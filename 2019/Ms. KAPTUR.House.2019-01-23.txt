 Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the  consolidated package of six appropriations bills and reopen the federal  government.   This unprecedented shutdown has ground our country to a halt.   Every day this shutdown continues, families in my district suffer a  cruel fate. From missed paychecks, uncertainty in food benefits, to  delays in critical efforts that protect the health and safety of our  country.   The shutdown impacts Universities conducting critical research, in my  region, at the University of Toledo. Twenty-five percent of the  University of Toledo's research awards are from agencies affected by  the shutdown. Anticipated grants are now delayed.   This week, nine of UT's researchers on aerospace projects for NASA  Glenn Research Center in Cleveland will be placed on leave without pay.   Aquatic ecologists fighting invasive Asian carp in the Great Lakes  have been put on hold.   The health of the Great Lakes is in danger. This is not the time to  risk the vitality of our region on partisan bickering. I would like to  include in the Record the following article about the impacts of the  shutdown on EPA inspectors unable to protect our water.   I call on all my colleagues to support this effort and reopen  government.                  [From the New York Times, Jan. 9, 2019]        Shutdown Means E.P.A. Pollution Inspectors Aren't on the Job                            (By Coral Davenport)         Washington.--The two-week-old shutdown has halted one of       the federal government's most important public health       activities, the inspections of chemical factories, power       plants, oil refineries, water treatment plants, and thousands       of other industrial sites for pollution violations.        The Environmental Protection Agency has furloughed most of       its roughly 600 pollution inspectors and other workers who       monitor compliance with environmental laws. Those scientists,       engineers and analysts are responsible for detecting       violations that endanger human health, as they did, for       example during an August 2018 airborne inspection that found       that oil and gas fields in Karnes County, Tex., were leaking       illegal levels of chemicals into the atmosphere, in violation       of the Clean Air Act.        While the inspection personnel represent a relatively small       proportion of the E.P.A.'s total of about 15,000 workers,       their absence increases the chances that, either by design or       by accident, companies might emit illegal levels of       contaminants into the air or water without detection, for       weeks on end, according to people familiar with the E.P.A.       inspections.        ``There are plants that discharge wastewater into streams       and rivers, places that store hazardous chemicals in       containers that could leak--we show up and test these places       to see if they're meeting pollution laws,'' said Garth       Connor, a furloughed E.P.A. inspector based in Philadelphia       who has been off the job since Monday. ``Now there's nobody       out there to check if they're complying.''        Mr. Connor inspects for air and water pollution and       hazardous waste disposal at sites throughout the Mid-      Atlantic.        The inspectors ``are the cops on the beat,'' Cynthia Giles,       who headed the E.P.A. enforcement division during the Obama       administration, wrote in an email.        She noted that, in 2017, E.P.A. workers performed about       11,700 such inspections, averaging to about 225 inspections       per week, according to the agency's records. The numbers       suggest that hundreds of such inspections may have already       been canceled this year, with the potential for hundreds more       to not take place should the shutdown continue for days or       weeks more. ``Those weeks can never be made up,'' Ms. Giles       wrote. ``In addition to the violations not found and the       inspections not done, there is also the impact of no       inspectors in the field doing unannounced inspections,'' she       added, asking: ``Will that result in more violations because       companies know E.P.A. isn't watching?''        Andrew Wheeler, the acting administrator of the E.P.A., did       not respond to an email requesting comment. On Wednesday,       President Trump formally nominated Mr. Wheeler, who was       confirmed last year as the deputy chief of the agency, to       formally take over as the agency head. When on the job,       E.P.A. inspectors regularly cite companies for violations       that endanger human health. For example, during an April 2016       inspection at a Firestone rubber plant in Sulphur, La.,       E.P.A. inspectors discovered that the plant was emitting       illegal levels of butadiene, a carcinogen, into the       community.        A telephone message left at the plant was not returned.        Some E.P.A. inspections are unannounced. Others take the       form of two- and three-week on-site visits.        Still other examinations don't happen on-site: E.P.A.       experts sitting in labs or at computers will review documents       detailing a plant's own reported emissions of pollution or       wastewater, checking whether legal limits were met or       violated. These activities, too, are on pause during the       shutdown.        Inspectors need to read those reports ``and say, `no, you       can't do that,' '' said Eric Schaeffer, who worked at the       E.P.A. on enforcement from 1990 to 2002 and now runs the       Environmental Integrity Project, an advocacy group. ``Then       they follow up and go on-site. But none of that is       happening.''        Unlike other federal agencies affected by the government       shutdown, the E.P.A. continued to operate through the week of       Dec. 24, but pollution inspections, along with most of the       rest of the work of the agency, had ceased by New Year's Eve.        Mr. Schaeffer recalled the effect on pollution enforcement       of the longest government shutdown in history, which ran from       Dec. 16, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996.        ``That was one of the worst years ever at the E.P.A. in       terms of numbers of inspections and enforcement,'' he said.       He added that the damage to the work of pollution inspections       didn't end completely once the government reopened.       ``Everything was ground to a halt, bogged down. You can't       just restart at 100 miles per hour. You have to reschedule       everything.'' Another former E.P.A. official who now lobbies       on behalf of industry offered a different view, saying that a       shutdown of even a few weeks was unlikely to make much       difference in the amount of illegal pollution emitted or       detected.        ``What you have is a delay,'' said the former official,       Jeffrey Holmstead, who served in the E.P.A. during both Bush       administrations and now works for some of the largest coal       companies and electric utilities in the country. ``I don't       think it's true that all of a sudden, because E.P.A.'s       inspectors are not there, that most people will take       advantage of that,'' he said. ``There may be a few folks who       believe they can get away with more, but I don't think that's       the biggest issue.''        Among Mr. Holmstead's clients are several companies that       have been cited for violations by the E.P.A., including the       electric utility Southern Company, which has had 52 sites       with violations over the past five years, including 23 sites       with current violations, according to E.P.A.'s enforcement       database. An email sent to a Southern Company spokesman       requesting comment on the violations was not answered.        Another of Mr. Holmstead's clients, the electric utility,       Ameren, owns 23 sites that have been cited for pollution       violations over the past five years. A telephone message left       with an Ameren spokeswoman was not returned.        In many years, about 10 to 20 percent of the E.P.A.'s       pollution inspections turn up significant violations,       according to the agency's data.        Most operators ``really are doing a good job,'' said Adam       Kushner, a former top legal official at the E.P.A. ``But       there's a 1 percent that are bad actors, who will continue to       do what they're going to do, unless inspectors find them. And       then there are sites where the operator just may not have       identified the problem, and they're putting bad stuff out       into the air without knowing it.''        Angela McFadden, a furloughed E.P.A. environmental engineer       who oversees state permits for pollution discharge and has       worked as an on-site inspector dealing with clean water       violations, said she ``always'' found violations during her       time as an inspector.        For example, she said, in inspecting municipal water       systems in rural areas she frequently found that cities and       towns over-chlorinated or under-chlorinated their water--not       a legal violation, but a potentially harmful situation that       is easily corrected when identified by an inspector.        Ms. McFadden recalled a more frightening inspection she       once performed in Pennsylvania that found excessive nitrate       levels in a municipal water supply. Nitrates can sap oxygen       from the blood and, when found in high levels in drinking       water, are linked to ``blue baby syndrome,'' in which infants       struggle to deliver enough oxygen to their bodies.        ``Right now, E.P.A. is not monitoring any of that,'' Ms.       McFadden said. ``Things are falling through the cracks.''
