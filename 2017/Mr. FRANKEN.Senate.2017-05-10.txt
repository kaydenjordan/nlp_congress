 Mr. President, I rise to address President Trump's  stunning dismissal of FBI Director Comey yesterday evening. We know the  Russians interfered in the 2016 election. We know the Russians did so  in order to undermine confidence in our democracy. We know the Russians  carried out this attack with the goal of benefiting the campaign of  Donald Trump, whom the Kremlin preferred to see win the election. These  facts have been confirmed by our intelligence agencies.   What we don't fully yet understand is all of the reasons why, all the  reasons why the Russians favored Donald Trump and whether associates of  the President or members of his campaign assisted in the Russian  operations to sway the election in his favor.   These questions are the subject of an ongoing counterintelligence  investigation, an investigation conducted by the Federal Bureau of  Investigation and, until last night, an investigation led by James  Comey.   As former Director Comey recently testified to the House Intelligence  Committee, ``[T]he FBI, as part of [its] counterintelligence mission,  is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the  2016 presidential election--and that includes investigating the nature  of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and  the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between  the campaign and Russia.''   The timing of Director Comey's dismissal raises serious questions,  and President Trump's decision to abruptly fire the man leading an  investigation that could implicate the Trump administration should  shock the conscience of every American who believes that no man or  woman is above the law and who has faith in the fair and impartial  pursuit of justice.   The White House attempted to preemptively dispel any suspicion by  announcing that President Trump fired the Director ``based on the clear  recommendations'' of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney  General Rod Rosenstein. The White House released several documents to  back up that claim: a letter from President Trump to Director Comey,  firing him; a letter from Attorney General Sessions to President Trump,  recommending that Comey be fired; and a memo written by Deputy Attorney  General Rosenstein, which cited the Director's handling of the Hillary  Clinton email investigation as damaging the FBI's reputation and  credibility. These documents create more questions than they answer.   First, the letter from President Trump to Director Comey firing him.  President Trump, ever eager to put distance between the Russian inquiry  and himself, wrote: ``While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on  three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I  nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that  you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.''   Again, we know the FBI is conducting a criminal investigation into  whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with the Russians in  their efforts to influence the election. Director Comey confirmed that  before he was fired. Whether President Trump is personally under  investigation by the Bureau or whether investigators are merely  scrutinizing his advisers and associates, the President's clumsy  attempt at misdirection does little more than remind us of the many  unanswered questions about his and his people's connections to Russia.   Second, Attorney General Sessions' letter to President Trump. The  Attorney General writes that based on his review of Deputy Attorney  General Rosenstein's memo, which cites the Director's handling of the  Clinton email investigation, that Attorney General Sessions has  concluded that the FBI requires new leadership and a fresh start.  Attorney General Sessions recommended that Director Comey be fired.   Attorney General Sessions should not have had any involvement in this  decision at all. On March 2, the Attorney General called a press  conference to announce: ``I have now decided to recuse myself from any  existing or future investigations of any matter relating in any way to  the campaigns for president of the United States.''   The reason Attorney General Sessions made that announcement was  because news reports revealed he had provided misleading testimony in  response to a question that I asked during his confirmation hearing;  that Attorney General Sessions had falsely stated: ``I did not have  communications with the Russians.'' In fact, he did meet with the  Russian Ambassador during the campaign twice.   Having provided misleading testimony under oath about a matter that  could potentially be the subject of a criminal investigation by the  FBI, Attorney General Sessions was forced to recuse himself.   I find it deeply troubling that Attorney General Jeff Sessions--who  misled the Judiciary Committee about his own communications with the  Russian Ambassador and who pledged to recuse himself from this  investigation as a result--betrayed that pledge by involving  [[Page S2866]]  himself in the decision to fire the Director of the FBI, who was  leading the investigation into Russia's interference in our elections,  including whether members of President Trump's campaign were involved  in that interference. Attorney General Sessions was a member of that  campaign, and he misled the committee on whether he had met with the  Russians, and he did that under oath. That is why he recused himself,  and yet he inserted himself in this firing.   Finally, there is Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein's memo, which  asserts that Director Comey's handling of the Clinton email  investigation caused the public to lose confidence in the Bureau.  Director Comey spoke publicly about the Clinton email investigation  twice, in July and October of last year.   Setting aside whether Director Comey's decision to discuss the  investigation was unorthodox or broke with Justice Department and FBI  protocols, his actions were well known to both President Trump and  Attorney General Sessions, and both of them celebrated his actions at  the time. After Director Comey wrote to Congress on October 28,  informing us that the FBI had discovered additional emails and would  therefore reopen its investigation into Secretary Clinton, then- Candidate Trump praised his decision. He said: ``What [Comey] did was  the right thing,'' and ``It took guts for Director Comey to make the  move that he made in light of the kind of opposition he had.''   Appearing on FOX Business Network, then-Senator Sessions said that  Director Comey ``had an absolute duty, in my opinion, 11 days [before  an election] or not, to come forward with the new information that he  has and let the American people know that, too.''   If President Trump or Attorney General Sessions truly objected to the  way that Director Comey conducted the investigation into Secretary  Clinton's emails, I suspect they would have said so at the time rather  than heap praise upon him. But their previous statements lauding  Director Comey's handling of the Clinton email probe cast suspicion on  the extent to which they relied on the Deputy Attorney General's  purported rationale.   Further, and this is important, if Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein  were truly concerned that Director Comey's handling of the Clinton  email investigation had damaged the reputation of the Bureau, then why  not wait for the conclusion of an investigation by the very respected  DOJ inspector general into Comey's decision during the election--his  decisions--an investigation that had been underway since January?   The shifting positions of President Trump and Attorney General  Sessions lead me to believe something else is going on here, that this  is not about Hillary Clinton's emails but about turning the page on  Russia. In fact, last night, a White House spokesman said so. Appearing  on FOX News, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders  was asked how Director Comey's firing would affect the Russia  investigation. She replied:         When are they going to let that go? It's been going on for       nearly a year. Frankly, it's getting kind of absurd. There's       nothing there. It's time to move on. Frankly, it's time to       focus on the things the American people care about.    The American people care about whether a hostile foreign government  influenced our election. They care about whether advisers and  associates of the President helped that foreign government do that.   The events that have occurred over the past 24 hours are deeply,  deeply unsettling. As my Republican colleague Senator Flake said last  night:         I've spent the last several hours trying to find an       acceptable rationale for the timing of Comey's firing. I just       can't do it.    And I can't either. In my view, the timing and the circumstances  surrounding Director Comey's dismissal are very suspicious. For  example, just this morning, it was reported that Director Comey  recently asked the Justice Department to provide additional resources  for the Russian investigation--a request that purportedly he made  personally to Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein. This raises grave  concerns about the Trump Justice Department's ability to conduct a  full, fair, and impartial investigation. In order to address these  concerns, Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General  Rosenstein should come to the Senate and explain their involvement to  all of the Senators in this body.   In the wake of what I believe was a politically motivated decision to  remove Director Comey, I no longer have confidence that the Department  of Justice can fulfill its obligation to resolve this matter  impartially. The situation now calls very clearly for the appointment  of a special prosecutor to oversee the investigation into whether  associates of the Trump organization or former members of the Trump  campaign had knowledge of or participated in the Russian attack on our  democracy.   I join my colleagues' calls for an independent inquiry so the  American people can have confidence that the individuals who conduct  this investigation will follow the facts no matter where they lead.   Thank you, Mr. President.
