 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano for his dedication  and leadership to move these import veterans provisions through  Congress.   Included in this package is my bill, the Veterans-Specific Education  for Tomorrow's Health Professionals Act. The VET HP Act will create a  1-year pilot program to allow pre-med students to gain clinical  observation experience at VA medical centers. I thank the chairman for  his leadership in helping include this.   This legislation will not only increase opportunities for students  from diverse backgrounds to gain the clinical observation time they  need for medical school, but it will also allow them the opportunity to  gain a deeper understanding of veterans' specific health needs and  experiences, which we just heard about, while connecting them with the  VA medical system.   In identifying and training future physicians interested in serving  veterans, this legislation will, hopefully, help fill some of the  estimated 30,000  [[Page H7209]]  medical vacancies at the Department of Veterans Affairs by creating a  viable pipeline of future physicians.   Mr. Speaker, one of our highest responsibilities as a Congress is to  ensure our veterans receive the timely, highest quality care they  deserve from trained professionals. I am pleased that this bill, the  VET HP Act, with the leadership of Chairman Takano and with my  sponsorship as well, will directly support these priorities.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2472, the Neil A.  Armstrong Test Facility Act.   Congresswoman Horn, you have been a trusted and valued colleague and  have ably served our Nation and your constituents. I want to express my  deep appreciation for your assistance on today's legislation and for  your friendship as you served so honorably in this Congress. In the  busy days before the end of the session, Ohio is truly grateful for  your assistance in getting this bill to the finish line. We can't thank  you enough.   Mr. Speaker, the Neil A. Armstrong Test Facility Act renames the NASA  Plum Brook Station after a true American hero, who happened to be a  Buckeye, an Ohioan.   Our State is known for aviation, for its flight milestones, for its  courageous heroes and inventors. The Plum Brook Station, located in  Sandusky, Ohio, is a true asset to American excellence in space  exploration. The facilities at the site are second to none. They  contain the Space Environments Complex, with the world's largest space  test chamber.    In its In-Space Propulsion building, it has a space chamber where you  can fire an upper stage rocket. There is also a world-class clean-air  hypersonic wind tunnel that even the Department of Defense didn't know  about, and a space chamber to test equipment to simulate planetary  surface conditions.   Imagine what someone like Neil Armstrong had to learn in order to be  successful in that history-making flight.   These capabilities enable our scientists to prepare for the rigors of  space exploration.   The Plum Brook Station and test facility is a national asset. Today,  it is being renamed after an American pioneer in human history. This  year, Plum Brook Station finished testing the Orion spacecraft that  will fly the Artemis I mission. This mission will eventually return a  person to the Moon.   Fifty-one years after Neil Armstrong captivated the world with his  famous words that united humankind and allowed us to dream for a common  purpose, the Nation turns our attention back to this test facility. How  humble it was when he said, ``One small step for man, one giant leap  for mankind.''   Mr. Speaker, I also want to express my deep appreciation to  Representative Anthony Gonzalez's partnership on this bill. I am  pleased to see him managing the Republican time today. I couldn't be  happier. He and his staff have been able to be collegial partners in  securing a floor vote, and I thank him for that. I also thank our  colleagues in the other body who have helped as well.   I, along with the people of Ohio, are also extremely grateful to  Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson; Ranking Member Lucas; our Senate  colleagues, Senators Brown and Portman, for their bicameral partnership  on today's legislation. This is the way Congress should work.   In these days of uncertainty for our society and planet, renaming the  [[Page H7224]]  NASA test facility at Sandusky, Ohio, for Neil Armstrong offers a  reminder to the world of our common purpose that can give us the giant  leaps that lie ahead for humankind. Indeed, America must continue  reaching for the stars and beyond.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 2472, the Neil A.  Armstrong Test Facility Act.
