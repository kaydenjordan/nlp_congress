 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the lives of Coach Guy  Thomas and Coach Mark McGarity, two beloved track and field coaches of  the Southwest Florida community who both passed away on July 13 of this  year.   Coach Guy Thomas tragically passed away after being hospitalized in  critical condition after contracting COVID-19. A track and field coach  at Dunbar High School, Mr. Thomas dedicated his life to training and  mentoring our young athletes on the field. A highly respected coach,  Mr. Thomas led his team to numerous Lee County Athletic Conference wins  and coached multiple State champions.   Retired Coach Mark McGarity also lost his life to a battle with  cancer. Mr. McGarity served the Collier County community as a coach and  teacher for 38 years, and for 15 years served as the cross country and  track coach at Lely High School.   I am proud that the State of Florida has access to such esteemed and  beloved educators that allow our youth to flourish, both in the  classroom and on the field.   As the Representative for Florida's 19th Congressional District, it  is my honor to stand here today celebrating the lives of two Americans  who dedicated themselves to bettering our youth and serving as role  models to the Southwest Florida community.                            ____________________
