 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Oklahoma for yielding.   Certainly, my colleague from Massachusetts knows my deep affection  for him, but since I walked on the House floor tonight, I keep hearing  this reference to this rules package, that somehow it is not posted on  our website and that we are debating something else called an addendum  to the rules package.   I wanted to come to the House floor as someone who worked quite  passionately last week on behalf of our new Speaker, working on an  agreement with all of my colleagues so that we are unified in the House  Republican Conference, to say that there is no addendum to this  package, Mr. Speaker.   There is no 3-page addendum. There is no extra stuff. Everything in  the House rules package is posted on the House website.   We made one addition as a Conference, and that was the change in the  vacate the chair motion.   Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear in the Congressional Record, for  those watching on C-SPAN, and to my colleagues: There is not a 3-page  addendum to the rules package.   I greatly respect my good friend from Massachusetts and my friend  from Oklahoma.
