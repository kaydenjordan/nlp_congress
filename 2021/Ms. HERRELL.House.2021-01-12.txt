 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the misuse of the  25th Amendment.   To preserve separation of powers, the authors of the 25th Amendment  correctly intended section 4 to be initiated by the Vice President, not  by the request of Congress.   Process concerns aside, the fact is, removing the President from  office will not heal our Nation. It will not bridge our partisan  divides, give Americans hope, or bring us together. It will only make  things worse.   With just days away until President Trump leaves the White House and  just days into our new Congress, we have more important things to do.  We should be working to hold Big Tech accountable. We should be working  to help families and small businesses get through the pandemic. We  should be working on jobs, on infrastructure, on energy, and all the  other issues our constituents sent us here to address.   I am appalled by the violence that took place here last week. Those  who assaulted police officers and forced their way into these hallowed  halls are responsible for their criminal acts and must be brought to  justice.   I cannot support the 25th Amendment, but I am also tired of the  double standard, the double talk, and the double trouble that we have  brought upon the American people. We have to stand for our  Constitution. This is our Nehemiah moment, and we better take  advantage.
