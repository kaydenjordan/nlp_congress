 Madam Speaker, I appreciate my good friend from Florida  for yielding. I also thank the chairman of the committee for bringing  this bill before us today on the floor.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1002, the Debarment  Enforcement of Bad Actor Registrants Act of 2021, or the DEBAR Act.   In the 116th Congress, we worked vigorously to tackle the coronavirus  and address the needs of those who were suffering. One of the hardest  issues facing Americans during this time was substance abuse, which, on  average, takes nearly 130 lives each day in our Nation.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that more  than 88,000 drug overdoses occurred in a 1-year period ending in August  of 2020, making it the deadliest year for U.S. overdoses.   In Ohio alone, opioid overdoses reached record levels, rising 16  percent in the second quarter of 2020. Prior to the pandemic, these  rates were, thankfully, declining over a 24-month period.   We need to act immediately to put an end to this crisis. The DEBAR  Act provides the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, debarment  authority to permanently prohibit a person or entity that has violated  the Controlled Substances Act from being able to receive a registration  to manufacture, distribute or dispense a controlled substance.   This legislation would also close loopholes and reduce the  circulation of illegal substances across our Nation and keep bad actors  from reapplying for new licenses once revoked. There is no silver  bullet when it comes to fighting the opioid epidemic; however, the  DEBAR Act will help address what is needed to combat this crisis, save  lives, and stop bad actors from contributing to addiction.   Again, I thank the chairman, my friend from New Jersey, for bringing  the bill to the floor. I also thank our ranking member from Washington  for her help on this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.
