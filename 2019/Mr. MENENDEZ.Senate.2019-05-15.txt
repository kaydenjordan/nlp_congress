 Mr. President, I came to the floor to speak about  rising tensions and potential challenges with Iran, but after my  distinguished colleague's remarks and as a Member of the Senate Finance  Committee who helped write the Affordable Care Act, I wouldn't want to  have my silence be an acceptance of his views.   For nearly a decade Republicans have sought to tear down the  Affordable Care Act, which some derisively call ObamaCare, with no  substitute, with no plan. This administration is actually in a Federal  court, arguing that the law is unconstitutional--the very law that  gives protections to everyone in this country who has a preexisting  condition, such as a child born at birth with some heart disease, a  husband who had a heart attack, a woman simply because she is a woman  and before was discriminated against because she was a woman. Somehow  that was a preexisting condition and allowed insurance companies to  charge twice as much as their male counterparts in the same age group  and same geography. It was the Affordable Care Act that ended that  discrimination and created the protections.   It was the Affordable Care Act that ended lifetime caps so that if  you had a major illness such as cancer, before you hit the ceiling on  your insurance and you were one illness away from bankruptcy--the  Affordable Care Act ended lifetime caps so that if you had a serious  illness you were still covered.   The Affordable Care Act created the possibility for our children to  be able to stay on our insurance until the age of 26. That was not the  law before.   The list goes on and on. So it is that which Democrats have been  about and, expanding upon that, the opportunity to create a universal  system for everyone--something we all desire.                                     Iran    Mr. President, as important as that issue is, I have come to the  floor in alarm to demand answers by this administration about Iran,  about its policy, about what intelligence the administration has. For  more than a week we have seen press reports and heard rumors about the  ``threats'' to U.S. interests and possibly American citizens by Iran.   For more than a week I have been demanding, along with others, that  the administration provide senior level officials to brief Members of  the U.S. Senate.   For more than a week, the administration has ignored these requests.  For all intents and purposes, it has refused to provide Members of  Congress with information critical to our national security-- information it says indicates that American citizens and American  assets may be in harm's way.   After specifically requesting information on security posture at our  diplomatic facilities in Iraq on Monday, this morning, I read from  press reports that the administration is ordering the departure of  staff from our Embassy in Baghdad and our consulate in Erbil. As the  ranking member--the senior Democrat--of the Senate Foreign Relations  Committee, it is outrageous to be learning about the evacuation of an  Embassy from media reports. There are only two reasons to make such an  order: We have credible intelligence that our people are at risk, or  there is some type of preparation for military action against Iran.   This behavior is unacceptable. By refusing to provide Members of  Congress with critical information, this administration is blatantly  disregarding the fundamental governing structures of the United States  as outlined in our Constitution.   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is charged with writing the  laws that authorize the use of military force and of oversight of the  State Department and the safety of those who work there. The  administration must provide this committee with the information we need  to judiciously and appropriately make policies.   While I hear there is a briefing for all Senators rumored for next  week, that is not confirmed, nor is it an acceptable timeline. Next  week may be too late. We do not need another Iraq weapons of mass  destruction moment that led us to one of the worst, most disastrous  military engagements when there were no weapons of mass destruction to  be found. We need clarity. We need answers, and we need them now. We  cannot make foreign policy and national security decisions while flying  in the blind.   Make no mistake--I have no doubts that Iran continues to be a bad  actor in the region and throughout the world. Iranian leaders continue  to support dangerous proxy actors throughout the region. Iran continues  to violate arms embargoes. Iran continues to oppress its own people.  Indeed, I have spent the better part of two decades developing  legislation and policies to stop Iran's quest for a nuclear weapon and  attacks against our allies, including Israel.   Working across the aisle, often cajoling and prodding the executive  branch and our allies, Congress led the effort to build an extensive  economic and political pressure campaign to force Iran to the  negotiating table. Our allies in Europe, Asia, and across the world,  most of whom share our concern about Iran's ability to develop a  nuclear weapon and its broader maligned activities, have been critical  to this effort.   When building a policy to effectively confront an adversary, you must  have an end goal, you must have clear objectives, and you must take  actions in pursuit of those objectives. With Iran, our objective was to  ensure that Iran never develops a pathway toward a nuclear weapon. So I  am all for putting on as much pressure as we can, but that requires  also having a clear way of showing how it can be alleviated. There must  be a viable, tenable, diplomatic track. If I were to put you in a room,  lock the door, throw away the key, and tell you there is no way out and  no way to survive, you would sure as hell start looking for ways to  fight and break down that door.   For a campaign of maximum pressure, when the moment of maximum  leverage is reached, it must be seized. That requires working with our  allies to offer a real, diplomatic path to negotiations.   British Major General Chris Ghika, the deputy commander of the  American-led coalition to fight the Islamic State, has called into  question some of the credibility of the intelligence our officials say  we have regarding Iranian-backed forces in Iraq.   Yesterday, Spain pulled a frigate from a U.S.-led naval group that  had been scheduled for a joint training mission 2 years ago, saying the  original mission had changed.   Our allies are critical not just in confronting Iranian malign  activity but in securing our interests across the world.   Let me conclude with two points.  [[Page S2865]]    Now is the moment to invest in a diplomatic surge to meaningfully  engage our allies and Iran in serious negotiations to end its pathway  toward nuclear weapons and its malign activities.   Second, Congress has not authorized war with Iran. The  administration, if it is contemplating military action with Iran, must  come to Congress to seek approval.   I call on every Member of this body on both sides of the aisle to  assert our institutional and constitutional prerogatives and demand  information from this administration, demand classified briefings. When  matters this serious are at stake, we have to demand more. We cannot  and we will not be led into dangerous military adventures. The  administration must provide this critical information to Congress, and  it must do so immediately.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to bring attention to the  Assad regime and its Russian and Iranian backers' latest assault on  innocent civilians under a rain of airstrikes and barrel bombs, which  has sparked the worst violence in a year and a half in the Idlib and  Hama provinces. The regime and its enablers would yet again have us  believe that they are striking ``terrorists.'' However, facts simply  bely that worn-out ruse; their airstrikes have hit 18 hospitals in the  past 2 weeks alone, denying lifesaving facilities to more than 100,000  people and destroying at least 10 schools, according to NGOs monitoring  the situation. Relief workers on the ground assess that Assad's forces  are responsible for scores of civilian deaths over the past 2 weeks, as  well as displacing 150,000 desperate and terrified people.   Assad's barrel bombs and starvation campaign, along with violence  from terrorist organizations, has already sent 5 million Syrians  fleeing to neighboring Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq. Despite  already fragile economic and political systems, these countries have  shown an extraordinary openness in hosting those fleeing. It is  absolutely critical that those refugees be allowed to return in a  manner that is safe, voluntary, and dignified and that they not be  forced to return to situations in Syria where they face conscription,  retaliation, detention, torture, or murder at the hands of the Assad  regime.   In the face of such wanton cruelty and profound suffering, the United  States can and must show renewed leadership in Syria, but instead,  President Trump froze and then terminated stabilization assistance in  Syria. The Trump administration must restart stabilization funding in  Syria. Furthermore, Congress can show leadership by passing the Caesar  Syria Civilian Protection Act, which would impose new sanctions on the  Assad regime and its Russian and Iranian supporters.                            ____________________
