 Madam Speaker, let me rise in support of and with  rebuttal to my good friend, my other good friend from Pennsylvania.   It is well-known that the appropriations process is an investment in  America, and so I rise to support the appropriations that will be  presented to us in this rule T-HUD, Agriculture, Energy and Water,  Financial Services, Interior, Military Construction, and Veterans.   I ask the question: Is anyone going to suggest that our military  personnel do not need better housing, better schools, better  facilities, and bases, both in the United States and across the world?   And so, investment in the American people I will never run away from,  and I hope the Senate does not, as well.   And on the question of inflation, I want to remind my good friend  from Pennsylvania, my other good friend, that the prices of gas at the  pump are going down, because inflation is not pertaining to one  administration; it is continuing. And the past administration dug the  hole of the inflation that we are now in today.   I also want to make sure that every aspect of reproductive freedom is  protected, and the contraceptive legislation should be strongly  supported because people are running for their lives. Women are running  for their lives because they do not have the lack of fear that they  could be arrested; that they could be stopped; or a doctor could say: I  am sorry, I cannot help you in your desperate time of need.   This rule is very important, and I support the underlying bills.   And finally, let me--as I was here, as we debated this concept of  whether or not you are free in your private rights to make a decision  of who you love, I support H.R. 8404 the rule provides for this because  it says the ``full faith and credit given to marriage equality.''   I want the LGBTQ community in Houston to hear me, the caucus to hear  me, we are hearing your voices as well. And I want you to know that  this bill includes, for the purpose of Federal law, rule, or regulation  in which marital status is a factor, an individual shall be considered  married if that individual's marriage is valid in the State where the  marriage was entered into or, in the case of a marriage entered into  outside any State, if the marriage is valid in the place where entered  into and the marriage could have been entered into, it is safe.     I believe this law is key to rejecting the  interpretation of Justice Clarence Thomas, who indicated, or  speculated, that other provisions or rights under privacy may be in  jeopardy.   We should not jeopardize someone's right to love who they want to  love, interracial marriages, marriages of any kind. And I support the  Respect for Marriage Act and the underlying rule. I thank the  gentlewoman for her graciousness.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsors of this  legislation and the leadership of our chairman, and, as well, the  millions of families that are, in fact, families.   My good friend from Ohio started out with the litany of violence, of  which none of us stands for, we abhor violence. We believe in the  freedom of speech and the right to petition. There are countless acts  of violence against those who are seeking reproductive freedom and  countless acts of violence against the LGBTQ community.   Listen to the violence against transgender parents just trying to  help their children, or the violence that started in the early days of  this community seeking their freedom and their rights. I know it well  from the LGBTQ+ community in Houston and  [[Page H6721]]  the Caucus and the leaders who started out in those early years. I know  that they suffered from just the simple position that they were  different.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Constitution of the United  States of America because that is what the Respect for Marriage Act  exemplifies. It exemplifies a recognition of the Constitution. As the  legislation says, the full credit and faith to marriage equality.   I believe that our friends have gotten it wrong. There is a  constitutional right to privacy. And morally there is a right to love  who you love and to establish a family as you desire.   It is horrific to believe that with the elimination of the precedent  of 50 years of Roe v. Wade, one Justice decided to say, wait, there may  be more. There may be an ending to marriage equality. There may be an  ending to any number of constitutional rights.   Well, I am here today to say, I support enthusiastically H.R. 8404,  the Respect for Marriage Act, codifying the constitutional right to  privacy and the constitutional right to marriage.   Mr. Speaker, over and over again, I would ask my colleagues to vote  for this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in strong support of H.R. 8404, the  ``Respect for Marriage Act.''   This Act would enshrine in federal law marriage equality for same sex  and interracial couples.   It would also repeal the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act  (DOMA) of 1996 that problematically defined marriage as between one man  and one woman.   The Supreme Court's backwards ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's  Health Organization that was used to justify overturning the right to  abortion could be weaponized in the future to strip away other  fundamental rights, including the right to marriage equality.   In his concurring opinion in Dobbs, Justice Clarence Thomas  explicitly called on the Supreme Court to reconsider its decisions  protecting other fundamental rights, including the right to same-sex  marriage recognized in Obergefell v. Hodges.   Although Justice Thomas conveniently chose not to mention the right  to interracial marriage--a right he currently enjoys--that right relies  on the same constitutional doctrines as the right to same-sex marriage,  and, therefore, could also be on the chopping block.   The night before the Dobbs ruling, LGBTQI+ couples and people in  interracial relationships went to sleep confident in the legality of  their marriages.   They had no reason to believe that the next morning five individuals  would pass a ruling that would strip women of their right to abortion  and threaten the legality of their marriage unions.   On June 24th, amidst the horror of the Court's ruling against  abortion rights, innocent LGBTQI+, Black, and Brown people had to also  grapple with the possibility that the legality of their marriages might  be violently stripped away.   We cannot and will not allow Republican lawmakers and Conservative  Justices to toy with the rights of the American people.   That is why I strongly support the Respect for Marriage Act.   This act would ensure that an individual be considered married as  long as the marriage was valid in the state where it was performed.   This ensures that same-sex and interracial couples would continue to  enjoy equal treatment under federal law--as the Constitution requires.   This bill would go further by officially repealing the Defense of  Marriage Act.   While the Supreme Court effectively rendered DOMA inert with its  decision in Obergefell, this unconstitutional and discriminatory law,  however, still officially remains on the books.   Therefore, H.R. 8404 would repeal DOMA once and for all.   The Respect for Marriage Act would also prohibit any person acting  under color of state law from denying full faith and credit to an out- of-state marriage based on the sex, race, ethnicity or national origin  of the individuals in the marriage.   It would also authorize the U.S. Attorney General to enforce these  protections and would create recourses of action for any individual  harmed by a violation of this provision.   If conservative lawmakers and Justices want to wage war against human  and civil rights, we are ready to meet them toe for toe.   We will not back down for marriage equality.   We will not back down for racial justice.   We will ensure equal rights for all American people.   I strongly put my full support behind H.R. 8404, the Respect for  Marriage Act, and encourage my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership, and the ranking member, as well.   Let me say that America is going to get not a payday but an  investment.   Unlike how my colleagues like to characterize the hard work of the  appropriators and our chairwoman, this is about good-paying jobs, $90  billion in transportation.   This is about tackling hunger and agriculture, some $27 million.   This is about helping Houston with its horrible and yearly  confrontation with flooding.   Yes, this is about the issues of Energy. As well, with Financial  Services, this is about helping our consumers. Of course, in Interior,  I want to say that this is about helping the work that I am doing on  the Emancipation Trail.   I am delighted that I also rise to support all the en blocs. I have  amendments in all of them. Particularly, I want to emphasize the work  that is being done through my amendments on oversight over the General  Land Office that has tackled Houston, Harris County, and the region  after Hurricane Harvey like they are at odds. Our Federal money, $4  billion, was supposed to go to Harris County and Houston. Houston  ultimately got zero amount at a certain stage, and they only gave  Harris County $800,000 when we are suffering with loss of housing and  with major flooding.   My amendment will talk about major oversight over the GLO and their  treatment of local jurisdictions. This plays across America when States  get money, and they don't believe that it should go to the local  communities.   Let me also indicate I am glad that my human trafficking victims bill  is in. That provides for SNAP resources and to clarify that if you are  educating a human trafficking victim that is not documented, you can  clarify for them without looking like you are recruiting or selling  SNAP to let them know that they are eligible for it, which is extremely  important.   Also, I-45, the President of the United States issued an equity  policy that whenever you do major infrastructure projects, you should  look at how it impacts historic neighborhoods and how it impacts the  minority neighborhoods and urban neighborhoods. I-45, a major Federal  project, has not even perceived that to be important. My amendment  indicates that that should be the case.     Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for her  graciousness.   That is an ongoing issue that we have in our community, where the  communities are not taken into consideration when the houses are  leveled and when the flooding is increased by an infrastructure project  that we now have a title VI proceeding under that is funded by Federal  dollars.   Let me also express my appreciation for amendments dealing with the  Federal Railroad Administration. Everyone that knows it has trains. We  know that it provides part of the supply chain. But in our communities,  there are the crossings, there are the sounds, and there are the horns.  All we want to do is work harmoniously in the oversight over the  Federal Railroad Administration to deal with safety and operations in  our communities. That is particularly important.   I also want to express appreciation for the work my amendments will  do and that they have been accepted dealing with the issue of historic  preservation, which will include places like Freedmen's Town,  Independence Heights, and, of course, the historic Third Ward where  Emancipation Park is.   Again, the underlying bill is a bill that will invest in America. I  support this legislation and the good work of the Appropriations  Committee.   Mr. Chair, I ask everyone to support that and the amendments included  in the en bloc.   Mr. Chair, I rise to speak in a strong support of H.R. 8294, the  Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, Agriculture, Rural  Development, Energy and Water Development, Financial Services and  General Government, Interior, Environment, Military Construction, and  Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act.   H.R. 8294 makes key investments in rebuilding our nation's  infrastructure, expanding research innovation, combating climate  change, and honoring the sacrifice and commitment of our nation's  veterans.   The diligent work that produced this comprehensive legislation will  make a very positive impact on so many sectors and activities  throughout American society.   Mr. Chair, I also want to voice my strong support for En Bloc  Amendments No. 2, 3, 6, and 7, which incorporates Jackson Lee  Amendments.   I thank the Rules Committee and Chairman McGovern for making these  amendments in order and the Appropriations Committee and Chairwoman  DeLauro for including it in this En Bloc Amendment.   The Jackson Lee amendments are in the following Divisions of the  bill:   Division A--Transportation, Housing and Urban Development   Division B--Agriculture   Division E--Interior and the Environment                                  en bloc #2    Jackson Lee Amendment #46 supports the work of the National Institute  of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) by making a $2,000,000 increase in  funding to that office for the purpose of supporting agriculture  research programs particularly at 1890s Institutions, which are land  grant colleges at 28 Historically Black Colleges and Universities  (HBCUs), as well as Hispanic-serving institutions, and other  educational institutions that benefit underrepresented communities.   This amendment promotes NIFA's work with agricultural experiment  stations, cooperative forestry, and other innovations to improve our  nation's food production through agricultural  [[Page H6853]]  research, economic analysis, extension, and higher education.   The NIFA was created at the time of the industrial revolution to  ensure that the nation would have a sufficient number of working farms  to provide a reliable supply of domestically produced food.   One of ways NIFA achieves its mission is by providing research grants  to education institutions, which include 1890s institutions created by  the Morrill Act of 1890.   Today, land-grant colleges and universities can be found in 18  states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The list  includes:   Alabama A&M University   Alcorn State University   Delaware State University   Florida A&M University   Fort Valley State University   Kentucky State University   Langston University   Lincoln University   North Carolina A&T State University   Prairie View A&M University in Texas   South Carolina State University   Southern University System   Tennessee State University   Tuskegee University   University of Arkansas Pine Bluff   University of Maryland Eastern Shore   University of the District of Columbia*   University of the Virgin Islands   Virginia State University   West Virginia State University   HBCUs annually enroll 40% of all African American students in 4-year  colleges and universities. HBCUs are prominent among research  institutions in fields such as:   animal sciences   sustainable agriculture and agriculture economics   toxicology and waste management   conservation and environmental management   business and industrial development   biomedical science   In particular, Jackson Lee Amendment #68 is necessary to make clear  that providing victims of trafficking access to information about their  eligibility to receive SNAP benefits does not constitute the type of  SNAP recruitment activities or ``advertising'' of the SNAP program  prohibited by the bill and by Section 4018 of the Agriculture Act of  2014 (Public Law No: 113-079).   Trafficking in humans, and especially domestic child trafficking, has  no place in a civilized society. Those who engage in this illicit trade  should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. This House made  that clear again in 2021 when it passed H.R. 3530, the Justice for  Victims of Trafficking Act, which contained my Sense of the Congress  amendment added during the Judiciary Committee markup.   That means we need to ensure that state and local law enforcement  agencies have the tools, resources, and training necessary to identify,  apprehend, and prosecute criminals who ruthless traffic in children and  young persons.   And one of the most effective resources in bringing criminals to  justice is the cooperation and assistance of their victims.   Perpetrators of crime know that they are more likely to evade  detection and punishment when their victims refuse to assist or  cooperate with law enforcement. That is why they make it a point to  instill fear in their victims--for their own safety or that of family  and loved ones.                                  en bloc #3    Jackson Lee Amendment #19 increases and decreases HUD's Office of  Inspector General account by $1,000,000 with the intent to support the  OIG's oversight of the Texas General Land Office to track the  accounting of Emergency Supplemental Disaster Appropriations for  Hurricane Harvey Mitigation and Recovery that Congress approved for the  2017 disaster.   food and nutrition   plant and social sciences   international development   Agricultural research programs at HCBUs assist people living in  densely populated areas to learn ways to eliminate food deserts,  increase public education about farming, bolster appreciation for our  nation's farmers, and provide new avenues to careers for those  graduating with degrees in agriculture who seek to enter cutting-edge  agricultural research.   This amendment promotes NIFA's work with agricultural experiment  stations, cooperative forestry, and other innovations to improve our  nation's food production through agricultural research, economic  analysis, extension, and higher education.   The funds provided by the Jackson Lee amendment would support  research and education for helping urban and suburban communities  maximize their green space by turning it into productive farming  resources to support access to affordable foods.   Jackson Lee Amendment #47 provides a straightforward, important  contribution to the bill for a goal shared by every Member of this  body: ending the scourge of human trafficking. This amendment provides  that:   None of the funds made available by this Act for ``DOMESTIC FOOD  PROGRAMS--Food & Nutrition Service--Supplemental Nutrition Assistance  Program'' may be used in contravention of section 107(b) of Division A  of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (22  U.S.C. 7105(b)).   The effect of this amendment will be to make clear that nothing in  this bill restricts the authority of the Secretary of Agriculture or  any federal agency head from providing assistance and benefits to  victims of trafficking under current law as authorized by 22 U.S.C.  Sec. 7105(b) of the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act  of 2000 (114 Stat. 1464, Pub. Law 106-386).   Jackson Lee Amendment #20 provides an increase of $1,000,000 in  assistance to address challenges faced by historically disadvantaged  communities and areas impacted by persistent poverty not included in  decision making when major highway construction threatens their homes,  businesses, and culturally significant structures.   Jackson Lee Amendment #21 increases and decreases by $1,000,000 the  Community Development Fund and the Community Development Block Grant  program to address the fairness in the use of Community Development  Block Grant Disaster funding to repair or replace single family homes  damaged during Hurricane Harvey to ensure that multi-generational homes  can house families at documented pre-disaster capacity.   Jackson Lee Amendment #22 increases and decreases by $1,000,000 the  Federal Rail Administration Safety and Operation's account to emphasize  the need to provide dedicated funding to address community engagement  on safety issues related to railroad crossings in urban areas.   Jackson Lee Amendment #23 prohibits the Department of Transportation  from using funds for Section 106 Transportation construction projects  in urban areas that have not been determined to meet the statutory and  fiduciary obligations of the National Historic Preservation Act (54 USC  306108).                                  en bloc #6    Jackson Lee Amendment #57 increases and decreases funding for  Environmental Programs and Management by $5 million to highlight the  need to support culturally competent federal, state, and local public  health and environmental protection efforts to address cancer clusters  impacting overburdened communities in the gulf coast region.                                  en bloc #7    Jackson Lee Amendment #56 increases and decreases funds for the  Historic Preservation Fund by $3,000,000 with the intent of enhancing  activities for the preservation, restoration, and maintenance of  nationally significant sites, artifacts, and structures through  competitive grants at the local, state, and federal levels focusing on  projects involving HBCUs, sites and stories linked to the Civil Rights  movement, landmarks associated with communities that are historically  underrepresented, and sites related to the histories of Indigenous  peoples.   The Historic Preservation Fund is vital in working to preserve  nationally significant sites, structures, and artifacts. We want the  environment to be safe, but we want the historic environment to be  preserved for those who are a valuable part of the historical story of  America.   It is crucial to the Freedmen's Town community in Houston, but it is  also crucial to the Tulsa story in Oklahoma, the story of Chicago,  Savannah, New York, and many other States where we have systematically  ignored the historic preservation of our Nation. Who will tell our  children the story? I am fighting in Houston. Others are fighting  elsewhere. This amendment is to create the historical record, the  legislative record that we are committed to.   I urge all Members to vote in support of En Bloc #2, 3, 6, and 7, and  the Jackson Lee Amendments.
