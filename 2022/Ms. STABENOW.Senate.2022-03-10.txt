 Mr. President, reserving the right to object.    Mr. President, across America, our schools are open and  our children are back in the classroom, and that is great news for  everyone.   Unfortunately, providing our children healthy food has been a real  challenge for schools thanks to supply chain challenges that are  happening in many places and almost in every State.   This chart shows the supply chain disruptions across the country,  with the red being almost 100 percent of the schools having supply  chain challenges and disruptions.   Over 90 percent of the schools in the majority of the country are  having challenges just buying the food they need for the children. That  is why, during the pandemic, Congress made sure schools and meal  providers had flexibility to continue to feed hungry children.   Ninety percent of our schools, from rural Alaska to downtown  Louisville, are still relying on these flexibilities to keep their  children fed. Extending these bipartisan tools in the omnibus package  is essential to helping schools ease back into regular operations for  our children.   Nutrition operations at schools are working hard. They are working as  hard as they can to get back to normal, but it takes time, and the  waivers help. When basic staples like chicken and whole grains cost  double, waivers help schools in Caribou, MN, for instance, keep feeding  kids. When supply chain limits available food options like ground beef  or fruit, schools in Bismarck, ND, for instance, can use substitutions  to put together healthy lunches.   Hunger doesn't go away just because school is out. Thanks to these  waivers, communities from Michigan, to Kentucky, to Utah were able to  feed more children over the summer, particularly in rural communities.   If schools or meal providers are unable to serve meals because of  ongoing challenges, that hurts all of our children. Over 2,000 groups,  from the School Nutrition Association, to Feeding America, to local  school boards and superintendents and administrators, have all called  on Congress to do what is right and extend these waivers.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                  November 10, 2021.        Dear Chairwoman DeLauro, Ranking Member Granger, Chairman       Leahy, Vice Chairman Shelby, Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member       Harris, Chairwoman Baldwin, Ranking Member Hoeven: At the       start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress gave the U.S.       Department of Agriculture (USDA) the authority to issue       nationwide child nutrition waivers to address access and       operational challenges created by the pandemic, allowing       school nutrition programs, local government agencies, and       nonprofit organizations to adapt as necessary to changes such       as school closures and virtual learning. This authority was       established through the Families First Coronavirus Response       Act (Public Law 116-127), extended for Fiscal Year 2021       through the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other       Extensions Act (Public Law 116-159) and again extended to       June 30, 2022 through the Extending Government Funding and       Delivering Emergency Assistance Act (Public Law 117-43).       Without these waivers, the child nutrition programs would not       have been able to adequately respond to the fallout from       COVID-19. The meals provided through the child nutrition       programs have been critical to our nation's pandemic response       to childhood hunger.        Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over.       Families continue to need support, and school nutrition       departments and community sponsors still struggle to operate       under the unique circumstances created by  [[Page S1102]]       the pandemic. Contrary to where many people thought and hoped       we would be at this point in the pandemic, COVID-19 continues       to be a threat causing school closures and requiring students       to stay home in quarantine. It is unclear when schools and       community organizations will be able to fully return to       normal operations, particularly in light of future variants       of COVID-19 that may develop.        When the Public Health Emergency does finally end, it will       take time for nutrition operations to recover from the       challenges created during the pandemic: to rebuild their       programs and overcome the significant financial impact. USDA       will need waiver authority to support schools and program       operators through the summer and as the school year begins.        The authority to provide a nationwide waiver in response to       the pandemic, even if it increases program costs, has only       been extended to June 30, 2022 and waivers cannot be provided       beyond the 2021-2022 school year (which the statute defines       as ending each year on June 30). This arbitrary deadline       means that summer meal programs will not be able to operate       under the same program rules through the entire summer. It       also takes away USDA's ability to respond to the operational       and access challenges that are likely at the start of the new       school year in what will hopefully be the first year back to       normal school nutrition operations.        We, the undersigned organizations, ask Congress to further       extend USDA's nationwide waiver authority to September 30,       2022 to give USDA the flexibility needed to respond to the       pandemic as well as its aftermath, and to ensure that the       federal child nutrition programs continue to operate and       provide healthy snacks and meals to students.

Dear Chairwoman DeLauro, Ranking Member Granger, Chairman       Leahy, Vice Chairman Shelby: We are members of the Mayors       Alliance to End Childhood Hunger, a nonpartisan coalition       representing more than 65 mayors across the nation working in       partnership with Share Our Strength's No Kid Hungry Campaign       to ensure that every child has the healthy food they need to       thrive. We appreciate Congress' ongoing efforts to help the       millions of children who rely on federal child nutrition       programs as a daily source of nutrition. At the start of the       pandemic, Congress provided the U.S. Department of       Agriculture (USDA) with the authority to issue nationwide       child nutrition waivers to ensure that children would       continue to have access to healthy meals despite COVID-l9       related disruptions and safety precautions.        With the pandemic continuing, we urge Congress to extend       USDA's waiver authority through the 2022-2023 school year,       giving USDA the authority to provide community organizations       and school nutrition providers with the critical       flexibilities needed to respond to public health requirements       and supply chain disruptions. This is necessary to ensure       that the federal child nutrition programs continue to operate       and provide healthy meals and snacks for vulnerable children.        Our cities are on the frontline of responding to challenges       in our communities, and as mayors, we need every option       available to fight childhood hunger. Waivers for child       nutrition program requirements have allowed schools,       community partners, and other organizations in our cities to       operate with the flexibility to meet the growing need while       protecting the health and safety of kids during the pandemic.       However, these critical waivers are currently set to expire       at the end of the 2021-2022 school year, and the USDA does       not have the authority to issue or extend waivers beyond that       point unless Congress acts. The uncertainty about the       extension of USDA's waiver authority is a significant barrier       to schools and community organizations trying to make plans       to feed children this summer and next school year since the       requirements affect budgets, staffing, and vendors.       Furthermore, the expiration of USDA's waiver authority at the       end of the 2021-2022 school year further limits summer meal       programs by not operating under the same programs by not       operating under the same program rules across the entire       summer. With deadlines looming, especially for summer       operations, organizations must have the reassurance they need       that they will be able to safely run programs despite ongoing       challenges. This hits our communities particularly hard       because summer is the hungriest time for children. Summer       hunger should not be intensified because meal programs lack       the flexibility they need to reach kids.        The suite of child nutrition waivers has given community       organizations and school nutrition providers critical       flexibilities that have:        Supported families who needed to pick up multiple meals at       a time in one location as they returned to work or faced       transportation challenges.        Allowed for social distancing protocols through grab-and-go       meal distribution or delivery.        Ensured that children who need meals are getting nutritious       food as families continue to struggle economically through       the pandemic.        Helped school nutrition providers support a return to       ``normal'' in-person learning with the flexibility to       implement safety precautions and overcome supply chain and       labor disruptions.        Child nutrition programs play a critical role in helping       kids learn, stay healthy, and thrive.        Again, we urge Congress to act now by extending USDA's       waiver authority so that schools and community organizations       have ample time to ensure that no child struggles to find       their next meal.

Dear Chairwoman DeLauro, Ranking Member Granger, Chairman       Leahy, Vice Chairman Shelby, Chairman Bishop, Ranking Member       Harris, Chairwoman Baldwin, Ranking Member Hoeven: We, the       undersigned national, state, and local organizations, ask you       to further extend USDA's nationwide waiver authority through       School Year 2022-2023 in recognition of the ongoing pandemic,       the continuing school closures, and the need for flexibility       to meet the needs of students.        At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress gave the       U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) the authority to issue       nationwide child nutrition waivers to address access and       operational challenges created by the pandemic, allowing       school nutrition programs, local government agencies, and       nonprofit organizations to adapt as necessary to changes such       as school closures and virtual learning. This authority was       established through the Families First Coronavirus Response       Act (Public Law 116-127), extended for Fiscal Year 2021       through the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other       Extensions Act (Public Law 116-159) and again extended to       June 30, 2022 through the Extending Government Funding and       Delivering Emergency Assistance Act (Public Law 117-43).       Without these waivers, the child nutrition programs would not       have been able to adequately respond to the fallout from       COVID-19. Throughout the pandemic schools and community meal       sponsors have relied on these waivers to keep children fed       during short- and long-term closures, alleviate child hunger,       and advance racial equity and child well-being.        Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over.       Families continue to need support, particularly Black,       Hispanic, and Indigenous families who disproportionately lack       reliable access to healthy meals, and school nutrition       departments and community sponsors still struggle to operate       under the unique circumstances created by the pandemic.       Contrary to where many people thought and hoped we would be       at this point in the pandemic, COVID-19 continues to be a       threat causing frequent school closures and  [[Page S1103]]       requiring students to stay home in quarantine and miss meals.       Currently short and long-term school closures are occurring       constantly across the country. They are due not only to COVID       exposures and the need to quarantine but to staffing       shortages and teacher burnout. It is unclear when schools and       community organizations will be able to fully return to       normal operations, particularly in light of omicron and       future variants of COVID-19 that may develop.        The authority to provide a nationwide waiver in response to       the pandemic, even if it increases program costs, has only       been extended to June 30, 2022 and waivers cannot be provided       beyond the 2021-2022 school year (which the statute defines       as ending each year on June 30). This arbitrary deadline       means that summer meal programs will not be able to operate       Under the same program rules through the entire summer,       forcing many providers to stop serving 'meals or shut down       altogether and leaving millions of children without access to       healthy meals. The June 30th expiration also takes away       USDA's ability to respond to the supply chain, operational,       and access challenges that are likely despite what will       hopefully be the first year back to normal school operations.       Moreover, it denies schools and other sponsors the tools and       flexibilities they need to recover from the impacts of the       pandemic and resume normal operations.        We, the undersigned national, state and local       organizations, ask Congress to further extend USDA's       nationwide waiver authority through School Year 2022-2023 to       ensure USDA has continued flexibility to respond to the       ongoing and evolving impacts of the pandemic as well as its       aftermath, and to ensure that the federal child nutrition       programs continue to operate and provide healthy snacks and       meals to students.

Dear Senator Stabenow: On behalf of the Michigan       Association of Superintendents and Administrators, I am       writing to urge you to extend the U.S. Department of       Agriculture's nationwide waiver authority to September 30,       2022 to give USDA the flexibility needed to respond to the       pandemic and to ensure that the districts operating federal       child nutrition programs continue to operate and provide       healthy snacks and meals to the students.        At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress gave the       U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) the authority to issue       nationwide child nutrition waivers to address access and       operational challenges created by the pandemic, allowing       school nutrition programs and local government agencies to       adapt as necessary to changes such as school closures and       virtual learning. These waivers have been critical in       ensuring that child nutrition programs can adequately respond       to the fallout from COVID-19 and continue to provide meals to       children.        Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic is far from over.       Families continue to need support, and school nutrition       departments and community sponsors still struggle to operate       under the unique circumstances created by the pandemic. When       the Public Health Emergency does finally end, it will take       time for nutrition operations to recover from the challenges       created during the pandemic: to rebuild their programs and       overcome the significant financial impact. USDA will need       waiver authority to support schools and program operators       through the summer and as the school year begins.        The authority to provide a nationwide waiver in response to       the pandemic, even if it increases program costs, has only       been extended to June 30, 2022 and waivers cannot be provided       beyond the 2021-2022 school year (which the statute defines       as ending each year on June 30). This arbitrary deadline       means that summer meal programs will not be able to operate       under the same program rules through the entire summer. It       also takes away USDA's ability to respond to the operational       and access challenges that are likely at the start of the new       school year in what will hopefully be the first year back to       normal school nutrition operations.        Additionally, districts need stability and clarity as they       prepare for the 2022-2023 school year and should know whether       the waivers will be available.        Thank you very much for your attention to this matter,      Matt Schueller,        Director of Government Relations, Michigan Association of       Superintendents and Administrators.     We all want life to get back to normal. Right now, we  need our Republican colleagues to support the bipartisan tools that  will help get us there.   This amendment is a short extension. There is a clear end date when  schools will be back to normal operations, but in the meantime, these  waivers are key to helping schools stay open and operate in person for  our children.   Taking these waivers away would leave schools and summer meal  programs scrambling, and that hurts up to 30 million kids who eat  school meals--30 million kids. Smaller rural schools and their students  would undoubtedly be hurt the worst.   It is time for Congress to stand with our schools and with our  children. So would the Senator agree to modify his request to include a  vote in relation to Stabenow amendment No. 2994?
