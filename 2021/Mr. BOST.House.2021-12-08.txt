 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5545, as amended, the REMOTE  Act. I am pleased to support this bill, which is very similar to my  bill, H.R. 5509, the Student Veteran COVID-19 Protection Act of 2021.  This bill will help address urgent needs of student veterans who are  impacted by COVID-19.   At the beginning of the pandemic, Congress worked to ensure that  student veterans' GI bill housing allowance payments were not cut when  in-person classes were moved online.  [[Page H7470]]    The current authorization for this protection expires on December 21,  2021. H.R. 5545, as amended, would extend it through June 1 of 2021.  This would provide veterans and schools with the certainty that  students will not see a reduction in their monthly housing checks this  school year.    The bill also includes changes to ensure that GI bill students can  attend foreign schools and give American schools time to comply with  new consumer protection rules.   It includes a change to the VA's rounding-out policy to allow  students to retain their full monthly housing allowance, even if they  finish their program-required coursework early.   Finally, it also includes language sponsored by Congressman Lamb and  Congressman Mann to remove the cap on the equal employment opportunity  counselors at the VA. There is no place for discrimination at the VA. I  am pleased that we can, once again, pass this important provision to  help employees avail themselves of their right for a safe workplace.   The costs of this bill are fully paid for by extending current VA  home loan funding fees for a few months into 2030. This is a bipartisan  offset that has been used multiple times in previous Congresses.   This issue of whether to offset the estimated $220 million mandatory  costs associated with this bill has been an issue of disagreement for  many weeks, and I want to thank Chairman Takano for working with me and  finding a mutually beneficial solution that is paid for and can quickly  pass the Senate. This is win for the veterans, schools, and taxpayers  alike.                                time  1030    In the vast majority of circumstances, I strongly believe that  Congress should do our job and pay for this new spending. We have a  responsibility to pay for our bills, just like every American does.  However, that does not mean that I will not consider the use of  emergency spending when it is appropriate and necessary in the future  as new emergencies may arise.   Before I close, I would like to thank the dozens of higher education  groups and veterans service organizations that have advocated for the  passage of this needed extension and reform.   I want to especially thank the American Council on Education and the  Student Veterans of America for their continued support for this fully  paid for legislation. They understand that if these changes are not  made soon, many schools will be forced to stop accepting students who  are using the GI Bill. I agree with them that such an outcome is simply  unacceptable.   While I wish we could have enacted these protections weeks ago, I am  glad we are taking care of them today on a bipartisan basis that  protects veterans and taxpayers alike.   I, again, want to thank Chairman Takano for working with me and  others on this issue, as well as our colleagues, Senators Tester and  Moran, for their support.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I just want to let everyone know  that I am very much in support of this legislation. I encourage my  colleagues to support it as well, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
