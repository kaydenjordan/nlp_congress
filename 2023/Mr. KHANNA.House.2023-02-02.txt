 Mr. Speaker, let me be clear. The Democratic Party does  not believe that the government should control the means of production.  No Democrat believes that there should be government gas stations or  government technology companies or government car companies.   So what does the Democratic Party believe? We believe every person in  America should have childcare.   What do the Republicans say?   Their answer: Well, look at how many people Stalin killed.   We say: Let's give everyone healthcare.   The Republicans say: Well, we can't do that. Look at how many people  Pol Pot killed.   We say: Let's make sure everyone has equal opportunity.   The Republicans say: We can't do that. Look at how many people Kim  Jong-un is starving.   Give me a break. The American people are catching on. They know that  we have lost 25 percent of wealth in the working class and middle class  since 1980.   They know that the real crimes are not crimes happening abroad but  the crime of paying starvation wages for hard work.  [[Page H641]]    This party is actually solving the problems of the American people.  That party is giving rhetoric about foreign regimes.   People will see through the rhetoric and side with the Democratic  Party.
