 Mr. Speaker, you can learn a lot when you listen. During  times like these, when political infighting makes it difficult to hear  everyone's voice, we need to try even harder.   Today I would like to encourage all of my constituents in the  Illinois 12th District to visit bost.house.gov/yourstory to share your  personal perspective on the Affordable Care Act. Again, that is  bost.house.gov/yourstory.   If the law has helped you and your family receive care you needed, I  want to hear about it. If the law has put you in a situation where you  don't have insurance or have higher premiums, I want to hear about  that, too.   It is important that we deal with this healthcare issue and reform it  so that it works for all people. And for the people of southern  Illinois, I want to hear your story.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Add at the end the following new section:       SEC. 14. PLAN TO HIRE DIRECTORS OF MEDICAL CENTERS OF                     DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS.         (a) Plan.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall develop and implement a plan to hire highly qualified       directors for each medical center of the Department of       Veterans Affairs that lacks a permanent director as of the       date of the plan. The Secretary shall prioritize the hiring       of such directors for the medical centers that have not had a       permanent director for the longest periods.        (b) Matters Included.--The plan developed under subsection       (a) shall include the following:        (1) A deadline to hire the directors of the medical centers       of the Department as described in such subsection.        (2) Identification of the possible impediments to such       hiring.        (3) Identification of opportunities to promote and train       candidates from within the Department to senior executive       positions in the Department, including as directors of       medical centers.        (c) Submission.--Not later than 120 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the       Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives and the Senate the plan developed under       subsection (a).        (d) Semiannual Reports.--Not later than 180 days after the       date of the enactment of this Act, and each 180-day period       thereafter until January 1, 2018, the Secretary shall submit       to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House of       Representatives and the Senate a list of each medical center       of the Department that lacks a permanent director as of the       date of the report.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Bost) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R.  1367.   My simple and straightforward amendment would require the Department  of Veterans Affairs to develop and implement a plan to hire permanent  directors for each medical center of the VA. It also specifies that the  Secretary should prioritize the hiring of directors for locations that  have spent the longest amount of time without one.   Mr. Chairman, last Congress it was brought to my attention that the  VA medical center that many of my constituents utilize had not had a  permanent director in almost 3 years. This is simply unacceptable when  we have veterans needing quality care and are demanding reform to the  current healthcare system.   After reaching out to the Department, I came to realize that this is  a common problem around the country, which led to my introduction of  the amendment.   Under the current VA system, the Secretary is allowed to appoint an  interim director at facilities, but those individuals can only serve a  maximum of 240 days. This is simply far too short  [[Page H2166]]  a period of time to properly get to know the staff at the centers and  the needs of the location, let alone implement new reforms.   This commonsense bipartisan amendment is identical to a bill I  introduced earlier in this Congress with Members of both parties  supporting the legislation. It is also identical to legislation that  this body passed last Congress with strong bipartisan support.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Wenstrup).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Wenstrup).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Wenstrup).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost).   The amendment was agreed to.                   Amendment No. 14 Offered by Mr. O'Rourke    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 14  printed in part B of House Report 115-39.   Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Add at the end the following new section:       SEC. 14. RECRUITMENT OF PHYSICIANS IN DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS.         (a) In General.--Section 7402(b)(1) of title 38, United       States Code, is amended--        (1) by inserting ``or to be offered a contingent       appointment to such position,'' after ``position,''; and        (2) by striking subparagraph (B) and inserting the       following new subparagraph (B):        ``(B)(i) have completed a residency program satisfactory to       the Secretary; or        ``(ii) with respect to an offer for a contingent       appointment upon the completion of a post-graduate training       program, complete such a residency program by not later than       two years after the date of such offer; and''.        (b) Oversight of Graduate Medical Education Programs.--The       Secretary shall--        (1) ensure that a recruiter or other similar official of       each Veterans Integrated Service Network visits, not less       than annually, each allopathic and osteopathic teaching       institution with a graduate medical education program within       the Network to recruit individuals to be appointed to       positions in the Veterans Health Administration; and        (2) submit to Congress an annual report on the       implementation of paragraph (1), including the success of       such recruiting efforts.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 198, the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. O'Rourke) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.   Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by recognizing the  incredibly important work of my colleague from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup) in  ensuring that we bring more physicians and care providers into the VA  so that more veterans can get access to quality, timely care, producing  better outcomes for them.   Of course, our veterans have served this country so honorably and  have put their lives on the line, and now it is our turn to fulfill our  obligation. Dr. Wenstrup's underlying legislation is going to ensure  that we get a step closer to doing that. He will agree with me, I hope,  that one of our challenges is recruiting the right talent into the VA  out of residency programs across the country.   Right now, the VA is operating with one hand tied behind its back  because it limits itself to the last year of a medical residency before  it begins talking to that resident to try to recruit them to serve at  the VA.   Meanwhile, most residents begin making career decisions a year or two  earlier than that. And private sector clinics, hospitals, other public  institutions are talking to those residents, trying to recruit them,  and successfully bringing them to places other than the VA.   This amendment will allow the VA to begin recruiting and offering  conditional job offers with 2 years left in a residency. It will help  us to address the fact that today there are 43,000 authorized funded  positions that are open in the VA where we don't have the doctors, the  psychiatrists, the primary care providers, the medical professionals we  need to provide the care that veterans need.   We need to begin recruiting earlier, more effectively, and more  successfully. This amendment to the underlying legislation will allow  us to do that.   I hope that I will have the support of my friend from Ohio (Mr.  Wenstrup), of the ranking member of the full committee, and of my  colleagues here in the Chamber.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
