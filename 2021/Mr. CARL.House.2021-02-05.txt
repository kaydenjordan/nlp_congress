 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and the legend  of Henry Louis ``Hank'' Aaron, a native of Mobile, Alabama.   Hammering Hank is a baseball legend respected not only for his  performance on the field but also for being a civil rights icon who  helped pave the way for equality in professional sports.   Hank Aaron is one of the greatest baseball players of all time. He  became the first player in major league history to record 500 home runs  and over 3,000 hits, ultimately defeating Babe Ruth's home run record.   Hank Aaron's leadership and character reflect the best of American  values, and his legacy will live on for generations. I am proud to call  him a fellow Mobilian.                            ____________________
