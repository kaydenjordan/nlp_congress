 Mr. President, a few minutes ago, I had the opportunity to  pay my respects to U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who lies  in honor right now in the Capitol Rotunda.   By all accounts, Brian Sicknick decided early on that he wanted to be  a police officer. He joined the National Guard as a way to achieve  this, serving our country for 6 years before finally joining the  Capitol Police in 2008.   On January 6, 2021, he joined his fellow police officers to defend  the Capitol from invasion by a violent mob. He  [[Page S279]]  was attacked by the invaders, pepper-sprayed twice, and reportedly hit  in the head with a fire extinguisher. He later collapsed at his office  as a result of his injuries and was transported to the hospital, where  he died the next day.   While reading accounts of Officer Sicknick's death, I was  particularly struck by reports that he returned to his division office  after the day that he had had. A lot of us, after having been pepper- sprayed twice and hit on the head, would probably have made a beeline  for the hospital or for home. Even if, like Officer Sicknick, we  weren't aware of just how badly we had been injured, I am not sure we  would have returned to the office. But Officer Sicknick did.   His family noted that Officer Sicknick had ``an incredible work  ethic. He was very serious about showing up to work on time and refused  to call out sick unless absolutely necessary.''   We saw that dedication on January 6. His first thought was not of his  injuries but of the job that he was committed to.   We are the beneficiaries of the service and dedication of men and  women like Brian Sicknick, men and women who get up every day not  knowing what they will face but willing to sacrifice up to and  including their very lives to protect those that need protecting.   In the Gospel of John, Jesus tells his disciples, ``Greater love hath  no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.''   All of us marvel and are moved when we hear stories of those who have  laid down their lives to protect others: the soldier who jumps on a  grenade to save his buddies, the mother who leaps in front of her child  to protect her, the firefighter who dies trying to rescue someone from  a burning house.   But Officer Sicknick's story hits particularly sharply because  Officer Sicknick laid down his life for us. He died for us. He died for  me, for every Senator in this Chamber, and for every Representative,  for every staff member, for every cafeteria worker and maintenance  worker and administrative worker in the Capitol Complex.   We were in danger, and he stepped forward to protect us. And he died  for us. Greater love hath no man than this.   There is no repaying such a sacrifice. There is no earning it. We can  only honor it and try to live our lives in such a way as to be worthy  of it.   Officer Brian Sicknick died as he lived: defending the U.S. Capitol  and all those within it.   My thoughts and prayers are with Officer Sicknick's family and with  all those who loved him as they mourn the life of this brave man                                Bipartisanship    Mr. President, in his victory speech and later in his inauguration  address, President Biden made it clear that he intended to govern for  all Americans. He pledged to be ``a President who seeks not to divide,  but to unify. Who doesn't see Red and Blue states but a United States.  And who will work with all my heart to win the confidence of the whole  people.''   I was encouraged by his words and hopeful of the potential for a new  day in American politics and real bipartisan legislative work on the  priorities facing the American people. It is still a hope I have, but I  am discouraged by the path that we are on here in Congress.   Yesterday, Senate Democrats voted to proceed to a budget resolution  designed to allow Democrats to pass COVID legislation on a purely  partisan basis.   As I noted a couple of weeks ago, it is common to talk about unity at  inaugurations. I have been to a lot of them, but all too often that  commitment is quickly forgotten. And, unfortunately, we are already  seeing signs that Members of the Democrat leadership are rapidly  abandoning the President's call for bipartisanship.   Democrats' turn toward budget reconciliation--a process that allows  certain legislation to pass the Senate with a simple majority instead  of 60 votes, which is normal here--would be more understandable if  Republicans had categorically refused to consider any additional COVID  legislation, but that isn't even close to being the case.   Republicans share Democrats' commitment to COVID priorities, like  vaccinating Americans and getting our children back in the classroom.  In fact, we passed five--five--COVID relief bills so far in Congress,  totaling more than $4 trillion, and every single one of those bills was  passed under Republican leadership in the Senate, with bipartisan  cooperation, at the 60-vote threshold.   Just this week, a group of 10 Republicans outlined a $600 billion  COVID proposal that would fund vaccine distribution, extend enhanced  unemployment benefits, and provide additional economic support to  Americans who need it most. And on Monday night, at the same time that  Speaker Pelosi released her budget bill, those 10 Republicans were  meeting with President Biden in the Oval Office for 2 hours.   Republicans are more than ready to work with Democrats on additional  COVID relief. Now, I won't pretend that we don't have reservations  about some of the measures that Democrats have proposed. For instance,  I don't think an emergency COVID bill is the place to push through a  change that would more than double the Federal minimum wage and  directly increase expenses on businesses that have been decimated by  the pandemic.   I also think that sending checks to those who don't need them and  won't spend them is not a good use of taxpayer money.   But disagreement over aspects of the Democrat proposal does not mean  that Republicans are not willing to work with Democrats on COVID  relief.   Democrats' move toward a purely partisan pathway on COVID legislation  is troubling, but what is even more disturbing is the noise that  Democrats are making about gutting the Byrd rule, which was named for  and introduced by Democrat Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia and  adopted to prevent abuse of the budget reconciliation process and  protect the rights of the minority in the Senate.   It limits the proposals that can be considered under budget  reconciliation so that the majority party in the Senate cannot use the  budget reconciliation process to push through any legislation it wants  with a bare majority vote.   But some Democrats are suggesting doing away with the Byrd rule as a  way of getting around the legislative filibuster, and that is a big  problem. Preserving minority rights was a priority for the Founders.  They knew that, in democratic forms of government, tyrannical  majorities could easily trample the rights of the minority, so they  were determined to put in place a system of checks and balances that  would protect the rights of the minority.   One of those checks was the U.S. Senate. And as time has gone on, the  legislative filibuster is the Senate rule that has had perhaps the  greatest impact on protecting minority rights in the Senate.   But the Byrd rule has played a key role as well. By limiting  Senators' ability to use budget reconciliation to get around the  filibuster, the Byrd rule has helped ensure that the minority has at  least some voice in most legislation passed by the Senate.   In 2017, when Republicans held the majority in Congress as well as  the White House, there were calls within our party to gut the Byrd rule  and to abolish the filibuster, but the Republican majority in the  Senate refused. We knew that abolishing the legislative filibuster, or  de facto abolishing it by gutting the Byrd rule, would seriously weaken  minority representation in the Senate.   So for the long-term good of the Senate and the country, we refused.  We knew that it would be a betrayal of our obligation to Senators to  undermine the Senate's key role as a protector of minority rights.   I would just remind Democrats that, back in 2017, they strongly  agreed with our decision. I trust that their opinion has not changed  simply because they are now in the majority.   Minority representation would be important even if elections tended  to break 60-40 or 70-30 in favor of one party or another across the  country.   All Americans deserve to be represented in government, but it is  particularly important when you consider that our country and the  Senate is pretty evenly split right down the middle, which means any  attempt to disenfranchise the minority party means disenfranchising  half of the entire country.  [[Page S280]]    While the far-left wing of the Democrat party would like to use this  election to implement every extreme, pie-in-the-sky, socialist proposal  on its list, that is not what the American people voted for in this  election. Americans voted for a Presidential candidate historically  regarded as a moderate.   Democrats lost seats in the House of Representatives. And while,  thanks to the Vice President, they have a tie-breaking vote in the  Senate, they did not actually win a majority of seats in the Senate.   My point very simply is that if any mandate was given in this  election, it was a mandate for moderation, for bipartisanship, for  unity. And I hope that Democrats remember that and resist calls from  the far left to gut the Senate's rules and fundamentally change the  character of this institution.   I still believe that we can come together in this Congress to address  the challenges facing our country, but it is going to require a lot  more bipartisanship than we are seeing from a lot of Democrats.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
