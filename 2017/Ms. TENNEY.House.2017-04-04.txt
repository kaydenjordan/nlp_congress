 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1343, which  passed the Committee on Financial Services by a very large bipartisan  vote of 48-11. I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren) and  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Delaney) for introducing this  essential piece of legislation.   As the coowner of a small manufacturing business in New York, this  legislation would help companies in New York and across our Nation to  grow stronger while allowing hardworking employees to have a stake in a  business' future through ownership.   Company leaders across America understand that greater employee  investment through ownership will develop a stronger workplace culture  and increase productivity by giving private companies more flexibility  in retaining and rewarding employees, the people we so vitally need to  grow our businesses.   I want to thank the sponsors of this bill, and I urge my colleagues  to support this legislation.
