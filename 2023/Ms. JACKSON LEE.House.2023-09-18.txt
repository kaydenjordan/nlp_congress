 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3981,  the Isakson-Roe Education Oversight Expansion Act of 2023.   Members of the armed forces are important to our nation, and we show  them our appreciation by taking care of them after they have completed  their service by legislation such as H.R. 3981.   Many of our nation's veterans have earned federal support to help pay  for college, graduate school, and training programs through their GI  Bill education benefits.   They can even transfer unused benefits to family members and do so in  many cases.   Unfortunately, some predatory programs have exploited veterans by  aggressively attracting them and their GI beneits to fraudulent,  falsified, or substandard programs.   The comprehensive Isakson-Roe Education Oversight Expansion Act would  seek to rein in these abuses by increasing the Department of Veterans  Affairs oversight capacity.   Additionally, it would look to restore benefits to defrauded  veterans, and improve oversight, faster accountability, and most of  all, help our veterans access the quality education they have earned.   Similarly, H.R. 3981 would require educational institutions that  offer certain courses to people who are eligible for educational  bene6ts administered by the VA.   Reportable events would include punitive actions by state or federal  agencies, heightened monitoring of federal student aid, and the  potential loss of accreditation.   Institutions that fail to report those events would become ineligible  to receive benefit payments from the VA.   Unfortunately, our nation's recognition of those who served in  subsequent conflicts has been less than adequate.   We have, in recent decades, too often failed to overcome our  political differences to recognize the truly remarkable achievements of  our courageous veterans.   We must be united in seeing that every soldier, sailor, airman, and  marine in welcoming them back with all the care and compassion this  grateful nation can bestow.   Our nation has a proud legacy of appreciation and commitment to the  men and women who have worn the uniform in defense of this country.   Veterans continue to have many unanswered needs, and I will continue  to fight for the rights of our most patriotic Americans.    Mr. Speaker, I rise as a strong supporter of H.R.  1530, the Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2023, which, among other  things, would amend title 38 of the United States Code to improve the  requirement to publish disability benefit questionnaire forms of  Department of Veterans Affairs.   Veterans are some of America's most valued members of society.   These are people who served our nation in a time of need, people who  risked their lives to protect our country.   Yet, it pains me to say that many of these same veterans who fought  so bravely and risked so much in lands abroad have come back to their  nation and have limited access to veterans' outreach programs,  particularly in areas with large concentration of veterans.   There are approximately 18.5 million veterans in the United States.   Of those veterans, 1.5 million reside in Texas--the largest veteran  population of any state.   This legislation is necessary because veterans have special needs  that are unique from those faced by the rest of the population.   In 2015, I was proud to introduce the H.E.R.O.E.S. Act, which offers  assistance and materials to help veterans transition from the  battlefield to the workplace.   The Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2023 is a step closer  towards building a smooth transition for our nation's heroes.   H.R. 1530 helps to address the shortcomings in veteran assistance by  increasing and extending assistance programs as well as scholarships  through the Department of Veterans Affairs.   The Veterans Benefits Improvement Act of 2023 holds the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs responsible to improve its support of veterans through  outreach; reimbursement for medical disability-related travel;  professional development activities; and access to Board of Veterans'  Appeals telehearings.   This comprehensive program is needed if we are to fight this scourge  that is a blight upon our nation.   Our nation's veterans did not risk their lives abroad so that they  could come home and not receive the support and benefits they so  desperately need.   We must all have outrage that so many of our nation's veterans live  without critical support services; we must continue to proactively find  ways to correct this injustice.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 663,  the Native American Child Protection Act.   This bill reauthorizes through FY2028 and otherwise revises certain  programs related to the prevention, investigation, treatment, and  prosecution of family violence, child abuse, and child neglect  involving Indian children and families.   Specifically, the bill revises the Indian Child Abuse Treatment Grant  Program to encourage the use of grants for culturally appropriate  treatment services and programs.   The bill renames the Indian Child Resource and Family Services  Centers as the National Indian Child Resource and Family Services  Center.   It also requires the center to:   (1) provide advice, technical assistance, and training to urban  Indian organizations;   (2) develop certain technical assistance materials for Indian tribes,  tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations;   And (3) develop model intergovernmental agreements between tribes and  states to prevent, investigate, treat, and prosecute incidents of  family violence, child abuse, and child neglect involving Indian  children and families.   Additionally, the bill revises the Indian Child Protection and Family  Violence Prevention Program to allow Indian tribes, tribal  organizations, and intertribal consortia to use program funds for  additional activities, such as operational costs for child protective  services.   American Indian and Alaska Native children who experience child  maltreatment or family violence often have few opportunities to find  accessible, culturally appropriate services to help them address the  trauma from these events.   Furthermore, prevention funding is almost non-existent for this  population, removing opportunities to prevent trauma before it happens  and avoid families and children slipping into crisis.   The federal government has a solemn responsibility to ensure that the  most vulnerable members of Indigenous communities--children--are  protected.   According to the American Indian Center of Houston, there are over  60,000 Native Americans in the Houston area.   Additionally, there are around 137,000 Native Americans in Texas and  around 2.6 million Native Americans in the U.S.   This is a significant number of people, not only in my community but  the whole nation, that deserve protection.   Guarding against crimes committed against our Native communities  should always be one of our highest priorities, and this bill is a  strong step in the right direction.    Mr. Speaker, the strength of America is in her  workers,  [[Page H4375]]  and today I rise on the floor of the House to stand with the UAW  workers around the Nation and those that are striking now in the  Midwest.   There are UAW workers in Texas, and I stand with them. Can we at  least understand that the value of what these workers are advocating  for are American values: health benefits; the ability to have a  permanent job; the ability to have compensation; to be able to buy and  keep a house, or to provide for your family, or to buy a car that you  make.   This is a crisis that does not have to be. I ask and encourage the  Big Three, the automakers, to sit with the UAW workers and resolve this  the American way, and that is with fairness and justice and equality  for all.   UAW is fighting for American workers. American workers over the  decades and centuries have helped build this Nation. Let us not  continue a strike that does not respond to the basic human needs of the  UAW workers.   Again, I stand with the workers. I look forward to a reasoned and  responsible resolve of all of this.                            ____________________
