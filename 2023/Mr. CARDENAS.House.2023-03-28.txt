 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Women's History  Month and the countless women who have given so much to the northeast  San Fernando Valley and to our country.   March is dedicated as Women's History Month, and I am proud to be  part of the party that every day in Congress are expanding women's  rights, fighting for wage increases, parental leave, and reproductive  rights for all and uplift every woman across our great country.   In that spirit, I will be highlighting amazing women trailblazers  from the San Fernando Valley who have given so much to our community  and to our great country.                           Honoring Ada Munoz Yslas     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Ada Munoz Yslas, the  former principal of Andres and Maria Cardenas Elementary School.   Daughter of immigrant parents and a proud product of valley schools,  Ada has dedicated over 30 years as an excellent educator.   Ada has given so much of herself to thousands of students and fellow  educators and parents by inspiring and teaching everyone around her  that they can become everything that they aspire to be.   After her career of over 30 years, Ada is now enjoying time with her  family.   We thank Ada Munoz Yslas for being an inspirational educator in her  well-deserved retirement.                          Honoring Dr. Judy F. Baca     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor one of the most amazing  painters and muralists in the world, Judy F. Baca. Her art is  appreciated all over the world from California to Finland and to El  Salvador.   In 1976, Judy began painting a true landmark for the San Fernando  Valley: the Great Wall of Los Angeles. It is a half-mile-long mural  along the Tujunga waterway that depicts the history of California. Judy  inspired and employed over 400 youth to paint this iconic mural in  their own community.   In 2017, the Great Wall of Los Angeles received national recognition  on the National Registry of Historic Places by the U.S. Department of  the Interior.   Just last week, Judy received one of the most prestigious honors an  artist can ever receive. President Joseph R. Biden awarded her the  National Medal of Arts for her decades of inspirational art.   Dr. Judy Baca will continue to bless us with her art all over the  world, and we pray for her continued success.                            Honoring Carolyn Rose     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Carolyn Rose, one of the  founders of the largest antipoverty nonprofits in the San Fernando  Valley, Meet Each Need With Dignity, also known as MEND.   In 1976, Carolyn started MEND with her husband, Ed, in their garage  in Mission Hills. They collected food and clothing donations and  distributed them to the most needy families throughout our community.   MEND has grown to continuously serve the most vulnerable in our  community with food distribution, one-on-one case management, and  support for low-income families.   Every year, you can see Carolyn leading the Christmas Family Adoption  [[Page H1469]]  Program with her dedicated volunteers loading up groceries for  Christmas dinner, toys for the kids, and smiles for all to receive.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Carolyn Rose for all that she does for our  community.                                time  1015                      Honoring Assemblymember Luz Rivas     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor California State  Assemblymember Luz Rivas.   Luz was raised by her single immigrant mother and spent her childhood  living out of converted garages and back houses in Pacoima. She became  the first woman from San Fernando High School to graduate and attend  MIT, where she received her engineering degree. Luz then went on to  Harvard and achieved a master's degree in education.   After working as an electrical engineer at Motorola, she came back  home and started a nonprofit, DIY Girls. DIY Girls inspires thousands  of girls every year to believe in themselves and pursue a career in  STEM.   Luz was elected to the California State Assembly in June 2018 and  continues to serve communities she was raised in, the northeast San  Fernando Valley.   As our assemblymember, she is a fierce advocate for all families,  expanding education opportunities, and creating green spaces for our  communities across our State.                Honoring Gospel Music Performer Sandra Crouch     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Sandra Crouch, gospel  music performer, Grammy Award winner, and copastor at New Christ  Memorial Church in Pacoima.   Sandra and her twin brother, Andrae, who is no longer with us, were  raised singing gospel music in the church their father founded. Like  her brother, she pursued a career in the music industry.   In 1984, she won a Grammy Award for her album ``We Sing Praises.'' On  this album, she gave moving performances of songs such as ``My Soul  Only Loves You'' and ``No Greater Love.''   Sandra's powerful voice continues to enrich the hearts of many in her  congregation and community, and we honor her accomplished career and  dedication to her community.                            ____________________
