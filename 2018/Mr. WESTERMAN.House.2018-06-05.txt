 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana for  hosting this. Also, it is an honor to follow my three colleagues from  Arkansas.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the benefits of the Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act, specifically in the Fourth District of Arkansas.   One of the greatest advantages that H.R. 1 provides residents of  Arkansas' Fourth District is an increased standard deduction of $12,000  for single filers and $24,000 for joint filers.   In my district, 81.5 percent of residents choose the standard  deduction when filing their taxes, and they will now be taxed on a  smaller portion of their income. In addition, the child tax credit has  been doubled to $2,000 and made partially refundable, a boost for low- income families. Those who itemize their deductions will find most of  their previous options still available, including the interest  deduction for most mortgages, capital gains deductions, and deductions  for charitable contributions.   An overwhelming number of low- and middle-income Arkansans have  benefited from the first major tax reform in 36 years. At the same  time, these changes have simplified our complex tax laws and encouraged  businesses of all sizes to invest in their communities.                                time  2000    Many have committed to increasing wages, paying bonuses to employees,  and reinvesting in American jobs and infrastructure, as my colleagues  have previously mentioned.   Businesses in Arkansas are thriving, and the biggest concern that I  hear right now are where do they find labor. We have got a low  unemployment rate and there is a huge competition for labor in my  district.   H.R. 1 also maintained the Federal historic tax credit that was  originally championed by Ronald Reagan. Cities, like my hometown of Hot  Springs, have relied on the historic tax credit to revitalize downtowns  and create jobs.   This tax credit has been used to refurbish, revitalize, and  reinvigorate properties and communities across the Fourth District of  Arkansas and across the country. This not only brings economic  prosperity back to these towns and back to these historic areas, but it  allows us to keep our history alive for future generations.   Passage of tax cuts and the continuation of the Historic Tax Credit  will continue to propel the economy of Arkansas and the country  forward. I am proud to have supported it and proud to stand up with my  colleagues from The Natural State and around the country to praise its  benefits.
