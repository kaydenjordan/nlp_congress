 Mr. President, with my fellow Members of Idaho's  congressional delegation Senator Jim Risch and Representatives Mike  Simpson and Russ Fulcher, we pay tribute to an outstanding Idahoan,  Richard ``Rich'' Hayes Cesler, Sr., who served our country and its  veterans with great distinction. He passed away on July 16, 2023.   Rich not only assisted living veterans and their families, but also  made sure thousands were recognized and honored after their passing.  Rich partnered with Fred Salanti in cofounding the nonprofit Missing in  America, MIA, Project. Rich served as the MIA Project's national  cemeteries/laws coordinator. Since 2006, the duo led MIA Project  volunteers nationwide who have interred the unclaimed cremated remains  of nearly 5,800 veterans.   As a Vietnam veteran, Rich connected with the many veterans and their  families he helped. He grew up in Portsmouth, VA, and joined the U.S.  Air Force directly after high school. He obtained the rank of sergeant  during his service from 1966 to 1972. He was trained as a jet aircraft  mechanic and aircraft maintenance technician and served as a crew chief  in Saigon, Vietnam, working on F-111 aircraft.   His loved ones characterize Rich as ``a true renaissance man'' who  dabbled in many different hobbies and occupations. His obituary  includes a list of his vocations after his military service noting that  in no particular order he ``was a life insurance agent, a police  officer, Veteran Service Officer, small business owner, general  contractor, cargo/baggage handler, senior customer service agent,  international head judge for car stereo contests, promoter, Director of  two State Veteran cemeteries, beta tester, trainer, VFW state  commander, he drafted legislation, delivered seminars, was a competitor  at car stereo contests, a published writer, and a die-hard veteran  supporter and advocate.'' In fact, he was recognized with a 2011 Spirit  of Freedom: Idaho Veterans Service Award for his unselfish dedication  to his fellow veterans and their families. His work as director of two  State veterans cemeteries to ensure veterans and their spouses received  the burials they were promised and his founding of the MIA Project were  among the many examples of his dedicated service to others cited in his  award recognition.   Honoring Rich Cesler in Congress in September during National POW/MIA  Recognition Month, a time set aside to highlight ongoing efforts to  seek answers for families of America's prisoners of war--POWs--and  missing in action--MIA--is deeply fitting as Rich made sure lost  soldiers were honored here at home. He saw firsthand that America's  veterans did not only go missing overseas. He recognized that the  shelves of funeral homes, coroner's offices, and State hospitals and  even far less ceremonial locations should not be the final resting  places for veterans who do not have remaining family or have lost touch  with their families. MIA Project volunteers' commendable efforts to  honor veterans lost right here at home were rightly recognized. This  includes our understanding that he was being considered for a  Presidential award for his Missing in America Project. Rich said, ``The  MIA Project has become the voice for those who have none and continues  to be dedicated to remembering our forgotten heroes.''   Rich accomplished one of the greatest things we can achieve in our  lifetime: He used his talents and experiences to meaningfully help  others. His actions demonstrated his deep understanding that great  personal rewards came from giving to others instead of seeking personal  gains. And, despite his solemn work, he found and shared joy. Rich was  known for his amazing sense of humor. As noted in his obituary, ``This  was one of his greatest joys, to laugh and make others laugh.'' May the  joy, levity, and dedication he gave to so many during his time on earth  comfort his many friends and loved ones, including his wife of 47 years  Joyce; six children and their spouses; 17 grandchildren; 20 great- grandchildren; and many others. We join in mourning this great Idahoan  and American and pay tribute to his extraordinary legacy.                            ____________________
