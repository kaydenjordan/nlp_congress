 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The Department of Labor's environmental, social, and governance rule  is good for retirees, and it is good for the American economy.   Allowing ESG considerations can help financial professionals identify  investments that will be sustainable in the long term and in the best  interest of their clients.   The rule is not an ESG mandate. It simply clarifies that the  professionals who make investment decisions for retirement plans do not  violate their fiduciary duties by merely considering ESG factors.   Existing law already says that these professionals' primary purpose  is to make the best financial choices for the plans, and this rule does  not change that at all.   It merely is a recognition that if a company is inherently risky  because of the business they do or their internal practices, its stock  could suffer in the long run.   Just like American consumers can be motivated to disinvest from  companies that pollute or mistreat their workers, now investors will  have the same abilities.   As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Health, Employment,  Labor, and Pensions, I have seen overwhelming support for this rule,  especially from the financial industry.   Rolling it back would be a significant step backward. I strongly  oppose H.J. Res. 30 and encourage all Members to do the same so they  can leave retirement plan decisions to the retirees and the  professionals they respect and they work with.
