 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Ariel Brown, a teacher at Savannah Legacy Academy on her recent 2023  First Tee National Teacher of the Year award.   First Tee is a youth development organization that enables children  to develop personally, athletically, and socially through golf lessons.   A First Tee alum herself, Ms. Brown was the first coach at First Tee  Savannah when the chapter relaunched in 2021. The organization is  making the game more accessible to youth, and it is clearly working as  they currently have more than 3 million children in the program  nationwide.   Ms. Brown's involvement in First Tee shows her commitment to students  in and out of the classroom. I thank her for her efforts to help guide  her students intellectually, socially, and athletically.   Congratulations, Ariel, on this wonderful accomplishment.                            ____________________
