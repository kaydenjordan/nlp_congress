 Mr. President, in just a few moments, we are going to  consider S.J. Res. 28 through S.J. Res. 48. I urge my colleagues to  oppose these resolutions and to consider the sales that we are talking  about here on their own merits.   First of all, we are not talking about the killing of Mr. Khashoggi.  That was a murderous act; it was an awful act; and it cannot be  condoned or tolerated in any way, shape, or form. Yet it is not what we  are voting on here today. Indeed, we hope to eventually bring to the  floor a resolution, possibly even a bill, that speaks to that horrific  act. Those negotiations have been going on for some time, and we hope  to reach a conclusion, but we are not talking about that. We are  talking about arms sales that the administration has determined are  needed--and on which we have all been briefed--because of the current  situation in the Middle East.   I want to speak very briefly about recent events that have been  happening as far as Iran is concerned. Iran is conducting activities  that are very worrisome and very troubling. When you have these kinds  of things happen, it is obvious that a miscalculation can occur, which  is the most worrisome thing here.   In any event, these arms sales are needed. To be clear, in the  current statute, the administration is within its legal authority to  declare an emergency. As stipulated in the Arms Export Control Act,  which was passed by this body, the President can act swiftly if he  concludes an emergency exists that requires a proposed sale that is in  the national security interest of the United States. That has occurred.   Presidential authority to waive congressional notification was  invoked for the very first time by President Carter in 1979. It has  been used on three other subsequent occasions. The administration has  said, as in those cases, this is a one-time invocation of the waiver  authority in response to an acute threat from Iran. The administration  has since returned to the regular congressional notification process  for further arms sales, which is in place today.   These sales are needed to address the legitimate security  requirements of other countries we support in response to there being  numerous threats from Iran and its proxies. These threats are real. As  the events over just even the recent 24 hours have shown us, it is  important that these countries be ready to assist us and to act on  their own behalf to counter what Iran has been doing.   Yesterday, Iranian-backed Houthi militants struck a Saudi civilian  desalinization plant with a land attack cruise missile.   Last night, Iranian forces shot down a U.S. drone that was operating  in international airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. It is the third  U.S. aircraft they have targeted in recent weeks.   Last week, using limpet mines, Iran attacked two oil tankers that  were traveling near the Strait of Hormuz. Yesterday, German Chancellor  Merkel cited strong evidence that attributes that attack to Iran. There  are very few people in the world who don't know for a fact that it has  been Iran that has been responsible for all of this.   On that same day last week, the Iranian-supported Houthis fired a  missile at Abha International Airport, in southern Saudi Arabia, and  wounded 26 innocent Saudi civilians. Human Rights Watch announced this  Houthi attack as a war crime.   On May 19, a rocket--likely by Iran's proxies--landed near the  American Embassy in Baghdad.   On May 14, Iran's proxies used drones to strike two strategically  important Saudi oil facilities.   Just 2 days earlier, on May 12, four more tankers were targeted by  Iran while they were anchored in an Emirati port.   Each month, Iranian-sponsored Houthi rebels launch over 15 ballistic  missiles and weaponized, unmanned aerial systems against Saudi Arabia  and the United Arab Emirates. This poses a significant threat and  endangers the lives of 80,000 Americans who reside on the Arabian  Peninsula.   These are the most recent examples of Iran's destabilizing actions on  the world stage. These are serious, serious matters. As I said before,  this is worrisome; this is troubling. The miscalculation of these kinds  of things cause hostilities that lead to very large wars.   As Iran thinks through these things and calibrates them and tries to  make determinations as to what is in its best interest, it is not going  well. If you listen to Iran's public statements, they clearly do not  coincide with facts. More importantly, Iran is miscalculating the  resolve of the American people. It is miscalculating the fact that it  is dealing with President Trump; it is not dealing with a former  President.   I have talked to the President about this many times. He does not  want to go to war with Iran. The American people don't want to go to  war with Iran. This body does not want to go to war with Iran. This  President is absolutely committed to protecting U.S. lives and U.S.  interests, and he will do so. Iran should not miscalculate on that  matter, for the President is deeply committed to that proposition.   Iran needs to back away from the edge that it has taken everyone to  and deal with this matter entirely differently than it has, or there  are going to be dire consequences.   In the face of the attacks I have described and the intimidation, our  allies have an obligation to develop capabilities to protect their  citizens from such threats. These arms sales are an essential part of  our effort in helping them build those capabilities and resist Iranian  intimidation.   I share my fellow Senators' concerns about the humanitarian crisis in  Yemen and the need for all combatants to avoid civilian casualties.  This package includes the sales of precision weapons, which, when  combined with partner efforts to improve intelligence in targeting,  will enable those who use the weapons to ensure their actions are  precise, discriminate, and proportional so as to minimize civilian  casualties. The precision munitions in these sales would also prove to  be essential to other countries' efforts in defending themselves from  more direct attacks from Iran.   Some of us have been briefed by U.S. personnel who have worked  specifically with the Saudis to make these improvements, and I  encourage my colleagues to have similar conversations. If you care  about reducing civilian casualties, you should be an enthusiastic  supporter of providing these exacting capabilities, which will be  transferred pursuant to these sales. These are important for reducing  civilian casualties, and we should all support them.   In closing, I will repeat several key points.   First, the emergency declaration is legal.   Second, these sales are necessary to answer for the legitimate  security requirements of other nations that work to keep safe our  fellow Americans who work, travel, and live around the world.   Third, to reject these sales at this time and under these  circumstances is to reward recent Iranian aggression, to encourage  further Iranian escalation, and most importantly, to encourage the  miscalculation on the part of the Iranians, which will be disastrous if  [[Page S4142]]  they continue down the road they are going.   For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against these  resolutions.   I yield the floor.                             Vote on S.J. Res. 36     Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Michael  Assante, a leader, a visionary, and a patriot who has contributed so  much to protect our Nation's critical infrastructure and our interests  around the world.   Michael Assante began his impressive career as an intelligence  officer in the U.S. Navy where he learned the intricacies of cyber  security defenses. After leaving the Navy, Mike became the chief  information security officer at one of the largest U.S. utilities,  American Electric Power. Mike continued to work in the private sector  in the field of cyber security before he joined Idaho National  Laboratory, INL, as a critical infrastructure protection specialist. At  INL, Michael Assante assembled a unique team of computer experts, power  engineers, control systems technicians, grid operators, infrastructure  designers, law enforcement officials, and U.S. military special forces  officers to tackle the most challenging cyber threats to critical  infrastructure. This team has an impressive list of successes and its  work continues to this day.   As Mike's accomplishments and recognition grew, he left INL and  assumed senior positions at the North American Electric Reliability  Corporation, the Council on CyberSecurity, the Center for Internet  Security, NexDefense, the SANS Institute, and the Center for Strategic  and International Studies. In all of these capacities, Michael Assante  brought unique insights and strategies to the effort to protect our  critical infrastructure from cyberattack. It was during this time that  Mike became a resource to me and my staff, and he helped us better  understand the magnitude of the cyber threat to our grid and  opportunities for engineered solutions to interrupt the kill chain and  mitigate the threat.   As a result of more than two decades of dedication, hard work, and  impact, Michael Assante has a long list of noteworthy publications,  collaborations, recognitions, and awards, but perhaps his greatest  legacy is the thousands of professionals he trained to help protect our  Nation's critical infrastructure.   Most Americans, including Mike's family and friends, will never know  how much he did to protect U.S. national security interests. As a  member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I can tell you  that he is a giant in his field, and our country is safer because of  his efforts. We are grateful for his many contributions.                            ____________________
