 Mr. President, as we near the 1-year anniversary of the  coronavirus pandemic ripping our country, there is no question that  Michiganders and people all across our country are still hurting.   While we are making important progress in the fight to combat this  virus, this public health and economic crisis continues to take a  significant toll on families, workers who are out of a job, educators,  students, small businesses, hospitals, and communities all across our  country.   We passed targeted, temporary relief in December, but we knew at that  time that that was not going to be enough. We need more robust,  meaningful relief. We must act quickly to meet the urgency of this  moment by swiftly passing the American Rescue Plan.  [[Page S1045]]    This is about relief for Michiganders and Americans who are reeling  and are trying to make ends meet, funding to help schools safely  reopen, sources to speed up vaccine distribution, and support for small  businesses fighting to stay afloat.   I continue to hear from Michiganders from all across the State who  are struggling to put food on the table, pay their rent, and keep the  lights on. These folks are not asking for a handout; they simply want a  lifeline to get to the other side of the pandemic.   When we passed $600 relief checks in December, I pledged that we must  do more and that we could do that by providing people with an  additional $1,400 to fulfill the promise of $2,000 in relief funds.  With the American Rescue Plan, the majority of Michiganders and  Americans who received these relief checks in December are going to be  eligible once again.   This bill would mean a family of four could receive an additional  $5,600. That support is vital to make sure that people don't fall into  poverty as a result of this pandemic and that they can get back up on  their feet as quickly as possible.   We know that millions of workers across our country, including  workers in Michigan, are on the verge of seeing unemployment benefits  expire on March 14. We cannot abandon folks who are out of work through  no fault of their own because of COVID-19. They have seen this pandemic  disrupt their jobs and their incomes. The need for unemployment  assistance is widespread, and it is necessary in Michigan.   For example, there were over 840,000 active claims for Michiganders  for unemployment assistance in Michigan just in February. That is up  from 529,000 in January. And these claims for assistance come from  every single county all across our State. We need to act now so these  individuals remain eligible for unemployment benefits, including if  they were self-employed workers, like small business owners, freelance  workers, independent contractors, or gig workers. We must ensure  families receiving unemployment have enough assistance to get by, which  is why I support an additional $400 in weekly benefits. We also need to  provide certainty that this assistance will continue to be there for  them in the months ahead, not just for the next few days. The American  relief plan will do just that by bolstering our State unemployment  programs with additional Federal support through August 29.   To help families get back to work, we all know that we must also  safely reopen our schools. Many parents and educators are struggling to  assist children through lessons while juggling other work and  caregiving demands during the pandemic. The American Rescue Plan  reflects a point of consensus that we want our students to return to  in-person learning as quickly and as safely as possible. And the more  resources that we can provide, the better.   In response to the negative impact that COVID-19 has had on  education, a stronger and urgent investment in our schools is  absolutely critical for achieving safe operations and recovering from  gaps in learning. That is why the American Rescue Plan is absolutely  essential   This legislation will provide $170 billion in emergency funding to  our schools and to our students, with $130 billion for K-12. The  funding will help schools take steps based on science and recommended  by the CDC to ensure that students and educators can safely return to  the classroom. This includes repairing ventilation systems, reducing  class sizes, implementing social distancing guidelines, purchasing  personal protective equipment, and hiring support staff to care for  students' health and their well-being.   Every family and community has been facing a very unique set of  challenges, and we need to provide robust funding so schools and  parents have what they need to keep children connected with learning  opportunities that are both safe and effective.   And while these are important steps, we also know that if we are  going to come back stronger from this pandemic, we also need to support  the very backbone of our economy, which is our small businesses. While  we have passed several rounds of relief for small businesses, too many  of our hard-hit small businesses are still reeling--from restaurants to  boutiques, to family-owned and minority-owned businesses.   The American Rescue Plan has significant small business relief,  including $25 billion in grants for restaurants and bars that have lost  revenue because of the pandemic; $15 billion for economic injury  disaster loan advance grants; $7 million in funding for Paycheck  Protection Program loans and expanded eligibility for nonprofits.   Additionally, this package reauthorizes and provides $10 billion in  Federal funding--including $1.5 billion specifically for minority-owned  small businesses--to the State Small Business Credit Initiative.   I was proud to help establish this program in 2010 while serving in  the House of Representatives. This program is a proven success. In  Michigan, it has helped small businesses create or retain over 12,000  jobs, and it strengthens State programs that support financing of small  businesses, allowing them to both grow and to create more jobs.   I am pleased to again champion this program, and with additional  investment, it will again provide crucial support to small businesses  in Michigan and all across our country.   And, finally, to completely get this pandemic under control, we must  ramp up the distribution of vaccines. That is one of my top priorities  as chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security and Government  Affairs.   Thanks to the extraordinary work of our scientists, our researchers,  and our vaccine makers, especially those in my home State of Michigan,  we now have three safe and effective vaccines. But I know that many  people have been frustrated and darn right angered by the difficulties  they have had in trying to secure vaccines for their loved ones or for  themselves. I am encouraged that President Biden and his administration  have been working tirelessly to expand vaccine production and speed up  vaccine distribution. But to get those additional vaccines into  people's arms, it will take additional resources.   Through my work on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, I have  been leading the charge to ensure that the Federal Emergency Management  Agency has the essential staff, supplies, transportation, and other  resources necessary to ensure that every vaccine dose is actually  reaching an arm in this country.   I have spoken with President Biden both in the Oval Office and at the  Pfizer vaccine facility in Portage, MI, about the critical need to  expedite the deployment of vaccines and to do everything--do everything  in our power to ensure vaccines are free and widely available in every  community as quickly and as efficiently as possible.   The American relief plan includes $50 billion to help FEMA support a  national vaccine program to efficiently administer vaccines, including  underserved communities. It also provides frontline medical  professionals the personal protective equipment, testing supplies, and  workforce needed to slow and to eliminate the spread of COVID-19.   All of these resources are mission critical as FEMA plays a leading  role in assisting the Federal Government's response to COVID-19 by  coordinating medical supply acquisition and distribution and assisting  State and local governments with funds for response activities, such as  vaccine distribution and overtime pay for public health officials.   As we consider the American Rescue Plan, there are signs of hope,  particularly with ramped-up vaccine production. We are beginning to  emerge from a very dark winter, but our work is not done.   We cannot be complacent. We cannot let up. This virus does not take a  day off, and neither can we.   We must pass the American Rescue Plan. This package is not only what  the American people need, but it is what they want. There is widespread  support across the country for this package--from mayors to Governors,  to economists across the political spectrum, and the majority of the  American people.   We must deliver comprehensive and urgently needed relief so we can do  just that by passing the American Rescue Plan. This package will not  mark the end of our efforts to crush this virus, but it will provide a  massive shot in the arm to help families, to safely open up our  schools, and to accelerate the development of more vaccines.
