 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the National Defense  Authorization Act. I must say that I am so proud to be a member of a  committee so known for its bipartisanship. I am particularly proud to  serve on the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee with my  colleague, Vicky Hartzler, from Missouri.   I am concerned that this administration is failing to confront the  threats our country faces, like Russia, so I am encouraged that this  bill includes a package of measures to deter Russia, including U.S.  training and support for our European allies; a plan for additional  sanctions on Russia linked to treaty violations; as well as a  requirement for the administration to develop a strategy to counter  Russia over the long term.   The bill also forces the same type of accountability that I have been  pushing for on Syria policy for a long time, requiring the President to  submit a comprehensive Syria strategy, including diplomatic, military,  and humanitarian assistance initiatives.   Too often, big bills like this forget the troops on the ground, but  this bill raises military pay by 2.5 percent and takes action on  specific concerns raised to me and my team by requiring a study on  improving opioid prescription practices as well as additional mental  healthcare for those transitioning out of Active Duty.   The bill includes a provision I supported for our critical allies in  the fight against terror. The Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program  affords Afghan interpreters who have risked their lives--not only for  their country, but for ours--the ability to resettle in the U.S. due to  threats that they and their families face on a daily basis because they  work with U.S. troops.   Here at home, our military families selflessly support our men and  women in harm's way and provide the backbone so important to military  communities across our country. That is why I led an effort to include  a requirement for the DOD to examine a new Military Family Service  Corps to support volunteer efforts surrounding spousal career support,  career transition assistance, community integration for military  families, support for liaison programs with schools, as well as  families with children of special needs. By building on these efforts,  we can ensure our servicemembers and their families are supported to  the fullest extent possible.   Despite the important provisions included in this bill, it does come  at a time when we as a Congress have forced the Department of Defense  to operate under yet another continuing resolution in the absence of a  full-year budget; and we are authorizing an unprecedented $692 billion  in defense spending, blowing past the budget cap set by the Budget  Control Act, by over $80 billion.   All the while, Republicans are pushing one of the most aggressive tax  cut packages in history, set to cost our country at least $1.7  trillion. Simply put, Republicans don't know how to balance a  checkbook. Ultimately, it is our servicemembers and their families who  will pay the price.   As Admiral Mike Mullen, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff, said in 2010 and again in 2016:         Our Nation's long-term debt is the single greatest threat       to our national security. We ought to balance the budget       because it is the right thing to do for the troops.
