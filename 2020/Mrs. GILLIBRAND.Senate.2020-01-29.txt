 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of Senators Casey, Murphy, Rosen, and myself for the House  managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Senator from New York.   The question from Senators Gillibrand, Casey, Murphy, and Rosen is to  the House managers:         How do the President's actions differ from other holds, and       how is the hold and release of congressionally appropriated       assistance to foreign countries supposed to work?    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S688, January 29, 2020, third column, the following  appears: How do the President's actions differ from other holds on  foreign assistance, and how is the hold and release of  congressionally appropriated assistance to foreign countries  supposed to work?      The online Record has been corrected to read: How do the  President's actions differ from other holds, and how is the hold  and release of congressionally appropriated assistance to foreign  countries supposed to work?    ========================= END NOTE =========================       Mr. Manager CROW. Chief Justice, thank you, Senators, for the  question.   To be very clear, what the President did is not the same as a routine  withholding or reviewing of foreign aid to ensure that it aligns with  the President's policy priorities or to adjust the geopolitical  developments because, indeed, if that were the case, if the President  had engaged that process, had gone through the interagency review  process, had gone through the routine congressional certification  process, we would have the documents, we would have the testimony, we  would have the facts to back that up.   But, indeed, what we have are none of those facts, none of those  documents, and in an almost 2-month period, none of the individuals who  would normally be involved in that process were aware of the reason for  the hold.   Now, let's look at some prior holds in the cases of Obama's-- President Obama's--temporary holds. Congress was notified of the  reasons for those holds, and it was always done in the national  interest, whether it be corruption, national security, in support of  our alliances--never the President's own personal interests.   But let's look at even President Trump's other holds in Afghanistan  because of concerns about terrorism or in Central America because of  immigration concerns. They were done for reasons related to official  U.S. policy. They weren't concealed. They were public--widely  publicized--and had engaged not only Congress but the Department of  Defense, Department of State, and the entire apparatus that is involved  in conducting those holds--again, none of which happened here.   So all of this goes to show--the evidence shows that there is no  legitimate policy reason. Why violate the Impoundment Control Act? Why  keep all of the people involved in these holds in the dark?   The President's agencies and advisers confirmed repeatedly that the  aid was in the best interests of our country's national security,  including Secretary Esper, Secretary Pompeo, Vice President Pence,  Ambassador Bolton. Over and over again, everybody was imploring the  President to release the hold--to no avail.   The evidence also shows that even the process was unusual, as I  talked about earlier, and you have heard, over  [[Page S689]]  the last week, a career OMB official, Mr. Sandy, explain that Mr.  Duffey, the President's handpicked political appointee who has refused  to testify at the President's direction, took over responsibility to  authorize the aid.   Mr. Sandy confirmed that, in his entire career at OMB, he had never  seen or experienced career officials having their apportionment  authority removed by a political appointee. Senators, this is what we  are talking about. There has been a lot of discussion.   You haven't heard from me in a little while. I suspect there is a  reason for that. I suspect it is because we don't want to talk about  the big issue. We don't want to talk about what happened here.   The President abused his authority, put the interests of himself over  the interests of the country, over the interests of our national  security, over the interests of our free and fair elections. That is  what we are here to talk about. That is what happened. That is what the  evidence shows.   There is no evidence that shows a legitimate engagement of U.S.  policy processes to forward legitimate ends.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Missouri.
