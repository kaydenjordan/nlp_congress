 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2. I thank all of  those who have worked on this important signature piece of legislation.   I specifically want to point out and thank my friend and colleague  from Tennessee, the chairman, Congressman Mark Green.   Mr. Speaker, Lennox Lake, 6 years old, was killed by an illegal.  Sarah Root, 21, was killed by an illegal. Maris DiGiovanni was killed  by an illegal. Jacqueline Vigil, 55, was murdered by a man who had been  deported on multiple occasions. Retired U.S. Army Lieutenant  Colonel Jerry Wayne Harbour, 75, was killed by an illegal. Joseph  ``GT'' Paglia, a retired police officer, 48, was killed by an illegal.  Michael White, retired U.S. Army officer, was killed by an illegal.    These are just a few of the individuals and countless Americans who  have been murdered at the hands of illegal aliens through a porous  border that has long been a problem.   What once was a trickle is now a flood. This administration that has  overseen it is responsible for 10 consecutive months of over 200,000  apprehensions.   This crisis is the fault of this President so long as he refuses to  enact policies to secure our border.   Our border crisis is literally killing Americans. It is threatening  the safety of communities. It is costing at least $151 billion every  single year in de facto subsidies for those who break our laws.   As we approach the end of title 42, it is imperative that we take  action to secure our border and stop the flood of illegal aliens.   The House Republican bill, the Secure the Border Act of 2023, will  force Biden to restart the construction of the wall. It increases  Border Patrol agents, requires transparency from the DHS, ends the  practice of catch and release, and strengthens the asylum process.   Again, I thank the Homeland Security Committee chairman and my fellow  friend and Tennessean, Congressman Mark Green.
