 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Morelle, the gentleman from  New York and distinguished member of the Committee on Rules, among  other committees of the House, for bringing this important rule to the  floor.   Madam Speaker, we just left a meeting with President Biden where we  had a discussion about how this legislation meets the needs of the  American people. As our colleagues may be aware, early this morning,  before 6 a.m., the Senate passed a budget bill, which is identical in  instruction to the bill that we sent there.   We had the debate on that bill on Wednesday. It passed with a strong  vote in the House, and then went to the Senate. It comes back to us now  and we are addressing it. So that is what brings us to the floor now.                                time  1230    What brings us to the floor now is the opportunity to crush the  virus, to put vaccines in the arms of the American people, money in the  pockets of the American people, children safely in school, people back  in their jobs.   We can do that following science and good governance to make it  happen. We must do that in a way that addresses the disparities. It is  almost sinful to see the disparity in access to some of the vaccines  and everything that happened up until now.   As I mentioned the other day in the debate on the budget bill, the  GAO has put out a report that at least 90 percent of their  recommendations to the Trump administration on how to address the COVID  crisis were ignored. Twenty-seven out of 31 were ignored.   This legislation, again, based on science and knowledge, and respect  for all the people in our society and in our country, addresses many of  those concerns in a more current way as now we have more access to  vaccines and people more willing to participate because they have hope.  That is what this legislation does. It gives us hope.   It is a reconciliation bill, which means we can just pass it with 51  votes in the Senate. It would be my hope that we don't have to use it  as a reconciliation bill, that we will be able to have bipartisanship  with the facing of the facts of what is needed to meet the needs of the  American people, both in this body and in the United States Senate. But  in order to have a guarantee that the people's needs will be met, we  are passing this legislation today.   I hope that we will have a very strong vote in favor of crushing the  virus, money in the pockets, people back to work, and children,  children, children safely in schools.
