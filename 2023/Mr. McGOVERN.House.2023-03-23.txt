 Mr. Speaker, any mom or dad knows that being a parent  is a lifetime job. It doesn't end when your kids are 18 and it  certainly doesn't end when they are 7.   That is why I was horrified when a Republican colleague of mine on  the Agriculture Committee introduced a bill last week to kick parents  with kids over the age of 7 and older adults, ages 50-65, off SNAP by  imposing harsh new work requirements.   Let's be clear about who this would penalize: grandparents raising  grandchildren, folks who can't work full-time because childcare is too  expensive, and single moms and dads struggling to make ends meet.   Over 10 million people--1 in 4 SNAP recipients--live in households  that would be at risk of losing food assistance under this bill,  including 4 million children.   When we kick parents off SNAP, we make it harder for them to feed  their children. It is as simple as that.   We have a chance to increase access to healthy and locally grown food  by funding SNAP and passing a farm bill with a robust nutrition title.   Let's focus on helping families put food on the table instead of  trying to figure out ways to make life harder for working parents.   Let's all commit to ending hunger now.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me get something straight here:  Republicans keep saying, as they just did, that nothing in this bill  has anything to do with banning books. We keep hearing it over and over  and over. We have heard the same thing in State after State as  Republicans have passed bills like this.                                time  1245    Now, we have over 1,600 books--and more every month--pulled from the  shelves. They are banned. Democrats put forward amendments to prevent  politicians from banning books. They all voted ``no.'' Democrats put  forward six amendments to prevent censorship. They all voted ``no.''  Now they are trying to pretend like they have no idea why we would be  concerned about book bans. Give me a break.   I am a parent. My wife, Lisa, and I have gone to countless parent- teacher conferences when our kids were in public school. Both of my  sisters are public school teachers. I know how hard they work to  involve parents in their kids' education. Don't lecture us. We are  parents. We know what this is about. It is about banning books.   This bill is going to be weaponized by far right groups and used to  threaten schools with legal action if they don't pull books off the  shelves. It is going to force teachers to decide between staying silent  and teaching something that certain politicians in their State don't  like. It is already happening, for God's sake.   Ask the teacher in Iowa who was told that they cannot teach that  slavery was wrong.   Ask the teacher in Texas who was told that they have to teach the  opposite perspective on the Holocaust.   Ask the teacher in Florida who was fired for exposing a book-banning  spree at the hands of Ron DeSantis that would make the Chinese  Communist Party blush.   I have a few books that Republicans want to ban--too many to go  through now, but let me recite a few. ``The Life of Rosa Parks.'' ``Who  was Sojourner Truth?'' ``Biography of Nelson Mandela.'' ``The Story of  Harvey Milk.''   Now, do you notice any pattern here? They want to ban books about  Black and Brown people, and they want to ban books about LGBTQI+  people. It is sick. It is hateful. What is wrong with them, Mr.  Speaker?   If you don't like a book, don't let your kid read it. But you don't  get to tell the rest of us parents what our kids should be allowed to  read. Talk to your kids' teachers. Run for school board. Don't take  away money from schools that fall on the wrong side of the MAGA culture  wars.   We gave Republicans dozens of chances to amend this bill and make it  better to address the actual issues that our schools face. They voted  ``no'' on all of them. Get this, they voted ``no'' on getting lead  pipes out of schools. They voted ``no'' on that. They care more about  getting Rosa Parks out of our schools than lead pipes. I think that  says it all.   Never in my life did I think I would see such a reprehensible,  disgraceful bill come to the floor. We should trust parents and  teachers and students to think for themselves without having toxic MAGA  culture wars shoved down their throats by Republicans in Congress.   Vote ``no'' on this awful rule and on this awful bill.  [[Page H1341]]
