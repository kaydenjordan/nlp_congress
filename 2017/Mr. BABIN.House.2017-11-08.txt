 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, when a disaster like Hurricane Harvey  strikes, the most important job we have is to assist those in harm's  way.   From the Texas National Guard to the Louisiana Cajun Navy, to  countless volunteers and citizens who have volunteered and contributed  their time, their money, and their prayers, we saw across southeast  Texas, in the immediate aftermath of that storm, nothing less than a  model to which the whole Nation and world can aspire.   I have even compared the rescue of so many Texans by boat to the  miracle at Dunkirk.   But when the storm passes, it is just as important that we look for  lessons, demand accountability, and work to fix whatever went wrong or  may have made this situation worse.   I am pleased to offer this amendment today that will begin to address  such an issue.   When a hydropower station is licensed and regulated by FERC, it is  not just the power plant that falls under Federal control. Decisions  about lake levels, flood storage capacity, and other measurements of  the body of water that powers that station are set forth in FERC  license protocols and guidelines written and administered by folks who  work right here in Washington.                                time  1500    As a former official for the Texas Lower Neches Valley River  Authority, I know that these are tough decisions to make, and sometimes  it is a matter of choosing between bad and worse options of where to  put all of that water.   But in my district, serious concerns have been raised by my  constituents and local river authorities about whether FERC's licenses  for hydropower facilities need to be adjusted to account for the  unprecedented flooding that we just experienced and with the ability to  make commonsense changes in the face of an impending flood event.   My amendment ensures that nothing will stand in the way of FERC going  in and examining the licenses for any facility located in the path of  the terrible disasters that we have seen this year. By passing it with  strong bipartisan support, we will make clear that that is just what  FERC should do.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Upton) and introduce someone who is now famous in  Texas, Uncle Fred Upton, now that the Astros have won the World Series.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins), my next-door neighbor and  cosponsor of this amendment.    I yield to the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
