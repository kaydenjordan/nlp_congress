 Madam President, each year during National Police Week we  honor our law enforcement officers and the families who support them  and sacrifice alongside them. It is so important to remember that, as  much as the sacrifice of the officer or the man or woman overseas  fighting for our country, the sacrifice of the family is in many ways  just as great.   They all give so much in service to their communities. Too many make  the ultimate sacrifice to keep us safe.   This year we add the names of four Ohioans to the National Law  Enforcement Officers Memorial. Ohioans who laid down their lives last  year were Officer Eric Joering of Westerville, a Columbus suburb;  Officer Anthony Morelli, also of Westerville; Officer Vu Nguyen of  Cleveland; and Officer Matthew Mazany, of Mentor, a community east of  Cleveland along Lake Erie. Each of these losses is a tragedy for a  family, for a community, for their fellow officers.   Sadly, we already know the names of two people who will be added to  the memorial next year: Detective William Brewer of the Clermont County  Sheriff's Office east of Cincinnati and Officer Dale Woods of the  Colerain Township Police Department near Cincinnati. Both were killed  in the line of duty in 2019.   We can't begin to repay the debt we owe them and their families, but  we can work harder, frankly, to support their families and their fellow  officers as they work to keep our communities safe.   It is why I am working with my colleague Senator Portman on our  bipartisan POWER Act to get officers the tools they need to screen for  dangerous opioids in their communities.   This bill builds on my INTERDICT Act, which the President signed into  law last year. That law is getting new, portable, handheld screening  devices to Customs and Border Protection agents to detect fentanyl and  carfentanil at the U.S. border and stop them before they reach Ohio  streets.   The POWER Act will give our local and State law enforcement access to  the same high-tech tools.   All of our law enforcement officers know how big of an issue illegal  fentanyl has become. They deal with it, it seems, almost every day.  [[Page S2842]]    This week I am joining Senator Inhofe to introduce the bipartisan Law  Enforcement Training for Mental Health Crisis Response Act.   We have seen too many officers hurt. We have seen far too many police  officers and sheriff's deputies and Federal agents killed responding to  people in their communities suffering a mental health crisis. This bill  would invest in training to help officers resolve those situations  safely for themselves and for the communities they serve.   This National Police Week, let's offer more than gratitude to the  people who put their lives on the line to keep us safe. Let's support  these women and men by getting them the tools they need to do their  jobs for themselves and for our communities.                            ____________________     Madam President, over the past couple of months, we have  seen State legislatures around the country taking drastic,  unconstitutional steps to insert themselves into personal, private  healthcare decisions that should be--and have been in the past--between  a woman and her doctor.   Ohio and Georgia, two States that wouldn't seem on the surface to  have that much in common, have both passed laws that would  fundamentally eliminate a woman's right to make her own healthcare  decisions.   Who made these laws? It is always the same. It is predominantly men  who don't even understand how women's bodies and how preventive care  like birth control work.   We have one Ohio legislator, a man, who sponsored a bill banning  insurance companies from covering certain types of birth control, and  then he admitted he didn't really know how birth control actually  works.   When asked about the different kinds of medications and birth control  devices, he said: ``I don't know because I'm not smart enough to  know.'' But he thinks he should make decisions for women.   You would think he is smart enough to know better. You would think  that millions of Ohio women know best how to take care of their own  bodies.   He was also making up medical procedures. He actually wrote into a  version of the Ohio bill an exception allowing insurance companies to  cover a made-up medical procedure where a doctor would reimplant an egg  from an ectopic pregnancy.   This is a total fantasy. No such medical procedure exists, yet that  is what he did.   He is 1 of 99 votes in the Ohio legislature, and he happens to be in  the majority, and he happens to be one of the authors of these bills,  and he happens to be a supporter of whatever it takes to put Planned  Parenthood out of business.   It is not only idiotic to suggest that those medical procedures  exist, it is actively harmful to spread information, not to mention  insensitive or cruel--that might be the better word--to the women and  families coping with the very real struggles involved in an ectopic  pregnancy. That inaccuracy in the law could create serious confusion  about how and when doctors could treat women for ectopic pregnancies  and put women's health at risk.   After he was asked over and over again what in the world he was  talking about, he said: ``That's clearly not my area of expertise.''   Yet he was going to legislate in an area where, self-admittedly, he  didn't have expertise. He was going to tell women what they had to do-- fantasy or not--with birth control. He was going to try to tell women  what to do with their own bodies. He thought it was a good idea to  legislate on it and to insert himself in the medical decisions of  millions of women in my State.   Unfortunately, this administration is only making things worse.  President Trump and the men he has put in charge, the judges he has  appointed--look at the Supreme Court--put their thumb on the scale of  justice, always choosing corporations over workers, always choosing  Wall Street over consumers, always choosing insurance companies over  sick people and, frankly, increasingly over women's bodies and women's  decisions.   President Trump and the men he has put in charge are encouraging  these male lawmakers in States like Ohio and Georgia and Alabama, where  it may be worst of all--they are taking the country backward when it  comes to women's health.   Rather than making it easier for women to get care, they make it  harder. This administration put out a new rule 2 weeks ago that would  allow healthcare providers to refuse to provide needed care for a woman  if the treatment supposedly violates their personal beliefs.   In other words, if a woman had a miscarriage and she came in needing  emergency care, the doctor could refuse to treat her simply based on  his own personal issues and biases. How does that follow the physician  mantra of ``do no harm''?   It is not just medical professionals who could refuse care; it is  hospitals, and it is insurance companies too. I don't know how anyone  could suggest a for-profit insurance company has a conscience, yet,  apparently under these kinds of laws, it does.   Under this rule, an insurance company can consider the coverage of  some services--and we know these are always services related to women,  and they are always services related to LGBTQ people, all Americans-- against that corporation's supposed conscience. So if the corporation  doesn't believe in human rights, doesn't believe in equality of gay  people, of LGBTQ people, doesn't believe women should have control over  their bodies, that corporation, licensed under the law--they have a  conscience, and they can refuse care. That is what these legislatures  are doing, and that is what this President wants to do.   That conscience clause that these corporations and these insurance  companies say they believe--I wish that conscience clause would kick in  when they are raising premiums, when they deny people coverage for  their medication. When they take away an exclusion for a preexisting  condition, where they cancel someone's insurance or never insure them  because of a preexisting condition, that is not a conscience thing  because they are a corporation, but when it comes to women's health, it  is.   One woman from Butler County in Southwest Ohio wrote, and she said:         I'd like to know why insurance companies are allowed to       pick and choose the drugs they will and will not cover. Since       when did they become doctors?    This is just the latest in a long line of rules that hurt women.   They have rolled back title X protections, instituting a new gag rule  that would ban many clinics from talking about birth control and family  planning options with their patients, limiting their patients' access  to accurate medical information.   I just don't understand. Some of these people don't like abortion. I  understand that. They want to take away women's healthcare decisions,  but they will not help women get contraceptives, and they will not  explain the options women have when they come in and want to talk to  the doctor about those kinds of things. I just don't get that.   I get letters from women in Ohio who also don't get that, who are  scared about what these changes mean.   One woman from Mahoning County wrote to me:         I am a 24 year old woman living with PCOS, a hormonal       disorder. Complications of PCOS include Type 2 Diabetes, high       risks of miscarriage and infertility, and even cancer.        It is not curable, but it can be treated with birth       control.        This domestic gag order will put millions of women at risk       across this country.    Let me read again what she said:         I am a 24 year old woman living with PCOS, a hormonal       disorder. Complications include Type 2 Diabetes, high risk of       miscarriage and infertility, even cancer.        It is not curable, but can be treated with birth control.        This domestic gag order will put millions of women at risk       across the country.    Who said these people can practice medicine when they are without a  license and do these kinds of things?   I hope my colleagues will think about these women. I hope my  colleagues, especially my male colleagues, will spend a little more  time trying to help women get the healthcare they need instead of  trying to meddle in decisions that always, always, always should be  between a woman and her doctor.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S2843]]                                ____________________
