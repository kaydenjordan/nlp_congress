 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor again today to  discuss Washington Democrats' one-size-fits-all healthcare scheme.  Every American needs to know about this very radical plan.   Democrats essentially want Washington, DC, to take over all of  healthcare in this country and to abolish private health insurance that  180 million Americans get through their jobs. Incredibly, this proposal  offered by Senator Bernie Sanders has the backing of many leading  Democrats running for President and 109 Democratic Members of the House  of Representatives.   So I want to continue the debate today by focusing on the terrible  impact this radical scheme will have on all of the fine men and women  who provide healthcare to people across the country. Of course, the  impact on them will impact the patients for whom they provide care and  services.   I am talking about the Nation's dedicated medical professionals,  especially  [[Page S3020]]  those who serve in our community hospitals. I actually know many of  these healthcare providers because I am one of them. For many years I  practiced orthopedic surgery in Casper, WY. I was a medical doctor, a  physician, and chief of staff at the Wyoming Medical Center.   When practicing medicine in Casper, WY--or anywhere in the Presiding  Officer's home State of Nebraska--you really treat patients from all  over the State. That is because many people in Wyoming live in small  towns. I am talking about patients in towns like my wife's hometown of  Thermopolis, WY. My wife's parents are there. When they need specialty  care, they go to Casper. For those who haven't traveled in Wyoming, it  is about a 2-hour drive one way when the weather is good.   My point is, when you work in the Casper hospital, you are actually  covering a large area in our State, and that is often the case in many  States. So when I hear that Washington Democrats want to have a one- size-fits-all healthcare plan, I wonder if they have given any thought  to people in the Nation's heartland, to people out west. Are they  considering people in rural communities at all?   I will state that I think about the people of Wyoming every day. I am  there every week. The staff at small hospitals who serve rural  communities like Thermopolis, Rawlins, Lusk, Kemmerer, and at the  Lovell hospital, where I attended a health fair this past Saturday,  talking to all of the folks there--their needs are things I am not  convinced Washington Democrats have any knowledge of or care for at  all. The people at these hospitals work hard just to keep the doors  open so that they can continue to care for patients right there.   So alarm bells go off when I see headlines like the one from the  Washington Post that said:         ``Who's going to take care of these people?'' As       emergencies rise across rural America, a hospital fights for       its life.    That is the headline in the Washington Post, referring to a community  hospital in Osage County, OK. The hospital has a sign out front that  reads: ``A small community is only as healthy as its hospital.'' That  is the truth.   Hospitals across rural America are struggling. Many are, in fact,  fighting for their lives. Still, Democrats are offering a plan that  will destroy private health insurance in America, which is the  lifeblood of our Nation's healthcare system; 180 million Americans get  their insurance this way.   Democrats want to drastically reduce provider payments which, of  course, would drive many doctors from practice and shutter many small  hospitals. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator  has said a one-size-fits-all system ``would decimate physician  networks, creating a permanent physician shortage.''   So how can rural hospitals survive with no financial cushion if  Democrats' one-size-fits-all healthcare plan passes? Just ask the New  York Times, of all people. Last month, the Times ran with this  headline: ``Hospitals Stand to Lose Billions Under `Medicare for All.'  '' Hospitals stand to lose billions.   The Times cites a study from George Mason University that found  Medicare provider reimbursement rates are more than 40 percent lower  than private insurance rates--40 percent lower. At these payment rates,  the Times says, ``[s]ome hospitals, especially struggling rural  centers,'' like those in the Presiding Officer's home State and mine  ``would close virtually overnight.''   There would be an overnight closure of hospitals under Bernie  Sanders' and the Democrats' one-size-fits-all scheme for medicine in  America.   I am sure a lot of people listening out there are thinking, maybe it  is all a mistake; maybe Democrats don't really mean to threaten  hospitals. Well, the fact is, Democrats have long argued that hospitals  need to close. That is what they have said.   Look at what Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, who is an architect of ObamaCare  and a professor in Philadelphia, said on the subject. He actually wrote  a book outlining all of this. It is titled, ``Reinventing American  Health Care.''   He predicted that 1,000 U.S. hospitals would close by 2020. Well, we  are approaching that year. We haven't closed 1,000 in this country, but  over 80 have closed, and those are rural hospitals.   Last year he published an op-ed in the New York Times--the same Dr.  Emanuel--ominously titled, ``Are Hospitals Becoming Obsolete?'' He  writes:         Hospitals are disappearing. While they will never       completely go away, they will continue to shrink in number       and importance. This is inevitable and good.    Well, not in rural America--``good,'' he says, that thousands of  hospitals and patients who rely on them are forced to close their doors  for good. I disagree fundamentally with this principle and what he is  saying.   Of course, all people who practice medicine in small towns want to  keep the doors open because they know the impact on the lives of the  people who live in those communities. Just last week I had a chance to  visit with Dr. Mike Tracy, a family physician in Powell, WY. He is past  president of the Wyoming Medical Society. He is passionate about caring  for his patients, and guess what. He doesn't participate in Medicare at  all. Instead, he provides his services privately by charging his  patients a set, transparent monthly fee. He does what he does to keep  his practice open. His focus is on his patients, not on Washington  paperwork, and his patients are very happy. His practice is successful.  The patients are happy with the time he is able to sit and be with them  and look at them and focus on them, instead of the mandates of a  Washington computer screen.   So you see, there are doctors like Mike all across the country who  don't want a one-size-fits-all healthcare system. Many doctors and many  small community hospitals cannot afford it, and they will not survive  it. Certainly, many rural communities can't survive it.   As the Presiding Officer knows better than most, as he has traveled  his State and as I have traveled mine, if a small community loses a  hospital, it is harder to attract doctors, nurses, teachers,  businesses--all of the things that are vital for a community to have.  So the threat is very real in terms of what the Democrats and what  Bernie Sanders and the one-size-fits-all healthcare plan would bring to  our country.   Let me just tell people who are watching the debate right now:  Democrats' one-size-fits-all healthcare--what this will mean for you is  that you will pay more to wait longer for worse care. That is what it  means. That is what it means to you. You will pay more to wait longer  for worse care. That is what is at stake.   We all need to make our voices heard loud and clear: no to Democrats'  one-size-fits-all healthcare scheme, yes to real reforms that improve  healthcare and bring down the costs for all Americans.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
