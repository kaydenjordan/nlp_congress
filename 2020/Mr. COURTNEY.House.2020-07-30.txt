 Mr. Speaker, one of the most dynamic and striking  figures in American history was General George Patton. He was famous  for saying: Lead, follow, or get out of the way.   Mr. Speaker, those words were given at a time of world crisis when he  was leading the Third Army through France and Germany and still ring  true today. We are in a world crisis.   This morning, the government released its GDP numbers, and it showed  that, in the second quarter, the U.S. economy shrunk by 10 percent.  That is the largest number since the government started recording GDP  numbers since 1947. Annualized, that is a 33 percent hit to the  economy.   What is even more, I think, concerning, is that the new numbers in  terms of new first-time unemployment claims this morning grew again  this past week to 1.43 million claims.   Yesterday, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Jerome Powell,  foot-stomped the fact that not just the numbers from last quarter are  of concern, but, again, looking out in the future, the Federal Reserve  sees trouble ahead. The amount of credit card activity is dropping, and  again, as I said, new first-time claims are growing.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Powell, back in May, warned us that the CARES Act  was not going to be enough. This economy needed more fiscal stimulus,  and the House did show leadership because we passed the HEROES Act,  which was a package of fiscal measures whose cornerstone was extending  unemployment compensation and State and local assistance, again,  following the lead of the Federal Reserve Board Chairman, who said that  those are the most efficient ways to make sure that this economy does  not falter.   Well, here we are today, finally, after the Senate responded with  sort of a package, which, again, is completely missing any relief for  State and local government and which has this convoluted unemployment  extension, which Secretary Scalia, President Trump's own Secretary of  Labor, said would take 8 weeks for State government departments of  labor to implement.   It is totally inadequate, totally insufficient to deal with the  magnitude of the challenge. Again, when we look at State and local  assistance, there is not a Member in this body who does not have a  board of education, a local council, or a finance board that is  struggling with making sure that public safety, public education, and  public works are going to continue because revenue is cratering just  the way the government showed this morning that the economy is  cratering.   We have this debate about defunding the police. Not voting for the  HEROES Act was, de facto, defunding the police. How are local  governments, which primarily fund police departments, going to have the  resources in this economy to make sure that people's public safety  ranks are, in fact, protected?   Mr. Speaker, McConnell's plan, which he released earlier in week, his  own people called it a mess, a mistake--Ted Cruz. The President said it  is semi-irrelevant.   It is time to wake up and get serious. The blueprint is there with  the HEROES Act, in terms of making sure that we heed the warnings of  President Trump's own economic advisers--Chairman Powell--and look at  these numbers this morning: historic, jaw-dropping.   We need to act. It is time to listen to General Patton: Lead, follow,  or get out of the way.                            ____________________
