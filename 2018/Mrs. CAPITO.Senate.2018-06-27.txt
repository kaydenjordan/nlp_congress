 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the 6-month  anniversary of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I would like to illustrate  what it has meant to the people of West Virginia since President Trump  signed this into law. I will speak in a larger sense, as well,  regarding what a difference it has made in this country.   We see it in the news every single day, and the benefits are really  undeniable. Since Congress passed tax reform, we have seen incredible  job creation--more than 1 million jobs, to be exact. We have seen  unemployment drop to historic lows and wages are on the rise. Our small  businesses and their employees are feeling optimistic again.   When I travel throughout the State and visit our small businesses,  there is a real hop in the step of those small business owners and  those who work there because of their increased business, because of  their ability to expand, and other things that they have wanted to do  for years. So it really has been an incredible transformation.   Only a few days ago, a ``CNBC News'' survey showed that 54 percent of  Americans say the economy is ``good or excellent''--good or excellent.  That is the highest percentage that has ever been recorded in the 10  years that CNBC has been doing the survey.   But even more important are the number of stories that I have heard  of what has transpired since we did tax reform. In letters, in  meetings, and everywhere around town, I have heard from West Virginians  who are feeling the positive effects of tax reform. Our small  businesses have been able to expand and hire new employees. They have  been able to give back to their employees, whether in the form of  bonuses or reaching out to their communities with more charitable  donations. Others have been able to create jobs and hire more workers.   Just this month, I received a letter from a constituent, Chris from  Charleston, who owns an eye consulting business. Chris wrote that the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is ``legislation that has benefited small  business owners all across the country and our folks back here in West  Virginia.'' He said that as a result of the tax cuts, small businesses  have hired more people, raised employee wages, and expanded  opportunities and operations.   He continued to talk about the other aspects of the tax cuts. He  said:         That doesn't sound like a tax cut that only caters to the       rich and powerful. As each week passes, more and more of our       fellow Americans support the new tax code. I hear it from my       patients in the office all the time.    Chris isn't alone. I have heard from families who are better able to  cover expenses and invest in their children's education. When President  Trump traveled to West Virginia this spring, we spoke to one family,  the Ferrell family from Huntington. Thanks to tax reform, the Ferrells  were able to open a 529 savings account for the first time to help  support their children in their education.   I have heard from families who have been able to afford high-speed  internet for the first time. That might sound like a little thing to a  lot of people, but it is a big thing to a family and to a child who  comes home from school and can't do their homework because they don't  have connectivity. Because of that change, one more student in our  State is able to complete their homework at home. They no longer have  to feel left behind when they get back to school. That is a powerful  thing.   But it is not just West Virginia's small businesses and working  families who are benefiting from tax reform. In our State, these  benefits are helping to improve entire communities.   During President Trump's roundtable--again, in West Virginia--we also  heard from Tony, who is a rural mail carrier. Tony and his wife Jessica  live in Hurricane, WV, with their two sons. Tony explained that because  of tax reform, their family was not only able to make home  improvements, but they were also able to make more charitable  contributions.   Specifically, they took extra money that they are seeing in their  paychecks and gave it to their church, specifically for the faith-based  initiative that has  [[Page S4469]]  been a very successful resource in fighting the opioid epidemic that we  see throughout our State. It is no secret that this opioid epidemic is  severely damaging and having devastating consequences in our State with  our communities and our families. But because of tax cuts and Tony and  Jessica's generosity, at least one community has extra support that can  be used to fight back against the drug crisis.   I know this is not an isolated incident. It is one that illustrates a  very important point: Tax reform is making real and meaningful changes  in West Virginia and across the country. That is certainly not crumbs  to us in the Mountain State.   Just think that it has only been 6 months--only 6 months--and already  4 million workers have received bonuses across the country. Consumer  confidence is at an all-time, 18-year high, and 102 utility companies  have cut their rates. Think of what that does for the folks at the  lower end of the economic scale. When your power bill is $50 or $100  less or even $25 less a month, that makes a difference. That makes a  real difference. And more than 8,000 low-income communities have been  designated as opportunity zones.   I am excited to see what else is ahead for the State of West Virginia  and for all Americans thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I am excited  to continue building on the incredible momentum that we have created,  and I am excited to continue delivering pro-growth solutions that will  help to improve lives all across this country.                            Tribute to Dennis Frye    On another note, Mr. President, I was just visited by Dennis Frye,  who is a retiring park ranger in Harpers Ferry. He has been a good  friend to me. He is a historian of the highest degree on the Civil War  and the critical battles that were fought in and around Harpers Ferry  and in that region of our State and in Virginia and Maryland.   I want to thank him for his service, for his 42 years, 32 of those in  the Park Service. He is a public servant who will never be forgotten in  our region. I know he is going to continue to give back to the  community.   So I want to say thank you to Dennis for his depth of knowledge, for  his appreciation for our history, and for his appreciation of what we  can really learn about our future if we look back at our history.   So thank you to Dennis Frye.   With that, I yield the floor.
