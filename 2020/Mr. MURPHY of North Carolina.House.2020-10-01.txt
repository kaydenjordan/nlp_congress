 Madam Speaker, I would like to reach  out today to the thousands of Americans who have opened their homes to  the gift of adoption. Giving a child a home and a better life is one of  the greatest gifts we can give.   I especially want to applaud Judge Amy Coney Barrett's effort to help  bring two children from Haiti out of the depths of despair to a better  life here in America.   I was doing medical relief work in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake,  which made 80,000 children orphans instantly. Children who would  literally be 10 feet apart from their parents would be separated in the  chaos, never to see them again.   The Barrett family did a beautiful thing by adopting an orphaned  child in the aftermath of this horrible disaster. Her family gave a  toddler a new life after one of the worst earthquakes in recorded  history.   Unfortunately, some misguided souls in this country have turned that  beautiful act of kindness into one of creating racial division rather  than unity. They purport evil motives in a selfless act of sacrifice  just to create further division in our Nation.   Judge Coney Barrett is now a Supreme Court nominee. Let her example  of knocking down racial barriers and creating unity rather than  division be an example for all of us to follow.   I look forward to her successful placement on the Nation's highest  court.                            ____________________
