 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because ObamaCare has  failed the American people; and one of its biggest failures is that,  instead of lowering costs, healthcare prices have increased. Americans  are paying more for coverage, and families are hurting.   In my State of Tennessee, premiums are rising by an average of 63  percent. Why pay so much for health insurance if you still can't afford  to see a doctor? It puts us right back where we started. And no one--no  one--thought the status quo before ObamaCare was good enough.   I am glad to see the American Health Care Act was released, and I  look forward to working on specific legislative details with my  colleagues so that we can finally fix our broken healthcare system.                            ____________________
