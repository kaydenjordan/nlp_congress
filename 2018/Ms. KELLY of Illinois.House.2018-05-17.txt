 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about  something critical to each and every person in the House and the  millions of Americans whom we represent: our health.   It is no secret that the Affordable Care Act was an important start  toward increasing access to care and addressing long-lingering health  disparities that plague our communities. Thanks to the ACA, millions of  Americans have access to quality, affordable healthcare, many for the  first time. The impacts have been positive across the country, but  especially in the African American community, where the uninsured rate  has been cut in half.   Mr. Speaker, this is remarkable progress, but we still have a long  way to go. Globally, the U.S. ranks 24th in healthcare. Let me say that  again. We, the United States, the richest country in the history of the  world, ranks 24th when it comes to healthcare. Nations like Slovenia,  Antigua, and Barbuda outrank us. Mr. Speaker, that is outrageous. We  can and must do better.   One area we desperately need to do better in is mental health. One in  five Americans--that is more than 40 million of us--suffer from a  mental health condition. Thankfully, the Affordable Care Act mandated,  for the first time, that mental health services be included in  coverage.   But stigma and a persistent lack of access to care continue to  prevent many from seeking and receiving treatment. It is estimated that  more than half of those struggling with a mental health condition  cannot, or do not, receive the care that they need.   This Mental Health Awareness Month, I want to challenge my colleagues  to join efforts to end stigma and bring these issues out into the open:  join a rally, send a tweet on available services in your district, or  host a roundtable with veterans who are struggling.                                time  1030    Do something, anything, to help deconstruct the stigma.   If every Member of this House did something, that is more than 440  moments to help tear down this stigma that keeps too many struggling  without care.   This month, May, is also Lupus Awareness Month. Despite affecting  more than 1.5 million Americans, lupus is poorly understood and often  overlooked even by medical professionals.   It is estimated that a patient with lupus will go 6 years before they  finally receive an accurate diagnosis.   More than 90 percent of those living with lupus are women, and a  disproportionate number are people of color. In fact, African  Americans, Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans are as much as three  times more likely to be diagnosed with lupus than White Americans.   I hope that this House will mark May and Lupus Awareness Month by  recommitting research, improved awareness, and increased access to care  to support the 1.5 million Americans living with lupus.   This month, I also want to draw attention to the fact that more than  75 million of us suffer from high blood pressure.   Tragically, more than half--or 38 million--of us do not have this  condition under control, leading to worsening complications, including  heart disease and stroke, two of the leading causes of death in this  country.   High blood pressure is often called the silent killer, and I know  that nearly every one of us in this House has a story of losing a  friend or loved one to stroke or a heart attack.   Again, as with nearly every disease, African Americans are  disproportionately impacted. In fact, more than 40 percent of African  American women and men have high blood pressure.   Our community often tends to develop this disorder earlier and  experience it more severely than our White counterparts.   So this month I challenge everyone to ``embrace the squeeze'' and get  your blood pressure checked. Knowing is half the battle, and it can  save your life.   We have a chance for Congress to tackle these issues head-on.   Next week, my dear friend, mentor, and colleague, Congresswoman  Barbara Lee, will introduce the Health Equity and Accountability Act,  also known as the HEAA bill.   This bill, that I have personally had the honor of introducing last  Congress, takes a comprehensive look at where we need to address  Americans' health disparities crisis.   I hope that all Members will take a careful look at this important  bill and join us as cosponsors.   While many of these health disparities have existed for years, they  don't need to persist. We can address them, we can solve problems, so  let's get to it.  [[Page H4145]]                                ____________________
