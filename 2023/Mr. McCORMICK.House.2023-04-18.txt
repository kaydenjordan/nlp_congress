 Mr. Speaker, the Biden administration has declared war  on Title IX protections for female athletes. They want to force  American schools to allow biological men and boys to compete in women's  sports. In fact, they show no intent to protect women at all.   As a doctor, I know this is ridiculous. Where does it stop? What  would it take for liberal women to stand up for themselves?   Perhaps when all the scholarships for women are given to biological  men, when all the female sports records are broken, all the medals are  taken, all the awards stolen, and every woman of the year title or best  actress Oscar is given to a man, perhaps then President Biden and his  media allies will finally decide to enforce Title IX and protect young  women.   We are not going to wait around for them. I am proud to cosponsor the  GOP bill to protect women's sports and save Title IX for America's  female student athletes.                            ____________________
