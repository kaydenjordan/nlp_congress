 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize May as National  Foster Care Month.   In Michigan, there are nearly 14,000 children in foster care and more  than 400,000 children nationwide all in need of love and support.  Studies have shown the majority of children in foster care are affected  by mental health issues and often lack access to the help they need. We  need to push for access to services to support these vulnerable  children to avoid serious risks in the future.   I encourage my colleagues to continue working together in a  bipartisan manner to address the needs of our foster care system. I  also want to thank Karen Bass for raising awareness on the critical  needs facing foster youth through the Congressional Caucus on Foster  Youth. During this month and beyond, let us celebrate foster parents  and caregivers and recommit to ensuring every child has a permanent,  safe, and loving family.                            ____________________
