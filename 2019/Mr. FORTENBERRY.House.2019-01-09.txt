 Madam Speaker, there is a twofold goal being sought  by many of us right now, and it is this: to keep the government fully  open and to secure our border.   No one wins in a government shutdown. No one wins if the border is  not safe. We ought to be able to rise above the momentary difficulty,  whether it is a negotiation between the Senate and the House, the  President and the House, the President and the Senate, and get to those  mutually compatible goals of fully funding an operational government,  as well as ensuring that Americans are safe and that we have the right  type of assistance to our border personnel, the right type of barriers,  the right type of technology, the right type of preventative measures  to protect us all, and create the conditions in which America can have  a truly just and humanitarian response to those in need. That is what  is at issue this moment.   With that said, Madam Speaker, though, I think it is important that,  as we are at the beginning of a new Congress, as we were all sworn in  last week, as this Chamber was filled with Members' children and  Members' families coming from such extraordinarily diverse backgrounds,  it was a celebratory atmosphere. It always tends to be that way, and  then we get into the hard, hard work of governing.   As President Kennedy once said, to govern is to choose wisely, and in  a society divided by deep cultural and philosophical difficulties, that  actually manifests itself here in the people's House.   It is incumbent upon those of us who have been given this awesome  responsibility to govern to undertake the awesome responsibility of  deciding to govern well, to carry forth that spirit of the swearing in  day with our families here, and that oath of office, where there is a  common narrative around who we are as a people and where we should go  as a Nation, reaching back to our most honored-in-time traditions and  projecting them forward so America can have confidence that we have  [[Page H350]]  set up the guardrails for a successful culture, a successful economy, a  successful society.   That is our job. It is going to take difficult moments of prudential  wrestling. It is my hope it will be done in a civil manner and that  people will make their firm case and fight for those principles, but do  so with an eye toward building consensus.   We in Nebraska, I believe, invented the phrase ``get `er done.'' Just  get `er done. Fight for what you believe and seek that which is  possible. They are not mutually incompatible goals. That is our  responsibility as legislators for the good, the well-being of the  entire American public.   With that said, Madam Speaker, I would like to do something a little  bit unique. I would actually like to look back for a moment at the year  in review and some important things that were accomplished.   We tend to be caught in what I call the tyranny of the urgent, where  what is right in front of us completely occupies us. Of course, we have  a 24/7, 911 media that heightens all of this intensity. It is what it  is. But the reality is, we did some pretty good things last year, last  term, and I want to review a few of them.   In December, the House and Senate passed a new farm bill with very  strong bipartisan support. For a lot of Americans, it is very easy to  overlook this accomplishment. Our grocery bills are some of the lowest  in the world, our food is readily available, and our safety net for  those who are vulnerable is well considered.   It comes down to this: it is the vastness of our land and the quality  of our soil and the gritty ingenuity of our farmers and ranchers who  lay the foundation for America's prosperity, stability, and economic  vitality. We tend to forget this because our food comes somewhat easy  to us.   The farm bill provides risk management tools to maximize this natural  gift, allowing farmers and ranchers to provide food security for our  country, our nutrition programs, as well as food assistance to millions  of others around the world and protect those who are in very vulnerable  circumstances.   This bill also fosters conservation practices that enhance the  protection of our soil and our wildlife habitat. I am pleased by the  increase in the number of acres in the Conservation Reserve Program.   The farm bill ensures that America continues to lead the world in  agricultural innovation, food safety, and renewable fuels. In Nebraska,  agriculture is central to our well-being, our way of life, and our  culture. Our land-grant universities help ensure that we maintain our  tremendous productivity.   The farm bill is a once-in-every-5-year piece of legislation. The  birth of such legislation is neither smooth nor easy, but we got it  done. It is a good lesson for what we are facing now with new  challenges ahead of us. We got it done in a very strong, bipartisan  vote.   For Nebraskans, and many people throughout rural America, the farm  bill is not just another Washington accomplishment. Like the rhythms of  planting and harvesting, it is an expected rite of legislative passage  essential to who we are as a people, as Americans, and to our well- being.   One of the things that I am excited about, Madam Speaker, is that  beginning farmers and local food producers are big winners in our farm  bill. I am very encouraged by the growing interest of young people in  seeking agricultural opportunity.   We are witnessing a food culture awakening, with local chefs, farmers  markets, and a keen interest in eating local. The farm bill helps these  next generation farmers and food entrepreneurs through new resources  and training, such as the Local Agriculture Market Program, called  LAMP, which accelerates the farm-to-fork movement across America,  connecting local farmers with families, consumers, and restaurants.  This offers a big, big opportunity for us all.    I am also happy, Madam Speaker, that the farm bill includes my  provisions to enhance the Farmer-to-Farmer Program. For over 30 years,  the Farmer-to-Farmer Program has connected volunteer American farmers,  agriculture extension experts, and others with deep knowledge of the  agriculture industry with the world's farmers abroad. From dairy  production to seed selection to entomology, irrigation, and crop yield  determination improvement, as well as farm credit, this sharing of  America's agricultural expertise dramatically enhances the capacity of  people elsewhere to grow their own food, contributing to worldwide food  security, community well-being, and human flourishing. Food security is  the key.   This year, we also passed the Global Food Security Reauthorization  Act. I had worked on this important piece of legislation when it first  passed. It amends the Global Security Act of 2016 to enable programs  that support sustainable agriculture around the world and it extends  assistance for international disaster relief and rehabilitation,  especially for emergency food programs.   Switching topics a bit, Madam Speaker, the fundamental duty that we  all have here is to keep America safe. This requires a modern and  properly equipped military.   In recent years, our force structure has significantly deteriorated.  Planes could not fly in certain circumstances and other equipment was  not available.   This past year in Congress, we passed the 2019 National Defense  Authorization Act and the defense appropriations bill. Again, most of  the government is open and functioning. We are working toward the rest.  This helps rebuild our military after years of budget cuts. Our Active  Duty, National Guard, and reserve force personnel will receive a 2.6  percent pay raise, the largest in 9 years. We are going to purchase new  aircraft, tanks, ships, and other military hardware to replace and  upgrade worn out equipment. These bills also increase across-the-board  funding for additional personnel, training, maintenance, and operations  to ensure that our military is always ready to defend our Nation.   Madam Speaker, while a strong military is vital, America's safety and  prosperity also depends upon a skillful mix of diplomacy and  development. Building authentic relationships around the world and  attacking the root causes of structural poverty are equally important  goals that need to work in tandem with a properly sized and prepared  military.   A race toward technological superiority through ever-larger weapons  systems will not unilaterally resolve our most difficult security  challenges. The tech gap that we enjoy is closing, and will continue to  close rapidly.   Then, we have to ask ourselves: Then what?   I often use the phrase ``foreign policy realism'' to guide how I  believe the United States should engage in global affairs. It is this:  strong defense, smart diplomacy, and sustainable development. These are  the three pillars.   Thanks to the dedication and courage of our troops and our diplomats  and the exhaustive work of many others who serve from their heart in  faraway places, we ought to be very grateful that our country has been  kept safe from attack. There is always a however. However, real risks  remain.   Northern Iraq and Syria are places where ISIS and other dark forces  could regenerate. Iran meddles and frustrates peace throughout the  region. The United States' relationship with Saudi Arabia is under  severe scrutiny in light of our intelligence findings that implicated  the Saudi Crown Prince in the murder of an American-based Saudi  journalist. We also face risks from various actors to increasingly  powerful, yet more nimble and mobile nuclear capabilities.   Madam Speaker, I lead the Nuclear Security Working Group in Congress.  We had a very important dialogue with the administrator of the National  Nuclear Security Administration as we closed out the last Congress to  discuss our coordination of nuclear nonproliferation activities.   There are two core elements in preventing an attack. The first, of  course, is deterrence. The second is threat reduction. Again, the dual  work of our military and other government efforts in nuclear threat  reduction has been successful in preventing nuclear and radiological  terrorism.   The challenge is to constantly reassess the changing threat  environment. A single failure can lead to catastrophic consequences.  These efforts must be matched with an equal effort to halt and reverse  nuclear proliferation throughout the world.   In a September conference, we gathered with national and nuclear  security  [[Page H351]]  experts and former government officials across four administrations  with the singular goal to improve U.S. Government oversight and  coordination of nuclear counter and nonproliferation efforts. As a  result, I am going to propose the creation of a nuclear  nonproliferation council to enable a unified U.S. Government strategy  on nuclear nonproliferation.   In the National Defense Authorization Act, which we passed, there is  a section also that perhaps has been overlooked, but it is important.  It will speed the elimination of cesium chloride that can be used to  make dirty bombs. This policy change that we were pleased to work on  reduces the risk of a catastrophic radiological attack inside our  borders.   In the face of expanding Russian and Chinese nuclear arsenals, our  defense bill modernizes our nuclear deterrence capability even as we  hope to reestablish a more stable and peaceful world. Only through a  combination of strength and an openness to dialogue can we avert a  nuclear arms race.                                time  1745    Back in June, the first-ever meeting between leaders of the United  States and North Korea took place. President Trump met face to face  with Kim Jong-un in a preliminary step towards reconciliation and  denuclearization.   The summit that was held in Singapore was a first step to shift an  escalating trajectory of missile launches and hostile rhetoric,  reducing anxiety for the region, America, and the world.   The summit took a new approach to a long standoff. For the first  time, a U.S. President reached out directly to a North Korean leader.  The meeting would not have happened, though--and this is very  important, Madam Speaker--without a unified global community willing to  support the preconditions needed to encourage Kim Jong-un to meet.   As an initial gesture of goodwill, North Korea returned the remains  of U.S. service personnel and destroyed at least one nuclear testing  facility.   Clearly, much more progress is needed, and a joint action plan will  require North Korea to continue to earnestly engage in  nonproliferation.   I believe that congressional leadership should play a role here in  policy developments that can help the administration reduce the nuclear  threats on the Korean Peninsula.   Now, Madam Speaker, where I live, Nebraska, plays a critical role in  keeping America safe. Offutt Air Force Base and Strategic Command are  essential to America's security, and the steady work of guiding budgets  and building the necessary coalitions here in Congress resulted in  dramatic improvements to both Strategic Command as well as Offutt.   The new USSTRATCOM headquarters building is nearing completion. Its  increased capability, beginning this summer, will add to the combatant  command's charge as one of the Nation's most vital missions, and that  is nuclear deterrence.   A major repair of Offutt Air Force Base's runway will soon begin.   Again, I am very pleased, working with the Nebraska delegation and  our colleagues, to continue to advance the completion of the Strategic  Command as well as the enhancement of Offutt Air Force Base.   Offutt is home to the Air Force's 55th Wing. The wing conducts  intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. This is very  important, Madam Speaker, because, again, it is something that is  overlooked in our tense times.   One of the 55th Wing's important aircraft is the OC-135B. It flies in  support of the 34-international-member Treaty on Open Skies, one of the  last remaining functional arms control regimes that is operational  between the United States and the Russian Federation.   I am pleased that, working together, we were able to enhance funding  for the OC-135B aircraft, again, vital to one of the last linkages of  agreements with the Russians.   Madam Speaker, I want to turn to another topic that really ought to  be at the forefront of our discussions, but rarely is; if we are going  to create a 21st century architecture for international stability, I  believe it revolves around two words: human dignity.   We traditionally think of diplomacy as between nation-states.  Increasingly in our interconnected world, where people can reach people  in faraway places in an instant or by travel in a very short period of  time, it is this deeper transcendent idea that is still operational in  our culture. It underlies our founding here in America. It is in our  earliest documents. It is alluded to. This idea of human dignity, this  sacred space of personhood from which the free exercise of conscience  and right reason and other rights that we tend to take for granted,  such as religious freedom, flow.   Human dignity, the two words that mark the 21st century architecture  for how we ought to conduct international affairs, reaching toward  authentic relationships and dialogue with people with whom we may have  had tremendous misunderstandings in the past, tremendous tensions, or  even the grave consequences of war.   Again, as I mentioned earlier, Madam Speaker, the tech gap is  closing. We can beat anybody anywhere. We can do that and will continue  to be able to do that. And, again, a strong military is absolutely  essential to keeping the peace and creating the conditions for  stability internationally, which protects us here at home.   But what happens when, again, the miniaturization of technology is  such that any bad actor or any bad nation has ready access to it; we  have to ask ourselves: And then what?   It is this idea of being in authentic dialogue around this  fundamental principle that is operative in the way in which we conduct  our affairs; human dignity, mutual respect for that sacred space of the  person and their perspectives and their ability to use reason to think  for what is good for themselves, their family, and their country.   Human dignity. This is manifesting itself very clearly in something  that, again, is really overlooked in our dialogue because we are caught  in the urgency of the moment.   Let me point this out, Madam Speaker. It is about the country of  Iraq. America has given so much. We have lost so much in Iraq that it  is hard to understand why engagement is ongoing and necessary. The  thought of it is exhausting to the American people. It is exhausting to  our process.   But I need to point this out. Much is at stake. Iraq once had a  mosaic and an ancient tapestry of religious pluralism that existed  there. Christians used to total 1.5 million; now only a few hundred  thousand remain.   The Yazidi community, another ancient faith tradition that lived in  peace, in persecution off and on; but, in attempting to live out their  faith tradition in northern Iraq, right now there are about 400,000  people from the Yazidi faith tradition trapped in refugee camps. They  are internally displaced persons living in tent structures, distant  from their northern Iraq homes, and many are children.    As of this past summer, we had a statistic--and it is hard to know  where this is now, given the dynamics--that about 3,500 Yazidi women  remained as slaves of ISIS.   In fact, Madam Speaker, we are still working through the logistics,  but I am very proud that I reached out to Nadia Murad, who is a Nobel  Peace Prize winner, who was captured by someone named Salman, the  Iraqi, and held in slavery.   She came to my office, and I spoke with her and I said: I would like  to hear the fullness of your story, but I recognize that is selfish on  my part and that the horror and the pain and the tragedy are very real  to you. So if you do not wish to say anything, I completely understand,  but I would like to know more if you are willing.   And she agreed. And she told us, moment by moment about what happened  to her family, about how she was captured, sold, and how she eventually  escaped, with the help of a Muslim family, by the way.   I reached out to Nadia recently, and I invited her to the State of  the Union. And she is going to come. We are working through it, and I  am hopeful that works out. Right now she is scheduled to come, and I am  proud of that.   Because it is not about me giving a speech here about human dignity-- and I think Nadia would agree with me saying this--it is not even about  the trauma that she went through and the need to heal. The reason that  she is speaking so clearly and so courageously about the horror she  went through, in  [[Page H352]]  the midst of her great pain, is this singular concept right here: human  dignity.   How can civilizations survive if we do not somehow rally ourselves  around this fundamental principle of respecting the sacred space of  personhood, of allowing people the liberty to live in peace and  exercise their tradition as they see fit, to do good things for their  family, to carry forward the wisdom of their tradition and ages,  through their family life and the exercise of their faith.   If we give up on that principle, where do we go?   We can fight it out. We might even be able to win. But the deeper  answer lies in the message that Nadia and so many others are telling  us, crying out for justice and humanitarian relief and begging for a  new way to think, a new way to order ourselves.   And because we have the philosophical foundation here in America,  because we have been a just and generous society and we have welcomed  people who have fled persecution, the world looks at us as this  beautiful place of the residual, of the protection of that fundamental  value that I believe every heart longs for: to be respected, to be in  community, to be loved.   Now, here is what I think we ought to do. We have about 5,400  American troops in Iraq. And, with the help of international partners,  we have been training Iraqi national forces and nurturing their  capacity to lead and finish the work of defeating the dark, twisted  horror of ISIS.   At the behest of the Vice President, I went to Iraq last summer, and  the Iraqi forces that we have trained and the military told me directly  they have fought and they have fought well. Again, the irony of the  attack of ISIS and the genocide against Christians and Yazidis and  other religious minorities and the killing of so many innocent Muslim  people is that it has created a nationalism, if you will, among the  Iraqi people. And they have fought hard and fought well and taken many,  many casualties.   But here is the key: An additional security footprint is still  required in the Nineveh Plain and Sinjar so that it is possible--these  are the areas in northern Iraq proximate to Kurdistan. A new security  settlement in that area would allow the return of Christians and allow  the return of Yazidis to their traditional homes and to begin to  rebuild.   Again, as I mentioned, in July, at the request of the Vice President,  I joined Administrator Mark Green of the United States Agency for  International Development and Ambassador-at-Large for International  Religious Freedom Sam Brownback, former Governor of Kansas, and we went  to Iraq together.   We were responding to reports that our initial efforts to help the  religious minority communities were not having the intended effect.   When we stepped into the dusty alleyways and streets and villages and  camps, we gained firsthand knowledge of the broken conditions there.  Our trip included intense discussions with Iraqi religious leaders,  international aid workers, displaced children, U.N. personnel, as well  as our military leadership.   Despite the situation's fragility, there is certain progress being  made, including courageous acts of ecumenical alliance and  revitalization, often with international nongovernmental organizations  and faith-based entities.   My firsthand observation was this: The situation in Iraq can be  summarized in three words: possibility, urgency, and security.   Multiple levels of challenge remain. Security is weak, and the  prospect of permanent refugee camps is real.   If Iraq loses its minority communities, the hope for a healthy  pluralism in the region will die, and a severe chain of events will  occur. Iran will expand its presence. ISIS could regenerate. Out- migration will ensue, and Iraq will forever lose this extraordinary  ancient tapestry of multiple faith traditions that are so vital for  human dignity, mutual respect, and peace.   So, working with the administration, our government, we are expanding  and accelerating our humanitarian support for those who suffered  genocide, and this is all good. However, the financial assistance must  be combined with the proper security settlement that ensures a just  return for these beleaguered minorities to the Nineveh Plain and  Sinjar.   So, Madam Speaker, this is what I have done. I am recently getting  ready to reintroduce a resolution in the House of Representatives to  develop a multinational security mission to integrate local Christians,  Yazidis, and other minorities into the security forces of the central  government of Iraq.                                time  1800    Getting this right means justice for the oppressed, stability for  Iraq, and the preservations of the principles necessary for  civilization itself. By doing so, we will correct a fragile security  situation. The religious minorities will have special autonomy for  protection of their own areas, but, again, under Central Iraqi  authority, under the Iraqi flag. The mission will be international in  character under the Iraqi flag. I know, right now, many other nations  are very willing to join this effort, to put down a new security  footprint that would stabilize permanently that area and allow people  to go home.   Madam Speaker, there is another issue related critically to human  dignity, and while it is not something that we often talk and think  about, we are starting to get our mind around how big tech is  controlling our lives. We are starting to worry that the surveillance  of our habits and our contacts by people who shouldn't be surveilling  us, these big tech companies, are creating multiple levels of  difficulty. This growing problem here in America is affecting the most  vulnerable persons here: our children.   The CEO of Google, a few months ago, recently came before Congress,  and he did receive an earful. Big tech is controlling our lives. Big  tech is concentrated and dominating. Big tech is going to necessarily  come under increased policy scrutiny to ensure that individual privacy  is protected and competition is not stifled. But one overlooked area,  problem, is protecting children online.   Now, Google's YouTube is the most popular online platform for  children on Earth, and 8 out of 10 U.S. children from 6 to 12 use it  daily. In April of this past year, 23 child and privacy advocacy groups  filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission arguing that  Google's YouTube online video and advertising network systematically  collected data on the online habits of tens of millions of YouTube- watching children under the age of 13, and that data was sold to  marketers.   Now, in support of this advocacy, Congressman  David Cicilline, who  is from Rhode Island, who sits on the other side of the aisle from me,  he and I asked Google for answers on its policy regarding protection of  children online. The response was weak.   So our goal is to continue to try to ensure that the internet's  extraordinarily beneficial technological advances square with the time- honored values essential to a humane, decent, and dignified world. We  want Google to thoroughly answer our questions. We want Google to be  true to its original motto: ``Don't Be Evil.''   Now, Madam Speaker, let me turn to another topic, and touch on it  briefly, to talk about what is germane in this moment, given the  discussions of border security, some of the things we actually worked  on last year that weren't successful but, nonetheless, may provide some  answers for the current dilemma that we find ourselves in.   America is, again, a kind and generous nation, and we have opened our  arms to persons who seek refuge and want to rebuild their own lives and  accept and embrace the deeper values of our country. However, charity  cannot flow from chaos. No one is entitled to enter America illegally.  Law and order create the conditions for justice and compassion. Law and  order create the conditions necessary for charity, for justice, and for  compassion.   Now, the dynamics around immigration are complex and multilayered. A  Yale study came out last year that said the number of persons illegally  in the United States could be as high as 30 million, but at least 40  percent of those have overstayed a visa. And over the past 30 years-- and this is what we are wrestling with right now--over the past 30  years, incomplete border control, insufficient Federal enforcement, and  the cynical exploitation of the poor for economic gain here in America  [[Page H353]]  has created an attractiveness and led to a failing system.   So, in an attempt to meet multiple immigration challenges, to align  the various perspectives that are here in Congress about a humane and  compassionate response about the need for additional, necessary border  resources, about the need to update our immigration laws, this year we  voted on legislation that would stiffen internal enforcement, modernize  our immigration laws, and significantly increase border resources.   The House-led legislation moved more toward a merit-based immigration  system, provided new funding for more humane shelters at the border. It  accelerated the judicial review process, and it made accommodations to  resolve the anxious ambiguity for those who are called the Deferred  Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA kids, children who were brought  here through no fault of their own.   I supported these initiatives, but, unfortunately, they failed in the  House. And moving forward, I think we need to keep certain other  priorities at the forefront of the immigration debate, which are, of  course, an increase in border security, robust internal enforcement,  and this additional priority which is now only coming to light. We have  been doing this for a number of years. Of course, the policy needs to  be revisited and evaluated in terms of success, but I do think it is an  important one: moving the immigration debate off the 1-yard line and  working with creative and imaginative foreign policy engagement with  the countries in the Northern Triangle of Guatemala, Honduras, and El  Salvador. In that way, to help those countries build more just and  humane systems both economically and politically, to create the  conditions for stability, decreases the intensity of need for out- migration for either economic purposes or fleeing criminal activity.   Now, immigration can seem remote and abstract for many of us, but it  is important to remember that it has a human face, and I am very proud  that we are doing two things at once here. We are, of course, debating  the importance of immigration policy and potential changes, but also  assisting many people who have gotten tangled in immigration  difficulties back home.   Madam Speaker, I think there are certain things in this House that  transcend disagreement, and one of them is our veterans. Americans  often sense what is right and good, and we instinctively recognize the  nobility of self-sacrifice for another, for our country, and for our  timeless ideals, and our veterans stand above the division and  discord--beyond politics--to what is lasting and true.    But beyond our applause and admiration, we are also duty-bound in  this body to keep our promise to care for them. So, this past year, we  did some important things.   Back at home, we are in the process, after some long negotiations, of  creating a new state-of-the-art VA facility in Lincoln, on the historic  veterans' campus there. This is a victory. This is a significant  victory for economic regeneration of a unique historic property, and it  arrives on the heels of a very successful public-private partnership to  expand and improve and innovate the Omaha VA Medical Center. I am so  proud that Nebraska continues to inspire the Nation with creative  partnerships to assist our veterans.   Now, here in Congress, we passed a law called the VA Maintaining  Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks, the acronym is  the MISSION Act. It was signed into law, and it brought the long-needed  reforms in the last Congress to the VA system. It provides a  replacement for the VA Choice program and consolidates community care  programs for veterans who live far from a VA center or experience long  wait times for care.   This is going to assist many of our veterans in rural communities and  help them receive the quality of care that they deserve in a reasonable  amount of time. This act also expanded the veteran caregiver program,  making more pre-9/11 veterans and their families eligible for  assistance.   Now, another bipartisan project that I hope we can pursue shortly,  and we have been in dialogue in a bipartisan manner on this, is to work  with the international community to create a historic center at the  site of our D-day battles in Normandy. A new institute that is being  envisioned by some European colleagues could reestablish, for the 21st  century, a renewed understanding of the pivotal battle that happened on  D-day, its consequences for the war, and the institutions that emerged  afterward that have created the conditions for stability and  prosperity, many of which are aging and need to be updated and  challenged.   The United States cannot pull the world's weight alone. We need to be  in authentic partnership and in authentic dialogue when we have  differences, but in partnership with those who have been given the  capacity by our sacrifice, both militarily and economically, to advance  their own economies and build out systems of governance.   Again, the 21st century architecture of international diplomacy is  going to revolve around that central idea: authentic partnerships based  on the philosophical principle of human dignity that lead to burden  sharing and vision sharing at the same time.   Madam Speaker, I had an interesting thing happen this summer. I  wasn't at home, and I regret that I wasn't there to receive him, but he  stopped in my office. World War II veteran Sidney Walton stopped by,  and he has a really fascinating story.   You see, he told my staff and some of the young people there, the  interns, he has a deep regret that when he was young, he never really  took the time to visit with the last few remaining Civil War veterans.  So he has taken it upon himself; he has embarked on a national No  Regrets Tour, and his goal is to visit all 50 States and give young  Americans a chance to meet a World War II veteran.   Again, his name is Sidney Walton. We were honored to have him in  Nebraska, and he will finish his tour at the White House, as I  understand it, this February, on his 100th birthday.   Thank you, Sidney. Great, great effort.   Madam Speaker, let me also touch upon another area that is so  essential to our well-being, our sense of being able to fulfill these  deepest longings that we have, our healthy sense of ambition for  ourselves and for our family.   A lot of times around here we cite economic data, have a bunch of  charts that show statistics. We do a lot of that around here. It  doesn't really convey, I think, the deeper dynamics of what is  happening. But let me go into it just for a bit and talk about the  positive outcomes that have occurred.   This year, we have seen more jobs, increased wages, and reinvestment  in equipment, plants, and research and development. Our gross domestic  product, one of the measures of the economy, is climbing, and median  household income is rising. Unemployment is at a 50-year low, and many  people who have been marginalized or on the sidelines, thankfully, have  found access to meaningful work.   And if we think about a holistic approach to helping our neighbor,  work is dignity. When a person is able to use their gifts and talents,  either their two hands or their intellect, to make things, they are not  only providing for their own well-being, but they are in solidarity  with the community. This benefit of exchange goes beyond just material.  It creates the value of relationships. That is the beauty and dignity  of work.   And when people are sidelined, when entire communities have been  decimated through poor planning or poor policies or become  overdependent upon one industry that decides it is going to pick up and  leave--and we have seen that happen over and over in America--it is not  fair to people; it is not fair to communities.   But when we can see a return of entrepreneurial momentum, especially  in small business--and again, people who have had real difficulty, for  whatever reason, finding access to meaningful work restores  individuals' vitality, of course, helps them to help themselves and  creates solidarity and community. That is what, when we go into all  these charts and graphs and economic figures, we really ought to be  talking about, what I just said: the dignity and beauty and meaning of  work, the gift of work, the ability to create the conditions necessary  for societal flourishing.                                time  1815    So last year, we passed an important, what was called Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act,  [[Page H354]]  and we are seeing this enhanced economic growth and more take-home pay  for families.   In addition to those important benefits, there is another little- known provision in here that I want to touch on for a moment, and it is  called Opportunity Zones. It provides powerful tax incentives to  encourage revitalization of some of the newest, most economically  distressed areas of the country. It has been overlooked in terms of our  understanding of that law.   This investment opportunity will foster job regeneration and make  better use of taxpayer dollars already spent, and it forges stronger  communities.   Madam Speaker, I used to be on our city council back home, and most  of city council works is public works. When you see an area that is no  longer functioning well, it is not just a blight on the community; it  is not just that buildings are run down. We already made an investment  there. We already paid for streets. We already paid for streetlights.  We already paid for utilities, and they are being underutilized. That  minimizes the return on an investment already made.   We also have to provide police and fire protection for these areas.  Again, those are real costs to the taxpayer. They are not on an  accounting balance sheet, but they are real costs. It is called  opportunity cost and underutilized investment. It is already there.   So this idea of regenerating places across America that have the  infrastructure already creates the conditions in which we get a better  return on the tax dollar for money already spent. We are not chewing up  additional land and resources. We are recycling, regenerating,  rethinking possibility in some of the hardest hit areas of our country.   I am excited. In my own congressional district, there are 14 of these  Opportunity Zones that have been designated.   Now, here are some hard realities, and I should point them out  because they are real. Let's just be honest.   Our deficit is high, and it is stubbornly high, and there are real  disparities between those at the top and those who struggle to make a  living.   And while we hear policymakers tend to take too much credit for  economic booms and too little blame for the crashes, most analysts do  conclude that the actions taken by Congress over the last year have  improved our economic outlook--again, a good accomplishment.   We got the farm bill done. We got the right type of tax reform done.  We strengthened our military, and we are looking forward to the debates  around where we go as a nation now.   Something that continues to be difficult for all of us, though, is  the right type of healthcare reform. And I am going to venture out here  and say that I would assume that everybody in this body holds to these  same three principles. I don't mean to speak for anyone else, but this  is what I believe. I think we ought to be striving for three things in  the right type of healthcare reform: lower cost, improved well-being,  and the protection of vulnerable persons.   So let's just start there. Let's not create another proxy fight over  the Affordable Care Act. Let's just start there.   How do we get to lower cost, particularly for people in rural  communities who are priced out of the individual market and have  incomes that they don't get a subsidy?   Some of the farmers in my community are paying as high as $40,000 for  healthcare. You can't do it unless you are very wealthy.   So what happens? A member of the family has to leave and go get a job  in order to get the benefit. We don't even know how to calculate the  economic lost potential of forcing somebody to go do a job they don't  want to do simply to get health insurance. We don't even know how to  calculate that.   So I proposed something in the farm bill. Unfortunately, the Senate  didn't take it up, but it is the Rural Health Insurance Act, which  would have subsidized the startup of new risk pools to provide for  better health insurance options in areas of rural communities,  primarily, where this market has been decimated, where people have had  to change the way they reorder their economic lives in order to have  some access to health insurance. I thought it was a good idea.   The startup costs for risk pool sharing, the sharing burden that is  necessary to create an insurance product for smaller businesses, are  high, so I wanted to provide, just like we do in markets that don't  function efficiently, like crop insurance, a subsidy that would help  the startup of these new risk pools in order to give more competition  to the health insurance market in rural communities. That is one idea I  had. We didn't get it all the way through, but I am glad it passed the  House.   I look forward to working with colleagues on the other side of the  aisle again who are looking toward those three goals. How do we think  creatively and imaginatively about reducing costs, improving well- being?   We are right around the corner from amazing breakthroughs in  innovation and technology in both managing and preventing and curing  disease, and we have significantly increased our funding on a  bipartisan basis for the National Institutes of Health for disease  research.   So we have done a number of things that are important for the  American people. Of course, it tends to get overshadowed by some of the  more philosophical fights that have occurred, but I would ask my  colleagues, let's embrace the concept that we might be able to find  some policies that everybody could potentially agree on around three  goals: reducing cost, improving well-being, and protecting vulnerable  persons. I think that is pretty reasonable.   There is another idea out there that I will be introducing this year.  I already have a cosponsor from the other side of the aisle. Here is  the problem:   For 3 years in a row now, America's life expectancy has declined. We  are consuming more healthcare and dying younger. Rates of asthma and  diabetes have skyrocketed in some populations, and it is really hard to  see whether or not we are making progress on certain preventable  illnesses. We can do better than that. That is not a necessary  condition that we have to settle on.    So, to start an effective new conversation, I am introducing the  Community Health Improvement Leadership and Development Act. It is  called the CHILD Act. My cosponsor is from a large urban area, and this  allows communities across America to fully participate in improving  their own health.   How does it work? When community members find an innovative way to  improve health and save money in their State Medicaid program, the  legislation allows the verified savings to be shared back to that very  community and State. It is a virtual cycle of assuring access to care  and more creative prevention. I like it. It is a win-win for taxpayers  and people in communities and towns across Nebraska and America.   As we go on, I hope this is one of those ideas that fits into the  three sets of principles as to how we are going to reduce cost, improve  outcomes, and protect vulnerable persons.   Madam Speaker, I know our time is getting ready to run short, and can  you give me an idea of how much time is left.    Madam Speaker, I want to introduce a new topic in  the time that we have remaining, again speaking to that which might be  able to unite us in a very divided time, that which is a fundamental  principle that is operative in most of our hearts, that which, again,  transcends these temporary and urgent moments of policy division. It is  what I call natural security.   We talked about national security. We talked about economic security.  We talked about human dignity, family security. Now I want to talk  about natural security, and here is an example.   Nebraska is one of the only States where you can find three distinct  subspecies of the turkey.   Madam Speaker, are you with me on this? It is really very  fascinating.   In the southeast corner of Nebraska, you can find the Eastern turkey.  In the southwest corner, you can see a Rio, and out west, you can find  a Merriam. This unique trifecta exists right there in my home.   Now, why am I raising this? Why would you be raising this? Of course,  I  [[Page H355]]  find it interesting, and I hope you do as well, Madam Speaker.   This newfound abundance of turkeys is an amazing story because, due  to urban pressures and habitat loss and improperly regulated hunting,  not too long ago, wild turkeys were in decline across the Nation. But  they have since rebounded through basic conservation efforts.   With innovative thinking and proactive policy, we can conserve and  restore other wildlife and natural habitats, while bringing social,  cultural, and economic multipliers to our rural communities.   Nebraska has been at the forefront of such conservation efforts, and  we will continue to lead this charge at home as well as here, so I have  introduced the Recovering America's Wildlife Act.   Now, Madam Speaker, we weren't able to get it through Congress last  year, but I think by the end of the session, we had 120--it was  probably a little bit higher--bipartisan cosponsors.   So what does it do? It takes an upstream approach to habitat  protection through robust funding of State wildlife action plans so  that we don't have the downstream effect of habitat loss. In Nebraska,  we do this through means of voluntary landowner agreements.   This is why this is important. As we approach the renewal of the  Endangered Species Act, RAWA, the Recovering America's Wildlife Act,  actually gets in front of the problem by preventing wildlife from  becoming endangered in the first place, and it moves us from costly  regulation and litigation to collaboration.   I am very excited about this because I think it is another way in  which we can use moneys from lands in Federal trust and plow it back  into another form of trust that creates a widespread benefit for those  interested in environmental policy, those interested in conservation  policy, and those interested in enhanced recreational sporting and  hunting opportunity.   That is why so many people have gotten on this bill. It transcends  our divide. It is a creative mechanism by which we use certain moneys  that are already being gathered into the Treasury and apply them in  innovative and creative ways.   Madam Speaker, I, again, am grateful for the opportunity to have had  time to present to this body an overview of last year's work. It is  important because, ultimately, it is not just about policy; it is about  persons.   A woman named Mary came into my office this past year, and she was  with two men who had made their living as truckers. Their pensions were  in danger. Mary just began to tear up as she explained the dire  circumstances in which they found themselves, because multiemployer  pension plans--this is a little bit in the weeds, but multiemployer  pension plans, some are in dire condition.   So what does that mean? Somebody who said, ``I am going to work for  this set of benefits and, in turn, I am going to be guaranteed an  income of this level in my older years,'' all of that promise, all that  work and those promises are now under real threat.   So, again, working in a bipartisan fashion, that is an area which is  in severe need that we worked to try to fix last year and will do so  again, working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle.   Madam Speaker, my intention tonight was to give an overview of the  last year because so often, again, in the dynamics of the moment, we  lose sight of the good things that were accomplished for our economic  security, for our national security, for family security, for the well- being of our land and water. By taking a little bit of a look back,  maybe this gives us some prospect for unity, consensus, while fighting  on principle, but unity and consensus for good.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 29 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, January 10, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
