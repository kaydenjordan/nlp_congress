 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 241 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 241         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 5) to ensure the rights of parents are honored       and protected in the Nation's public schools. The first       reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. General       debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed two       hours equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Education and the       Workforce or their respective designees. After general debate       the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-      minute rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on Education and the       Workforce now printed in the bill, it shall be in order to       consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment       under the five-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       118-2. That amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be       considered as read. All points of order against that       amendment in the nature of a substitute are waived. No       amendment to that amendment in the nature of a substitute       shall be in order except those printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. Each such       amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the       report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be       subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand       for division of the question in the House or in the Committee       of the Whole. All points of order against such amendments are       waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the       House with such amendments as may have been adopted. Any       Member may demand a separate vote in the House on any       amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill       or to the amendment in the nature of a substitute made in       order as original text. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Scanlon), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.   During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.   Last night, the Rules Committee met and reported out a rule, House  Resolution 241, providing for consideration of H.R. 5.   The Parents Bill of Rights is to be considered under a structured  rule with 2 hours of debate, equally divided and controlled by the  Chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Education and the  Workforce, or their designees, and provides for one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in support of the  underlying legislation. The Parents Bill of Rights would secure a  fundamental right parents should always be guaranteed: their right to  make informed decisions about their children.   As my first time managing a floor debate, I couldn't think of a  better bill to focus on. Our families in Indiana and across the country  deserve debate on H.R. 5, and we plan to deliver.   As a mother of three children in school, I know how important it is  for parents to know what is happening in the classroom. Unfortunately,  this bill is necessary because school districts across the country have  failed to deliver basic transparency.   That became painfully obvious to parents during the pandemic. Our  living rooms became classrooms. Parents came to realize exactly what  their children's days looked like.   Many parents were surprised and disappointed by what they were  learning about their children's educational experiences.   Like many of my colleagues, I prefer that most decisions regarding  education be made at the State and local level, and this bill does not  change that.   The actions over the past few years have compelled us to stand up and  to act. There has been example after example of this becoming a bigger  problem.   In one example, a father from Virginia had to learn his daughter was  assaulted in the high school bathroom from his child, not the school.   Stories like this one shouldn't become the new normal.   As I said in the Rules Committee during the hearing about the bill  just last night: ``Sending a child to public school does not terminate  parental rights at the door.''   I worked in child services. I have cared for children in foster care.  When foster parents are caring for their children who are in the  custody of the State, they can't give those kids a haircut without  getting permission from the child's biological parents. Shouldn't the  same rules apply to the students' safety and well-being in our schools?   Yet, parents are left pleading. They are left to plead for  information; to plead for the safety of their kids in public restrooms;  to plead for the quality of their kids' education; and to plead for  anyone who would listen to help restore their parental rights.   This bill would restore transparency, consultation, and notification  requirements to existing law. In doing so, it would give parents the  right to obtain critical information more easily from school  administrators, boards, and teachers to make informed decisions  regarding their children's education.   The bottom line: It gives power back to parents.   As the Republican Education and the Workforce Committee members have  said, the Parents Bill of Rights contains five basic principles: That  parents have the right to know what their children are being taught;  that parents have the right to be heard; that parents have the right to  see the school budget; that parents have the right to protect their  children's privacy; and that parents have a right to keep their  children safe.   Now, these goals are hard to fight against, but we have heard critics  say this bill is somehow politicizing education or that bureaucrats  know better than parents or that we are encouraging the banning of  books.   Let me be clear. Nothing in this bill has anything to do with banning  books or even that parent engagement is somehow a better model than  parental rights. That is simply not true.   Instead, this bill provides an opportunity to ensure our kids are  prepared to contribute to this great country of ours. It aims to  strengthen parent-teacher partnerships where they exist and close  information gaps where parent-teacher partnerships could be improved.   While there are many challenges in our schools, one we should all be  able to agree on tackling is that administrators, educators, and  parents should be on the same page. The first step in achieving that  goal is improving our parents' access to information about their kids'  experiences.   One example of this is an amendment I was able to offer during the  markup a few weeks ago. The amendment required notification of parents  when a  [[Page H1338]]  student isn't reading at grade-level proficiency by the end of the  third grade. Our child literacy rates are falling behind, and the more  parents know, the more they can help, the better.   In the end, by passing the Parents Bill of Rights, we are one step  closer to what everyone wants, providing our students with the best  learning experience inside and outside of the classroom and giving  parents a proper say in their children's future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from South Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Alford).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to make a few comments.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard about things embedded in this legislation.  I want to reiterate this is a bill that says that parents have the  right to know what their children are being taught, parents have the  right to be heard, parents have the right to see the school budget and  spending, parents have the right to protect their child's privacy, and  parents have a right to keep their children safe.   We have also heard our colleagues talk about how well school boards  work, and for large swaths of the country, I am sure that is true. Just  because things work well in some places does not mean they work well in  all places. Tell that to Mr. Scott Smith who was arrested at a school  board meeting in Loudoun County, Virginia, when he questioned whether  the school might be trying to cover up his daughter's sexual assault by  a gender fluid student.   We have heard that this bill pits parents against teachers and  against each other. We have heard a lot of those types of comments. The  very fact that they characterize this bill as pitting someone against  another when I have just stated the facts of what is in the bill should  be a red flag.    I sat through a 16-hour markup until the early hours of 2:30 or 3  a.m. in this morning. We did hear dozens of amendments, but what I  heard were dozens of chances to empower bureaucrats over empowering  parents.   Republicans are proud to stand up for parents on behalf of students.   This is not politics over parents. It is parents over politicians and  bureaucrats. We want what parents all across America want: schools to  teach reading, writing, arithmetic, and science  [[Page H1345]]  with the utmost transparency. Parents want to be involved and informed  without having to file 200 freedom of information requests only to be  sued by the NEA and the school board, such as Nicole Solis.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, we made a commitment to America, and delivering for  parents is an important part of that promise.   We must empower parents to be in the driver's seat with respect to  their children's education. This isn't about banning books or  politicizing education.   How parents having a right to be informed about and involved in  decisions regarding their own children's academic experience is being  misconstrued by some is lost on me.   Mr. Speaker, we did have a robust committee markup on this bill that  I was part of. We were in committee markup, hearing and debating  amendments on this bill, from 10:00 in the morning until 2:30 in the  morning. In those many amendments, what I heard over and over again  was: there is nothing to see here and that this bill is not necessary  and that most schools in America are doing just fine.   Well, most schools, Mr. Speaker, are not all schools. Our parents  have a fundamental right to know what is happening in the classroom  without having to file a public records request to find it. If things  are going so well that our colleagues across the aisle believe that  this bill is not needed, then they should stand and join Republicans in  support of parents across America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the  underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Scanlon is as follows:     An Amendment to H. Res. 241 Offered by Ms. Scanlon of Pennsylvania    At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 178) affirming the House of       Representatives' commitment to protect and strengthen Social       Security and Medicare. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means or       their respective designees.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 178.
