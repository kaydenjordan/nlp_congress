 Madam Speaker, I have breaking news: The  pandemic has ended. It seems that everyone knows the pandemic is over,  except the White House.   Despite the fact that the President said in an interview last  September on ``60 Minutes'' the pandemic has ended,  [[Page H520]]  the public health emergency has been extended again for the twelfth  time.   Madam Speaker, it is past time to end this blatant Federal overreach,  and that is exactly what we are going to do. This week, House  Republicans will vote to repeal the public health emergency, stop the  forced vaccination of our healthcare workers, and finally get Federal  workers back to their offices to serve the American people.   It is time to restore individual liberty to the American people so  the American people, not the Federal Government, can make the best  decisions for themselves and their families.                            ____________________
