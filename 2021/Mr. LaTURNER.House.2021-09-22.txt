 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Women's  Health Protection Act, or more accurately, the abortion on demand until  birth act.   This legislation imposes on-demand abortion until birth, meaning  anyone can have an abortion for any reason up until the day the baby is  born. Republicans, and as hard as it is to believe now, at one point  even some Democrats, have been fighting for pro-life protections for  decades. This bill removes nearly all protections for the unborn at the  State and Federal level and allows babies to be aborted just based on  the baby's sex, race, and disability.   Since day one of the Biden administration, Democrats have made it  their goal to push a radical pro-choice agenda, and this bill is no  exception.   For months, Democrats have been encouraging taxpayer-funded abortions  in the United States and even going as far as limiting healthcare  access to babies that survive abortions.   My colleagues and I standing up here tonight are not the only ones  who agree that this bill is wrong for our country. The Democrats'  radical agenda is extremely out of touch with the majority of Kansans  in my district. In fact, over 80 percent of Americans agree that  abortion should be illegal in the third trimester. I am proud to be a  member of the Pro-Life Caucus where we are pushing back to help ensure  every baby is protected under the law and to be a voice for the  millions of pro-life Americans who will not rest until the sanctity of  life is protected.   As my Democrat colleagues continue to advance their radical and  immoral pro-choice agenda, my constituents can be assured that I will  always unapologetically defend the most vulnerable among us, the  unborn. And may God help us all in this effort.
