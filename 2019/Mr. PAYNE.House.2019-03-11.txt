 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Bard High  School Early College science faculty for their work to advance science,  technology, engineering, and math programs for their students.   Earlier this year, one of their teachers, Maria Agapito, was only 1  of 35 science teachers in the country who was selected by the Society  for Science and the Public to receive a $1,000 grant.   Ms. Agapito and other science teachers will be using this grant to  create a multiyear science program for student research. They will be  able to use the funds to help buy equipment and materials, and for  student projects.   Science teachers at Bard and public schools across the country are  doing great things to help their students prepare for an increasingly  technological future.   I am proud to represent such bright students and passionate  educators.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of America's teachers in this country and  wish them continued success.                            ____________________
