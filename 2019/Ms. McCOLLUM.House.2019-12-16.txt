 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order at any time without intervention of any point of order to  consider in the House the bill (H.R. 5430); that the bill be considered  as read; that the bill be debatable for 2 hours equally divided and  controlled by the majority leader and the minority leader or their  respective designees; and that, pursuant to section 151 of the Trade  Act of 1974, the previous question be considered as ordered on the bill  to final passage without intervening motion.
