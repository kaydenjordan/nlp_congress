 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Rodgers and Chairman  Pallone for their leadership on this bill.   I, once again, rise in support of H.R. 1629, the Fairness in Orphan  Drug Exclusivity Act.   This crucial legislation would close a current loophole that is used  to block competition in the pharmaceutical marketplace.   The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 provided incentives for prescription drug  manufacturers to develop products to treat rare diseases. This includes  an exclusive 7-year marketing right for therapies that receive an  orphan drug designation.   For a drug to qualify, it must either be a treatment for a disease or  condition that affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States  or a drug intended for diseases that there is no reasonable expectation  to recoup research and development costs.   It would require all drug manufacturers who obtain orphan drug status  to prove that they have no reasonable expectation that they will  recover R&D costs.   This legislation works to prevent companies from continuing to use  orphan drug exclusivity status for a newly approved drug with an  identical ingredient to the former version without having to prove the  inability to recoup costs.   This exact circumstance, as the chairman described, happened when a  manufacturer of a buprenorphine product tweaked an older product that  had received orphan drug status and subsequently was given a renewed  orphan drug exclusivity.   Buprenorphine is used as a treatment for opioid use disorder to help  those recovering from addiction. Unfortunately, at the time, the opioid  epidemic was raging, as it is today, and was by no means a rare  disease. And the drug was by no means a market loser. It was a  moneymaker.   Closing this loophole would ensure that products do not receive an  unfair market advantage and will get more affordable drugs to patients.  It ensures consistency with the spirit and intent of the Orphan Drug  Act.   Know that we want to encourage and support the development of rare  disease treatments and therapeutics. It is critically important. But we  cannot allow this important incentive to be co-opted to allow for  unfair market competition for drugs that are not a commercial loss.   This bill was supported unanimously last Congress and has broad  support among patient advocates. This bill is about ensuring market  competition, reducing barriers to the development of new treatments,  and, ultimately, supporting patients.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 16 patient  advocacy organizations in support of this legislation.                                                     March 9, 2021.      Re H.R. 1629--The Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act.       Hon. Madeleine Dean,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Marc Veasey,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Dean and Veasey:        Thank you for your leadership on the reintroduction of H.R.       1629, The Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act. Our nation       is in crisis. Each day, 130 Americans die from an opioid       overdose, and according to recent provisional data from the       Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between June 2019       and May 2020, the number of people who died of an opioid       overdose increased by 38.4%.        We have a responsibility to ensure that all treatment       options are made available to those living with opioid use       disorder OUD). Last year, this important legislation was       approved by the House of Representatives unanimously.       Unfortunately, the Senate was unable to also act on the       measure before the 116th Congress adjourned. The new Congress       now has an opportunity to pass this legislation swiftly and       improve access to life-saving medication assisted treatments       and prevent more lives from being lost. We, the undersigned       organizations, support H.R. 1629 and urge quick passage of       this important bill that will help ensure the availability of       vital treatment options for OUD that can save American lives.        The Orphan Drug Act, enacted in 1983, allows the Food and       Drug Administration (FDA) to grant manufacturers Orphan Drug       Designation (ODD) and Orphan Drug Exclusivity (ODE) to a       product developed to treat rare diseases and conditions       affecting less than 200,000 patients. In addition, a       manufacturer also can qualify for ODD and ODE if more than       200,000 patients are affected, but there is ``no reasonable       expectation'' of recovering development costs. Few know about  [[Page H2563]]       this option, and as a result it is exceedingly rare with only       three uses to date.        In such cases, if a newly approved product has the same       active ingredient as a previous product that received orphan       designation and exclusivity because the FDA determined the       original drug could not recoup its development costs, the       newly approved product does not have to demonstrate the       inability to recoup its development costs. It does not matter       how much time has passed, or how much money the newly       approved drug is predicted to make. This loophole creates the       potential for abuses within the system, and it is not       consistent with intent of the Orphan Drug Act.        Enacting H.R. 1629 will: fix this loophole in a narrow and       targeted manner to prevent this abuse of the Orphan Drug Act;       preserve incentives for development of products treating rare       diseases and conditions; and ensure new treatment options       come to market to treat OUD.        During this public health emergency, we need all the tools       we can muster to fight this crisis. We should not tie one       hand behind our back as the exploitation of this loophole       would do.        More than 2.1 million Americans live with OUD, making this       disease far from rare. This disease is a national public       health emergency, and we need to close this loophole to       ensure that all safe and effective treatments are available       to fight this disease. Thank you again for your leadership on       this issue, and we look forward to working with you to help       pass H.R. 1629.            Sincerely,          Advocates for Opioid Recovery, AIDS United, Aimed             Alliance, Daniel's story, Center for U.S. Policy,             Cover2 Resources, FORCE, Healthy Women, Maryland Heroin             Awareness, Mother's Addiction Journey, No More OD's,             Inc., NOPE Task Force, Prevention Action Alliance,             Shatterproof, Tyler's Light, Young People in Recovery.     Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the Statement of  Administration Policy issued by the Office of Management and Budget on  May 17 of this year in support of this bill.                     Statement of Administration Policy      H.R. 1629--Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act--Rep. Dean, D-                     Pennsylvania, and two cosponsors         The Administration supports House passage of H.R. 1629, the       Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act. Orphan drug status       is intended to encourage companies to develop promising drugs       for rare diseases. Current law provides market exclusivity       for drugs that treat any disease or condition which (A)       affects fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States, or       (B) affects more than 200,000 in the United States and for       which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of       developing and making available in the United States a drug       for such disease or condition will be recovered from that       drug's sales in the United States. H.R. 1629 affects only       drugs that qualify under the latter provision. Current law       allows market exclusivity to be extended for a new version of       the same drug without the drug developer having to show a       lack of profitability for that new version as well. This       legislation would close that loophole, requiring all drugs       that obtain seven years of market exclusivity for conditions       affecting 200,000 or more people to illustrate that they have       no reasonable expectation of recovering R&D costs through       U.S. sales.        The Administration applauds these steps to ensure Americans       have access to high quality, affordable treatments.    Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone for his support on  this bill, and I urge all members to support its passage.
