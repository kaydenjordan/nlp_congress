 Mr. President, I appreciate the candor of my colleague  from Pennsylvania and the work that we do jointly on the Committee on  Housing and Urban Affairs.   I ask unanimous consent to finish if I go a bit over and if my  remarks continue into the next section or, potentially, the vote.   Have I said that right, Mr. President?    I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting a dedicated  and talented public servant and great Ohioan, my Congresswoman for the  last 12 years, Marcia Fudge, to be our next Secretary of Housing and  Urban Development. The Presiding Officer served with her in the House  of Representatives and appreciates her.   I can think no one better to lead us out of this pandemic and create  strong communities for the future than Marcia Fudge. When she came  before the Banking and Housing Committee, Congresswoman Fudge's  knowledge and passion for service and her commitment to the people who  make this country work were obvious to all of us, Republicans and  Democrats alike.   After a year when Black Americans endured so many painful reminders  of the yawning gap between the promise of our founding ideals and our  failure to make that promise real for everyone, it is meaningful that  our committee's first nomination hearing featured two African-American  women who will take leading roles in our economic recovery, Marcia  Fudge and Dr. Cecilia Rouse, who has been confirmed already to be Chair  of the National Economic Council at the White House. The Senate  confirmed Dr. Rouse with broad bipartisan support this month.   It matters on so many levels. It is important for our future that  little girls, including Black and Brown girls, see themselves in our  leaders, from the Vice President to Marcia Fudge, to Cecilia Rouse, to  so many people in this Cabinet, including the new Secretary of the  Interior from the Presiding Officer's area of the country. It matters  because of perspectives and life experience these two Black women bring  to these jobs.   Congresswoman Fudge will lead an Agency that supports families and  communities, provides housing and safety to people experiencing  homelessness, and it helps communities rebuild.   Today, HUD is grappling with a housing market where millions of  families find it harder and harder to afford a decent home. New data  out this week confirms that home prices are soaring around the country  even while millions are out of work. Imagine that. The cost of housing  is up, but wages are flat. So many workers have trouble making rent  every month, with the kind of stress that brings and too often having  to turn to predatory loans. The dream of home ownership is increasingly  out of reach for too many families in New Mexico and too many families  in Ohio.   None of this started with COVID-19. The affordable housing crisis is  the product of decades of conscious policy decisions by Wall Street,  corporations, and too often by government. This pandemic has exposed  what millions of families in this country already knew: that for far  too many people, a hard day's work doesn't pay the bills.   Before the United States ever had its first case of COVID-19, one- quarter--listen to this--one-quarter of all renters of this country  spent more than half their income on housing, on rent. If one thing  happened in their life--their car broke down, their child got sick,  they had a workplace injury that caused them to miss work for a week-- any of those things and their life turns upside down. HUD should play  an essential role in fixing that.    We know that the Black home ownership rate was nearly as low as it  was in 1968 when Senator Romney's father became Secretary of HUD and  the work he tried to do in opening housing in 1969. We have made little  or almost no progress in the Black home ownership rate. I am confident  that soon-to-be Secretary Fudge will change that. She understands the  importance of expanding opportunity to every ZIP Code, allowing more  families to have the peace of mind that brings.   Here is what I know about ZIP Codes. I am in Congresswoman Fudge's  district. My wife and I live in ZIP Code 44105 in Cleveland. That ZIP  Code, in 2007, the first half of that year, had more foreclosures than  any city in the United States of America. I still see the residue, the  remains of what has happened because of all those foreclosures.   Congresswoman Fudge will work to protect our kids from the lead  poisoning that is still all too common in ZIP Code 44105, to restore  the promise of fair housing, and to give communities the help and the  resources they need to thrive.   She brings to the job critical experience, as Senator Toomey said,  serving as a mayor in the industrial heartland for the kind of  community that is either overlooked or outright preyed upon by Wall  Street and big investors.   Even though Senator Toomey said that Congresswoman Fudge doesn't have  the experience in housing, I know up close--I was the Senator during  her entire time in the House. I represented her in the Senate. We live  in the same community. We worked on many of the same projects. She was  helpful on a number of housing issues that I worked on in the Banking,  Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee. She understands our communities.   She will lift up the voices of all the people left out of our housing  policy, people who work hard to try to keep a roof over their family's  head, whose hard work never pays off like it should; people who are  just trying to make rent or pay the mortgage every month who just don't  feel like they can keep up. Their wages are flat. Costs go up. Pressure  builds on them.   Congresswoman Fudge has the expertise and tenacity to fight back.  That is why I ask my colleagues to confirm her for Secretary of Housing  and Urban Development.  [[Page S1444]]                            American Rescue Plan Act of 2021    Mr. President, in so many ways, we know here that government is  really about whose side you are on, whom you fight for, what you fight  against. We know we passed--Senator Cardin is here. He came to the  Senate the same day I did, and we served in the House together. We both  recognized what a big deal it was to pass that bill last Saturday. That  is the biggest thing I have ever done in my career, and I heard other  Senators say the same thing--shots in people's arms, money in people's  pockets, kids back in school and workers in jobs.   But I think it is also important, just for a moment--I will be brief.  This is a chart of the difference--the biggest issue that Senate  Republicans and President Trump worked on in this Congress was the GOP  tax bill, the tax bill in 2017. Senator Cardin and I are on the same  committee that fought against some of the overreach from Wall Street  greed in that bill.   The purple, the blue is what our bill does. Just glance at this for a  moment. The 20 percent lowest earners, we are increasing--we are  increasing their after-tax revenue by 20 percent, essentially a 20- percent raise for people making $20,000 or $30,000 a year. There was no  help in the Trump tax bill for that.    Then you work up to the second lowest 20 percent, to the people who  are modest, working-class families, not quite middle class. They get a  big bump in their incomes from our bill. Under the Trump plan, they got  pennies.   Then you work your way up here to, essentially, the top 1 percent.  All of the money went to them, essentially, overwhelmingly.   When you think about what we do with taxes and when you think about  what this Congress did on Saturday when we put shots in people's arms  and money in people's pockets and kids back in school, one of the most  important things we did was to give working-class kids in Denver and in  Santa Fe and in Albuquerque and in Baltimore and Salisbury, MD, and in  Mansfield and Cleveland, OH--working-class people and poor kids--a  chance, a shot, at the American dream.   This is the biggest thing. Senator Tester and I came to the Senate on  the same day. This is the biggest thing we have done in years. It will  matter in people's lives. It is something to celebrate. More  importantly, it is something we need to carry out and make sure that it  matters in our constituents' lives.
