 Madam President, today I wish to recognize and honor  Esther Cody Splitt, on the occasion of her 100th birthday.   Her incredible life of ``firsts'' and extraordinary service to her  community and country began with her birth in the historic year of  1919, the year women earned the right to vote. With encouragement from  her smart and strong-willed Irish mother, Cody grew up in Wausau during  the Great Depression, when money for entertainment was nonexistent.  Instead of sending Cody to the movies, she told her to go to the county  courthouse and watch the lawyers for free. ``Enchanted'' by what she  saw, Cody returned home and told her mother she had decided to become a  lawyer. Her mother supported  [[Page S5661]]  her dreams and told her there was ``no reason she could not be a wife,  mother and a lawyer, just as a man is a husband, father and lawyer.''  That prescient inspiration became reality when Cody graduated from the  University of Wisconsin Law School, one of only five women in the class  of 1949.   Before attending law school, Cody already had a successful career as  one of the first women to serve in the U.S. Navy. She said the day she  was admitted to the WAVES--Women Accepted for Volunteer Services--was  the turning point of her life. Fascinated by politics, Cody was  disappointed to learn she was assigned to Wright Patterson Air Force  Base in Ohio. She said to the assigning officer, ``That's lovely, but I  really would like to go to Washington, D.C. What do you suppose?'' She  was granted assignment to a naval intelligence unit in Washington, DC,  where she worked on cracking the Japanese code during World War II. She  was quickly promoted to lead her fellow WAVES in Washington, a post  where she oversaw the careers and well-being of 200 women. At the end  of the war, Cody heard the GI bill would pay for her tuition to law  school, a fact she confirmed by going to the Library of Congress and  reading the entire bill.   Cody married her husband, Harley, also a UW law student, and moved to  Appleton after graduation to open the second woman-owned law firm in  Outagamie County. It was not easy for even a highly skilled female  attorney to attract clients in the 1940s. In fact, her first client  walked out of her office upon learning ``Cody Splitt'' was a woman. The  scarcity of a client base forced her to close her practice after a  year. Undaunted, Cody dedicated herself to her community, serving as a  supervisor on the Outagamie County Board, president of the Outagamie  County Bar Association, and a member of the American Association of  University Women, the Fox Valley Human Rights Council, and the Alliance  for the Mentally Ill. She also held various leadership roles in the  Republican Party. She built a thriving law practice from which she  retired at the age of 75.   Cody has received many well-deserved accolades for her work,  including a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Wisconsin Law Journal  and a Woman of the Year Award from the National Organization for Women.  Her legacy will live on for decades to come through her scholarship and  other charitable funds with the Appleton Community Foundation.   I am privileged to acknowledge the life and work of Cody Splitt, and  on the occasion of her 100th birthday, I wish her good health and  happiness for many years to come.                            ____________________
