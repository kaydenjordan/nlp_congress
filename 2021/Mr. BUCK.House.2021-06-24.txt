 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank the gentleman for his leadership on this important issue. I think  it is something that America needs to talk about, and I am glad we are  talking about it on the floor of the people's House.   During the COVID shutdowns, more than 600,000 businesses shut their  doors. This is 200,000 more businesses than typically close in a year  due to natural market influences.   Unsurprisingly, many of these most severe lockdowns across the  country were implemented by liberal Governors who caved to  fearmongering and hostility to former President Trump.   To be clear, I recognize the dangers posed by this virus. However,  reactionary and overreaching shutdowns significantly worsened the  impacts of COVID on our Nation.   One of the most glaring examples of these negative impacts has been  on our children who missed a year or more of in-person education  because their schools were closed.   The resilience and creativity of many teachers to adjust to these  tragic circumstances are admirable. However, the reality is that these  closures resulted in deteriorating mental health among students and  less effective educational environments for children across America.   Importantly, these shutdowns disproportionately affected children  with disabilities, minority students, and students facing economic  hardships.   America is beyond ready to reopen. Today, more than half of Americans  have been vaccinated, and broad mask  [[Page H3124]]  mandates are clearly no longer necessary for most communities. The  science overwhelmingly demands that the restrictions continuing to  burden our communities be lifted, and efforts by liberal politicians to  extend these mandates only serve to reveal their ideological  motivations.   I urge our national, State, and local officials to follow the  science, unshackle our economy from these burdensome and unnecessary  restrictions, and reopen our country.
