 Mr. President, I join with the vice chairman of the  Appropriations Committee, Senator Shelby, in honoring Joanna Capps on  her retirement on January 21, 2022, after more than 33 years of  distinguished service to the Congress. Joanna, better known as Jodi,  has supported the annual appropriations process throughout her career.  Republican and Democratic staff of both Chambers hold Jodi in high  esteem for her deep expertise of appropriations law and budget process  and for her steady, even-keeled collegiality.   Jodi came to Capitol Hill in 1989, joining the staff of the Senate  Appropriations Committee. For 4 years she worked as a professional  staff member of the full committee, productively and reliably working  for lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to support the orderly  development of appropriation bills by coordinating the compilation and  presentation of scoring data across all subcommittees. During her time  at the committee, Jodi gained invaluable expertise and insight into the  highly detailed and fast-paced nature of appropriations-related work,  as well as the myriad budget-related rules and procedures that govern  Senate consideration of those bills.   In 1994, Jodi transitioned to a new role within the Congressional  Budget Office's Budget Analysis Division, where she has worked as a  scorekeeper for the past 28 years. In that capacity, she has been a  valuable asset to eight CBO Directors. Initially tasked with scoring  the Energy-Water and Interior appropriation bills, Jodi served as the  primary or backup scorekeeper for multiple bills, expanding her  substantive expertise and institutional knowledge along the way. For  the past several years, she has handled both the vast Labor, Health and  Human Services, and Education bill and the legislative branch bill,  coordinating CBO's analyses of the President's budget request for those  bills and compiling scores for countless versions at each stage of  Congressional consideration. She also supported the production of  baseline projections, cost estimates for authorizing legislation, CBO's  annual report on Expired and Expiring Authorizations of Appropriations,  and other vital efforts related to the Budget Analysis Division  functions.   Throughout her congressional career, Jodi nurtured strong,  collaborative relationships that enabled her to act as a trusted and  effective liaison between appropriations staff and CBO analysts. Staff  of the Senate Appropriations Committee value her candor and ability to  juggle multiple requests with a calm, steady demeanor. Within CBO, Jodi  is regarded as a generous and amiable team player who goes out of her  way to support colleagues, both professionally and personally.   Jodi is also known for her many creative talents and her civic- mindedness. From setting out trays of homemade scones for CBO  colleagues to enjoy with their morning coffee to leading lunch-time  tutorials on how to create a floral centerpiece, Jodi has an eye for  elegance and enjoys sharing her gifts. She is a committed volunteer who  makes time to support causes that benefit her community and boost  people's spirits. But perhaps above all, Jodi is famously known as an  avid animal lover, a passion she shares with her husband of many years,  Alan.   Jodi's expertise, institutional knowledge, and generous spirit will  be sorely missed throughout Capitol Hill. We are grateful for her 33  years of exemplary service to the Congress and wish her the best in the  years to come.                            ____________________
