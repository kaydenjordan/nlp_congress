 Mr. Chairman, as co-chair of the Endangered Species  Caucus, I rise today in strong opposition to amendment No. 55 of the  National Defense Authorization Act offered by Mr. Biggs of Arizona.   We are facing a biodiversity crisis in America and around the world.  We should be discussing how better to protect our Nation's wildlife  instead of these unconscionable, extreme, MAGA Republican attack on  efforts to protect our endangered species.   As my friend Mr. Huffman said, this is one of the most successful  bills in American history, and this is an absolutely baseless attack on  the Endangered Species Act that the Department of Defense has not asked  for. No colonels, no generals, no admirals, no captains have said that  they have trouble fulfilling their mission because of the Endangered  Species Act.    The Department of Defense already has a strong natural resources  program. They work very closely with the Fish and Wildlife Service, and  they have been part of delisting many of the species earlier listed,  including, most importantly, the American bald eagle.   In the midst of a biodiversity crisis, we need an ESA that remains  strong. We need all Federal agencies, especially the Department of  Defense, to continue to collaborate with each other to protect our  endangered wildlife.   Actions to protect these species do not hinder our national security.  Managing endangered species in balance with their mission is something  that the Department of Defense already does very well.   By the way, the Goldwater Range is actually managed not by the  Endangered Species Act but by the Department of Defense's own resource  management plan.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject this unwanted,  unnecessary, and destructive amendment.
