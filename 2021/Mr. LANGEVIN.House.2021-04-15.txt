 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Shawn Friedkin, a  passionate advocate for people with disabilities, whose life was cut  short after a courageous battle with cancer. John Friedkin was my  friend, and we were kindred spirits.   At the age of 27, Shawn was in a car accident that left him  paralyzed. Instead of allowing that experience to defeat him, he used  it to help others overcome their own obstacles and reach their full  potential.   In 1997, he founded Stand Among Friends, a nonprofit dedicated to  improving the quality of life for people with spinal cord injuries, and  more broadly, improving employment outcomes so that people with  disabilities can live ``life without limits.'' That was Shawn's  philosophy, ``a life without limits,'' and he applied it to everything  he did.   Whether providing assistance through Stand Among Friends,  establishing a disability resource center at Florida Atlantic  University, or advocating for legislation in Congress, Shawn  demonstrated his unwavering commitment to improving the quality of life  for individuals with disabilities everywhere.   Mr. Speaker, I was proud to call Shawn a friend. Although his life  was cut far too short, his legacy will live on through his work and his  loving family.                            ____________________
