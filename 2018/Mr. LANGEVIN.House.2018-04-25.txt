 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Autism  Awareness Month.   Right now, the CDC estimates that 1 in 68 children has been  identified with autism spectrum disorder, but a recent parent survey  indicated that as many as 1 in 45 children may be affected.   As a proud uncle of a young man with autism, I understand the  challenges that families across the country are facing and the need for  more resources to support this in this area. But I am also aware of the  positive opportunities that we can create by working together to build  a better future for our loved ones with autism and the families that  care for them.   Mr. Speaker, I have been a proud participant in the Rhode Island  Autism Project's annual Imagine Walk, which highlights the importance  of research, screening, interventions, and education for the entire  Ocean State community and also helps to raise resources.   I look forward to continuing my work in Congress to support the  Autism Project and other great organizations that help foster a more  tolerant, inclusive society.                            ____________________
