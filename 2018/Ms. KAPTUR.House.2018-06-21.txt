 Mr. Speaker, yesterday's Detroit Free Press reported that  two babies were taken by the Department of Homeland Security from their  parents at the U.S.-Mexico border and flown in the dead of night last  night to Grand Rapids, Michigan--one child is 8 months old, and another  11 months old--hundreds and hundreds of miles from home.   Fifty more immigrant children have landed in foster care by  spontaneous combustion in western Michigan. A staffer at Bethany  Christian Services, which is assisting these displaced children said:  ``Not only are they being separated from their family, they are being  transported to a place that they don't know in the middle of the  night.''   Mr. Speaker, taking children from parents presents a deep moral  crisis for our Nation. The abduction of children from their parents is  a crime against humanity. The Trump administration's kidnapping of  children must end.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this important article from the  Detroit Free Press entitled ``Torn from Immigrant Parents, 8-Month-Old  Baby Lands in Michigan.''                  [From Detroit Free Press, June 20, 2018]      Torn From Immigrant Parents, 8-Month-Old Baby Lands in Michigan                             (By Tresa Baldas)         Four days ago, a Homeland Security official proclaimed:       ``We are not separating babies from parents.''        Yet in the middle of the night, two baby boys arrived in       Grand Rapids after being separated from their immigrant       parents at the southern border weeks ago.        One child is 8 months old; the other is 11 months old. Both       children have become part of a bigger group of 50 immigrant       children who have landed in foster care in western Michigan       under the Trump administration's zero-tolerance border       policy.        The average age of these children is 8, a number that has       alarmed foster care employees who are struggling to comfort       the growing group of kids who are turning up in Michigan at       nighttime, when it's pitch-dark outside. They're younger than       ever, they say. And they are petrified.        ``These kids are arriving between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m. Not       only are they being separated from their family, they are       being transported to a place that they don't know in the       middle of the night,'' said Hannah Mills, program supervisor       for the transitional foster care program at Bethany Christian       Services, which is currently assisting the displaced       children. ``We have found on many occasions that no one has       explained to these children where they are going.''        According to Mills, some of these displaced children got       picked up right at the airport by a foster family, while       others wound up at a foster care center, begging to talk to       their parents. Many have gone 30 days or more without talking       to their parents because their parents can't be located, she       said.        Bianey Reyes, center, and others protest the separation of       children from their parents in front of the El Paso       Processing Center, an immigration detention facility, at the       Mexican border on June 19, 2018, in El Paso, Texas. (Photo:       Joe Raedle, Getty Images)        ``These kids are hysterical. They're screaming out for mom       and dad,'' said Mills, who speaks Spanish and can converse       with the children, noting only a handful have learned some       English.        Mills, who has worked with displaced, immigrant children       for six years, said the foster agency is dealing with a new,       troubling element: Getting unaccompanied children on the       phone with their parents. Typically, this takes about three       days, she said. But now it's taking up to a month or more       because the parents are detained and the agency can't locate       them.        ``That's probably one of the most detrimental things,''       Mills said. ``At least if we can get a kid to speak with       their parent, they can feel safe.''        Equally upsetting, Mills said, is watching children when       they do finally get on the phone with a parent. For example,       she recalled, a tearful 7-year-old on the phone with her       mother asking her, `Are you OK? Are you hurt? Is someone       hurting you?'        ``All of it is incredibly upsetting,'' Mills said,       stressing: ``The difference is, we're seeing so many more       younger kids.''        Homeland Security officials were not available for comment       on why infants and toddlers are being taken from their       parents.        Meanwhile, the Trump administration has steadfastly       maintained that its goal is to protect the nation's borders,       enforce immigration laws and send a strong message to  [[Page H5489]]       immigrants that if they cross the border unlawfully, they       will be prosecuted and their kids taken away.        There is no federal law that mandates children and parents       be separated at the border, though the practice has led to       nearly 2,000 kids being misplaced in the past six weeks--a       phenomenon that has triggered a firestorm of controversy.       Many religious groups, social activists and immigrant-      sympathizers are calling for an end to the practice while       Trump supporters are saying let him do his job.        On Tuesday, the Michigan Department of Civil Rights       announced that it's assessing the impact of Trump's zero-      tolerance policy on the state of Michigan and the detained       immigrant children, stating it ``has a duty to make sure       their civil rights are protected.''        ``We have received reports and are very concerned that the       children arriving here are much younger than those who have       been transported here in the past. Some of the children are       infants as young as 3 months of age and are completely unable       to advocate for themselves,'' Agustin V. Arbulu, Executive       Director of Michigan Department of Civil Rights said in a       statement.        The American Association for Justice also condemned the       family separation policy on Tuesday, stating: ``These actions       are risking the safety and well-being of innocent children.       We call on the administration to immediately halt this       practice and to reunite these traumatized families. This is       not who we are as a nation. We can and must do better.''        But the Trump administration is not backing down, stressing       the policy is about preserving and protecting America's       borders and upholding the law. Moreover, it insists, the       policy is not new, claiming children have long been placed in       foster care when their parents were criminally charged with       an immigration violation.        ``What has changed is that we no longer exempt entire       classes of people who break the law,'' Homeland Security       Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a White House briefing       Monday. ``Here is the bottom line: DHS is no longer ignoring       the law.''        She later added: ``We are a country of compassion. We are a       country of heart. . . . We must fix the system so that those       who truly need asylum can in fact receive it.''        President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans       desperately searched Tuesday for an end game to the       administration's contentious zero-tolerance immigration       policy that has drawn fire from lawmakers on both sides of       the aisle.        Trump said Tuesday he wants the legal authority to detain       the children along with the adults and ``promptly remove       families together as a unit.''     Mr. Speaker, I remind my colleagues of the words at the  base of the Statue of Liberty by Emma Lazarus:       Give me your tired, your poor,      Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,      The wretched refuge of your teeming shore.      Send these, the homeless tempest-tost to me,      I lift my lamp besides the golden door.    That is the America that I know. That is the America of liberty for  all.                              The New Colossus                             (By Emma Lazarus)       Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,      With conquering limbs astride from land to land;      Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand      A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame      Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name      Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand      Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command      The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.      ``Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!'' cries she      With silent lips. ``Give me your tired, your poor,      Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,      The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.      Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,      I lift my lamp beside the golden door!''                            ____________________
