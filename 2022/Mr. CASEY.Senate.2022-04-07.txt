 Mr. President, I just want to make some comments regarding  what the junior Senator from Missouri was just talking about on the  floor, and I know that my colleague from Hawaii was providing  commentary as well.   It is hard to comprehend how any Member of Congress, House or Senate,  could come to the floor and make the criticism of the Biden  administration regarding its Ukraine policy, especially with regard to  the military assistance provided by this administration, and that same  Senator, along with a long list of Republican Senators, voted against  all the money for Ukraine just a couple weeks ago, $13.6 billion.   But, unfortunately, it is entirely consistent with what those same 31  Senators have been doing for the last couple of weeks. They voted  against all the money in March, and then they criticize President  Biden. In fact, the day of President Zelenskyy's speech to the  Congress--that inspiring speech--that so many of us were moved by,  people in both parties, both Houses, all across the country, in fact,  across the world were moved by what he said and, frankly, challenged by  what he said.   We have to do more, even in my judgment, than the $13.6 billion. But  as the junior Senator from Missouri should know--I hope he knows this-- since the beginning of this administration, just on the military  assistance, we have provided $2.6 billion. So more than $2.5 billion  dollars just in military assistance, but the bulk of that is in that  spending bill that we passed a couple of weeks ago that has the $13.6  billion.   Here is what the Washington Post says, and I will read the headline  and the date, and then ask consent to enter it into the Record. Here is  the headline:         More than two dozen Senate Republicans demand Biden do more       for Ukraine after voting against $13.6 billion for Ukraine.    Mr. President, dated March 17, 2022, a story by Mariana Alfaro and  Eugene Scott, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in  the Record.    Here is the subheadline:         Thirty-one Senate Republicans voted last week against the       $1.5 trillion spending bill to fund the government, increase       U.S. defense spending and provide humanitarian and military       assistance to Ukraine. In recent days, many of them have       clamored for more weapons and aid.    And it goes on from there, and I am not going to read all of it,  obviously, but it chronicles the hypocrisy that we just heard here  today and that we have heard for days now and weeks now, criticizing  the President when they voted against all the money--so all the money  from the $13.6 billion that will go to pay for the Javelin missiles  that are taking out Russian tanks every day and have for weeks--every  penny of that out of the $13.6. You could probably cut it in half in  terms of what the military assistance will be.   So let's say, for sake of argument, probably half of that, $6 or $7  billion, but whatever the exact number is, that money is going to help  pay for a lot more Javelin missiles that have been so effective. The  Stinger systems that they have used, the antiaircraft systems, they are  all going to be paid for. The ammunition and the body armor and all of  the other assistance that we are providing is going to be made possible  because most of the Senate--50 Democrats and just 19 Republicans, but  we are grateful for their support--voted for the money.   So if you have a criticism about the administration's policy, you are  certainly entitled to criticize the administration, but I think you  lose your right to criticize the administration on military assistance  and what we are doing or not doing on military assistance when you just  voted against all the money--all the money. And yet they do it over and  over again, as if no one is watching.   Well, I think the American people get it, and I think they know the  difference between someone who can justifiably criticize any  administration on foreign policy or defense policy or anything else.  But I think you should admit on the record that you didn't vote for the  money. Don't throw sand in the eyes of the people. Admit on the record  that you didn't vote for the money, and then lodge your criticism. But,  of course, he didn't do that and so many who voted the wrong way.   Now, the Washington Post also notes in this article that, obviously,  it was a spending bill that will allow us to fund the government. We  could talk about that, whether you support funding the government. But  here is a point that was made in the article that I think a lot of  people may have missed: It is that this funding bill also paid for a  pay increase for our troops.   U.S. servicemembers got a pay increase in this bill, and yet you  would never know that by listening to some of the folks who voted the  wrong way on the bill. You would think that that wasn't part of this  legislation.   So I think a lot of Americans probably expect that when you are  making an argument against an administration, you have the right to do  that, but I think it would be a lot more truthful if you were clear  about where you voted on the biggest Ukraine spending measure in recent  history, likely not just the biggest ever for Ukraine but the biggest  ever for a lot of countries that we help.   So I hope that people across this Chamber and across the country will  make note of that contradiction, because when you voted against those  dollars for Ukraine, you were voting against not only the people of  Ukraine and their ability to fight this war and obviously the soldiers  in the field, but you were voting against that humanitarian support, as  well, that will provide food and medical care and so much else.   Now, I am in no way satisfied that we have done enough. We have got  to do a lot more. We have got to provide, in my judgment, a river, an  ever-rushing stream of weapons--as many weapons as it takes to defeat  Vladimir Putin.   So we are going to have more debates, and Senators will have more  opportunities to vote the right way when it comes to supporting the  people of Ukraine. But I think it would be better for the debate if  folks would mention how they voted, that they voted against the Ukraine  money, that they voted against the pay raise for the troops, and they  voted against a lot of other provisions.  [[Page S2073]]    But to come on to the Senate floor and to criticize the President on  military assistance, that is the height of hypocrisy.   I yield the floor.
