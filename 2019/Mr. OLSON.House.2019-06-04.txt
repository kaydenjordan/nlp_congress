 Mr. Speaker, a disaster is brewing in the people's House.  It is called H.R. 1384, the Medicare for All Act of 2019.   May 29, 1 week ago from today, the Fort Bend Chamber had a state of  healthcare event. During Q&A, Dr. Richard Ehlers, the head of the MD  Anderson Cancer Center, was asked about Medicare for All: ``Medicare  for All is the most expensive way to go, and it would be the most  expensive system to utilize. The underlying model for the rest of the  world is actually not universal healthcare but rationed medical care.''   He continued, ``Depending on the supply and the patient's age, it  could mean a 72-year-old man who needs a liver transplant is told he is  not eligible because of his age.''   That man, 72 years old, is given a death sentence by Medicare for  All, and that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
