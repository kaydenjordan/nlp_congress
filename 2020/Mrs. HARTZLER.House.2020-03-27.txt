 Mr. Speaker, we are at war against an unseen enemy our  world has never faced before. We are battling on two fronts: the  healthcare front and the economic front. Thousands of people are sick,  with courageous healthcare workers battling on the front lines.    Meanwhile, millions of Americans have lost their jobs because of the  virus, imperiling family budgets and devastating our economy.   Today's bill sends needed battle reinforcements to both fronts. It  provides funds to purchase more medical supplies and to support our  hospitals, while also sending much-needed help to businesses so that  they can make payroll and keep the doors open. It sends money directly  to almost every household and supports those who have lost their job  due to the COVID-19 crisis.   Most importantly, it gives this Nation hope: hope that we will get  through this by supporting our healthcare workers, enabling businesses  to stay open, and sending Americans funds needed to get them through.   While this bill is far from perfect and the price tag is sobering, I  believe we are in an unprecedented battle, and it is imperative we win  this war. I will be voting ``yes,'' and I invite all Americans to join  us in this battle.
