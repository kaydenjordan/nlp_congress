 Mr. Speaker, there are crossroads in the history of every  great nation so historically significant, so fraught with dramatic  consequences, that those in position to influence that nation's  direction are compelled to do all they can to ensure it does not fall  to the dustbin of history.                                time  1030    We have arrived at one of those moments. That is why, last week, my  colleagues and I demanded this majority end their secret impeachment  proceedings and bring them into the light of day.   Impeachment of the President of the United States is, next to the  declaration of war, this body's most solemn, important authority.  Impeachment begins the process of removing the duly-elected Executive  of the United States, who was chosen, not by this House, but by the  American people.   In the past, this body has always treated that authority with the  solemnity and respect that it demands. Certainly, during the Clinton  and Nixon impeachments, this House respected our obligation. In this  House, under this majority, no longer.   In the secretive, closed proceedings in the basement of the Capitol,  the majority party has monopolized all power, withheld pertinent facts,  denied the accused the right to participate, and offered the minority  party little more than token rights, all outside the public eye. The  American people, and even most elected Members of Congress, like  myself, have been able to glean only whatever lies, leaks, and  misinformation the majority disseminates.   During Watergate, this House specifically wrote in our rules that we  cannot shut out the public, absent extraordinary circumstances, and for  over 40 years our rules prohibited the exclusion of Members from  attending hearings on investigations. Yet, this majority has put an end  to those practices,  [[Page H8603]]  using secret depositions to get around the sunshine rules of this  House. Everything is carefully, reprehensibly designed to obscure  reality.   This is a watershed moment of monumental, historic significance. For  the sake of our constitutional Republic, we must start over and do it  the right way.   Unfortunately, today the Rules Committee will meet to mark up a  resolution that does absolutely nothing to change our dark course.   Don't listen to Democrat talking points. This resolution is political  cover disguised as good will. This is not a vote to authorize  impeachment but a vote to validate and continue the committee's  disgraceful, improperly-conducted proceedings.   This resolution permits the majority to continue holding proceedings  in secret whenever the majority arbitrarily decides to do so; and,  unlike previous impeachment proceedings, this majority's empty  assurance to offer the minority the right to issue subpoenas is a sham.  In fact, the minority is only authorized to issue subpoenas if Adam  Schiff and the Democrats on his committee agree with them, the exact  same situation the minority currently faces in all but name.   It gives the President no right of due process and, instead,  instructs the chair of the Rules Committee to determine, down the road,  what the procedures will be for participation of the President of the  United States and his counsel.   In the resolution presented by the majority, the President is given  no right to see evidence, present evidence, call witnesses, have  counsel present at all hearings and depositions, cross-examine  witnesses, make objections relating to the examination of witnesses or  the admissibility of testimony and evidence, or respond to evidence and  testimony.   How can President Trump defend himself if he cannot see the evidence  against him? Just as importantly, how can the American people make an  informed judgment?   Under this resolution, the House would deputize Adam Schiff and Jerry  Nadler, handpicked by Speaker Pelosi, to be prosecutor, judge, and  jury. The majority chooses what is seen and unseen by the American  people.   This is a Star Chamber proceeding reminiscent of some of the most  egregious practices of tin-pot dictators.   Political coups are often shrouded in patriotic overtones. Look past  the talking points and empty promises from Democrats. We must expose  what this resolution really does and the calamitous consequences for  due process and separation of powers it will unleash.   Silence in this matter is complicity. We must rally together to fight  back for the sake of the country we hold dear. The fate of our Nation  depends on it.                            ____________________
