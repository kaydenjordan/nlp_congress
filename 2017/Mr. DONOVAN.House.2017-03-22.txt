 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1238) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to make the  Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for Health Affairs responsible  for coordinating the efforts of the Department of Homeland Security  related to food, agriculture, and veterinary defense against terrorism,  and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1238         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Securing our Agriculture and       Food Act''.       SEC. 2.

Coordination of Department of Homeland Security efforts                related to food, agriculture, and veterinary defense                against terrorism.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 1238, the Securing our Agriculture  and Food Act, introduced by Congressman David Young of Iowa. This bill  seeks to authorize the Department of Homeland Security's food,  agriculture, and veterinary defense program within the Office of Health  Affairs.   Last year, the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and  Communications held a hearing to examine the potential devastating  impacts of an intentional attack on, or a natural disruption of, U.S.  agricultural or food production systems.   The food and agriculture sector is critically important to our  Nation's economy. U.S. food and agriculture accounts for roughly one- fifth of the Nation's economic activity, and contributed $835 billion  to the U.S. gross domestic product in 2014, and is responsible for 1  out of every 12 U.S. jobs.   Coming from Iowa and as a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee  on Agriculture, Congressman Young of Iowa knows all too well the  importance of protecting this sector, which is vital to the economy and  our way of life. I appreciate him introducing this bill of which I am  pleased to be an original cosponsor.   I thank Chairman Walden of the Energy and Commerce Committee and  Chairman Conaway of the Agriculture Committee for working with us to  advance this bill.   Mr. Speaker, we also look forward to working with our Senate  colleagues, who recently approved companion legislation without  amendment in the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Committee.   This bipartisan legislation passed the House last September by voice  vote, and I urge all Members to join me once again in supporting this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                     Washington, DC, March 16, 2017.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: I write in regard to H.R. 1238,       Securing our Agriculture and Food Act, which was referred in       addition to the Committee on Energy and Commerce. I wanted to       notify you that the Committee will forgo action on the bill       so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for       consideration.        The Committee on Energy and Commerce takes this action with       our mutual understanding that by foregoing consideration of       H.R. 1238, the Committee does not waive any jurisdiction over       the subject matter contained in this or similar legislation       and will be appropriately consulted and involved as this or       similar legislation moves forward to address any remaining       issues within the Committee's jurisdiction. The Committee       also reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation and asks that you support any       such request.        I would appreciate your response confirming this       understanding with respect to H.R. 1238 and ask that a copy       of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in your       committee's report on the legislation or the Congressional       Record during its consideration on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                     Washington, DC, March 16, 2017.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 1238, the ``Securing our Agriculture and Food Act.'' I       appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before       the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand       that the Committee on Energy and Commerce will forego       consideration of the bill.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration on this bill at       this time, the Committee on Energy and Commerce does not       waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in       this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition,       should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would       support a request by the Committee on Energy and Commerce for       conferees on those provisions within your jurisdiction.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the report or in       the Congressional Record during consideration of this bill on       the House floor. I thank you for your cooperation in this       matter.            Sincerely,      Michael T. McCaul.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Agriculture,                                     Washington, DC, March 10, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: Thank you for the opportunity to       review H.R. 1238, ``Securing our Agriculture and Food Act.''       As you are aware, the bill was primarily referred to the       Committee on Homeland Security, while the Agriculture       Committee received an additional referral.        I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House in an expeditious manner and,       accordingly, I agree to discharge H.R. 1238 from further       consideration by the Committee on Agriculture. I do so with       the understanding that by discharging the bill, the Committee       on Agriculture does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       on this or similar matters. Further, the Committee on       Agriculture reserves the right to seek the appointment of       conferees, if it should become necessary.        I ask that you insert a copy of our exchange of letters       into the Congressional Record during consideration of this       measure on the House floor.        Thank you for your courtesy in this matter and I look       forward to continued cooperation between our respective       committees.            Sincerely,                                                K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                     Washington, DC, March 10, 2017.      Hon. K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Conaway: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 1238, the ``Securing our Agriculture and Food Act.'' I       appreciate your support in bringing this legislation before       the House of Representatives, and accordingly, understand       that the Committee on Agriculture will forego consideration       of the bill.        The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration on this bill at       this time, the Committee on Agriculture does not  [[Page H2306]]       waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in       this bill or similar legislation in the future. In addition,       should a conference on this bill be necessary, I would       support a request by the Committee on Agriculture for       conferees on those provisions within your jurisdiction.        I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor.       I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul.     Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Young).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume, and I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1238.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1365) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require  certain acquisition innovation, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1365         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Homeland       Security Acquisition Innovation Act''.       SEC. 2. ACQUISITION INNOVATION.         (a) In General.--Title VII of the Homeland Security Act of       2002 (6 U.S.C. 341 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end       the following new section:       ``SEC. 710.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 709 the       following new item:  ``Sec. 710. Acquisition innovation.''.        (c) Information.--Not later than 90 days after the date on       which the Secretary of Homeland Security submits the annual       budget justification for the Department of Homeland Security       for each of fiscal years 2018 through 2022, the Secretary       shall, if appropriate, provide information to the Committee       on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of       the Senate on the activities undertaken in the previous       fiscal year in furtherance of section 710 of the Homeland       Security Act, as added by subsection (a) of this Act, on the       following:        (1) Emerging acquisition best practices that were tested       within the Department during such year.        (2) Efforts to distribute best practices and lessons       learned within the Department, including through web-based       seminars, training, and forums, during such year.        (3) Utilization by components throughout the Department of       best practices distributed by the Under Secretary of       Management pursuant to paragraph (3) of such section 710.        (4) Performance as measured by the metrics established       under paragraph (4) of such section 710.

(7) The criteria used to identify specific acquisition       programs or activities to be included in acquisition       innovation efforts and the outcomes of such programs or       activities.        (8) Recommendations, as necessary, to enhance acquisition       innovation in the Department.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1365, the Department of  Homeland Security Acquisition Innovation Act.   The bill allows DHS to designate a senior official to manage  acquisition innovation efforts; test, develop, and distribute  acquisition best practices throughout the Department; and establish  performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts.  Republican amendments at the committee markup strengthened the  underlying bill by encouraging DHS to obtain feedback from the private  sector and incorporate this feedback into future efforts.   As we have seen from numerous watchdog reports, the Federal  Government's acquisition and contracting process is broken, cumbersome,  and bureaucratic. DHS must continue to innovate to ensure the private  sector can best support our critical homeland security needs. The  Department has recently taken positive steps in using new contracting  tools and collaborating with industry. This legislation supports those  efforts and encourages their continued use.   I commend Oversight and Management Efficiency Subcommittee Ranking  Member Correa for all of his hard work on this legislation.   I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 1365, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.
