 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in 1793, in his annual address to Congress,  George Washington noted:         If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it;       if we desire to secure peace, one of the most powerful       instruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known that       we are at all times ready for war.    Or in the words of another President nearly 200 years later:         We maintain the peace through our strength; weakness only       invites aggression.    The United States has a well-deserved reputation for strength, and  aggressors think twice before tangling with the U.S. military. But  strength has to be maintained, and we have not done a good job, or  good-enough job, of that lately.   Five years ago, the bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission  released a report warning that our readiness had eroded to the point  where we might struggle to win a war against a major power like China.  While we have made some progress since then at rebuilding our  readiness, we are still a long way from where we need to be.   Recent U.S. war games envisioning a United States-China conflict  following an attack on Taiwan have had grim results, showing enormous  military and economic costs on both sides. One news story on these war  games noted:         And while the ultimate outcome in these exercises is not       always clear--the U.S. does better in some than others--the       cost is [clear]. In every exercise the U.S. uses up all its       long-range air-to-surface missiles in a few days, with a       substantial portion of its planes destroyed on the ground.    Let me just repeat that last line:         In every exercise the U.S. uses up all its long-range air-      to-surface missiles in a few days, with a substantial portion       of its planes destroyed on the ground.    I don't need to tell anyone that that is a profoundly concerning  position for us to be in. China is growing increasingly aggressive in  the Indo-Pacific and has also adopted an increasingly aggressive  posture toward the United States, and it is investing heavily in its  military.   If we want to deter China aggression, we have to ensure that our  military is strong enough to make China want to avoid challenging us.  We can't accomplish that if we would run out of key munitions in a few  days of combat.   While China has to be a major focus when it comes to our defense  policy, it is far from the only threat out there. Russia's war of  aggression in Ukraine is all the reminder that we need that Russia is  not a peaceful nation. North Korea launched two missiles just this  Monday. Iran continues to pursue its aggressive nuclear agenda,  threaten Israel, and attempt to seize ships in the Persian Gulf. And  the list goes on; which brings me to this year's National Defense  Authorization Act, which the Senate expects to wrap up this week.   I am pleased to report that this year's NDAA makes real progress on  the readiness front. It bolsters our security posture in the Indo- Pacific and deepens our ties with Taiwan. It rejects the President's  dangerous plan to shrink the U.S. Navy and authorizes investment in new  ships. It also contains multiple measures to increase our supply of  munitions, including the addition of six critical munitions to the  Pentagon's multiyear procurement program.   Two of these munitions--Tomahawk missiles and MK-48 torpedoes--play  an important role in our ability to deter China.   On the European front, the bill invests in Russia deterrence by  continuing support for Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression,  and it bolsters oversight to ensure U.S. funding is being used  appropriately.   The NDAA also holds NATO members accountable for investing in their  own defense by prioritizing our links with partners who meet the  commitment to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense.   This year's bill also ensures that our military keeps its focus on  defense and not divisive Democratic social initiatives by limiting so- called diversity, equity, and inclusion bureaucracy.   Above all, I am proud to report that this year's bill authorizes full  funding for the next steps of the B-21 mission--the Air Force's new  long-range strategic bomber which will revolutionize our long-range  strike capabilities and be hosted at South Dakota's own Ellsworth Air  Force Base.   I have said it before, and I will say it again: If we don't get  national security right, the rest is conversation. If there is one area  in which we can't fail, it is providing for the defense of our Nation.   This year's National Defense Authorization Act is not sufficient to  address all of our Nation's readiness issues, but it makes an important  down payment on boosting our preparedness. And I look forward to  supporting it later this week.   I hope that we will continue to have a robust amendment process so  that other important ideas can be considered and all Members have a  chance to make their voices heard. And I hope that Congress will  continue to make investing in our military a top priority.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
