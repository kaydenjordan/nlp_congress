 Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  unfortunate and dangerous amendment which is a propaganda win for the  Iranian regime and the Houthi allies. It takes legitimate options off  the table; shows America divided in the face of mounting Iranian  threats; and makes our Nation less safe.   We all agree that, under Article I of the Constitution, only Congress  possesses the authority to declare war. The administration's measured  response to Iran's shooting down of our U.S. military asset in  international airspace shows that the President is not looking for war  with Iran.   But this amendment goes much farther in prohibiting unauthorized war  with the number one state sponsor of terror. It uses the power of the  purse to preclude any use of force whatsoever against Iran unless it is  previously authorized by Congress or provoked by an attack on the  United States or our Armed Forces.                                time  2100    Think about what that means. What can our military do if Iran attacks  American civilians or our regional allies like Israel and Jordan or  strategic international shipping through the Straits of Hormuz?   Under this reckless amendment, the answer is: Absolutely nothing. The  U.S. military cannot fire a single shot until after the successful  completion of a bicameral legislation process that enacts a law  authorizing the use of force. All of us here today know how long that  could take.   This will tie our military's hands at a perilous time. We need Iran  and its terrorist proxies to think twice before they attack Americans,  our friends, or our interests.   This amendment is an unprecedented attempt to micromanage the powers  claimed by every Commander in Chief, Democrat and Republican, since the  War Powers Resolution was enacted over President Nixon's veto in 1973.  In fact, the effect of this misguided amendment is far more restrictive  than the War Powers Resolution itself.   This is absolutely not the time to play politics with our national  security. Iran's saber rattling and provocation is not going to go away  anytime soon.   I would like to quote from a July 8 letter from Acting Under  Secretary of Defense for Policy. He says:         The Department strongly opposes this amendment. If U.S.       citizens, diplomatic facilities in the region, or other       national interests are threatened or attacked, we must be       able to respond promptly and in an appropriate fashion.    And he says:         At a time when Iran is engaging in escalating military       provocations demonstrated most recently by the shooting down       of the U.S. unmanned aerial vehicle, it is attacking allied       shipping.    They shot a missile at our U.S. Embassy in Iraq. This amendment could  only embolden Iran to further provocations.   Bottom line, this amendment will give comfort to our enemy who has  the blood of Americans on their hands--from the Marine barracks bombing  to the Iraq war--and who continues to hold American hostages to this  day. This is a pro-Iran, pro-Houthi amendment.   I was in the White House when the President made his decision and  exercised restraint to not escalate this war, but this, I believe, is  an ill-proposed amendment.    Madam Chair, no one respects the Constitution more than I  do. We have Article I authorities.   There is a reason why the Founding Fathers put Article I first,  because that is the American people over the imperial presidency.   Why are we debating such an important issue, matters of war and  peace, which is what my committee argues day in and day out on the  Foreign Affairs Committee--well, first of all, it is part of the NDAA.  But why are we arguing this at 9:15 at night, in the darkness of night  and not the sunlight of day?   This is a dangerous amendment. It is a preemptive use of the AUMF.   We have not engaged in hostile forces, combat forces in Iran. We have  not engaged in hostilities. That is when the War Powers Resolution  kicks in, notification to the Congress, and then Congress debates the  Authorization for Use of Military Force.   I have been in this body for eight terms. That is how the process  works. You don't handcuff the President, the Commander in Chief. You  don't handcuff him in advance of any preparation for dealing with  state-sponsored terror.   This is just wrong.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment to repeal the 2002  law that authorizes the use of military force ``to defend the national  security of the United States against the continued threat posed by  Iraq.''   First of all, the repeal of any AUMF does not belong in this NDAA  bill. The Committee on Foreign Affairs has longstanding sole  jurisdiction over declarations of war and intervention abroad. Any  significant change to war-making authorities needs to be the result of  deliberations and votes by the committee of jurisdiction.   There is no issue more deserving of regular order than issues related  to war and peace.   Although none of us want to see the extension of any conflict beyond  what is necessary, we have also learned that premature disengagement  can have huge costs, such as when the prior administration's rush to  withdraw U.S. troops contributed to the deadly rise of ISIS in Iraq and  Syria.   While the Saddam Hussein regime was a key focus, it was not the sole  focus of the 2002 AUMF. It expressly identified al-Qaida and ``other  international terrorist organizations, including organizations that  threaten the lives and safety of the United States citizens.''   Members will recall that al-Qaida in Iraq later became ISIS, a brutal  transnational terrorist organization that continues to threaten  American lives and interests. President Obama cited the 2002 AUMF as  legal authority for his military operations against ISIS.   The current administration has stated its opposition to the repeal of  the 2002 AUMF because:         It remains an important source of additional authority for       military operations against ISIS in Iraq and to defend the       national security interests of the United States against       threats emanating from Iraq.   [[Page H5719]]     For those reasons, we shouldn't be repealing key counterterrorism  AUMFs unless and until we have replaced them with updated authorities  that clearly confront the enemies that continue to threaten our Nation,  our people, and our allies. To date, we have seen no such proposal from  the majority.   So for those reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in prioritizing  American security by opposing this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  2130     Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment. It simply lists complaints about the 2001 authorization for  the use of military force while avoiding the serious work of proposing  an improved replacement.   Most Members, including me, would say they would be fine with an  updated AUMF that better describes current threats. Unfortunately,  there is no consensus at all about what that should look like. The fact  that the majority has not put forward a single proposal in the 6 months  they have been in charge indicates to me that they have deep  disagreements.   The author of this amendment has also inserted an outright repeal of  the 2001 AUMF into this year's Defense appropriations bill, which would  make all counterterrorism operations globally illegal. That is reckless  because AUMF provides the necessary legal authority to confront ongoing  deadly threats against our homeland. It would also be simply  irresponsible and dangerous to repeal it until an adequate replacement  has passed both Chambers and been sent to the President's desk.   The gentlewoman from California, with all respect, has held a  principled, consistent position on this issue, and I do respect that. I  just disagree with it.   But it is incorrect to assert, as this amendment does, that the 2001  AUMF is a blank check for any President to wage war at any time and at  any place. The AUMF has been interpreted as covering al-Qaida, the  Taliban, and ``associated forces.'' And while that interpretation is  sometimes broad, it can't be stretched to cover just anything. For  example, it does not capture North Korea or countless other potential  adversaries and, arguably, Iran, as well.   The amendment also complains that the 2001 AUMF did not include  things like geographic limitations or a named enemy. But it is hard to  see how it could have done so while also meeting the grave  transnational terrorist threats it was intended to defeat. Because  these enemies aren't nation-states marching uniformed troops to face us  on the fields of battle, authorizing force to fight them is much more  complicated.   The amendment also wrongly implies that the will of Congress has been  thwarted by how long and how broadly the AUMF has been used. But  Congress has been kept aware of how it is being used, and has always  had the same power to legislate, amend, or repeal, as it had back in  2001. The fact is--and this goes on both sides of the aisle--it has not  done so. That indicates a decision that, under both Democrat and  Republican majorities and administrations, the 2001 AUMF is working.   For my years as Homeland Security chairman, I know that our  operations overseas, and the sacrifices of our service men and women,  have saved American lives and helped to protect the homeland from  countless thwarted attacks.    Unfortunately, the threat does continue. As the Director of National  Intelligence has testified, al-Qaida and ISIS maintain transnational  networks actively committed to our destruction. Don't get me wrong: I  would like to see an updated AUMF as well. That comes out of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs. We should deliberate an updated AUMF on  our committee. But this amendment contributes nothing towards that  outcome.   Until we have new authorities in place to combat the real and dynamic  threats to American lives and safety, we need to focus on responsibly  using the authorities we have, not just complaining about their  imperfections.   If the other side is serious about a fix, then let's work together on  a fix and provide a serious replacement to begin this process on a very  serious issue of counterterrorism and war and peace.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
