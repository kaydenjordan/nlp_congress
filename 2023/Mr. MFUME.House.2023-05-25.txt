 Madam Speaker, I say to the ladies and gentlemen all over  the country: Welcome to the United States Congress.   Only today, while we are facing a debt crisis, all of the Republicans  have left to go out of town. They have gotten into their cars and their  limos, and they are catching planes to go home while we are teetering  on the brink of disaster.   What kind of leadership is that, Kevin McCarthy?   We have heard the list. We know what the cuts are going to affect.  They are going to affect law enforcement, veterans' affairs, food  assistance, education, 401(k) retirement plans, pension plans, and cuts  to Social Security payments.   How can you leave town and not be here to deal with this?   All we need are five Republicans to sign this discharge petition, and  it goes away. It is over with.   Everybody else has left. So what you see here today are Members of  the Democratic Party making an American argument that we have a  responsibility to pay our debts.   They are gone. ``Beam me up, Scotty.'' There is no intelligent life  on that side of the aisle.                            ____________________
