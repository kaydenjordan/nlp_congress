 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise in support of this omnibus bill, in particular, the Commerce- Justice-Science title of the bill.   In commerce it makes smart investments that create good-paying  American jobs with economic growth. It supports American manufacturing.   In justice, it makes funding increases for the police, creating  better circumstances for public safety, for fighting crime, reducing  gang and gun violence and in hate crime prevention.   And in science, it provides robust support for things Americans are  proud of like NASA, the National Science Foundation, climate science  research.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the staff for a lot of hard work on this bill. I  thank Ranking Member Aderholt for working with me, and I urge support  for this package.
