 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today to condemn the senseless,  cowardly, and horrific terrorist attack in India, the deadliest in  three decades.   On February 14 of this year, a suicide bomber rammed an explosive- packed vehicle into a convoy, claiming the lives of 40 Indian  paramilitary forces and wounding at least 44 others. The Pakistan-based  militant group, Jaish-e-Muhammad, later claimed responsibility for the  attack.   We mourn the victims of this act of terror and call for continued  action against any nation, to include Pakistan, that harbors terrorists  and promotes violent extremism.   India has announced its plans to diplomatically isolate Pakistan and  cancel its preferential trade status. We support these efforts, Mr.  Speaker. This attack only further strengthens our U.S.-India  counterterrorism cooperation.   To the nation of India, we mourn with you, we pray for you, and we  stand in solidarity with you during this difficult time.                            ____________________
