 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the rule and the underlying  legislation. This is actually a very sad occasion, I think, for the  House; it certainly is for me personally. I have never voted against a  national defense authorization in my 17 years in Congress. As a matter  of fact, most of our Members have never done that for the last 58  years, so it is pretty unusual for us to be here and we, personally,  regret that a great deal.   My concerns with the substance of the bill are many, although there  are, as my good friend from Massachusetts said, lots of good things in  there, and there was lots of bipartisanship in writing it.   But the top line number is $15 billion less than the President  requests and the Senate has already enacted in their NDAA bill. We  think that hurts readiness. We have concerns with the reversal of some  decisions, both slowing down the modernization of our nuclear forces,  and moving us away from low-yield nuclear weapons, which we think we  need to counter Russia and its current aggressive posture.   We are disappointed the bill doesn't include longstanding prohibition  against transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay to the United  States. Those provisions were put in by a Democratic Congress in 2010.  We are sorry our friends seem to reverse a decision that they believed  in a decade ago.   And it includes a lot of restrictive policies and prohibitions on  securing the southern border, including prohibitions on funding a  border wall, fence, physical barriers. I understand there are  differences there, but I would hope we could give the executive  flexibility in that area.    Mr. Speaker, as concerned as I am about the substance of the bill, I  am very concerned about the process. I grant my friend's point that a  lot of amendments have been made in order. We could have made more. We  actually offered an open rule last night that would have made  everybody's amendments in order. It wouldn't have taken away any of the  amendments my friends wanted to put out there, but it would have  allowed everybody's amendments to come to the floor for full and robust  debate.   Now, the amendments that were made in order, 67 percent of them, are  Democratic amendments; 14 percent are Republican. We don't think that  is a fair, remotely fair ratio.   And frankly, the en bloc arrangements in which we are going to bring  many of these to the floor are even more imbalanced; basically 63  percent of those will be on Democratic initiatives; I think two are on  Republican initiatives. So we are very concerned about that. I think if  we don't stop this process, we are about to make the mistake that we  made 2 weeks ago.   Now, the Senate has given us, as it did 2 weeks ago, a different  example. They have passed a national defense authorization by a vote of  86-8, so overwhelmingly bipartisan. The President has said he would  sign their bill. The President sent us a message that the partisan bill  that we are embarking on and about to pass he will not sign; so we are  headed for a confrontation. It is a confrontation where we will produce  a partisan bill that the President won't sign. The Senate will produce  a bipartisan bill that the President will sign, and I think we know how  that story ends.                                time  1300    So we are dangerously close to repeating the mistake we made only 2  weeks ago, and I would hope that we stop, because if we proceed down  this path, we will find ourselves in precisely the same situation we  found ourselves in with the border wall.   Now, I also want to take issue with my friend a little bit about the  9/11 issue and our friend Mr. Wilson's bill and my good friend in the  chair's bill, as well. I just want to say, putting a bill, those things  that are bipartisan, in a rule, it just literally means that our side  is not going to vote for it. It would be the same if it were your side.  You can say all you want. It was going to pass no matter what. So we  don't think this was necessary.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for the additional time, and  I will be brief.   So it is with a great deal of sorrow--not sorrow that I oppose the  rule, because I think the rule needs to be much more open, much more  inclusive, but I hope that we can get back, Mr. Speaker--and by  rejecting this rule and rejecting the underlying legislation, we can-- to a bipartisan process where we produce a bipartisan National Defense  Authorization Act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of the rule and rejection of the  underlying legislation.
