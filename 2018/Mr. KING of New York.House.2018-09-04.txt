 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 6430) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to implement certain  requirements for information relating to supply chain risk, and for  other purposes.

(c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 835 the       following new item: ``Sec. 836. Requirements for information relating to supply chain                risk.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, on July 24, the Committee on Homeland Security voted  to favorably report H.R. 6430. I want to thank the Oversight and  Management Efficiency Subcommittee chairman, Mr. Perry; the full  committee chairman, Mr. McCaul; Ranking Member Thompson; the  Counterterrorism and Intelligence Subcommittee ranking member, Miss  Rice; the Oversight and Management Efficiency ranking member, Mr.  Correa; Congressman Donovan; and Congressman Payne for working with me  and cosponsoring this legislation.   The legislation under consideration is a result of several years of  oversight into supply chain and counterintelligence risks in the  procurement process.   There is no question that nation-states and criminal actors are  constantly trying to exploit U.S. Government and private-sector systems  to steal information or insert potentially harmful hardware or  software. The recent cases involving Kaspersky, ZTE, and Huawei  underscore the threats posed to the Federal supply chain and the  urgency in developing stronger mechanisms to secure it.   On July 12, I held a hearing to review DHS' current supply chain risk  management programs as well as assess the need for additional  authority. At the hearing, the Department's chief information officer  noted: ``Gaps exist in the Department's authority to use intelligence  to support its procurement decisions. . . . In those exceptional cases  where mitigation is not possible, the Department needs the capability  to react swiftly while appropriately restricting the disclosure of  other national security sensitive information.''   Clearly, Madam Speaker, this is a problem. The bill under  consideration today provides the DHS Secretary with authority to  restrict information technology procurements if the vendor poses a  threat to the DHS supply chain.   This bill establishes true coordination between the acquisition  process and intelligence. This authority is modeled after existing  authority granted to the Department of Defense in 2011. The legislation  also includes important enhancements recommended by the Office of  Management and Budget based on a governmentwide supply chain risk  management proposal released at the end of July.   I am hopeful that, as this bill moves through the process, we will  also have an opportunity to consider the legislation that provides  similar authority to ensure national security vetting is incorporated  into the wider government procurement process.   As a national security agency, it is vital that DHS also have robust  supply chain risk management practices and tools to identify, mitigate,  and remove potential threats to its systems and contracts. With this  legislation, Congress is ensuring that DHS will have the authority  necessary to fully vet and restrict, if necessary, vendors who pose a  threat.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 6430,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Let me again thank the gentleman from Mississippi and the ranking  member for his service on this bill and his service to the committee  over the years.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation provides DHS vital authority to protect  the Department from vendors who pose a risk. The bill includes  important accountability measures to ensure that decisions are risk  based, allows the vendor to provide feedback, and requires annual  reviews any time the authority is used.   This is commonsense legislation that will provide important national  security protections for the Department similar to what already exists  for the Department of Defense and the intelligence community.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6430,  the Securing the Homeland Security Supply Chain Act of 2018, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
