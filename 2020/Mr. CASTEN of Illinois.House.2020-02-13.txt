 Madam Speaker, 1 year ago Saturday, five  people lost their lives and many more were  [[Page H1128]]  injured when a gunman entered an Aurora, Illinois, warehouse and  started shooting.   At the vigil for those victims, I made it clear that, if we want to  stop people from getting shot, we have to politicize this and we have  to take legislative action.   Now, Illinois has some of the strongest gun laws in the country, but  our neighbors don't. In Chicago, 60 percent of the guns recovered from  crime scenes were trafficked in from out of State. And, worse, we have  never had the courage to regulate guns the same way we regulate cars.  If my daughter took my car out and crashed into my neighbor's garage, I  would be liable. That is common sense.   That is why, yesterday, I introduced the Gun Trafficker Detention  Act. This bill requires gun owners to report if their gun is lost or  stolen within 48 hours and imposes criminal penalties if they fail to  do so and their gun turns up at a crime scene. It would also allow the  victims of gun violence to hold traffickers legally liable for death or  injury caused by their guns, regardless of who pulled the trigger.   Are there people who won't like this bill? Yes--gun traffickers.  Every other American will be safer, and I encourage my colleagues to  join me and support this bill.                            ____________________
