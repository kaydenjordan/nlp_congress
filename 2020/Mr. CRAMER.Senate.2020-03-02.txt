 Mr. President, the students on the robotics team  in the small northwestern North Dakota town of Alexander set a goal at  the beginning of this school year to win their State competition. Their  determination and hard work paid off in February, and now the Alexander  High School FIRST Tech Challenge Team #9963 team is preparing to  represent North Dakota in the world championship competition.   FIRST is the acronym for the For Inspiration and Recognition of  Science and Technology organization, which plans the annual  competitions between schools. There, the students build and program  robots to perform challenging tasks and then compete with other teams.   Robotics competition is growing in popularity in schools because it  provides an ideal opportunity for young people to apply their knowledge  of STEM subjects. It also teaches valuable life skills like  communication, creativity, and collaboration and opens up countless  doors of opportunity for the future.   While new to some schools, the Alexander students have participated  in the North Dakota championship competition for the past 5 years. Each  year, they have brought home a trophy from one of the categories. For  this year's competition, these future engineers built and programmed a  robot they  [[Page S1253]]  nicknamed ``Spiderbot,'' which competed against other robots, doing  tasks like maneuvering under bridges and stacking blocks on a plate.   This progressive small town of less than 500 residents is preparing  its students for 21st century careers by offering robotics as a career  and technical education course for credit at the school. The success of  this program is due in large part to the support and encouragement from  many, including school administrators, teachers, volunteers, and  parents.   To the students on the Alexander Robotics Team, their adviser Cathy  White, and all who support them, I send my congratualations on becoming  State champions. They are an inspiration to so many with their  knowledge and passion. North Dakota will be watching as they compete in  the world championships in Detroit in late April. I have a feeling we  will be hearing much more from all of them in future careers as  successful engineers and entrepreneurs.                            ____________________
