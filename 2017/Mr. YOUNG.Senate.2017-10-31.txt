 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of a  fellow Hoosier, Amy Coney Barrett, who has been nominated by President  Trump to serve on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh  Circuit.   Professor Barrett's credentials are well known. She is a mother of  seven children, a distinguished legal scholar at the University of  Notre Dame Law School, where she herself graduated with high honors and  served as editor of the Notre Dame Law Review. She clerked for Justice  Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court of the United States and Judge  Silberman on the Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, and she is  an expert on the Federal courts.   Unfortunately, some of my colleagues on the left have made an issue  of Professor Barrett's Catholic faith. Echoing what Leader McConnell  has said, we do not have religious tests for office in the United  States of America, period.   I applaud all of those who have spoken up as the Senate weighs  Professor Barrett's confirmation. That includes Notre Dame president,  Rev. John Jenkins. He expressed deep concern at the questioning of  Professor Barrett's faith. Following Professor Barrett's hearing in the  Senate Judiciary Committee, Reverend Jenkins wrote: ``It is chilling to  hear from the United States Senator that this might now disqualify  someone from service as a federal judge.''   The president of Princeton University has also asked the Senate to  avoid a religious test in judicial appointments. In a letter to the  Senate Judiciary Committee, President Eisgruber wrote that Professor  Barrett and all nominees ``should be evaluated on the basis of their  professional ability and jurisprudential philosophy, not their  religion.'' He wrote: ``Every Senator and every American should cherish  and safeguard vigorously the freedom guaranteed by the inspiring  principle set forth in Article VI of the United States Constitution.''   Despite the rhetoric surrounding Professor Barrett's nomination, I  have yet to hear any significant doubts about her legal qualifications.   Professor Barrett has made clear that her personal views will have no  bearing on her rulings as a judge. She brings the skill set and the  temperament needed for the job. She will rule according to the law and  according to controlling precedents, and she will be faithful to the  Constitution. There is no question that Professor Barrett will make an  outstanding appellate judge.   Also, 450 former students signed a letter to the Judiciary Committee  in support of Professor Barrett's nomination. They wrote: ``Our support  is driven not by politics but by a belief that Professor Barrett is  supremely qualified.''   All 49 of her fellow faculty members at Notre Dame Law School did the  same. They said:         We have a wide range of political views, as well as       commitments to different approaches to judicial methodology       and judicial craft. We are united, however, in our judgment       about Amy.    Their endorsement comes as no surprise since Professor Barrett has  served on committees dedicated to bettering the lives of students,  faculty, and employees of the University of Notre Dame.   In particular, she has dedicated her time to the professional  development of women. She serves on the University of Notre Dame's  Committee on Women Faculty and Students. As the faculty adviser for  Notre Dame Law School's Women's Legal Forum, she has twice been  recognized by her students with the Distinguished Teaching Award, which  is selected by the graduating class to honor a faculty member. She was  selected twice to receive that award.   One former student, Conor Dugan, shared his story about her  willingness to help him navigate the next steps of his career right  after law school. He said that despite not having Professor Barrett for  a big class, she wrote him back right away and took time out of her  busy schedule to help someone who was no longer at the school.   Conor says Professor Barrett has always been very responsive and a  generous mentor over the years. Most importantly, he said, she tries to  help people keep their perspective about the most important things in  life.   Judge Silberman, for whom Professor Barrett clerked on the Circuit  Court for the District of Columbia, had the following to say about why  she will make an outstanding Federal judge:         She is an honorable and straight as an arrow woman. She       looks at the law without preconceived notions, and she's       brilliant. She is the only law clerk I ever had from Notre       Dame, and she is as smart as any law clerk I have ever had.       She is compassionate, and she has a lively sense of rumor.    Judges, former law students, fellow law professors, and even the  American Bar Association, who rates Professor Barrett as ``well  qualified,'' all seem to agree that she is well suited for the job.   Now, being nominated to serve in a lifetime appointment for a U.S.  circuit court of appeals is a privilege few in the legal profession  will ever attain. This is a historic opportunity, as Professor Barrett  would be the first Hoosier woman to have a seat on the Seventh Circuit  Court.   I offer my strong support for Professor Barrett's nomination, and I  look forward to the Senate's confirming her today.  [[Page S6907]]    Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 30  minutes of postcloture time remaining, equally divided between the two  leaders or their designees, prior to a vote on the confirmation of the  Barrett nomination.   The Senator from Missouri.
