 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the many individuals,  businesses, and manufacturers in the First Congressional District of  Kentucky who have dedicated their time and efforts to helping our  country fight COVID-19.   Just months ago, there was a concern that America would face a  drastic shortage of the medical supplies needed to fight the  coronavirus. And while we may not be completely out of the woods, the  efforts of so many caring citizens have been instrumental in providing  needed supplies.   I am proud to say that many of the citizens and companies who have  assisted in this fight call south central and western Kentucky home.  Garment factories, like Stitches Apparel from my home county in  Gamaliel, Kentucky, WPT Nonwovens in Ohio County, Jomel Seams  Reasonable in Cumberland and Russell Counties, and American Shield  Apparel in Metcalfe County stepped up to manufacture face masks and  gowns for frontline healthcare workers all across America. This is in  addition to the countless citizens who have turned their kitchen tables  into manufacturing centers for the face masks we have all become very  familiar with.   I am even more proud to say that some of our Nation's heroes from  Fort Campbell military base have gone into Boston and New York to  provide medical support when those areas were in desperate need of  help. Like others, their contributions to our Nation will not be  forgotten.   Corn from Kentucky farmers has even been used to fight the spread  with facilities like Commonwealth Agri-Energy in Christian County  providing base ethanol for distilleries to provide hand sanitizer.   I also honor a young lady from my hometown who went above and beyond.  Carrie Beth Cropper, a native Monroe Countian and a registered nurse,  volunteered to go to New York City at the height of the outbreak to  care for those in need. Her willingness to put her fellow Americans  first to help fight back against the virus speaks volumes about her  character.   All of our nurses, hospitals, and other frontline workers have been  heroic in working under extremely challenging conditions. Their country  has never needed them more, and they have certainly met the moment.   Unfortunately, our country continues to suffer from the outbreak of  this virus. But in many ways, the pandemic has brought out the best of  America: Neighbor helping neighbor and communities coming together to  support one another.                        Orestus Flowers 100th Birthday     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Orestus Flowers of  the First Congressional District of Kentucky, who is turning 100 years  old on September 7th.   Mr. Flowers was born in Bow, Kentucky, which is in Cumberland County,  and continues to reside in the First Congressional District. Mr.  Flowers served in the Army for 3\1/2\ years and was stationed in the  Philippines from 1942 to 1945. I stand with all Americans to  congratulate him on years of bravery and sacrifice to preserve our  safety and freedoms.   On February 1, 1946, Mr. Flowers married Geraldine, and together they  have three daughters. A true entrepreneur, he was responsible for  bringing Houchens Markets to Burkesville in 1952 and served as manager  for 32 years. Upon retiring from Houchens, he worked at Norris and New  Funeral Home for the next 25 years.   I join with everyone in Burkesville and throughout the Commonwealth  who has had the privilege of knowing him and to celebrate his fearless  spirit. I am honored to represent Mr. Flowers and wish him a very happy  100th birthday.                          Wanda Blackwell Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Wanda Blackwell  on her retirement from the Webster County Senior Center, where she has  served as director for the last 4 years. She is beloved by the seniors  she cares for and their families because her devotion to serving others  is evident in every effort she undertakes.   Just a year ago, Webster County opened a new senior center that has  already enriched the lives of so many and is evidence of the devotion  Wanda and her team have for their fellow citizens. Whether she was  serving or delivering meals, decorating and improving the center, or  raising funds to expand their offerings and programming, she did it all  with a smile on her face. Wanda lives by the saying, ``grow where God  planted you,'' and has been a shining example of giving back to the  local community.   I join with Wanda's family, friends, and all those she has served  throughout her time at the center to thank her for her outstanding  efforts to better the lives of others, and I wish her many happy years  of retirement.                           Law and Order in America     In recent weeks, American cities have been plagued by  irresponsible, reckless violence and rioting. The violence in cities  from Portland to Chicago has been out of control, requiring a Federal  response to quell what has turned into full-on mob violence.   This behavior has severe consequences for American life. Businesses  destroyed, chaos and disruption, and unacceptable levels of violence.   And what has the Democratic response been to violent outbreaks?  Turning a blind eye to vandalism and destruction, along with a fresh  round of calls to defund the police.   At a time of rising violence, businesses being vandalized, and the  lives of everyday citizens being disrupted, prominent Democratic  politicians have sought to reduce the presence of American law  enforcement.   In calling efforts to defund the police a local decision, Speaker  Pelosi has given a green light to mayors who have eagerly implemented  that reckless movement. Thankfully, Federal law enforcement has stepped  in to help out in cities where weak-kneed, incompetent mayors have  failed to protect their citizens.    Even though Federal agents have been shamelessly treated as enemies  by far-left mayors, Federal reinforcements were necessary in the face  of local failures.   I am 100 percent in favor of peaceful assembly and protest. It is an  American tradition for our citizens to speak out and to use our sacred  First Amendment rights for good. And when there is legitimate police  misconduct, like what we saw in Minneapolis, nonviolent protest is  absolutely justified.   However, the violence in our streets has been anything but peaceful.  And when protestors start vandalizing and destroying property,  including Federal courthouses, a line is crossed. We must have law and  order and respect for the rule of law.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my Democratic colleagues will join me in calling  for just that. Stop pushing to defund the police. Stop condoning mob  violence. Support peaceful protest, not out-of-control rioting. We can  and we must have free expression in this country, but we also must have  law and order when protest turns into rioting and threatens the safety  of our communities.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).  [[Page H4209]]                      Recognition of Former Legislative Directors     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Shimkus). I thank him for his service to this body, and I thank him for  his friendship. He has been an institution here in Congress. He has  been a good neighbor.   He has made a difference not just in southern Illinois, but in the  United States of America, and I want him to know how much I appreciate  his mentoring, his friendship, the work we have done together to help  benefit the Ohio River-Mississippi River region of America.   Mr. Speaker, I will say that he has left big shoes to fill. I  congratulate him on his upcoming retirement, and I appreciate  everything that he has done for me, for our colleagues, and for the  United States of America.                    Mysterious Seeds in the United States     Mr. Speaker, I have been concerned as a farmer and former  commissioner of agriculture to learn in recent days that mysterious  seeds have been sent from China to people in all 50 States encouraging  them to plant these mysterious seeds.   I say publicly what we are hearing from leaders in the U.S.  Department of Agriculture and from my former colleagues in the State  ranks, the commissioners, and directors of agriculture in all 50  States: If you get these seeds, do not--and I repeat--do not, plant  these seeds. We have no idea what these seeds are. And these seeds  could be potentially deadly to our ecosystem.                                time  1315    We have seen so many shenanigans coming out of the China region. We  don't know exactly who it is, who they are. But we have seen concerns  in cybersecurity, and we have seen concerns in trade with currency  manipulation, with stealing our patents, with stealing our intellectual  property. This is one more concern.   So, I have written a letter and asked the Secretary of Agriculture,  who is investigating this, Sonny Perdue, to give me a briefing and give  the Committee on Oversight and Reform and the Committee on Agriculture  a briefing as to what is going on with this.   We do know that there are some people, unknowing of the damages, who  have planted these seeds.   Again, I encourage people--and it is not just people in the  agriculture community. It is just common citizens, random people, in  all 50 States who have gotten these seeds.   This is something that I am concerned with as a leader in  agriculture, someone who has spent my whole life involved in the  agriculture industry, and I hope that I can utilize my position in the  agriculture community and as the ranking Republican on the Committee on  Oversight and Reform to be able to determine the genesis of these  seeds, who sent these seeds, what their purpose was. If we need to hold  those people accountable for trying to create mischief and disruption  in our agriculture industry, then I hope that we can work hard to hold  them accountable.   I want to conclude my time today, Mr. Speaker, thanking my colleagues  in Congress for their confidence to name me as ranking Republican of  the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. I take this position with  a great amount of honor and humility.   I understand the role of the Committee on Oversight and Reform. The  Committee on Oversight and Reform was created to provide oversight. It  was created to ensure the Federal Government is transparent and  accountable to the taxpayers.   We have seen an unprecedented amount of deficit spending in this  body, too much spending. It is immoral what Congress has done over the  last decade, with respect to the deficit and the national debt, to our  children and grandchildren.   Somebody in Congress needs to get the back of the taxpayers, and I  pledge today that that somebody is going to be the House Oversight and  Reform Committee, at least from the minority standpoint. My colleagues,  my Republican colleagues on the committee, we are committed to  defending the taxpayer, committed to rooting out waste, fraud, and  abuse.   Unfortunately, for the past year-and-a-half, the Committee on  Oversight and Reform has been focused on one thing, not oversight, not  having the backs of the taxpayer. They have been focused on one thing,  and that has been trying to embarrass the President of the United  States, trying to use that committee as a political tool, as a  subsidiary of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, to try  to find something, anything, on Donald Trump. And I can say with  confidence, after a year-and-a-half, they have failed.   What we need to do, what I challenge my colleague, Chairwoman  Maloney, to do is focus on the real purpose of the Committee on  Oversight and Reform.  [[Page H4210]]  There is no shortage of waste, fraud, and abuse in the Federal  Government. There is no shortage of opportunities to find a lack of  transparency and accountability in the massive bureaucracies that have  been created by this body in the Federal Government.   I am looking forward to the challenges that lie ahead. I couldn't ask  for a better committee than what we have, a committee roster. We have  people on our side and the Democrat side who are committed to the real  purpose of oversight and reform. I am looking forward to that.   I, again, thank this body for the honor to serve in that capacity. I  look forward to making a difference and getting the back of the  forgotten Americans, the Americans who work hard, who go to work.   They never stopped going to work because of the coronavirus. They go  to work. They pay their taxes. They abide by the law. They don't  destroy property. They go to church on Sundays.   They do everything right, yet they are always forgotten in this body.  Whether it is a government program, whether it is tax policy, whether  it is the use of their hard-earned tax dollars, they are always  forgotten. We are going to put them on the forefront, and we are going  to get the backs of the taxpayers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
