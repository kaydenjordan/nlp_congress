 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have  said before that we all want to make sure our schools can stay safely  open for in-person learning. But based on this legislation, it is not  clear that is true for all of my Republican colleagues.   Look, this is straightforward. If you want education decisions to  happen at the local level, you do not tie the hands of State and local  officials when they are trying to keep their students and educators  safe. And if you want schools to be able to stay safely open and bring  some stability and certainty back to our classrooms, you don't cut  schools off from the resources they need just because you think you  know better than the parents and local officials about how this  pandemic is progressing in their community or how they should use tools  like masks.  [[Page S587]]    I am a former preschool teacher, parent advocate, and school board  member. But let's be honest, you don't need classroom experience to see  that right now the very last thing we should be doing is denying  schools the tools and resources to help kids learn safely. The data is  clear. We have real work to do to help our students make up for an  incredibly tough 2 years.   Now, Democrats actually passed legislation--the American Rescue  Plan--which invests specifically in helping our students recover  academically and mentally. The proposal from the Senator from Arkansas  would put our students' recovery and safe in-person learning in  jeopardy. It would take those important public health decisions, which  should be based on local conditions, away from those communities and  slash funding for students and schools right when they need us the  most.   Now is not the time to pull the rug out from under students in  schools. Parents, educators, and, most of all, kids have been through  enough. I object.
