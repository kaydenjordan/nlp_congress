 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Medfield  Model as a national exemplar for returning kids to full, in-person  learning.   By following the latest public health guidance, drawing on the best  science and technology, and building trust across students, teachers,  administrators, parents, and nurses, the Medfield Public Schools are  returning to full, in-person learning safely. At a recent visit, I  watched nurses test and screen students with minimal disruption and  felt firsthand the palpable relief among the students and teachers to  be back in the classroom.   For their academic and socioemotional growth, our students deserve an  education off Zoom and in the classroom.   Mr. Speaker, the Medfield Model shows that we can keep students  physically and mentally healthy. I am pleased to see schools in my  district leading the way.                            ____________________
