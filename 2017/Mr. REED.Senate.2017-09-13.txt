 Mr. President, I rise to discuss the fiscal year 2018  national defense authorization bill, which was passed unanimously out  of the Armed Services Committee on July 10.   First, I would like to acknowledge Chairman McCain, whose leadership  on this committee and in this body has been invaluable, indeed  historic. His contribution, his indefatigable energy, his commitment to  the men and women who serve us in uniform is something that has shaped  this legislation and indeed shaped our country profoundly.   Chairman McCain ensured the committee's thoughtful consideration of  the President's request, which produced bipartisan legislation that I  believe will improve the readiness, capabilities, and quality of life  of our military personnel and their families.   I wish to highlight some key aspects of the bill, beginning with a  central national security issue--North Korea. Kim Jong Un is intent on  developing a nuclear weapon that can be mounted on the head of a  missile and shot at the U.S. homeland. Unfortunately, there is no set  of military options that lead to a quick and certain strategy on North  Korea. Diplomatic engagement that leads to a freeze of North Korea's  missile and nuclear programs is perhaps our best path forward. In order  to bring North Korea to the table, we must reinforce our ballistic  missile defense systems and demonstrate that all options, including  military options, remain on the table. To that end, this bill  authorizes additional funding above the budget request to make upgrades  to our Ground-based Midcourse Defense system to protect the homeland  and to buy 24 additional THAAD interceptors, a regional defensive  system that we have deployed to the Republic of Korea.   This bill also enhances our security cooperation in the Pacific by  authorizing the Asia-Pacific Stability Initiative, which will help  strengthen our posture in the region and provide additional support and  security assistance to our partners and allies.   Another significant national security issue is the escalating threat  from Russia's maligned influence activities. The nature and extent of  this threat was brought home with Russia's interference in our 2016  elections, but our allies and partners in Europe have been dealing with  this threat for many years now. This bill contains significant  resources, through the European Deterrence Initiative and the Ukraine  Security Assistance Initiative, to reinforce our military presence in  Europe and build the capacity of the NATO alliance to counter Russia's  efforts to intimidate and coerce its neighbors.   The bill takes critical steps to prepare for any attempt by Russia to  attack our democracy in next year's midterm elections. One provision  states that it is the policy of the United States to respond, using all  instruments of national power, to any and all cyber attacks that intend  to cause significant harm to the Nation, including undermining U.S.  democratic society. This is a clear message to Vladimir Putin that  Kremlin influence is unacceptable and will be strongly answered.   A second provision, which is an amendment I offered that was accepted  in committee, would require the Secretary of Defense to create a task  force to integrate all Department organizations responsible for what is  called ``information warfare'' in order to achieve a unified and  coherent capability to counter, deter, and conduct strategic  information operations. The Department of Defense must play a vital  role developing strategies and executing operations to counter and  respond to Russia's aggression against America and our close allies in  Europe.   But efforts by the Department of Defense are not enough. It is  essential to have a whole-of-government approach if we are to deal  effectively with the multifaceted threat posed by Russia, as well as  China, North Korea, Iran, and others against the West.   We need to develop comprehensive and specific strategies, taking  advantage of all the instruments of national power and the  contributions of friends and allies to deter and respond to aggression  in all of its forms. We need to bring together the authorities and  capabilities of law enforcement, homeland defense, the military, and  the intelligence community to confront cyber threats that recognize no  organizational or functional boundaries.   At the same time, we must improve how we work with the private  sector,  [[Page S5251]]   which owns and operates the critical infrastructure on which our  democracy, our society, and our prosperity depend. This bill advances  our goal of ensuring that we have the strategy, organization, and  resources necessary to counter the complex challenge posed by Russia's  maligned activities and the maligned activities of other state and  nonstate actors.   This legislation also provides needed authorities and funding for our  military personnel who are engaged in operations abroad. Through the  support of our partners on the ground, we continue to make significant  gains against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. However, our partners require  sustained support to clear the remaining ISIS strongholds and ensure a  sustainable security environment going forward. Therefore, this bill  authorizes $1.8 billion to support the Iraq and Syria Train and Equip  Programs.   The bill also includes $4.9 billion for the Afghan Security Forces  Fund to assist our Afghan partners as they continue to take the fight  to the enemy while also working diligently to build and professionalize  their security forces. This is a critical investment for the stability  of the region and the security of the international community.   With respect to our services, we have taken steps to improve their  capabilities, their readiness, and their ability to fight and win. With  respect to our Navy and Marine Corps, this bill represents a  continuation of the efforts that are so important for improving their  ability to address the challenges of this new century. The proposals  would begin significant efforts to improve the readiness of Navy and  Marine Corps aircraft, ships, and weapons systems.   It is clear that high operational tempo, coupled with limited  resources for training and maintenance, contributed to the recent  tragedies with the USS John S. McCain, the USS Fitzgerald, and the V-22  crash off the coast of Australia. First, we must recognize the  sacrifice of sailors and marines and pay our respects to their families  for the sacrifices they have given to this Nation. That sacrifice  continues to impress all of us, with the contribution of everyone  wearing the uniform of the United States, their dedication to their  country, and their calls for renewed commitment by ourselves to work  together to achieve the ends of this great Nation. We must prioritize  resourcing for our military so we can ensure that our servicemembers  have access to the best equipment and the best training possible so  they can conduct these missions safely in spite of the very difficult  challenges we face.   This bill provides significant investments in our next-generation  Virginia-class submarines to ensure our Navy remains dominant under the  sea. It authorizes multiyear procurement contract authority and  advanced procurement for up to 13 Virginia-class submarines. In  addition, the bill adds $750 million for economic order quantity  material for the Virginia-class Block V multiyear procurement program.  Meeting today with the Secretary of the Navy, he once again reiterated  that the Virginia-class submarine program, together with the Ohio  replacement program, and the ballistic missile submarine program are  the highest priorities of the U.S. Navy. This bill supports those high  priorities.   The Navy will be able to use this funding to expand the industrial  base across the second-tier and third-tier contractors, anticipating an  increase in production needed to increase submarine force levels. An  additional $450 million is authorized to increase support for expanding  the industrial base or for advance procurement to buy an additional  Virginia-class submarine in fiscal year 2020.   The bill provides authority for another multiyear contract for the  Arleigh Burke-class destroyer program and provides the Navy the  authority to buy as many as 15 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. It also  adds $1.8 billion to buy a third destroyer in fiscal year 2018.   The bill also authorizes $1 billion for incremental funding for  construction of an amphibious ship and more than $1.2 billion for  several auxiliary ship programs, including five surface connectors and  one expeditionary sea base.   With respect to naval aviation, this bill also recommends significant  increases for multiple programs. Notably, it authorizes 10 additional  F/A-18 fighters, 10 F-35 fighter variants, 4 additional KC-130J  tankers, and 6 additional P-8A submarine hunters.   With respect to the Air Force, the bill also makes significant  increases in authorization by adding an additional $10.4 billion for  Air Force programs to purchase 14 additional F-35A fighters, 12 MC-130J  aircraft, 3 additional KC-46A tankers, and authorizing funding for  replacement of the A-10.   With respect to the Army, I am pleased that this bill also makes a  number of important investments in Army modernization. It authorizes  full funding for the Department's request for AH-64 Apache attack  helicopters and UH-60 Black Hawk utility helicopters. In addition, the  bill supports the Army's unfunded requirement for additional Apaches by  including $312.7 million to procure additional helicopters.   Likewise, the bill fully supports the Army's request for modernizing  Army ground combat vehicles, including M1 Abrams tanks, Bradley  Fighting Vehicles, and the Stryker combat vehicle. The bill also  includes funding to support Army unfunded requirements, including  recapitalizing Abrams tanks and procuring a fourth upgraded set of  Double V-Hull Strykers.   Finally, this bill makes targeted reductions in Army network  modernization programs, since Army Chief of Staff General Milley plans  to make a decision soon on the way forward with regard to these  programs. Once a decision has been made, it is my hope that the Army  will provide the committee with a detailed plan for network  modernization, to include details on the funding necessary for this  approach.   Our Special Operations Forces remain at the ``tip of the spear'' of  our efforts to counter violent extremist groups. The bill fully funds  the U.S. Special Operations Command, or SOCOM, and includes an increase  of approximately $85 million to help address unfunded requirements for  additional intelligence collection, precision strike, undersea  mobility, and communications capabilities. Additionally, the bill  includes new authority designed to support the ability of our special  operators to work with partners to counter irregular warfare, or so- called gray zone challenges, posed by our adversaries.   The bill authorizes funding to modernize our triad of nuclear-capable  air, sea, and ground delivery platforms--the bedrock of our defense  posture against an existential threat. The B-21 heavy bomber is  authorized at the requested level to continue engineering,  manufacturing, and development to be fielded in the mid to late 2020s.  This heavy bomber will replace the dependable but aging B-52s, which  were built in the 1960s. The committee is working with a team at the  Government Accountability Office for rigorous oversight on the new  bomber program. When the B-52 retires in the 2040 timeframe, its  airframe will be approaching 100 years old, and the grandchildren of  the original pilots will be flying the plane.   Turning to the area of undersea deterrence, in order to maintain a  sea-based deterrent, the current fleet of 14 Ohio-class submarines must  be replaced starting in 2027 due to the potential for hull fatigue. By  then, the first Ohio submarine will be 46 years old--the oldest  submarine to have sailed in our Navy in its history.   The third leg of our triad, our land-based ICBMs, will not need to be  replaced until the 2030s. We have authorized continued development of a  replacement for this responsive leg of the triad, which acts as a  counterbalance to hostile ICBMs.   I know there is concern about Russia's violation of the Intermediate- Range Nuclear Force Treaty, which is a foundational arms control treaty  from the late 1980s. This committee has received classified briefings  on the actions taken by Russia, and they are indeed serious. I urge all  of my colleagues to request these classified briefings if they have not  done so. While some have called for the United States to perform  developmental testing of systems that are noncompliant with the treaty,  this committee has pursued a cautious and measured approach of looking  at what kinds of research within the confines of the treaty we can  perform if called upon to counter this threat. Again, let me  [[Page S5252]]   stress that I do not support withdrawing from the treaty, and our best  approach is to bring the Russians back into compliance.   With respect to energy use, which is an important aspect to the  bottom line in the operational capabilities of our military, the bill  contains several provisions that enhance how the Department pursues  energy resilience, which directly supports readiness and mission  assurance of our warfighters. Additionally, this bill contains a  requirement for a defense threat assessment and master plan on climate- related events and a comprehensive strategy and technology roadmap on  how the Department can more effectively use water.   In the area of science, technology, and innovation, I am pleased that  this bill authorizes increases in funding for science and technology  research efforts by over $375 million above the President's request,  including a total of $2.3 billion for university research programs.  These programs are critical to ensuring that our military retains its  technological battlefield superiority in areas like cyber security,  unmanned and robotic systems, high-energy lasers, space, and  hypersonics. The bill streamlines the ability to access expertise and  technologies in our Nation's universities and small businesses, whose  expertise and innovation is the cornerstone of the technologies on  which our military depends.   Additionally, it continues efforts to strengthen the capabilities of  our defense labs and test ranges, including removing redtape that  inhibits their effectiveness, and supporting their efforts to build  world-class technical workforces. The bill also authorizes two new  innovation offices, the Strategic Capabilities Office and the DIUx  Silicon Valley office, with special authorities to hire the unique  program management talent they need to execute their innovative  activities.   In the area of acquisition reform, I am pleased that the bill  continues efforts to streamline procurement practices to support the  Department's efforts to obtain the best goods, technologies, and  services on a timely basis at fair and competitive prices. The bill  includes provisions from Senator Warren and Senator Blumenthal to  ensure that the Pentagon works with contractors to safeguard worker  conditions. The bill also makes significant and needed changes to the  way the Department buys, evolving toward more agile and effective  commercial acquisition practices. These new practices should enable the  Department to build and buy the most modern software and IT for our  weapons systems, platforms, and business systems. The bill also  includes a provision from Senator McCaskill that will provide more  transparency and require more deliberate planning in the use of service  contractors in order to control this rapidly growing part of the  Pentagon budget.   In the area of Pentagon management, I am pleased that the bill  includes provisions to improve financial stewardship to help the  Pentagon get a clean audit opinion on its financial books. The Pentagon  has been trying to obtain a clean audit opinion for 27 years, and the  continual failure to do so calls into question its ability to steward  the large funding increases proposed in this bill transparently and  efficiently.   This bill accomplishes much on behalf of our servicemembers and the  Department of Defense. It authorizes a 2.1-percent pay raise for all  servicemembers and reauthorizes a number of expiring bonus and special  pay authorities to encourage enlistment, reenlistment, and continued  service for Active-Duty and Reserve component military personnel. The  bill permanently extends the Special Survivor Indemnity Allowance-- scheduled to expire next year--provides $25 million for supplemental  impact aid, and $10 million in impact aid for severe disabilities,  including $5 million available for the Secretary to direct to schools  to address areas with higher concentration of disabled military  children.   This legislation also enhances military family readiness by  addressing the shortage of childcare workers and increasing flexibility  for military families undergoing permanent change of station.   A provision in the bill also addresses the Marine United situation by  making the nonconsensual sharing of photos and videos of an  individual's private anatomy or of sexually explicit conduct involving  the individual a criminal offense under the UCMJ, even when the initial  taking of the photo or video was consensual.   Once again, this bill includes authorization for a needed package of  healthcare reforms, including modest increases to working-age retiree  healthcare cost shares, while ensuring that the cost share remain far  below those required by civilian plans. It also requires the Department  to establish a Medicare Advantage demonstration program for TRICARE For  Life beneficiaries that will achieve better healthcare outcomes for  beneficiaries with chronic health conditions as well as cost savings  for the beneficiaries and for the Medicare TRICARE Programs.   During floor consideration of this bill, Chairman McCain and I would  like to offer an amendment that will authorize a new BRAC round. I know  this topic concerns many of our colleagues, but I believe it is in  necessary to allow the Department to gain efficiencies and savings by  shedding excess infrastructure. In drafting this amendment, Chairman  McCain and I worked to include the lessons learned and address the  common critiques from previous BRAC rounds. The amendment would use the  most recent National Military Strategy and an elevated force structure  to determine if there is any excess capacity. Any recommendations  submitted by the Secretary would have to be certified by CAPE, require  third-party validation by the GAO, provide greater transparency to  communities by publishing on the Federal Register, and any list of  closures would have to be affirmatively approved by the President and  Congress. Again, I know this is a difficult issue, but I believe we  must make difficult decisions as stewards of our Department of Defense  and taxpayers' dollars, and I look forward to the debate.   To my disappointment, the bill also includes a series of provisions  that add unnecessary redtape to successful medical research efforts  funded by the Pentagon. The program has funded research over the years.  These programs have led to new treatments for burn victims, new  transplant procedures, and rehabilitation techniques for TBI and PTSD  patients, and a score of other medical innovations. These  Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs have been  independently reviewed by experts at the National Academies of Science  and found to be world class, scientifically rigorous, innovative and  effective. At a time when the President is proposing drastic and  harmful cuts to NIH's medical research budget, I do not think we should  intentionally throw bureaucratic hurdles in the way of researchers  trying to cure debilitating and life-threatening diseases. I hope we  can remove these provisions before we pass the bill.   I am also concerned about several provisions in this bill that would  weaken important protections for American defense manufacturers,  including small businesses in my State that supply advanced  technologies and systems to the military. I note that existing sourcing  laws include provisions that protect the Pentagon taxpayers from paying  unreasonable and unfair prices, and these laws serve to help protect  American jobs. We need to ensure that we have an innovative, reliable,  trusted, and secure domestic industrial base as we grow the military  and respond to contingency operations and surge production  requirements.   Finally, I would like to say a few words about the funding for  defense. The bill reported out of committee includes $610.87 billion in  discretionary spending for defense base budget requirements and $60.2  billion for Overseas Contingency Operations. It also includes $21  billion for Department of Energy-related activities, resulting in a  topline funding level of $692 billion for discretionary national  defense spending.   While many of us agree that the Department requires the resources,  these funding levels do not adhere to the spending limits mandated by  the Budget Control Act of 2011. If enacted and funded at these levels,  sequestration would be triggered, thereby wiping out about $88 billion  through across-the-board cuts. This would be a very complicated  situation. We would be giving money on one hand and taking it back  [[Page S5253]]  with the other, literally. We must come to address the insufficient  funding caps in the BCA, and we must do so for both defense and  nondefense accounts.   Since the Budget Control Act was enacted in 2011, we have made  repeated incremental changes to the discretionary budget caps for both  defense and nondefense accounts. We have done so in order to provide  some budgetary certainty to the Department of Defense and also to  domestic agencies. I believe that if defense funds are increased,  funding for domestic agencies must also be increased because they, too,  are suffering from the same severe budget that the Defense Department  has suffered over the last several years. In addition, at this point, I  think all of us acknowledge our national security is broader than  simply the accounts in the Department of Defense. It is the FBI, the  Department of Homeland Security, State Department, and many other  agencies that contribute to our national security.   In fact, in the wake of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma, we have  seen the Centers for Disease Control dispatched, EPA individuals  dispatched to evaluate, in the Harvey situation, threats to the  environment, and in case of Irma, to try to prevent the threats by  being deployed before the storm actually struck. So our national  security, our public safety, all these issues involve not just the  Department of Defense but the whole array of government enterprise. We  understand that the well-being of our Nation--and what our men and  women in uniform are fighting for--depends on funded and functioning  domestic agencies, not just the Department of Defense. For example, as  I have said before, with these two hurricanes, tens of thousands of  Americans have needed help, these Federal agencies have come forward,  and I will mention them: the Centers for Disease Control, Environmental  Protection Agency, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal  Communications Commission, the Small Business Administration, the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Social Security Administration.  Those are just a handful. Providing for the security of Americans  requires the whole of government, and it should all be funded fairly.  We should remain responsible stewards of taxpayers' money while also  ensuring we provide sufficient funds to meet the needs of our Nation.   Let me conclude by once again thanking Chairman McCain and my  colleagues for working thoughtfully and on a bipartisan basis to  develop this important piece of legislation. I would also like to thank  the staff who worked tirelessly on this bill throughout the year. I  look forward to a thoughtful debate on the issues that face our  Department of Defense and national security.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The majority leader.                          Remembering Pete Domenici    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is with deep regret that I announce  to the Senate the passing of our dear friend and colleague Senator Pete  Domenici.   Pete had a long and notable career, one that took him from pitching  on the baseball diamond to teaching mathematics at an Albuquerque  junior high school, from city politics to the U.S. Senate.   In fact, when he ran for the Senate in 1972, Domenici became the  first Republican elected from his home State in nearly four decades. By  the time he retired, he did so as the longest serving Senator in New  Mexico history. Like others in this Chamber, I served for a number of  years with Senator Domenici. I came to know him as smart, hard-working,  dedicated and as a very strong advocate for his home State of New  Mexico.   We are all saddened by this news today. The Senate offers its  condolences to Senator Domenici's family and especially his wife Nancy.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.   The question occurs on agreeing to the motion to proceed.   The motion was agreed to.                            ____________________     Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask if the  Senator from Kansas would modify the request and I be allowed to speak  for up to 5 minutes before Senator McCain?

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask if the  Senator from Kansas would modify the request and I be allowed to speak  for up to 5 minutes before Senator McCain?    Madam President, Senator Paul has been relentless in doing  something that has to be done, which is the revision of the AUMFs from  2001 and 2002. Yet there is sort of a simple notion that you cannot  replace something with nothing, and we have nothing. This is 6 months  of more time when, in the last 16 years, even at the request of a  President, we have not been able to come together as a Senate. I don't  know where the House is on this, but I think that it is equally  befuddled in providing the kind of specific language we need for an  AUMF.   This would be a different debate and a different vote if we were to  have before us an actual AUMF that would immediately supersede the  existing authorities. Without such an AUMF, we are going to cause  confusion, and we are going to cause disruption among our forces and  our allies. In my having spent a little bit of time in the Service,  when there is a possibility that in 6 months you will have to cease  operations, you begin planning almost immediately for those operations.  By the time we get around to actually even considering this--since I do  not think there are any plans to do it immediately--we could see 3 or 4  of those months evaporate. With each passing day, the concerns about  redeployment and repositioning and authorities become more pressing to  the military. Not only that, but even if they are sophisticated in  understanding that it is not yet the law of the United States, our  allies will read this--will see it--as a signal that we are weakening  in our cooperation.   What we have seen over the last several months, in Iraq particularly,  has  [[Page S5258]]  been effective Iraqi indigenous forces in close cooperation with U.S.  special operations and other forces, and they have made progress. They  will have political blowback in Baghdad and Kabul, especially if this  provision passes. Then I think, very adroitly, our adversaries will  take advantage of this. The newspapers and the social media that they  control--and, unfortunately, they control a great deal in all parts of  the world--will make this very simple: the United States to leave, the  United States restricting authority. Those are the practical  consequences.   Again, this would be an entirely different debate and an entirely  different vote, I think, if we were looking at a real replacement for  the AUMFs of 2001 and 2002. So I would urge my colleagues to think not  just about the constitutional imperatives--the congressional  authorities to declare war, the Presidential authorities under article  II--but to think about the practical and almost immediate consequences  to those in the field, to our allies, and also of the possible ways in  which this act could be used by our adversaries.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.   Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I want to discuss the amendment, which  has to do with the importance of the authorization for use of military  force in the ongoing U.S. operations against violent extremist  organizations.   First of all, it is important to acknowledge why our current fight  against terrorism is necessary. Earlier this week, we commemorated the  anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks, which took the lives  of thousands of innocent Americans, shook our Nation to its core, and,  importantly, brought us together in common resolve to make sure that  kind of tragedy would never, ever happen again.   In pursuit of that noble goal, thousands of brave men and women in  uniform are currently deployed in Afghanistan, Iraq, and many other  places. No matter what else we do in this body and on this legislation,  we must always ask ourselves if we are doing everything we can to  support those servicemembers as they risk their lives to defend us.   At the same time, we must recognize the ways in which the current  conflict is different from when Congress passed the first authorization  for use of military force in 2001. The landscape of the global fight  against terrorism has changed dramatically with the emergence of ISIS  and the spread of the threat beyond Afghanistan and Iraq. That is why I  and many others have long called for updating the AUMFs.   Yet the nature of the conflict remains the same: Terrorist  organizations continue to warp the religion of Islam and promote a  radical ideology to recruit new fighters and plot violent attacks as  part of their jihad against the United States of America and all that  we stand for.   As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am open to a  process that would develop a new AUMF specific to the current fight  against ISIS and other terrorist organizations as identified by the  administration. I would be very willing to work with my colleagues,  including the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations  Committee, as well as the Senator from Kentucky, to ensure that the  legislation proceeded under regular order and included hearings, a  committee markup, and a floor amendment process that ensured that each  Member of this body was able to have his or her voice heard.   Haven't we had enough of bringing things to the floor without  hearings, without amendments, without debate? I am confident that an  overwhelming bipartisan majority of my colleagues would agree to  approve the use of military force against the vicious, brutal enemy  that we face in ISIS and its associated forces.   The amendment before us now falls far, far short of that process.  Repealing the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs without simultaneously passing a new  authorization would be premature, it would be irresponsible, it would  threaten U.S. national security, and it would inhibit our democracy- building efforts abroad.   As we speak, we have troops deployed overseas who are engaged in the  fight against ISIS, al-Qaida, the Taliban, and other violent extremist  organizations. Repealing the existing AUMFs without having a  replacement would jeopardize the legal authority for ongoing military  operations. I cannot stand by silently as this body considers taking  any action that would put our currently deployed servicemembers at  risk.   It is also important to recognize that adopting this amendment would  embolden our enemies and would send a signal to the members of the U.S.  Armed Forces who are serving in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere that  Congress and the American public no longer support their mission and  their sacrifice. We cannot send that message, because it is not true.   In closing, I agree with those who support this amendment that the  time has come for a new authorization for use of military force in the  global fight against terrorism, but this amendment is, simply, not the  way to do it. Rather than repealing the existing AUMFs without passing  a new authorization, I urge my colleagues to work together on a new,  bipartisan AUMF that addresses the threats we face today.   There are many Members on both sides of the aisle who have been  working together on AUMFS, including the chairman of the Foreign  Relations Committee. That is a process in which I would be proud to  participate, and it is one that would honor those who are currently  deployed in harm's way, fighting to make sure that our Nation never  sees another day like 9/11. But I cannot support anything that fails to  provide our men and women in uniform with everything they need-- including the legal authority--to keep our Nation safe.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.    Mr. President, first, let me once again commend the  chairman for working collaboratively and cooperatively to include in  this legislation over 100 amendments that have improved a very good  piece of legislation. It also represents the input of the vast majority  of our colleagues in the Senate. But I think, too, that we should have  opportunities to debate and vote, which was typical in previous  considerations of the National Defense Authorization Act. We are still  considering the possibility of such votes, and I hope we can reach an  appropriate conclusion to have votes and debates. But to this point,  again, let me thank the chairman for his leadership and take his wise  advice to think seriously about how we proceed forward with this  legislation.   Mr. President, I yield back.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Rhode Island, and I  thank him for the relationship we have developed over the years.   Here is the deal: We have basically four amendments--which are  important amendments, and I don't mean in any way to denigrate their  importance--that are forcing us to go to a mode where there will be no  other amendments voted on. By failing to reach an agreement, we are  shutting out our colleagues on both sides of the aisle and preventing  them from having their amendments considered. That is why cloture is  not a good thing. Cloture should be an act of desperation, and we  should not be shutting out debate or amendments by any Member of the  Senate.   I have talked a lot about the need to work on a bipartisan basis. I  have talked a lot--let's do the regular order, committee markups,  debate, legislation to the floor, debate, amendments, and then sent to  the President of the United States. I believe we can still do that. I  believe the progress we have made on this bill indicates that. But I  hope my colleagues think about the fact that we ought to be able to  decide, as we have on numerous aspects of this bill on a bipartisan  basis, either to agree or to have those amendments debated and voted  on. What we do when we invoke cloture is we silence Senators. That is  not the way our Founding Fathers envisioned the Senate would function.   But I also would like to say that there are 104 amendments that we  did agree to in a bipartisan fashion. I think we can be very happy  about that. But there are still three or four salient issues that I  wish we could just go ahead and debate and vote on, as we already have  on a couple of very tough issues.   I thank all my colleagues for their cooperation. I thank them for our  ability to get in all of these amendments. I am grateful for the votes  we have taken. I hope that overnight, even though the majority leader  will file cloture--and I support that--we should think overnight if  there are ways of resolving the existing differences--not in agreement  but to move forward with debate and votes.   Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I thank my friend from Rhode  Island. I hope we keep upmost in mind that what we are doing here  affects the lives, the welfare, the benefits, and the capabilities of  the finest in our society, the finest in America--the men and women in  uniform.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Alisa  Beyninson, a Government Accountability Office detailee to the Armed  Services Committee, be granted floor privileges during the  consideration of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2018.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.
