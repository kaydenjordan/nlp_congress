 Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate  Arkansas Public Broadcasting Service, PBS, for its tremendous work to  provide educational resources throughout the COVID-19 health crisis.   Arkansas PBS was recently recognized with five national Public Media  Awards from the National Education Telecommunications Association,  NETA, including honors for overall excellence for the programing it  provided to children, parents, and teachers through Arkansas AMI,  Alternative Methods of Instructions.   As the COVID-19 emergency progressed in March 2020, Arkansas PBS  upended its weekday schedule and began broadcasting streamlined,  curriculum-based programming for children from Pre-K through eighth  grade.   When schools first closed in Arkansas, educators were immediately  challenged by the lack of internet access in many rural areas of the  State. This made the Arkansas AMI project even more important. For many  without  [[Page S315]]  computers at home, the programming provided by Arkansas PBS became  their classroom.   I am proud of the partnership between Arkansas PBS and the Arkansas  Department of Education, which offered students a way to keep learning  when they couldn't be at school. This effort was possible because of a  longstanding relationship between the broadcast network and education  officials who have worked together for many years. With a strong  foundation in place, they were quickly and creatively able to pivot and  provide classroom learning on a network of stations that reached 76  percent of the State with a simple over-the-air signal. The programming  was also available on cable and satellite, live-streaming, on-demand,  and various apps that families could access on mobile devices.   I am proud of these devoted Arkansans who rose to meet an incredible  challenge, and I am grateful for the work they do every day to make  education in our State a priority. This recognition from the NETA is a  testament to its commitment to offering quality educational,  informative, and entertaining content that benefits the people of  Arkansas. We appreciate the hard-working staff of Arkansas PBS and  celebrate their accomplishments which reflect so well on the  organization and its service to our State.                            ____________________
