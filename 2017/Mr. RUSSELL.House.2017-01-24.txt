 Madam Speaker, the carving up and commercial sale of  dismembered unborn children ranks as one of the most horrific and  barbaric acts in American and human history.   As an adoptive father, I speak today on behalf of the 55 million  Americans that have had their lives brutally ended with the scalpel,  the suction hose, and the callousness of the murderous culture that  allows it to perpetuate.   These Americans had a right to choose life that they did not want to  lose. We have the ability to restore to future Americans that choice.  Until that day, no American should be forced to end the life of an  innocent human being with their tax dollars.   We can carve up a child and call it a choice. We can destroy human  life and call it health care. We can make the killing of children legal  and pretend it is beneficial. We can cover acts of barbarity with the  veneer of civility. But we cannot escape our accountability before the  Creator of life.
