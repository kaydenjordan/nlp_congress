 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  California for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I want to be upfront. I have caught dozens of sharks in  my life. I have released every single one of them intact. I have never  gone shark fishing. It was unintentional catch. I have never eaten a  shark, never had shark fin soup, nor have I any intention or desire to  have any of this. But I do represent a State that does have a shark  industry that sustainably harvests those.   Mr. Speaker, I think that it is our obligation to actually go to  scientists and to go to fisheries managers to get their opinion on what  it is that we ought to be doing here.   So, Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from our Democratic  Governor's administration where they talk about this bill.           State of Louisiana, Department of Wildlife and Fisheries,                                     Baton Rouge, LA, July 7, 2017.      Re Shark Fin Trade Elimination Act of 2017, S. 793, H.R.           1456.       Mr. Acy Cooper,      President, Louisiana Shrimp Association,      Grand Isle, Louisiana.        Acy: As requested by you on June 7, 2017, the department       has reviewed the text of Senate bill 793 and House Resolution       1456, also known as the ``Shark Fin Trade Elimination Act of       2017'' and the ``Shark Fin Sales Elimination Act of 2017'',       respectively. The bills, in their current form, would place       unnecessary economic burdens on Louisiana shark fishermen. As       long as responsible management is in place, which is       currently the case for sharks in the Gulf of Mexico, there is       no need for this legislation.        The purpose of these bills as stated by the authors is to       ``curtail the act of `finning' sharks while reducing the U.S.       contribution to the global shark fin market.'' The practice       of shark finning is already illegal in the United States and       Louisiana and has been since the 2000s. All sharks landed in       Louisiana must have their fins naturally attached until       landed. Once a shark is landed in Louisiana, these fins may       then be removed and processed separately.        Information available on NOAA's National Marine Fisheries       Service commercial statistics website shows that in 2015,       17,059 kilograms (37,530 pounds) of shark fins were exported       from the United States to other countries while 24,016       kilograms (52,835 pounds) of shark fins were imported from       other countries. The total estimated global shark fin trade,       was an estimated 17,500 metric tons (according to a 2015       F.A.O. report on the state of the global market for shark       products). These U.S. total imports and exports amount to       less than 1% of shark fins traded globally. This bill will       likely have little impact on the global trade in shark fins,       especially the illegal trade of shark fins. The majority of       shark fin exports do not move through the United States. The       majority of fins exported from the United States, in the       past, moved through California to the Hong Kong Market.       However, since the California ban on shark fins in 2015, the       shark fin trade now mainly flows through Mexico and Canada in       North America. These bills will do little to reduce global       trade or curtail illegal practices on the high seas, but will       economically impact responsible U.S. fishermen. Data for 2016       were not yet available.        Sharks are indeed a vital part of the marine ecosystem,       however those sharks harvested in the United States, along       with their fins, are sustainably harvested in accordance with       regulations and quotas established by the NOAA Fisheries       Highly Migratory Species Division and the State of Louisiana.       By eliminating a domestic market for legally harvested fins,       this legislation will only have adverse impacts on Louisiana       fishermen who legally harvest sharks and their fins as well       as the coastal fishing communities where they live. These       bills will create unnecessary regulatory waste of legally       harvested shark parts by not allowing fishermen to sell fins       from a legally harvestable shark species. These bills ban one       part, the most valuable part, of an otherwise legally       harvestable animal creating a situation in which an entire       fishery would effectively be shut down. They will either not       affect global shark fin markets, or at worst, will encourage       further development of unregulated harvest to replace the       regulated US landings.        The shark fishery is an important winter fishery in       Louisiana as it provides a critical seasonal source of income       to a number of commercial fishermen until other fisheries       open later in the year.        Possible alternative measures to allow the legal shark       fishery of the U.S. to continue to harvest and sell legally       obtained fins while working to reduce illegal finning       practices:        1) Legislation mandating tracking and traceability of       legally harvested fins as opposed to an outright ban.        2) Provide for tracking and traceability measures of       imported and exported fins to determine legal origin of those       fins originating from or entering into the U.S.        3) Prohibit the importation or exportation of shark fins       that can't be verified to have come from legally landed       sharks.            Sincerely,                                                    Jack Montoucet,                                                         Secretary.     They say: ``As long as responsible  management is in place, which is currently the case for sharks in the  Gulf of Mexico, there is no need for this legislation.''   They say: ``The practice of shark finning is already illegal in the  United States and Louisiana and has been since the 2000s.''   ``These bills will create unnecessary regulatory waste of legally  harvested shark parts by not allowing fishermen to sell fins from a  legally harvestable shark species.''   These bills ``will either not affect global shark fin markets, or at  worst, will encourage further development of unregulated harvest to  replace the regulated U.S. landings.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a National Geographic article  from this year that has quotes from the Mote Marine Laboratory in  Florida.     Shark Fin Is Banned in 12 U.S. States--But It's Still on the Menu     Shark fin bans, intended to reduce instances of shark finning, are     difficult to enforce, leading some to question if they're worth it                      (By Rachel Fobar, Jan. 16, 2019)         But that would be against state law. California is one of       12 states that bans the sale of shark fins--measures to help       prevent further declines of shark populations and to deter       finning, which has been illegal in U.S. waters since 2000.       Although demand for shark fins for soup is greatest in Asian       countries, there's significant demand for them in the United       States too.        A man who identified himself as the China Gate Restaurant       owner's brother says the online listing is a mistake and       denies that the restaurant serves the dish.        Finning involves slicing fins off live sharks and tossing       the wounded animals overboard, where they sink to the bottom       and, unable to swim and pass water over their gills,       suffocate, die of blood loss, or get eaten by other       predators.        ``It's without doubt, the worst act of animal cruelty I've       ever seen,'' says celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay in his       television documentary on the shark fishing industry.        Every year, the Animal Welfare Institute, a Washington,       D.C.-based nonprofit that supports a national ban on shark       fin, updates its list of restaurants that serve shark fin       soup and notifies the relevant state enforcement agencies.        But so far, according to the institute, the bans haven't       stopped restaurants in at least 10 of the 12 states.  [[Page H9080]]         During the past two years, at least five bills relating to       the country's shark fin trade have been introduced in the       U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate. All five died       before becoming laws, leaving the fate of sharks in the U.S.       uncertain.        Many countries don't regulate shark finning, says Peter       Knights, CEO of WildAid, an environmental group that strives       to reduce consumption of wildlife products. What this means,       activists say, is that Americans could be getting their fins       from countries that catch and mutilate sharks, diminishing       their already dwindling global populations.        Because of overfishing and the demand for shark fin for       soup, more than a quarter of the world's sharks, rays, and       chimaeras (a cartilaginous fish also known as ghost sharks)       are considered to be threatened. In a 2012 study, researchers       found the DNA of eight different sharks, including the       endangered scalloped hammerhead, as well as vulnerable       species like the shortfin mako and the spiny dogfish, in soup       samples collected from around the U.S.        Shark fin soup has long been a status dish in Asian       countries, notably China, where its use can be traced back to       an emperor from the Song Dynasty (960-1279) who is thought to       have invented the dish to show off his power and wealth.       Shark fin eventually became exalted as one of the four       treasures of Chinese cuisine, along with abalone, sea       cucumber, and fish maw (swim bladders).        Today, it's a luxury dish served at weddings as a sign of       respect for guests. Preparation of the soup involves boiling       the fins and scraping off the skin and meat, leaving behind       softened protein fiber, which is sometimes shredded before it       goes into the soup.        What is a luxury to some is a headache to understaffed       enforcement agencies in the U.S. states that ban shark fin.       They say that cases against shark fin vendors in those states       can be hard to make. Because the shark fin trade tends to go       underground, it has been compared to the illicit drug trade.        ``I know it's going on, I know it's out there,'' says San       Francisco marine warden William O'Brien. ``But it's a very       private matter--it's not the kind of thing that, you know,       people are selling to the public.''        In addition, according to several law enforcement agents,       fines and jail sentences for violating the shark fin ban are       generally light and have little deterrent effect.        Knights says a U.S. ban on sales of shark fin would be a       significant step forward because it would send the message       that selling and consuming shark fin isn't acceptable       anymore. The sale of shark fin, he says, ``continues to       increase the sort of pressure on sharks worldwide.''        But, argues Robert Hueter, director of the Center for Shark       Research at Mote Marine Laboratory, in Sarasota, Florida,       given how difficult it is for some states to enforce their       shark fin bans, a nationwide ban would just drive the shark       fin market underground--as it's done in San Francisco.        California has about a third of the country's Asian       population and is one of the largest consumers of shark fin       outside Asia.        When the shark fin ban passed in California in 2011, San       Francisco marine warden William O'Brien says he was ``charged       up.'' He'd been keeping a list of restaurants to inspect once       the ban went into force.        Almost immediately, he and his team received a tip about a       supplier, and they confiscated more than 2,000 pounds of       shark fin from a warehouse near San Francisco Bay. He       estimates that the haul was worth at least $500,000. The       accused, Michael Kwong, a shark fin wholesaler and vocal       opponent of the shark fin ban who said his family had been in       the business for four generations, pleaded no contest to       violating the shark fin ban. According to court records, he       spent 30 days in jail, paid a court fine, and received three       years' probation.        Since then, O'Brien says, the leads have dried up. He       suspects restaurants and market owners are now storing their       shark fin supplies off premises--perhaps in their homes,       which would be off-limits to law enforcement without a search       warrant.        ``Essentially, the market has gone so far underground that       it requires more specialization than I have to dig it up,''       O'Brien says.        O'Brien's overall responsibilities include monitoring for       illegal ivory, the pet trade, and illegal animal products in       medication, and he must also check hunting and fishing       licenses almost daily. He reckons that in any given month,       he's able to devote only about two days to shark fin.         ``It would be great if I was like, the shark fin guy, and       that was all I did,'' O'Brien laments.        A complicating factor is that a restauranteur accused of       selling shark fin soup may claim it's imitation or made from       a species of shark exempt from the ban. Spiny and smooth       dogfish sharks, for example, are exempt in New York State.       It's possible to identify a species from a freshly cut fin,       but once a fin is dried or absorbed in soup, the only way to       prove it's a species in violation of the law is through DNA       testing.        To ascertain whether a crime has been committed,       authorities must establish whether the DNA in a seized sample       of soup is actually that of a shark. The specimens Ashley       Spicer tests and analyzes as a part of her work in the       Wildlife Forensics Lab at the California Department of Fish       and Wildlife vary from suspected shark fin soup in plastic       to-go containers to frozen fins in vacuum-sealed packaging.        Spicer examined California's 2018 shark cases--all four of       them. Only two of those cases were specifically shark fin;       the others were a shark attack case and a poaching case. In       all, the two shark fin cases she handled in 2018 involved       about 20 different shark fins.        Low test numbers don't necessarily represent every       California shark fin case that comes to the attention of       authorities. If, for example, a case elicits an immediate       confession on the part of the accused, authorities may decide       that testing isn't necessary.        DNA testing proved successful in a recent case in Plano,       Texas, one of the states where shark fin is banned. Mike       Stephens, a game warden with the Texas Parks and Wildlife       Department, went into a local dim sum restaurant--in       uniform--with a colleague and asked for the ``special'' menu.       And there it was: shark fin soup.        To assure them the shark fin was real, not imitation, the       restaurant owner's wife led the wardens to a walk-in freezer       where they found about six bags of shark fins. Stephens       assumes that the owner, Qi Zhou, and his wife didn't realize       the real reason behind the wardens' visit until it was too       late. Before they left, Stephens says, Zhou's wife told them       they weren't the only ones selling shark fin. The supermarket       next door was offering it too, she said.        Sure enough, when the wardens went to the supermarket, Tao       Marketplace, to investigate, they found nearly 40 shark       carcasses, the tail fins removed, on display in the fresh       fish aisle and in storage.        Wearing rubber gloves so as not to contaminate the       evidence, they sealed the fins from both places in separate       containers and overnighted them to a lab in North Carolina       for DNA testing.        The case against the supermarket is still pending, but the       restaurant owner was found guilty of selling shark fin and       paid a fine: one dollar. The court also ordered Zhou to make       a donation to the Animal Welfare Institute, which totaled       less than a thousand dollars, Stephens says.        According to the institute, in Texas and most other states,       prison sentences for shark fin transgressions are rare and       usually don't exceed six months for a first offense. Fines       are usually less than a thousand dollars. By contrast, a       single pound of dried shark fin can sell for $400, and shark       fin soup can command anywhere from $50 to $200.         ``It's tough to get jail time on wildlife cases,'' says       Jesse Paluch, a captain with the New York State Department of       Environmental Conservation's Bureau of Environmental Crimes       Investigation unit. In New York, he says, judges and       prosecutors ``see so much crime, so wildlife crime is a       little bit lower on the spectrum.''        In October 1988, when Robert Hueter was getting his start       at the Mote Marine Laboratory, he heard from a colleague that       a group of fishermen off the Florida Panhandle had been       caught harpooning bottlenose dolphins, whose meat and blood       they used to bait sharks. Killing bottlenose dolphins was and       still is illegal under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of       1972. When the fishermen caught sharks, they sliced off their       fins and threw the mutilated animals, still alive, back into       the water.        This is sick, Hueter says he thought at the time. He'd       never heard of shark finning, so he contacted Nelson Bryant,       a reporter he knew at The New York Times, who wrote a       pioneering story about the practice. Today, shark finning is       the subject of documentaries, public protests, and Facebook       posts.        Hueter says the fishermen were handed minor fines for       killing the dolphins--and no penalty for finning the sharks.       ``There was no crime in what they'd done with the sharks,''       he says.        Since then, Hueter has been an advocate for sharks. Which       is why, he says, he's against a national shark fin ban.        ``The folks that are pushing the fin ban campaign want to       simplify it to this very simple message--that if we ban the       fin trade in the United States, we save sharks all around the       world,'' Heuter says. ``That is so simplistic and so wrong.''        He says that of course he's against finning and overfishing       but that cutting the fins off a legally caught dead shark       isn't cruel, and banning a specific dish won't stop shark       finning because shark finning is already illegal in U.S.       waters. But, he says, a ban will ensure that fins from dead       sharks are wasted.         ``It would cause [fishermen] to have to throw the fins       into the dumpster. It goes totally against our doctrine of       full utilization of fishery products--that when we harvest       fishes from the sea, we don't want to throw stuff away. We       want to use absolutely everything we can.''        David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist with Simon       Fraser University, in Vancouver, Canada, and the man behind       the popular Twitter account @whysharksmatter, says it's       unreasonable for people to criticize using shark fins for       soup when they may eat shark meat in other forms.         ``There are people who are outraged at the idea of       consuming a bowl of shark fin soup who are not outraged at       the idea of eating a mako shark steak on the grill,'' he       says. ``From my perspective, as a shark conservation       biologist, either way you've got a dead shark. Shark fin soup       has sort of become this boogie man of ocean conservation.''        As an alternative to a national ban, in 2018 Hueter helped       draft the Sustainable Shark Fisheries and Trade Act, which       Representative Daniel Webster, a Florida Republican, says he       plans to reintroduce this session. This bill, Hueter says,       would allow imports  [[Page H9081]]       only from countries that prohibit finning and promote shark       conservation.        But Susan Millward, director of the marine animal program       at the Animal Welfare Institute, says a blanket ban is still       the best answer.        ``Even if you have a sustainable shark fin trade, there's       still going to be a trade in shark finning,'' she says.       ``There's always going to be people who want to flout it.''        Chinese basketball star Yao Ming pushes a white ceramic cup       of shark fin soup across a table. In an aquarium tank to his       right, a bleeding computer-generated shark sinks to the       bottom. ``Remember,'' he says, staring into the camera lens,       ``when the buying stops, the killing can too.''        Since 2011, consumption of shark fin soup in China has       fallen by about 80 percent, both because of national bans on       serving shark fin at government banquets and the effect of       celebrity-backed awareness campaigns such as Yao Ming's, seen       by millions of Chinese.        According to a 2018 WildAid report, when WildAid began its       Chinese anti-shark fin campaign in 2006, 75 percent of       consumers didn't realize the soup they were eating was made       from shark, and many who did know mistakenly thought that       sharks' fins grew back after they were cut off.        Many conservationists believe that similar awareness-      raising efforts in the U.S. would curb demand. People       generally don't give much thought to what they're eating,       Millward says. ``It's just a lack of connecting the dots with       where this product came from, how it started with a live       animal and how much suffering was endured to reach this       finished product . . . These animals are dying painfully, and       their whole ecosystems are being affected--for what?''        Her question begs another: Why shark fin? It's widely known       that the fin adds no taste or health benefits to shark fin       soup; rather, it gives the soup a crystalline, noodle-like       texture, which can be replicated almost indistinguishably       with mung bean paste or melon. What's more, because shark       fins are cartilage and rigid protein fibers, they need to be       cooked for hours, even a full day, to soften them enough to       be edible. ``If you cook my belt for 24 hours, it would be       edible too,'' Knights says.        Ironically, as conservationists, chefs, and even consumers       themselves acknowledge, the flavor of shark fin soup--a dish       that has ignited international controversy, spurred people to       write countless letters to the United States Congress, and       led to a massive awareness campaign--comes not from the fins       but from the chicken broth used as the soup's base.     In fact, the director of shark research for  that institute says, ``The folks that are pushing the fin ban campaign  want to simplify it to this very simple message that if we ban the fin  trade in the United States, we save sharks all around the world. That  is so simplistic and so wrong.   It would cause fishermen ``to have to throw fins into the dumpster.  It goes totally against our doctrine of full utilization of fishery  products, that when we harvest fishes from the sea, we don't want to  throw stuff away. We want to use absolutely everything we can.''   David Shiffman, a marine conservation biologist with Simon Fraser  University, also talks about how this is a flawed approach. He lays out  an alternative, which my friend from Florida, Congressman Webster, and  the Mote Marine Laboratory director of the shark institute there have  advocated for as well.   Mr. Speaker, there is no one in this body who supports the concept of  shark finning. But let's be clear on that. No one here supports this  concept of finning a shark and just letting the rest of it drop to the  bottom and die. No one does. But we have to understand that our entire  fisheries management practice, the State of Louisiana having one of the  largest commercial fisheries in the Nation, that this is part of the  overall consideration.    This is part of the overall consideration.  Yet this bill attempts to gut legally sustainable shark harvesting that  is part of the overall fisheries management process and doesn't take  into consideration what impact that will have.   In closing, this bill is not the right approach. I agree with the  objective, but all we are doing here is pushing illegally harvested  species to other countries, as opposed to truly stopping the problem.  There are successful efforts out there that are demonstrated to work,  whereas this simply, again, promotes illegal harvesting.
