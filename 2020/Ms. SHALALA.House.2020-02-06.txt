 Madam Speaker, this is National Gun Violence Survivors  Week, and I rise to recognize the victims and survivors of domestic  violence across the United States who have felt the effects of our weak  gun laws.   Just last week in my community in Miami, a man killed his infant  son's mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother with a high-powered  rifle before abducting the days-old baby. The infant, Andrew, is still  missing.   Stories like this are not unusual in this country. Women in the  United States are 21 times more likely to be murdered with a gun than  in other high-income countries.   When we don't take action, it is people like Andrew, his mother, his  grandmother, and his great-grandmother who pay the price.   Andrew deserves to grow up with his family. He deserves leaders who  prioritize his well-being over the violent whims of abusers. He  deserves a chance at life not tinged with tragedy.                            ____________________
