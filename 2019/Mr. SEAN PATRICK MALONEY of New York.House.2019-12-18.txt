 Madam Speaker, the facts and  the evidence establish beyond peradventure that the President abused  the power of his office for personal gain and sought to cover up his  misconduct by obstructing the Congress.   What we do today goes to the heart of the oath we take to support and  defend the Constitution. These actions are as necessary as they are  heartbreaking.   It is the President, not any Member of this House, who has brought us  to this sad place. His actions echo in this Chamber and, like a tin can  tied to his leg, will rattle behind him through the pages of history.   For in the final analysis, none of us will escape the truth. It will  come for us all in this world or the next.   What is the truth? The President used taxpayer money and official  acts to pressure a foreign government to help him win reelection by  slandering a fellow American.   How do we know this truth? We know because brave Americans, soldiers  and public servants, came forward to reveal the President's misconduct.   And the President? He continues to undertake an unprecedented coverup  to stonewall the public and obstruct their Representatives in Congress.  He withholds access to documents and records belonging to the public  that would further establish his mendacity. He blocks his advisers and  associates from testifying before the public to conceal the wrongs they  witnessed.   These actions are unworthy of the Presidency.   Today is about right and wrong and whether we still know the  difference. Today, we hold the President accountable. If we fail to do  so, future Presidents would see corruption as without consequence. And  there, our democracy goes to die.   We inherit this Republic from our ancestors, and we borrow it from  our children. With humility, we pray that the history of this day will  guide us to a better future for our Nation.
