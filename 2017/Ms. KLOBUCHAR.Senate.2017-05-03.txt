 Thank you, Mr. President.   I join my colleague, Senator McCaskill from Missouri, in her comments  about the Central States Pension Fund. We have over 14,000 workers and  retirees in our State affected by this as well.   But I really stand here today to thank Senator Manchin for his work  and to thank our leaders, Senator McConnell and Senator Schumer, as  well as Chairman Cochran and Vice Chairman Leahy for their ability to  put partisanship aside and get this deal done. It meant everything from  funding for the COPS Program to helping to combat the opioid epidemic,  Capital Investment Grants, and medical research.   But for one guy here, it was all personal, and that is Joe Manchin.  He fought long and hard to protect healthcare benefits for his coal  miners. Think about this: In October, 12,500 retired coal miners and  widows received notices telling them that their healthcare benefits  would be cut off at the end of the year. Then, in November, another  3,600 notices went out. That is over 16,000 people.   I don't have coal miners in my State, but do you know why I knew  about those notices? Because Joe Manchin  [[Page S2702]]  made sure that I knew about those notices and because the other  Senators who spoke here, who have coal miners in their States--they  stood up and made sure we knew about those notices, and they worked  tirelessly to get this done.   For me, mining is not about that black coal dust. It is about red  dust. It is about iron ore. As Senator Manchin knows, my grandpa worked  1,500 feet underground in the mines in Minnesota. He got his first job  as a teamster when he was only fifteen. He had to quit school and go to  work and help raise his eight, nine brothers and sisters. One of them  died. His parents died. He worked underground his whole life. He went  down that shaft and that cage every single day, just to support his  brothers and sisters. Then he married my grandma and supported my dad  and his brother.   Do you know what? I wouldn't even be here in the Senate today if he  didn't have the pension benefits that came out of the job he had--and  healthcare. Joe Manchin understood that about the people he represents.  Those miners earned those pensions, and they earned their retiree  healthcare benefits. That is why what he did, and what all those  Senators who represent the coal miners did, is more than just about  those States and about those miners. It is about a promise we made to  our workers.   As one former Congresswoman, Barbara Jordan from Texas, once said:         What Americans want is something simple. They want a       country that is as good as its promise.    I thank Senator Manchin for fulfilling that promise.   I yield the floor.
