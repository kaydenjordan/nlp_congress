 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to  speak for 10 minutes prior to the scheduled vote.    I come to the floor to talk about one of the greatest  citizens, leaders, and public servants in the history of my State,  Lowell Palmer Weicker, Jr., who died June 28.   We held services for him in Greenwich on Monday, and I want to  celebrate him for a moment with my colleagues, because they don't make  them like Lowell Weicker any longer.   Lowell Weicker served virtually every capacity you could helping to  lead our State. He was a first selectman. He was a State  representative. He was a Congressman. He was a Senator here in this  Chamber, and he was a Governor. But throughout his long, storied tenure  as an elected official--for most of that time a Republican, as Governor  an Independent--he led a life that was led by one simple axiom: Do what  is right.   He put his principles, his convictions, and what he thought was right  for our State above every other political consideration--certainly  above party. He bucked his party here over and over and over again. His  autobiography was titled ``Maverick.'' But he also made decisions for  the betterment of the State that ran directly contrary to his own  political interests. And I will talk about the most famous of those  decisions, those calls that he made, in a moment, when he was Governor.   I got to know Lowell Weicker only in the last decade of his life, and  I am sorry for that because he played a very big role in my decision to  pursue public service as a vocation.   Lowell Weicker was born in Paris. He was raised on Park Avenue in  Manhattan and Oyster Bay on Long Island. He followed his father's  footsteps through prep school, to college at Yale. He graduated Yale in  1953, University of Virginia Law School in 1958. He served 2 years in  the Army as an artillery officer.   He began his political career as a local representative serving his  town of Greenwich. He was a State representative, and then he was first  selectman. He ran first for Congress in 1968. He unseated a three-term  Democrat representing Fairfield County. And from that first race, you  could see that Lowell Weicker was going to be a different kind of  political leader.   He ran to the left of his Democratic opponent on the issue of  Vietnam. He ran for Congress as a Republican who opposed President  Nixon's war. And as Congressman, he staked out a series of contrary  positions to his party, earning him, early on, the reputation of  someone who was just going to do what he thought was right over and  over and over. Later in life, he said: There is going to be this  crucial moment in your career. The question is whether you mature or  whether you are going to be an ideologue. Lowell Weicker was never an  ideologue. And there is no question of whether he matured. He was proud  of the fact that he changed his stance on issues over the course of his  career.   When he got to Congress, he supported prayer in schools. He ended up  as a Senator, here, successfully leading the opposition to President  Reagan's push for a constitutional amendment to allow organized prayer  in public schools. He changed. He matured. He didn't run from that. He  was proud of it.   In the Senate, he is probably best known to be the first Republican  to call for President Nixon's resignation. Speaking about his  Republican Party that he was so proud of, he said:         Let me [be] clear, because I have got to have my partisan       moment, Republicans do not cover up; Republicans do not go       ahead and threaten; Republicans do not go ahead and commit       illegal acts; and, God knows, Republicans don't view their       fellow Americans as enemies to be harassed. . . . I can       assure you, this Republican and those I serve with, look upon       all Americans as human beings to be loved and won.    In 1981, he was the only Republican to vote against President  Reagan's first budget. As I mentioned, he fought hard against that  constitutional amendment to allow organized prayer in schools because  he came to believe very deeply in the separation of church and State.  But maybe what defines Lowell Weicker's career in the Senate, more than  Watergate, was his ability to see the future. He always talked about  the fact that he was living for the future.   When standing up for people living with HIV and AIDS was  controversial, Lowell Weicker was leading the fight on the Senate floor  to put early money into AIDS research. When it wasn't a foregone  conclusion that we would make sure that people with disabilities had  access to buildings in this country, Lowell Weicker wrote the Americans  with Disabilities Act. It passed just  [[Page S2349]]  after he left the Senate, but he was the originator of that  legislation.   Today, Sheldon Whitehouse reminds us of our obligation to our oceans.  Before anybody else was talking about the oceans, it was Lowell Weicker  down here talking about the need to invest in oceans and oceans'  research.   But I remember Lowell Weicker when he became Governor. Lowell Weicker  ran as an Independent for Governor. He won a three-way race. And he was  facing a State crisis, a fiscal crisis of epic proportions. He didn't  like the idea of a State income tax. He, frankly, opposed the idea  earlier in his career. But he surveyed every other option necessary to  rescue Connecticut from its political and fiscal crisis, and he judged  that an income tax was the only path forward.   And so he took a step that he knew would mean that he could only  serve one term in office. He was a young man when he became Governor.  He was in his late fifties or early sixties, but he stood up and said  the only way for Connecticut to be fiscally sound going into the future  is to have an income tax. He fought both Republicans and Democrats to  get that done, and he got it done.   I was 17 years old at the time when Lowell Weicker became Governor  and made that proposal. I don't think I had any thoughts on whether an  income tax was the right or the wrong thing, but what I saw, for the  first time, was a political leader standing up and doing what they  thought was right, even though they knew it was unpopular, even though  he knew it was likely going to be the end of his political career. And  I was mesmerized. I was mesmerized by this act of political courage, by  this act of political statesmanship, and it was one of the early  examples that convinced me that there was honor in public service.   And so I am deeply grateful to the example that Lowell Weicker set  for all of us, during his time in the Senate, the first Republican to  call for Nixon's resignation, to the time as Governor, where he set the  State on a course of fiscal sanity.   During those income tax debates, thousands of people would show up at  the capitol. In fact, one day 40,000 people showed up at the State  capitol. They hung Governor Lowell Weicker in effigy. He didn't sit in  his office. He walked into the crowd to try to reason and negotiate  with them. It didn't last long. He was pelted with cans and bottles of  sodas. He had to be hustled out of the crowd as quickly as he went in,  but it caused Howard Baker, one of his great friends in the Senate, to  say: Lowell Weicker, ``[t]hat is the only man I ever met who would  strike a match to look into a gas tank.''   It has been popular to say, over the last few days as we have been  eulogizing Lowell Weicker, that he belonged to a different era in which  you could just be for what you thought was right and not worry about  the political consequences. But I think that is a copout, and I think  my friend Lowell would say that is a copout. Doing the right thing  should be timeless. Putting country over party should be timeless.   There is no reason why all of us can't learn a little bit about  Governor Senator Lowell Weicker's record upon his passing and use him  as a model for how we act as public servants as well.   Lowell Weicker died last week at age 92, one of the most  consequential people in Connecticut's history, and I choose to remember  Lowell Weicker and the example he set as timeless.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that privileges  for the floor be granted to the following members of my staff through  the end of July: Eleanor Schmutz, Clara Adams, Caroline Shinney,  Nicholas Benvenuto, Stephanie Crocker, Bennett Gilhuly, Alex Page,  Ritwik Bose, Elena Brennan, Nader Granmayeh, Hugh Cecil, Liv Birnstad,  and Evan Maher.
