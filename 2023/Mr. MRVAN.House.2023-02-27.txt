 Mr. Speaker, it is with great respect that I rise today to  celebrate Black History Month and recognize the Honorable Calvin D.  Hawkins, who is a Lake County Superior Court judge in northwest Indiana  and a champion for equality and civil rights.   While still in his teens, Judge Hawkins participated in the historic  March on Washington in 1963, and then embarked on his distinguished  legal career where he has faithfully served with purpose, integrity,  and respect.   Outside of the courts, he also has proven himself to be a tireless  advocate for the youth of northwest Indiana, launching a stay-in-school  initiative, and has also served as president of the board of directors  for Indiana Legal Services.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me today in celebrating  Black History Month and recognizing the dedication of Judge Hawkins and  all individuals who have fought and continue to fight for civil rights  and justice.                            ____________________
