 Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation with my  friend and colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen. The Helping  Entrepreneurs Affect Regulatory Decisions Act or the HEARD Act is a  straightforward bill that would make our government agencies more  accessible to our Nation's small business owners and improve  participation in the regulatory process.   When Federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency,  the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau, propose a new regulation with a potential  large economic impact, these agencies must convene Small Business  Advocacy Review panels. These panels allow for the views of small  business owners to be heard. The small businesses provide input on how  a particular regulation may affect their business and have a chance to  work with the regulators to address challenges and concerns.   As it stands, these panels are open to invitees, but participating is  often a challenge, especially when small businesses are often asked to  go to these panels at their own expense. Small businesses owners in  Maine and other parts of our country can little afford to shut down for  the day or use their own money to travel to these panels. Business will  not stop because of a meeting held hundreds of miles away. To address  these barriers, the HEARD Act would allow a small business to  participate remotely. Small businesses, which are the backbone of the  American economy, deserve to be heard, especially when we ask for their  input, and this bill would help facilitate that.   Small businesses and their advocates support this effort. In my  State, the Maine Chamber of Commerce has endorsed this bill because it  would allow Mainers to give their input on new regulations more easily.  Nationally, the NFIB, which advocates for America's small businesses,  supports this bill because it would ensure that Main Street has a voice  in the regulatory process.   Our bipartisan legislation would allow small businesses to be a part  of the process by providing input and recommendations on regulations  that would affect them. I encourage my colleagues to support the HEARD  Act to ensure that the Federal Government hears from our small  businesses, the backbone of our economy.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Anti- Spoofing Penalty Modernization Act of 2019'' with my colleague, Senator  Sinema, who serves with me on the Senate Committee on Aging, which I  chair. I am also pleased that Senators Hawley, Peters, and McSally have  joined as original cosponsors.   This morning, the Senate Aging Committee held its 23rd hearing in the  past six years to examine scams targeting our Nation's seniors. Scams  the Committee has examined include the infamous IRS imposter scam the  Jamaican Lottery scam, computer tech support scams, grandparent scams,  elder financial exploitation, identity theft, and the notorious ``Drug  Mule'' scam--where seniors are tricked into unwittingly serving as drug  couriers.   Two things are central to nearly all of these scams: first, the scams  are initiated by robocallers who cast a wide net in their hunt for  potential victims, and second, the scammers ``spoof' the victim's  Caller-ID to mask their identity, a key to the success of their  outrageous frauds. When victims see the ``Internal Revenue Service'' or  the ``local Sheriff's Department'' pop-up on their Caller-ID, they are  understandably worried, scared, and often easily hustled into doing  whatever the scammers demand.   Last year, robocallers generated more than 26 billion unwanted calls  that reached American mobile phones. When landlines are included, the  number soars to 48 billion. In Maine alone, our residents received an  astonishing 93 million robocalls last year. That averages out to 73  calls to every person in Maine. So far this year, scammers are on pace  to generate more than 58 billion unwanted, illegal robocalls targeting  Americans.   Putting a stop to these illegal robocalls requires a coordinated  approach from all levels of our government, working in coordination  with the private sector. Recently, this body overwhelmingly passed the  bipartisan ``TRACED Act,'' which makes a number of important changes to  our law that will help make it easier to fight illegal robocalls, such  as increasing civil penalties on robocallers and extending the statute  of limitations for violations to three years. The TRACED Act also  requires telecommunications carriers to implement the so-called SHAKEN/ STIR technology to verify whether Caller-IDs that appear on incoming  calls are authentic. When fully implemented, this technology will be a  major advance against illegal spoofing. I am pleased to be a cosponsor  of the TRACED Act, and I am hopeful it will soon become law.   The bipartisan bill we are introducing today complements the TRACED  Act by doubling the penalties on illegal spoofing. Except for inflation  adjustments, the penalties on illegal spoofing have not been updated  since they were first passed into law through the Truth in Caller ID  Act of 2009. Our bill also extends the statute of limitations to three  years for spoofing violations to match the extension for robocalling  violations included in the TRACED Act.   Mr. President, putting an end to the scourge of illegal robocalls  will take an aware public, aggressive action by regulators and law  enforcement agencies, and a coordinated effort at every level of our  telecommunications industry. The enhanced penalties called for by the  ``Anti-Spoofing Penalty Modernization Act'' are an important tool in  the fight. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Anti- Spoofing Penalty Modernization Act of 2019'' with my colleague, Senator  Sinema, who serves with me on the Senate Committee on Aging, which I  chair.
