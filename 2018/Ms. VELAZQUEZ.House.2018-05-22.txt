 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to S. 2155, which strips  back and weakens many of the regulatory tools and safeguards we enacted  in Dodd-Frank.   Make no mistake, Mr. Speaker: this bill will make our financial  system more vulnerable to a financial crisis.   The bill undermines important safety and soundness protections like  stress tests and capital requirements, key reforms that Democrats put  in place following the financial crisis that prevent the risk of bank  bailouts and protect our economy and taxpayers.   The bill also weakens critical consumer protections like Dodd-Frank's  enhanced HMDA data monitoring and reporting requirements. Under this  bill, 85 percent of depository institutions are excused from these  important requirements.   While many financial institutions say that these reporting  requirements are too onerous and too difficult to comply with, S. 2155  will make it harder to determine if lenders are serving the credit  needs of minority borrowers and to identify harmful and discriminatory  lending patterns.   Instead of eliminating important tools like HMDA, we should be  finding ways to eliminate discrimination in lending.    Mr. Speaker, as ranking member of the House Small  Business Committee, I support targeted reforms that provide relief for  community banks and local credit unions, but this bill does none of  that. It is a solution in search of a problem that harms consumers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this dangerous  bill.
