 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to shine a  spotlight on our strong, healthy, and growing economy. Specifically, my  focus is on how this record-setting economy is helping and could  continue to help all Americans.   Since Republicans took over and passed tax relief, there has been no  end to the boon in jobs in our country. Republicans have put the U.S.  worker in the driver's seat. The October jobs report again beat all  expectations. U.S. employers added a solid 128,000 jobs last month  alone.   Even better, American workers are noting that their wallets are  thicker and fatter. Wages are up 3 percent year over year. It is the  fastest growth--faster than inflation.   We also continue to see record-low unemployment across the country.  At 3.6 percent, the U.S. jobless rate is near a 50-year low. African- American unemployment is at a 50-year low. In fact, 3 years of  Republican pro-growth policies have produced more than 6 million new  jobs--actually, 6,700,000 new jobs. Today, the United States has nearly  160 million people working. That is another record high. Median  household income is the highest in 20 years. No wonder a new poll by  Gallup shows Americans are planning to spend more than ever this  holiday season because they have the money. They have earned it, and  they have kept more of their hard-earned money as a result of tax  relief.   The U.S. stock market continues to set new highs, and that is welcome  news for people when they look at their pensions, their retirements,  and their 401(k)s.   Notably, trade optimism has been a major factor in the stock market's  climb to record highs, which brings me to my next point: How do we  start the next chapter of the United States in terms of our success  story? I believe it is through America-first trade victories.   Without question, the most important trade deal we need to pass right  now is USMCA--the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. In my  view, it is vital to continuing our American prosperity. The U.S.- Mexico-Canada trade agreement was signed by all three countries'  leaders more than a year ago, so you would think, well, it should be in  place. But it takes more than that. Mexico gave its final approval to  USMCA in June. Canada is waiting for us--for the House and the Senate-- to give the approval as well.   Without a doubt, USMCA is the best trade upgrade in 25 years. It is  going to expand market access for a host of U.S. products, and it is  going to sharpen U.S. exporters' competitive edge. Above all, USMCA is  a big benefit for American workers. It will protect and produce  millions of U.S. jobs, and that is critical.   I predict it will pass the Senate with strong bipartisan support. So  it has to get here. Yet we have not crossed the finish line. There is a  roadblock, and the roadblock is at the other end of  [[Page S6574]]  this building. The roadblock is Speaker Nancy Pelosi. She has not and  will not yet allow a vote in the House of Representatives. It seems to  me the Speaker is too obsessed with impeaching the President instead of  being focused on fighting for American workers. She stopped all  progress on USMCA in its tracks.   The stakes, meanwhile, could not be higher. Passing USMCA will save  American jobs. Twelve million current American jobs are on the line.  The deal will create 180,000 new U.S. jobs. USMCA is a boon for the  entire economy. It will boost our economy by $70 billion. So what  exactly is the Speaker waiting for?   Canada and Mexico are our top trading partners. U.S. producers don't  need impeachment chaos or an impeachment circus; what we need is trade  certainty.   Not only is the deal essential for U.S. manufacturers, our ranchers  and farmers are counting on it as well. Canada and Mexico are the top  export markets for American farmers. Last year, U.S. agriculture  exports to the two countries totaled $40 billion. For the past 5 years,  Mexico has consistently ranked second or third for U.S. wheat imports.   USMCA is a huge win for Wyoming wheat growers. My State is going to  reap enormous benefits from this deal. Wyoming foreign trade has  increased nearly 20 percent in recent years. Wyoming farmers--the  Presiding Officer knows this, coming from an agriculture State--play a  key role in our economy. This Friday, I will be honored to attend the  100th annual meeting of the Wyoming Farm Bureau. It will be in Laramie.  Our farmers add billions to the State economy every year, and trade is  a big part of it.   Wyoming's annual agriculture exports total $300 million. The export  market supports 2,600 jobs in our State. Our State not only produces  livestock, seeds, and crops, but we are exporting essential chemicals  that farmers everywhere need to grow their crops.   Wyoming farmers and ranchers are counting on expanded export markets  for future growth. New markets mean new opportunities, and Wyoming is  poised to seize them.   In coming years, we plan to add to our high-quality beef, our grain,  and our hay exports. Future State exports will include gluten-free  products, as well as craft beer and distilled spirits, just to name a  few.   That is why the USMCA agreement is so essential for the people, not  just in Wyoming but for people all across America. To keep our record- setting economy on track, we need to pass this ``America First'' trade  deal, and we need to do it now.   It is time to put partisan politics aside. It is time to pass USMCA.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a different topic, I come to the  floor today to discuss the Democrats' partisan campaign against  President Trump.   The Democrats have been obsessed with impeaching him since day one of  his Presidency, and I absolutely mean day one. As the President was  taking the oath of office, sworn in to the Presidency, the Washington  Post ran this headline: ``The campaign to impeach President Trump has  begun.'' It was posted, actually, at 12:18, the day he took the oath of  office. The minute he took the oath of office, that headline was  posted.   So 3 years have passed, and impeachment is still taking up all the  Democrats' time, all their efforts, and all their energy. They are  fixated on it, and they are obsessed with it. As a doctor, in my  opinion, the Democrats have a bad case of impeachment fever, and it  seems that there is no cure for them.   We all know that Democrats deeply dislike this President. They have  from the moment he was elected in November 2016. Let me ask you: Does  that mean they get to overturn the last election? That is what they are  trying to do, not to mention interfere with the upcoming election. That  is really what it is--a bitterly partisan process.   Remember, it is being controlled by one political party. This is  totally partisan, and up to now, at least it has been conducted, prior  to today, in total secret, in the cellar, behind closed doors, and in  the shadows. That is the way they have done it. It is not a fair  process--no transparency and no accountability.   I think President Trump has a right to be treated fairly, yet his  rights have been completely ignored. The process, in my opinion, is  rigged against the President. The outcome is predetermined and fixed.  The Democratic House wins; the American public loses.   Democrats are so obsessed, they can't work. The people elected them  to do a job, to work for them, and they are nowhere to be found. The  Democrats, for example, will not pass defense funding, funding our  military, protecting our borders, protecting our Nation, and they will  not approve trade deals or lower drug costs. They will not even help  fix our aging roads and bridges.   Well, that is all bad news for the American people. All of this is  tied up in the impeachment obsession that is grinding the Democrats in  the House to a halt. The good news is, Republicans are highly resistant  to this fever, and so are most Americans.   We are not going to join the Democrats' impeachment campaign.  Republicans prefer to work on the issues we were elected to address-- jobs, the economy, national security--and we are going to continue to  work for the people who elected us.   I yield the floor.
