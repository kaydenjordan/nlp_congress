 Mr. President. Senator Pat Roberts has dedicated his life  to serving the Nation and the people of his home State of Kansas, and I  would like to take a moment to recognize his retirement.   During his 40 years of service in the U.S. Congress, Senator Roberts  has become a leader on agriculture, rural health and education, and  defense policy. Senator Roberts is the first Member of Congress to  chair the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee in both the  Senate and the House of Representatives. Through his work on this  committee and other, and across Congress, Senator Roberts has served  with honor and distinction, keeping foremost in mind the interests and  needs of Kansans.   Pat has been a true partner on the Agriculture Committee. His  methodical approach to bipartisanship mirrors my own efforts when I  served a chairman of that committee and worked with Senator Dick Lugar  to write and advance farm bills, nutrition laws, and conservation  policies. Under Pat's chairmanship, the committee was able to reach a  compromise on the 2018 farm bill, allowing for the inclusion of several  key policies to enhance rural development, support our farmers, and  fund vital nutrition programs. I know from negotiating the 1990 farm  bill as committee chairman that reaching a bipartisan and bicameral  consensus on such a substantial and sweeping piece of legislation is no  simple task. Pat's leadership through the process showed his deep  commitment to providing for the American people.   Pat and I have worked together, and we have traveled together. We  often chuckle that there are two bald men named Pat serving in the  Senate. While I will miss sharing that chuckle with my friend, I will  miss more his partnership and unwavering commitment to advancing  responsible policies and practices to support agricultural sectors  across the country. Pat and his wife Franki have become friends.  Marcelle and I wish them the very best.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Cory Gardner may be one of the younger  members of the Senate, but he has brought distinction and dedication to  his work on behalf of Coloradans. His entire career has been anchored  in legislative work, at the Federal and State levels, first as a Senate  staffer and then in the Colorado House of Representatives, before his  election to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives.   In both the State legislature and in the House of Representatives, he  focused primarily on energy and agriculture legislation. He brought  these priorities with him to Senate in 2015, through his work on the  Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and Commerce, Justice,  and Science Committees. As a Senator, Senator Gardner has often worked  across the aisle to find common ground and deliver for the people of  the United States. One recent example was the enactment of the  bipartisan Great American Outdoors Act, which became law in August.  This landmark bipartisan conservation legislation permanently funds the  Land and Water Conservation Fund, supports and creates countless jobs  in conservation and outdoor recreation, and protects our country's  natural beauty. Through the negotiation and passage of this bill,  Senator Gardner was at the table, trying to reach consensus and bring  about meaningful benefits for the American people. That is no easy task  and one which is not undertaken often in the Senate these days.   Senator Gardner will leave the Senate at the end of this Congress,  but I know his dedication to public service will remain. Marcelle and I  wish Senator Gardner, his wife Alyson, and the rest of their family the  very best in the next chapter of their lives.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as a nation, today we find ourselves  contemplating the key tenets upon which our country was founded: the  importance of truth and equality, the pursuit of justice, and the  determination of what is right. Doug Jones has pursued justice and has  fought for equality and for what is right for his entire career. Doug  is one of the most dedicated, thoughtful and decent public servants I  have ever had the privilege to know and work with in my time in the  Senate. He leaves the Senate having only furthered that record of  public service.   Doug brought with him to the Senate a passion for civil rights and  for resolving prior injustices. As U.S. attorney for the Northern  District of Alabama, he fought against entrenched racial injustice. He  prosecuted the men responsible for the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street  Baptist Church: and indicted domestic terrorist Eric Rudolph. In the  Senate, he continued the pursuit of justice as a vocal advocate for  greater government transparency and authored legislation that has  expanded access to criminal investigation records for civil rights  cases, helping families and individuals to resolve injustices after  decades of inaction.   I am certain that, even as he leaves the Senate, Doug will continue  to represent and to fight for what is right. His has been an important  and uniquely qualified voice for justice voice in the Senate these last  few years, and I will miss his sound judgment and thoughtful advocacy.  I know his long record of public service will only continue. Marcelle  and I wish Doug and his wife Louise and their entire family all the  best.   I have great respect for him. He is one of the most impressive  Senators I have served with, and I am so proud of all he has  accomplished                            ____________________     Mr. President, although Martha McSally only joined the  Senate in 2019, she has spent decades serving the Nation and the people  of the State of Arizona.   She served for decades as a fighter pilot in the U.S. Air Force, in  service to our country and to keep Americans safe. Upon her retirement  as colonel from the Air Force, she continued her career as a public  servant by representing Arizona's Second Congressional District in the  U.S. House of Representatives for 4 years before her appointment to the  Senate.   In the Senate, as she did in the House, Senator McSally has fought  hard to support veterans and has worked to further the interests of  Arizonans. Her sense of duty to her country and to her State allowed  her to make important contributions to the Senate Armed Services and  Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committees.   Senator McSally has also been a ``neighbor,'' with our offices both  on same floor of the Russell Senate Building. I thank Senator McSally  for her service in the Senate, and I wish her the best in the next  chapter of her life.   (At the request of Mr. Thune, the following statement was ordered to  be printed in the Record.)  [[Page S7496]]                                ____________________
