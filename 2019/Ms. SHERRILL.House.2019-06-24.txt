 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor our colleague,  Representative Bill Pascrell, for whom the fire headquarters in his  hometown of Paterson, New Jersey, is being named.   Representative Pascrell has been a tireless champion of our country's  firefighters. In 2000, he led the passage of the FIRE Act, the only  Federal program to deliver grant funds directly to local fire  departments. In 2015, he helped secure a $7.5 million grant for the  Paterson Fire Department, which prevented a dangerous reduction of  forces. He is co-chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus.   Just this month, I proudly cast my vote for Representative Pascrell's  amendment to increase funding for the Firefighter Cancer Registry to  ensure our firefighters can get the care they need.   As a representative of New Jersey and as an American, I am grateful  for all the work the Congressman has done to ensure protection and care  for the brave men and women who put their lives on the line to keep our  communities safe.   Though I regret I cannot be there with him this morning in Paterson,  I congratulate Representative Pascrell on this well-deserved honor.                            ____________________
