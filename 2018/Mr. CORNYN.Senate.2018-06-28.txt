 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am a day late with the news, but Justice  Anthony Kennedy, of course, announced  [[Page S4695]]  he is leaving the bench at the end of the month, and I would be remiss  if I didn't start my remarks this morning by thanking him for his 40- plus years of service to this country on the Federal bench.   He has presided over and authored the majority opinion in many high- stakes cases of national importance. As the news has pointed out, after  Sandra Day O'Connor left the Court, he has been that pivotal fifth vote  in a lot of really significant cases, which is to say, you can't really  typecast Justice Kennedy, but I do believe he has remained committed to  upholding the integrity of the legal system throughout the course of  his career.   I can say, as a former State supreme court justice myself, I know the  work he has been doing has been painstaking, time-consuming, and  extraordinarily important all at the same time. So I express my  gratitude, on behalf of my constituents, to Justice Kennedy for his  willingness, ability, and determination to carry out that work.   While serving on the Supreme Court for the last three decades, after  having been appointed by President Reagan, he has furthered the pursuit  of American justice, one case at a time, which is exactly what Justices  are supposed to do, through calm times and politically turbulent  times--perhaps, some might say, times like the present. He recognizes  that our core institutions are essentially democratic institutions,  answerable to the people through their elected representatives.   While the Court has a unique role in interpreting the Constitution-- which is the fundamental bedrock law of the Nation--in cases that don't  turn on the constitutionality of the statute, it is important to defer  to decisions made by the elected representatives of the people because  we are the ones accountable to the electorate for those decisions.  Judges, by their nature, are not because they aren't elected. They  don't run for election. So their fidelity is supposed to be to the law  and not to a personal agenda or politics or any other agenda.   Justice Kennedy was an important member of the Court that recognized  an individual right to bear arms under the Second Amendment and  recently upheld the President's prerogatives to protect national  security.   As Justice Kennedy concludes his term this next month, we, of course,  wish him well, along with his wife Mary and their children, and we wish  them many more happy--and, hopefully, a little less stressful--years  together.                  Filling the Upcoming Supreme Court Vacancy    Meanwhile, the Senate will conduct our constitutional role of  offering our advice and consent on whomever President Trump nominates.  As the senior Senator from Connecticut said yesterday, ``The Senate  should do nothing to artificially delay'' consideration of the next  Justice. I have heard conflicting views, but I agree with the senior  Senator from Connecticut.   This is consistent with the standard set by former President Obama  and Vice President Biden. In 2010--which was a midterm election--Senate  Democrats confirmed President Obama's nominee to the court, Elena  Kagan. Before that, when he was a Senator, Joe Biden argued that  Supreme Court nominees should not be confirmed during Presidential  election years. So one was a midterm, Elena Kagan. Merrick Garland-- whom we will hear more about from our Senate Democratic colleagues-- came up during a Presidential election, a time during which Joe Biden  said that nominees should not be confirmed in the runup to a  Presidential election.   After President Trump makes his selection, Senators will have the  opportunity to meet with the nominee, examine his or her  qualifications, and debate them. We will have a hearing under the  Senate Judiciary Committee. This will be the sixth Supreme Court  Justice nominee I will have had the privilege to serve on the Senate  Judiciary Committee for and question. Then, this fall, we will vote to  confirm Justice Kennedy's successor.   Justice Kennedy placed a deadline on his time in office. He is  retiring July 31. So any idea of delaying this and leaving the Court  shorthanded, particularly under these circumstances, really is beside  the point.   I know Chairman Grassley will, as usual, manage a fair, thorough, and  efficient confirmation process. He always does. It is crucial that as  this process begins to unfold, the President's nominee not be subjected  to personal attacks from an increasingly agitated and vitriolic  political base.   My philosophy on the role of a judge is simple: Decisions should not  be made on the basis of the judge's personal beliefs but from the  analysis of legal doctrine and actual reading of the legal texts. The  President, I believe, understands that. That is the sort of model out  of which Neil Gorsuch's nomination came. That is also why we confirmed  so many of his excellent choices in the 18 months of his  administration.   I look forward to another outstanding selection and a thorough and  efficient confirmation process. Then, in the end, we will vote to  confirm the President's nominee this fall.               Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act    Mr. President, on a separate note, yesterday, the White House  released a statement from President Trump regarding an important piece  of bipartisan legislation, which I introduced with the senior Senator  from California, Mrs. Feinstein, called the Foreign Investment Risk  Review Modernization Act or FIRRMA.   This concerns, as the Presiding Officer knows, the Committee on  Foreign Investment in the United States. Our adversaries around the  world have simply figured ways to game foreign investment in the United  States to get access to intellectual property and the know-how to  duplicate that property surreptitiously, taking advantage of the gaps  in the Committee on Foreign Investment's jurisdiction. So we are  updating that legislation. It passed unanimously out of the Banking  Committee, passed then out of the Armed Services Committee, and now is  a part of the Senate-passed Defense authorization bill.   As President Trump mentioned, this bill will enhance our ability to  protect the United States from new and evolving threats posed by  foreign investment while, at the same time, preserving our ability to  engage in international commerce and create new opportunities  benefiting our economy and our people.   Let me make clear, this is not to discourage foreign investment. I  think foreign investment is a good thing, but when our adversaries look  to exploit gaps and antiquated language in some of our statutes in  order to gain unfair advantage and seek access to intellectual property  in dual-use technology that has national security implications, we need  to act, and that is what we have done.   The President concluded that FIRRMA will provide much needed tools to  combat the predatory investment practices that threaten our critical  technology and national security. I think he is exactly right, and I am  glad he pledged to implement FIRRMA promptly and enforce it rigorously  once it is enacted into law.   I wish to express my appreciation to Treasury Secretary Mnuchin--who  is the convening authority of the Committee on Foreign Investment in  the United States--and the entire Cabinet for their input and their  support for what we are trying to do.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  following my remarks the statement in its entirety. I will read a  couple paragraphs because it was pretty strong. The President of the  United States said:         Should Congress fail to pass strong FIRRMA legislation that       better protects the crown jewels of American technology and       intellectual property from transfers and acquisitions that       threaten our national security--and future economic       prosperity--I will direct my Administration to deploy new       tools, developed under existing authorities, that will do so       globally.    What the President is saying, and what was reinforced by Secretary  Mnuchin in my conversations with him, is the President is depending on  this bipartisan legislation being enacted into law and providing the  tools necessary to protect our national security. If Congress, for some  reason, stumbles and fails to pass this legislation, the President has  made clear he intends to act unilaterally to fill that void.   I applaud the President and this administration for giving Congress a  [[Page S4696]]  chance to work with the administration to fill this gap through a  bipartisan, bicameral legislative process and to not just leap into  that void and try to do it unilaterally, perhaps causing more confusion  and less predictability.   In conclusion, the President said:         I applaud Congress on its progress toward passing robust       FIRRMA legislation. I urge Congress to send me a strong bill       as soon as possible and look forward to implementing it to       protect America's security and prosperity.    The Senate bill we passed takes a carefully tailored approach, and  the House passed a similar version earlier this week by a vote of 400  to 2.   I look forward to working with my colleagues throughout the Senate- House conference process to ensure the CFIUS review process is  sufficiently strengthened and meets the goals that we and the President  share.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       Statement From the President Regarding Investment Restrictions                         (Issued on: June 27, 2018)         I have often noted, consistent with the Section 301 action       initiated by the United States Trade Representative, that       certain countries direct and facilitate systematic investment       in United States companies and assets in order to obtain       cutting-edge technologies and intellectual property in       industries those countries deem important. Accordingly, I       directed the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with       other senior executive branch officials, to report to me       regarding appropriate measures to address these concerns.        I have been advised by the Secretary of the Treasury, the       Secretary of Commerce, the United States Trade       Representative, the Assistant to the President for Economic       Policy, and the Director of the Office of Trade and       Manufacturing Policy, among others, that Congress has made       significant progress toward passing legislation that will       modernize our tools for protecting the Nation's critical       technologies from harmful foreign acquisitions. This       legislation, the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization       Act (FIRRMA), will enhance our ability to protect the United       States from new and evolving threats posed by foreign       investment while also sustaining the strong, open investment       environment to which our country is committed and which       benefits our economy and our people.        After reviewing the current versions of FIRRMA with my team       of advisors--and after discussing them with many Members of       Congress--I have concluded that such legislation will provide       additional tools to combat the predatory investment practices       that threaten our critical technology leadership, national       security, and future economic prosperity. Therefore, upon       enactment of FIRRMA legislation, I will direct my       Administration to implement it promptly and enforce it       rigorously, with a view toward addressing the concerns       regarding state-directed investment in critical technologies       identified in the Section 301 investigation.        Should Congress fail to pass strong FIRRMA legislation that       better protects the crown jewels of American technology and       intellectual property from transfers and acquisitions that       threaten our national security--and future economic       prosperity--I will direct my Administration to deploy new       tools, developed under existing authorities, that will do so       globally.        To further ensure a robust defense of American technology       and intellectual property, I have also directed the Secretary       of Commerce to lead an examination of issues related to the       transfer and export of critical technologies. Through this       review, we will assess our Nation's export controls and make       any modifications that may be needed to strengthen them to       defend our national security and technological leadership.       Additionally, I have directed the Secretary of State, the       Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Defense, and the       United States Trade Representative to engage with our allies       and partners to support their efforts to combat harmful       technology transfer and intellectual property theft.        I applaud Congress on its progress toward passing robust       FIRRMA legislation. I urge Congress to send me a strong bill       as soon as possible and look forward to implementing it to       protect America's security and prosperity.     I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Arizona (Mr. McCain).    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander) and the Senator from Arizona  (Mr. McCain).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Alexander) would have voted ``nay.''    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the  Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander) and the Senator from Arizona  (Mr. McCain).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Alexander) would have voted ``yea.''    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 3170         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
