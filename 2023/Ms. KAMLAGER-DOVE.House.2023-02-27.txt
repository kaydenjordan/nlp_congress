 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res.  132 to respond to the devastating earthquakes in Turkiye and Syria.   Three weeks ago, the world watched in horror as one of the deadliest  earthquakes of the century hit southern Turkiye and northern Syria,  causing destruction of epic proportions. The damage affected 20 million  people in Turkiye and 8 million in Syria.   Amidst the tragedy, I recognize the heroism and courage of the nearly  240,000 rescue and aid workers who have responded to this disaster. I  am deeply proud that an urban search and rescue team from my district  in Los Angeles was deployed to Turkiye to assist in USAID's relief  efforts just 18 hours after the earthquake first hit. Eighty personnel  from the L.A. County Fire Department and eight members of the L.A.  Sheriff's Department led the search for survivors and assessed over  6,000 buildings to determine their safety for residents.   As is always the case when disaster strikes, those who suffer most  are the vulnerable and marginalized among us: civilians in rebel-led  Syria who have endured the horror of Russian airstrikes and Assad's  weaponization of aid; Syrian refugees seeking safety in Turkiye; and  pregnant women, children, the elderly, and disabled people.                            ____________________
