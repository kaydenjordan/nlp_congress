 Mr. President, first, on a very sad note, our hearts are  with East Lansing today, the campus, the entire community. We are  learning more about this terrible shooting. What happened there, on a  college campus, is devastating, and it breaks the hearts of Americans  everywhere.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 61, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to,  [[Page S402]]  the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 62, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 63, submitted earlier today.    I know of no further debate on the resolution.    I ask unanimous consent that the preamble be agreed to  and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 64, which was  submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, in this criminal case pending in Federal  district court in the District of Columbia and arising out of the  events of January 6, 2021, the prosecution has requested testimony from  a Senate witness.   In this case brought against Vitali GossJankowski trial is expected  to commence on February 27, 2023, and the prosecution has requested  testimony from Daniel Schwager, formerly counsel to the Secretary of  the Senate, concerning his knowledge and observations of the process  and constitutional and legal bases for Congress' counting of the  Electoral College votes. Senate Secretary Berry would like to cooperate  with this request by providing relevant testimony in this trial from  Mr. Schwager.   In keeping with the rules and practices of the Senate, this  resolution would authorize the production of relevant testimony from  Mr. Schwager, with representation by the Senate legal counsel.    I further ask that the resolution be agreed to, the  preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the  desk, and I ask for its first reading.    I now ask for a second reading, and in order to place  the bill on the calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I object to  my own request.    Mr. President, finally, I ask unanimous consent that  when the Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until  10 a.m. on Wednesday, February 15; that following the prayer and  pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings  be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that  following the conclusion of morning business, the Senate proceed to  executive session and resume consideration of the Nelson nomination,  postcloture, and that at 11:30 a.m. the Senate vote on confirmation of  the Nelson nomination; further, that if cloture is invoked on the Reyes  nomination, the confirmation vote occur at 4:30 p.m.; further, that at  1:50 p.m., the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the  Calbretta nomination, and if cloture is invoked, all postcloture time  be considered expired upon the disposition of the Reyes nomination;  further, that if any nominations are confirmed during Wednesday's  session, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's  actions.    For the information of the Senate, there will be two  rollcall votes at 11:30 a.m., one rollcall vote at 1:50 p.m., and up to  three rollcall votes at 4:30 p.m.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.
