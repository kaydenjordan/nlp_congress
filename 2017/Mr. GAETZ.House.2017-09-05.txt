 Madam Speaker, I take to the floor of the House today to  support President Trump's decision as it relates to DACA.   America must be a nation of laws, and those laws must be passed by  the Congress. This is the promise made in our Constitution and ensured  by our enduring liberty. President Obama was incorrect to unilaterally  act in this program; President Trump is correct to put the power back  in the hands of the people's representatives.   America must also be a nation of borders, and we erode the virtue and  value of those borders when we draw people across those borders  illegally. There is nothing compassionate about telling the rest of the  world that, so long as a child arrives here, that child will be treated  as if they have the same virtues and values of American citizens, if  they committed the criminal offense of unlawful entry into the country.   Challenges we have seen with undocumented minors being sent has  created humanitarian crises, and I believe that DACA and other programs  that draw those across our borders illegally have contributed to those  crises. I support the President. We should end DACA.                            ____________________
