 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for votes on June  18, 2019.   Had I been present, I would have voted no on both cloture and  confirmation of the nomination of Sean Cairncross to be Chief Executive  Officer of the Millennium Challenge Corporation.   I would have also voted no on cloture on the nominations of Matthew  J. Kacsmaryk to be United States District Judge for the Northern  District of Texas, Allen Cothrel Winsor to be United States District  Judge for the Northern District of Florida, James David Cain, Jr., to  be United States District Judge for the Western District of Louisiana,  and Greg Gerard Guidry to be United States District Judge for the  Eastern District of Louisiana.                            ____________________
