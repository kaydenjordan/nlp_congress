 Mr. Speaker, when my Lord, my savior, Jesus Christ, was  on this Earth, He said: Suffer the children to come to me and do not  deny them.   Unfortunately, this week, my Republican colleagues are bringing  forward a bill, H.R. 5, the so-called Parents Bill of Rights, which  will not teach our children to love, not teach them tolerance, not  teach them the plethora of issues and ideas that extend to all  Americans.   It will bring culture wars into our classrooms. It will deprive our  students of accurate and fact-based education. It will not teach them  tolerance and love.   Americans everywhere overwhelmingly agree that Congress should focus  on tangible assistance that will improve student outcomes, not  polarizing culture wars. The pandemic has already erased years of  learning from our children, and nothing in this legislation will  address that issue.   We have not had one hearing on gun violence in our classrooms.  Instead, we are prioritizing MAGA talking points over improving student  outcomes.    Let's get back to the people's business. Let's teach tolerance and  love to our children. Let parents open their hearts and their  children's hearts to what needs to be done.                            ____________________
