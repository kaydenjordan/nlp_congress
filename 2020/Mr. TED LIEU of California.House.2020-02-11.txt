 Madam Speaker, last week Donald Trump  came onto this House floor, looked the American people in the eye, and  he stated: `` . . . we will always protect your Medicare, and we will  always protect your Social Security.''   That statement is false. We know that statement is false because  Donald Trump released his budget, and the Donald Trump budget cuts over  $1.5 trillion from Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.   Let me say that again.   The Donald Trump budget cuts over $1.5 trillion from Medicare,  Medicaid, and Social Security.   The Donald Trump budget cuts over $1.5 trillion from Medicare,  Medicaid, and Social Security.   The Donald Trump budget cuts over $1.5 trillion from Medicare,  Medicaid, and Social Security.   The Donald Trump budget cuts over $1.5 trillion from Medicare,  Medicaid, and Social Security.                            ____________________
