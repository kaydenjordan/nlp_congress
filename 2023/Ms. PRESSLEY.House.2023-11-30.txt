 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember three  generational leaders who have earned the honor of being eulogized in  this great Chamber and in perpetuity in our Congressional Record:  Saundra Graham, Pearline James, and Mukiya Baker-Gomez, three  incredible Black women whose love for community was manifest in their  historic achievements and legacy they invite us all to aspire to.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to mark the passing of Ms. Saundra Graham.  Saundra Graham's contributions to Cambridge and the Commonwealth far  outpace her impressive and well-earned list of titles: first woman of  color elected to the Cambridge City Council, the first woman of color  to be the vice mayor, six-term State representative, secretary to the  National Black Caucus of Local Elected Officials, founder of the  Massachusetts Childcare Coalition, cofounder of the Riverside  Cambridgeport Community Development Corporation, among others.   Saundra Graham truly was a trailblazer on a mission to do good along  the way, and she wasn't afraid to make good trouble in the name of  justice both inside and outside of politics.   She was a tenacious truth-teller, and I count myself amongst those  who will miss her righteous reprimands. Her impact is an indelible one  which will endure throughout our Commonwealth and in her loving family,  which I know was her greatest legacy as she was a proud mother,  grandmother, great-grandmother, and great-great-grandmother.   May she rest in peace and power.                       Paying Tribute to Pearline James     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to an  incredible woman of faith, Pearline James. In church, I grew up singing  a song, ``They Will Know We Are Christians by Our Love.'' Indeed, Mrs.  James was God's love in action.   Pastor Pearline James served God and her community as an associate  pastor at Full Life Gospel Center in Dorchester. She did this with  love, dedication, and compassion for all God's children.  [[Page H5994]]    It is no surprise, as one of 21 siblings and the second eldest, that  she was a mother and nurturer to many. She brought life and love to  every child and family that passed through her and her beloved husband  Evans' childcare center in their home, J.P. Family Childcare, in the  1970s. She was passionate about education, and at the age of 60, she  returned to school, earning a degree and graduating with a 3.8 GPA.   While Mrs. James laid in hospice, the true impact of the love she  imparted to the city was on full display, and nurses were quoted saying  she had no less than 300 visitors.   Her daughter Denella said her mother often would invoke the lyrics of  ``It Is Well With My Soul,'' a gospel hymn whose words include:  ``Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say, it is well, it is well  with my soul.''   She is survived by the great love of her life, Evan, by her  daughters, Denella, Rosemarie, and Debby, and 10 grandchildren and 15  great-grandchildren.                         Honoring Mukiya Baker-Gomez     Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a woman, leader,  mentor, and brilliant strategist on whose shoulders so many electoral  firsts stand on, including myself, Mukiya Baker-Gomez.   In 2018, I became the first person of color to represent the  Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the House of Representatives in the  Commonwealth's 230-year history. That foundation, that possibility, the  literal electoral blueprint to winning elections in Boston and building  coalitions, began with Mukiya Baker-Gomez. Her political acumen and  shrewd counsel were enviable, and her commitment to community  unwavering and unshakeable, especially to Black people.   Her every move and impact outside of politics has been even greater.  She played a key role in an inclusive economy, fighting to ensure that  contractors of color would be prioritized. She was a historymaker,  although she never chased a title.   It was important to me to eulogize her because I will not have her  contributions erased or unacknowledged.   I thank Mukiya for everything. I love and miss her.   She is survived by the love of her life, Kevin; her loving children,  Talisha and Kenyatta; her siblings; and a host of family by blood and  by bond.   I thank Mukiya for her sacrifice and tenacity and for always speaking  truth to power.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, had I been present, I would have voted  ``no'' on rollcall No. 683, Ogles No. 8.
