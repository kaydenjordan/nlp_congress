 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the  time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Res. 79, a glorified press  release that the majority is having this Chamber spend time on during  another yet underwhelming legislative week.   At a time when the country expects its leaders in Washington to look  forward, this House majority is looking backwards. When our country  expects solutions, they are using this Chamber to settle political  scores.   As hundreds of thousands of Americans painfully experienced, portions  of our Federal Government were shut down for 35 days, a shameful record  under this majority's watch. It was a shutdown that never had to  happen.   Let's recall last December when this House passed an appropriations  bill that would have funded the government, secured the border, and  provided disaster assistance to the millions affected by hurricanes and  fires. Most importantly, it was a bill that would have been signed into  law. This occurred after then-Leader Pelosi declared in the Oval Office  earlier that month that a House majority couldn't pass such a bill.   That legislation went to the Senate and, alas, Senator Schumer  stopped it. And in doing so, once again, Senator Schumer shut this  government down.   From the moment Senator Schumer blocked consideration of that  appropriation bill, President Trump and congressional Republicans  offered solution after solution after solution after solution to solve  the challenge. In all, the President offered four reasonable solutions  to end the shutdown and secure the border.   The Democrats never offered one. In fact, they went on vacation and  political fundraisers to Puerto Rico. They littered this Chamber with  messaging bills that didn't come close to solving the problem and would  never be signed into law.   Mr. Speaker, I want to focus on the very last solution the President  offered. I want to focus on it because it met the Democrats halfway. It  was the truest form of compromise this town has seen in quite some  time. It would have secured portions of the border with barriers, and  it would have provided certainty to the very communities that my  friends on the other side of the aisle have stood on this floor for  countless hours to claim they want to help.   Instead, Mr. Speaker, the actions of this majority when presented  with that opportunity and following the shutdown tell you all you need  to know about who they truly want to help.   Do you know who they want to help? Themselves.   After the President signed a 3-week continuing resolution, the  Speaker gloated with a Presidential-style enrollment ceremony.  Democrats marveled at her exercise of raw political motivation. Many in  the media responded like they were beat reporters from their hometown  team. This all sounds like a historic event.    What exactly was everyone celebrating? They were celebrating nothing.  They were celebrating achieving nothing. They were celebrating the  status quo that suits their political interest and personal pursuits of  self-righteousness, a status quo that causes pain and suffering for  Americans across this country.   Here are just a few examples:   There have been 266,000 criminal aliens arrested in the last 2 years.  This includes charges and convictions of 100,000 assaults, nearly  30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings.   Three hundred Americans die every week from heroin, and more than 90  percent of heroin comes from across the southern border.   Roughly 10,000 children are being smuggled into the U.S. every year  to be sold for human trafficking.   They are celebrating a status quo that leaves 700,000 DACA-designated  individuals unsure about their future.   It was the best display of politics that this country is sick and  tired of seeing: zero-sum politics and nothing ever changes.   I would like to spend some time and reflect on Americans and their  families who may not have been celebrating the status quo preserved by  this majority:   Jerry David;   Sherri David;   Deputy Josie Greathouse Fox;   Pierce Corcoran;   Officer Ronil Singh;   Clinton Howell;   Robert Page;   Justin Lee;   Ellie Bryant;   Grayson Hacking;   Dominic Durden;   Edwin Jackson;   Grant Ronnebeck;   Kenneth Scott Mahr;   Officer Kevin Will;   Sergeant Brandon Mendoza;   Sergeant Cory Wride;   Josh Wilkerson;   Spencer Golvach;   Kate Steinle;   Detective Michael Davis;   Deputy Danny Oliver;   Bob Barry;   Parker Moore;   Officer Andy Chavez;   Lauren Bump;   Louise Sollowin;   Serenity Reedy;   Vanessa Pham;   Kathleen Byham;   Agent Brian Terry;   Officer Henry Canales;   Donald Mayle;   Breanna Schneller;   Jennifer Lee Hampton;   Officer Andrew Widman;   Officer Rodney Johnson;   Buddy Mason;   Adrienne Shelly;   Mollie Tibbetts;   Ronald da Silva;   Sarah Root;   Drew Rosenberg;   Kara Willingham;   Oscar Navarro;  [[Page H1313]]    Margaret Kostelnik;   Andres Duran;   Rocky Jones; and   Michael Grubbs.   These are just 50 names of Americans whose lives have been lost to  illegal immigration. They no longer have their voice, but we can and  must be their voice today. And if these names sound familiar, it is  because we heard them on the news.   I would like to reflect on others who certainly weren't celebrating  the status quo.                                time  1300    The names may sound familiar because these are the same individuals  who then-Leader Pelosi set a record on this floor just a year ago in  February for more than 8 hours defending the passion of DACA and  shutting the government down: Vanessa Rodriguez; Ana Sanchez; Juan  Escalante; Cesar Vargas; Nicole Robles; Jacqueline Romo; Andrea Sibra;  Cesar Espinoza; Denise Rojas; Ray Pineta; Kelly; Crystal; Carlos;  Marian; Brittany; Hugo; Fernando; Javier Noras; Marco Dorado; Mayra;  Fernanda Herrera; Emily; Claudia; Bruna; Cynthia Sanchez; Jose  Castillo; Hugo Alexander Acosta; Denia Candela; Luis Galvin; Hector  Rivera Suarez; Dalia Medina; Juan Carlos Navarro; Patricia Yulowa;  Maria Praley; Jose Manuel Santobo; Carlos Emilio Diaz; Luis Roberto  Ucerra; Sofia De La Varga; Novella Vladimar; Gloria Riconni; Alonzo  Rivarola; Yuri Hernandez; Oscar Canajoe, Jr.; Ashley Lamadrid; Gladys  Clompka; Denaya Joseph; Miriam Ochoa Garbay; Han Yoon Li.   Mr. Speaker, as this House adjourns for the week today--after just  one rule bill--I implore my colleagues to take some time and think  deeply about these individuals, their families, and what our country  stands for. It certainly isn't this political stunt by this majority,  and it certainly isn't the status quo they are so proud to protect.   As Members of the U.S. House of Representatives, we are a very small  group with a very large responsibility. The burden on us 435 Americans  is to represent 325 million Americans faithfully and to work together  so tomorrow is better than today. Let us not let these political  distractions get in the way of our duty. Instead, let's actually work  together to give a voice to the voiceless.
