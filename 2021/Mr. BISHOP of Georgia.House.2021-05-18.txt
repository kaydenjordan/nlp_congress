 Madam Speaker, millions of people here and  around the globe were shocked to learn of the shootings at three  Atlanta spas last March that killed eight people and injured one. Six  of the eight victims were of Asian descent.   Many of us saw a link between the discriminatory and often hateful  rhetoric against the Asian-American community during the COVID-19  pandemic and this unspeakable act of violence. In fact, the last year  has seen an unacceptable rise in anti-Asian racism and violent attacks,  especially against the elderly. There are many such incidents across  the nation that are said to be unreported as well.   As the Dean of the Georgia Delegation, I strongly condemn these  heinous acts of violence against our Asian-American brothers and  sisters. They have no place in Georgia or anywhere else in our nation  for that matter.   I therefore urge my colleagues to support not only this important  resolution to condemn this act of violence and to remember the lives  that were so tragically taken from us last March in Atlanta. I also  urge them to support the bipartisan COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act to bolster  the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes in the United States.
