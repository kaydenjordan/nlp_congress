 Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking the thousands  of firefighters who, each year, put their lives at risk to battle  wildfires like those that have plagued California and other western  States. We owe it to them, as well as to the American people, to use  every measure available to fight fires in ways that reduce the risk to  those firefighters and the risk of losing lives and property among our  population.   Just in the last year, and that is in 2018, wildfires in California  burned 1,117,000 acres. Nationally, there was 6.5 million acres burned.  In California, we had six fatalities. Nationally, there were 16  fatalities. California property losses were 2,356 houses--those are  people's homes--and 1,239 nonresidential buildings.   On that note, today, I would like to draw the attention of my  colleagues and the American people to what I consider to be an  inexcusable roadblock that is stopping the implementation of new,  innovative, and tested effective firefighting technology.   In 2008, I helped secure funding for research and testing of the  technology that ultimately became Precision Containerized Aerial  Delivery System, or PCADS.                                time  1030    It was designed specifically for military aircraft, including the C- 17s and the C-130s and others as well. It has been tested over the  years and proven to deliver massive amounts of water or fire retardant  onto fires using GPS and other expertise. It is safer, more accurate,  and much more effective than traditional aerial firefighting.   Yet a decade later, this technology has not been put to use despite  the Air National Guard's report determining that the PCADs are  operationally effective and appropriate for the use of C-130  firefighting aircraft or military aircraft that can be made for  firefighting. This has been deemed operational, yet for the last 8  months, while we have lost all of these homes and all of these lives,  hundreds of these aircraft, C-130s and C-17s, have sat on the tarmac.   This aircraft was designed for military use, but without  modification, can save the lives and homes of American citizens  throughout this country who are victimized by wildfires and other types  of fires. The primary responsibility of our government is to protect  the lives of our people with the best available tools, and it is  certainly not doing so.   I include in the Record, Mr. Speaker, letters that I have written to  the Director of our Air National Guard; to Secretary Mattis, the  Secretary of Defense; and to Heather Wilson, the Secretary of the Air  Force.                                  Congress of the United States,                                       House of Representatives,                                                    August 30, 2018.      Lt. Gen. L. Scott Rice,      Director, Air National Guard,      Washington, DC.        Dear General Rice: I draw your attention to our military's       bureaucratic inertia that has led to a needless loss of life       and a tremendous loss of property. I am referring to the vast       damage caused in the Western United States, specifically       California, by out-of-control wildfires which have plagued       the region for the last few months. This loss of life and       property could have been dramatically curtailed had our       military acted upon an option that was, and is, readily       available.        Our inventory of C-130 and C-17 aircraft, with inexpensive       and slight interior modifications, could be used as a major       firefighting asset that could make a major difference.       Instead, these potential incredible firefighting assets sat       as California burned. Using these aircraft as valuable       firefighting assets would not involve any alteration of the       aircraft. This option however has been available and ignored.        I call your attention to the Precision Container Aerial       Delivery System (PCADS). I helped win Congressional approval       in the 2008 appropriations bill wherein $2.3 million was       provided for the research and testing of this system. It is       ten years later, and I am frustrated that it has not been       used to protect our citizens, our homes, our businesses, and       our wildlands.        The Air National Guard determined that PCADS is       operationally effective and is appropriate for C-130       firefighting. The final report on PCADS that found it to be a       reliable option was released in January 2018, yet seven       months later there has been no action taken to deploy the       system. During those seven months, we have suffered 109 large       fires which have burned 1.9 million acres, caused 16 fire       fatalities, and destroyed 2,356 houses. During this time, our       C-130's and C-17's equipped with this system could have had a       major impact on these fires. This is utterly unacceptable       when we have a proven technology that responds faster and       delivers massive quantities of water and fire retardant with       GPS directed drops in contrast to the status quo.       Furthermore, military transport aircraft can be rapidly and       easily reloaded with water or fire retardant as compared to       any other system. When the American people discover how       bureaucratic intransigence has caused such preventable       wildfire damage they will be justifiably outraged.        Today, I am demanding that actions be taken upon receipt of       this letter to facilitate the use of this simple and       inexpensive technology which will easily turn our inventory       of C-130's and C-17's into firefighting water and fire-      retardant bombers.        I hope you will take this letter seriously enough in order       to prevent even more damage in the state of California and       elsewhere.            Yours sincerely,                                          Dana Rohrabacher (CA 48),      Member of Congress.                                   ____                                      Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                                    August 30, 2018.

Mr. Speaker, I would hope that we would get some  support from these leaders who have been appointed by President Trump  to protect the American people in any way they can.   Having these airplanes sit on the tarmac in California and elsewhere  throughout this country when they could drop fire retardant and massive  amounts of fire retardant water saving homes--little cul de sacs that  would catch on fire and be destroyed, one flight over those cul de sacs  could have saved them.   Thousands of people have lost their lives needlessly because of  bureaucratic intransigence in our military, so we are calling on the  Air National Guard, the Air Force, and, of course, our Secretary of  Defense to unblock this impediment to protecting the lives of our  people with U.S. military equipment that can do the job.                            ____________________
