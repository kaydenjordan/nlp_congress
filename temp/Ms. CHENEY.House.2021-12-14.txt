 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, as Chairman Thompson noted, we are here with great  sadness. We are here recognizing and understanding the serious nature  of this situation. And, Madam Speaker, we wish we had another  alternative. We wish that we did not have to meet today to urge our  colleagues to vote criminal contempt for one of our former colleagues  and the former chief of staff to President Trump.   We don't take this step lightly.   As my colleagues have noted, and will no doubt say again today, for  weeks the committee has worked with Mr. Meadows, with his counsel to  reach an agreement on cooperation, to reach an agreement and  accommodation.   Now, the reality, Madam Speaker, is the accommodations process is a  process that takes place between the legislative branch and the  executive branch. Mr. Meadows is a member of neither, and yet, the  committee has taken the extra step of working to try to make sure that  we do everything we can to secure Mr. Meadows' testimony.   He is improperly asserting executive and other privileges, but the  vote on contempt today relates principally to his refusal to testify  about messages and other communications that he admits are not  privileged. He has not claimed, and he does not have, privilege to  refuse entirely to testify regarding these topics.   There are just three examples I will give you this afternoon of  issues which we need to speak to Mr. Meadows about and on which his  testimony is required, indeed compelled by our subpoena.   First, is President Trump's failure to stop the violence when this  Chamber, and indeed, the entire Capitol building was attacked and  invaded. The mob that attacked this Chamber was summoned to Washington  by President Trump. And as many of those involved have admitted on  videotape and social  [[Page H7786]]  media and in Federal District Court, they were provoked to violence by  President Trump's false claims that the election was stolen.   As the violence unfolded that afternoon, nearly 1 year ago, it was  evident to all, not only to those of us who were in the Chamber at that  time. It was covered in real time by almost every news channel. But for  187 minutes, President Trump refused to act. Let's let that sink in,  Madam Speaker. He refused to act. When action by our President was  required, it was essential, and it was compelled by his oath to our  Constitution.   Mr. Meadows received numerous text messages which he has produced  without any privilege claim imploring that Mr. Trump take the specific  action we all know his duty required. Indeed, some of those text  messages, Madam Speaker, came from Members in the Chamber right now,  Members who understood that a violent assault was underway at the  Capitol, Members who pleaded with the chief of staff to get the  President to take action. Dozens of texts, including from Trump  administration officials and Members of Congress urged that the  President take immediate action.   I read a number of these last night at our hearing. I won't read them  all today, but I will read a few of them. ``Mark,'' one Member said:  ``he needs to stop this. Now.'' In all caps: ``TELL THEM TO GO HOME.''  ``POTUS has to come out firmly and tell the protestors to dissipate.  Someone is going to get killed.''   Indeed, a number of members of the press, a number of Members of this  body, a member of the President's own family, all urged the President  to take action because they understood that the President of the United  States had a responsibility to call off the mob.   Hours passed despite this without any action by the President. All of  these texts are nonprivileged. They are texts that Mr. Meadows has  turned over. And they are evidence of President Trump's supreme  dereliction of duty for 187 minutes. And Mr. Meadows' testimony will  bear on another fundamental question before this committee, and that is  whether Donald J. Trump, through action or inaction, corruptly sought  to obstruct or impede Congress' official proceeding to count electoral  votes.   This committee is entitled to Mr. Meadows' testimony, and it will  inform our legislative judgments. But Mr. Meadows has refused to give  any testimony at all, even regarding nonprivileged topics. He is in  contempt of Congress.   Second, Mr. Meadows has knowledge regarding President Trump's efforts  to persuade State officials to alter official election results.   In Georgia, for instance, Mr. Meadows participated in a phone call  between President Trump and the Georgia secretary of state. Mr. Meadows  was actually on the phone when President Trump asked the secretary of  state to ``find 11,780 votes'' to change the results of the  Presidential election in Georgia. That is the President of the United  States telling a State official to ``find 11,780 votes.''   While this was happening, Mr. Meadows appears to have been texting  with another participant on this call. Mr. Meadows has no conceivable  privilege basis to refuse to testify on this topic. He is in contempt  of Congress.   Third, in the weeks before January 6, President Trump's appointees at  the Justice Department informed him repeatedly that the President's  claims of election fraud were not supported by the evidence and that  the election was not, in fact, stolen.   President Trump intended to appoint Jeffrey Clark as attorney general  in part so that Mr. Clark could alter the Department of Justice's  conclusions regarding the election. Mr. Clark has now informed this  committee that he anticipates potential criminal prosecution related to  these matters and, therefore, intends in upcoming testimony to invoke  his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.   As Mr. Meadows' nonprivileged texts reveal, Mr. Meadows communicated  multiple times with another Member of this body who was working with  Mr. Clark. Mr. Meadows has no basis to refuse to testify regarding  those communications. He is in contempt.   January 6 was without precedent. There has been no stronger case in  our Nation's history for a congressional investigation into the actions  of a former President. This body must investigate the facts in detail,  and we are entitled to ask Mr. Meadows about the nonprivileged  materials he has produced to us.   Madam Speaker, I am sure you will hear my colleagues this afternoon  say that there are privilege issues here that must be resolved before  we can move forward. Any argument that the courts need to resolve  privilege issues first is a pretext. We will question Mr. Meadows about  emails and texts he gave us without any privilege claim.   Mr. Meadows' role in the Raffensperger call cannot be privileged, nor  can his dealings with a Member of this body regarding Jeff Clark. This  committee must get to the objective truth and ensure that January 6  never happens again.   Madam Speaker, Mr. Meadows is in contempt. He must testify. And I  urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren).                                time  1730     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, let me just make sure people understand some facts in  light of some of the charges that the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Jordan)  just made, which are flat false.   Number one, Mr. Meadows refused to show up for his deposition. The  committee scheduled a deposition after extensive coordination with Mr.  Meadows on a day that he chose, that he selected, and then he refused  to show up.   He refused to show up to testify about nonprivileged questions. My  colleague from Ohio can talk as much as he would like about executive  privilege and about George Washington and about the extent to which it  is crucial for the survival of the Republic, with which I agree, but we  are talking here about testimony about nonprivileged materials.   Secondly, Madam Speaker, I would say that we all on this side of the  aisle used to be in agreement about what had happened on January 6.  There was a brief period of time, days perhaps, when we were in  agreement.   Standing--perhaps at this microphone--the minority leader, Kevin  McCarthy, said this on January 13: ``The President bears responsibility  for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters. He should have  immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding. These  facts require immediate action by President Trump. . . .''   Unfortunately, Mr. McCarthy's position changed on this issue. Mr.  McCarthy then worked against, voted against the resolution that would  have created a bipartisan commission to investigate these matters, and  he withdrew his nominees to this committee. Let me say that again. He  withdrew his nominees to this committee.   This committee is engaged in critical investigative and legislative  activity for which there is no greater purpose in terms of Congress'  responsibility, no matter what my colleague on the other side may claim  in terms of Mr. Meadows.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Aguilar).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, President Trump is hiding behind executive privilege.  All of my colleagues, all of them knew that what happened on January 6  was an assault on our Constitution. They knew it at the time, yet now  they are defending the indefensible.   Whether we tell the truth, get to the truth and defend ourselves  against it ever happening again is the moral test of our time. How we  address January 6 is the moral test of our generation.   It is very sad to see how my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle are addressing this issue. Mr. Meadows  [[Page H7794]]  has refused to testify about nonprivileged material. He is in contempt.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
