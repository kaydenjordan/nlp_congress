 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak on two  significant issues that affect the brave individuals who have fought  for our Nation.   First, almost a quarter of all veterans in the United States-- approximately 4.7 million--reside in rural communities. While veterans  may enjoy the benefits of rural living, they also experience unique  challenges in accessing the healthcare they need and deserve.   Currently, through reauthorization, the Department of Veterans  Affairs grant program for the transportation of highly rural veterans  appropriates $3 million for the Department to provide transportation in  rural areas. This program should not need annual reauthorization; it  should be made permanent.   Second, the Veterans Benefits Administration has moved to  electronically process over 99 percent of compensation claims since the  implementation of the Veterans Benefits Management System. This  transition has been key in reducing the backlog of claims, modernizing  the Federal Government, and improving efficiency.   I propose amending title 38 of the United States Code to assist the  VA as they modernize and utilize today's technological advancements in  order to best serve our veterans.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in working on  legislation that will fix these oversights and to further support every  person who serves our Nation.                            ____________________
