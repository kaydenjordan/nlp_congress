 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to  complete my remarks in the unlikely event I don't finish them by 12:30.    Mr. President, I want to talk again for a few minutes  about S. 1, which is sponsored by Senator Rubio.   As I have cautioned the last few times I spoke on the subject,  nothing I say is meant to be construed as a criticism of Senator Rubio.  There are some really good things in this bill, as the Presiding  Officer knows.   I forget the title of it. I think Senator Rubio is calling it the  Strengthening America's Security in the Middle East Act. I like the  fact that S. 1 reaffirms our commitment to protecting Israel. I think  that is important. I think Israel is certainly our best friend in the  Middle East and one of our best friends in the world. Some days I think  Israel is our only friend in the world.   S. 1 is going to strengthen America's bonds with Jordan, and I think  that is very important. Jordan has been a key ally in fighting  terrorism and, frankly, a key ally in helping us deal with the  humanitarian catastrophe as a result of Assad and his butchering of his  own people in Syria.   S. 1 is going to combat a radical economic warfare campaign against  our friend Israel. That is long overdue. S. 1 is also going to create  new sanctions on the Government of Syria. I support all of those. I  intend to vote for S. 1, despite the fact that, in my opinion, there is  a great deficiency with S. 1.   I know Senator McConnell offered an amendment to reflect the will of  the Senate with respect to whether America ought to get out of Syria.  In his amendment, he suggested that we should not. I voted against  Senator McConnell's amendment not because I think he is wrong but  because I just don't know if he is right. I don't think most Members of  Congress know.   We have received such conflicting information, and I have asked  Senator McConnell to hold a briefing for us--a classified briefing in  which we bring over people who think we should get out and people who  think we shouldn't get out, and let us hear the facts and the informed  opinions of people who know better than we do. Frankly, I would like to  see us do the same thing with respect to Afghanistan.   I share the President's concern about nation-building. We have spent  $6 trillion since 2001 in the Middle East. I share the President's  concern about mission creep. But, once again, just as I am not saying  that Senator McConnell is wrong; I just don't know that he is right,  and, quite frankly, I am saying the same thing with respect to  President Trump. I am not saying he is wrong about withdrawing from  Syria; I am just saying I don't know if he is right.   I do know this: President Trump is going to do what he thinks is best  for America. The Senate can pass all of the bills and resolutions about  the will of the Senate that it wants to, but if the President of the  United States thinks it is best for the American people and the world  to withdraw all troops from Syria, then my experience is, by God, he is  going to do it.   If he does it, one of my biggest concerns, which could have been  addressed in this bill, is if we would have been allowed to offer  amendments, supposedly as the world's greatest deliberative body, we  could have fixed this problem. The problem I am talking about is the  Syrian Kurds.   Let's just call it like it is. I mentioned that Israel has been a  great ally, as well as Jordan. This bill is being sold as, well, this  is to protect our allies in the Middle East, in part. What about the  Syrian Kurds?   I think there are 50 or 60 million Kurds throughout the world. They  are mostly in Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. Why aren't the Kurds  allowed to self-determine?   Even if the Kurds didn't believe in democracy--and I think they do;  they want sovereignty like we have, and they want to be able to self- determine--the truth is, we wouldn't have beaten back ISIS without the  help of the Syrian Kurds.   I don't want to get off into this discussion about whether or not  ISIS is defeated. If you look at just the statistics, a couple of years  ago, there were 100,000 ISIS jihadists. There are not 100,000 now.  There are less than 5,000. A couple of years ago, ISIS had its own  caliphate. They just went in there and carved out their own country.  They don't have it anymore.   So you can debate whether we defeated them. I am not sure we will  ever  [[Page S847]]  completely defeat the jihadists, whether they call themselves ISIS or  al-Qaida or what. But I know this much: We could not have beaten back  ISIS without the help of the Syrian Kurds.   A lot of our other friends said: Yeah, you go get them. You go fight.  We will be glad to hold your coat while you fight. That was not the  Syrian Kurds. They got in there with us.   The Syrian Kurds have enemies in this world. I am not making any  accusations or disparaging comments about our friends in Turkey, but  President Erdogan has been very vocal about how he feels about the  Kurds, including, but not limited to, the Syrian Kurds. I worry about  them if we leave.   I had an amendment that didn't require--it didn't require--anybody to  do anything. It just said: Mr. President, if we leave Syria, this will  give you the authority to keep our friends, our allies, the Syrian  Kurds, from being butchered, from being opened up like a soft peanut.   America's foreign policy has never been just about interests; it has  been about values. America's foreign policy has always had a moral  component. Part of the moral component in our foreign policy is that we  don't leave our friends behind. That is what we are potentially doing  with this bill.   It could have been easily fixed. It could have been fixed if the  Senate had been allowed to be the U.S. Senate.   I don't hate anyone. I love and respect all of my colleagues, and I  mean that--even the jurists and everybody in their own way, especially  in this body, and I have gotten to know all of them, and I am so proud  to be a Member. But it does bother me sometimes; it seems we are kind  of like--it is almost Orwellian. We are all equal, but some of us are  more equal than others, and I think that irks the American people. I  think had we been able to offer amendments, we could have fixed that  problem with the Syrian Kurds.   I hope I don't have to come back and say told you so. I hope after we  leave Syria--and I think the President is going to leave Syria--I hope  the Syrian Kurds are just fine. I hope they are just fine. But if they  are not, I hope we will not look back and say that we had a chance to  protect our friends and do the right thing, but we didn't do it.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
