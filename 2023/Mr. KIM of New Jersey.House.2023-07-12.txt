 Mr. Chairman, I believe you can tell a lot  about the values of a nation based on how  [[Page H3239]]  they treat and care for those who step up and are entrusted with  defending the nation. If we are honest with ourselves, we don't always  keep our promises, and we don't always do enough for them.   We have servicemembers who are struggling with food insecurity and  mental health challenges. We have military families struggling with  rising costs and prices, issues that we can better deal with, whether  childcare or others.   To have the best and strongest military, we need to be the best and  strongest employer. This NDAA is our chance to do better.   So far, this NDAA takes some important steps to improve the quality  of life for our servicemembers and their families. It gives a needed  pay raise, and it takes action to address suicide and childcare needs.  There is more that we need to do, but these are important steps  forward.   I have also seen and heard of provisions and amendments, though, that  would make it harder for servicemembers to get access to the care that  they need or to know and feel that they are welcome and supported by  our military and our country.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose efforts that would do  that and that would jeopardize some of the gains for our military  families that are in this NDAA and make it harder for us to recruit for  our all-volunteer force, a force that is the most diverse fighting  force on this planet.   As mentioned, I do believe that the last place that partisan politics  belongs is in our national security. That is something that we should  fiercely protect when we are talking about this NDAA. Our military  families deserve better, and this is our opportunity to show them that  they are our top priority.   This is our chance to pay tribute to the anniversary of our all- volunteer force by creating support for our servicemembers that can be  sustained for the next 50 years.                                time  1445
