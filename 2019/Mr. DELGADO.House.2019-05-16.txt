 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Infrastructure  Week and call attention to the urgent need for investment in rural  areas like mine in upstate New York.   As an example, every time I am home in my district, I hear from folks  about the need to invest in infrastructure to help our family farmers  succeed.   When farmers drive their livestock or dairy products down to New York  City or the immediately surrounding areas, they need bridges and roads  they can rely on, structures that can carry product without potholes or  fear of collapse.   But infrastructure does not just mean bridges, roads, and seaports.  It means access to markets through high-speed internet.   Astoundingly, 25 million Americans lack rural broadband. This means  25 million Americans who own small businesses, operate small farms,  want to apply for college online, or do homework, or access lifesaving  medicine cannot, because they lack internet access.   This week, I was proud to launch, with the leadership of Whip  Clyburn, a task force on rural broadband.   I am ready to partner with folks on both sides of the aisle to  address the need to rebuild our infrastructure and access broadband  both in upstate New York and across the country.   Let's get this done.                            ____________________
