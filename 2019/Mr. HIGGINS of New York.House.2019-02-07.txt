 Madam Chair, I rise in strong support on  passage of H.R. 840, the Veterans' Access to Child Care Act, to provide  childcare assistance to our military families.   Nearly a decade ago, the Veterans Administration survey found that  over 1 in 10 veterans have had to cancel their VA medical appointments  due to the lack of childcare. In response, Congress created the VA  childcare pilot program. The first in the Nation opened in my hometown  of Buffalo, New York.   The program has been a tremendous success. Since its inception, it  has served countless military families. Last year, more than 1,000  children visited the Kids Korner, located at the Buffalo VA Center,  while their parents received much-needed care.   America's veterans placed their lives on the front lines for our  freedoms. Many veterans returned to their families from combat with  injuries and post-traumatic stress disorder that requires regular  treatment at their VA.   Madam Chair, we need to remove barriers to care and give our veterans  certainty. By passing this legislation, Congress will make childcare  available to veterans who need it, while being cost effective in  improving health outcomes.   In closing, I thank Congresswoman Brownley for her tireless work on  behalf of our Nation's veterans, and I strongly urge my colleagues to  vote on passage of this important legislation.                                time  1530
