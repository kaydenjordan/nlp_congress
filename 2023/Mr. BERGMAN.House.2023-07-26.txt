 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of my amendment to H.R. 4366.   This amendment will ensure the VA conducts large-scale studies into  the efficacy of drugs with FDA breakthrough therapy status to treat  post-traumatic stress disorder through medication-assisted therapy  trials.                                time  1545    Every day, roughly 20 veterans take their own life. This number has  stayed high despite our best efforts here in Washington. Fortunately,  new breakthrough therapies have offered significant help.   Under the Trump administration, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy  status for MDMA-assisted therapy to treat PTSD. Since then, privately  funded research has demonstrated clear, positive results in treating  previously untreatable PTSD with little or no risk for patients.   This includes studies in cooperation with the VA, for instance, at  the Bronx VA hospital.   Let me be clear. These trials are conducted with full FDA approval,  under medical supervision, and in safe clinical environments.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself an additional 1 minute.   Additionally, Mr. Chair, because these medications are only ever  administered directly in-person and in a clinical setting by medical  professionals, there is no potential for misuse.   It is now time for the VA to do its part to expand research into  these lifesaving therapies and refine best practices for our treatment  for our veterans.   If psychedelic-assisted therapy can help treat a veteran's PTSD or  prevent them from taking their own life, then we owe it to them to take  an active role in researching these potentially lifesaving therapies.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague and partner, Representative Correa,  for his remarks.   We have both worked long and hard on the commitment to our veterans  in so many different ways. This is just one more example of Congress  doing the right thing for our veterans.   This amendment will unlock potential treatments that have been shown  to actually cure post-traumatic stress disorder, something current  medicine and modern psychology have been unable to do; give our  veterans a chance to live a long, happy life that we all take for  granted.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge all our Members to vote for our men and  women--our heroes--who have served in uniform and to support the  Bergman-Correa amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
