 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to wish a happy 100th birthday  to private first-class David Perez.   In 1931, David's immigrant parents and their 14 kids moved to the  Salad Bowl of the World in Salinas, California to work in agriculture  and raise a family.   During World War II, David and two of his brothers were drafted to  fight for our country. As a combat medic, Private Perez shipped out to  the Pacific theater. Serving with the 27th Infantry Division, he fought  hard, saved many lives, and even was injured by enemy fire. Private  Perez received many medals for his service, including the Bronze Star  for his bravery in the Battle of Saipan where he evacuated and tended  to four of his wounded comrades.   After the military, David returned to Salinas, raised a family and  was a member of the Elks Lodge, American Legion Post 31, and in 2019 he  was chosen to be the grand marshal of the Salinas Veteran's Day parade.   For all that he has done in his long life, David will be the first to  tell you, though, his proudest moments are being with his wife Lillian,  his two daughters, Celia and Felicia, five grandchildren, and five  great grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, I wish a happy 100th to David and thank him for showing  our community and our country what it means to be a part of the  Greatest Generation and what it takes to fulfill an American Dream.  Happy birthday.                            ____________________
