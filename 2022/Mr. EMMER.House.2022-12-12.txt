 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6218, which  would designate the postal facility on Blattner Drive in Avon,  Minnesota, as the Warrant Officer Candidate Kort Miller Plantenberg  Post Office.   Kort was a true Minnesotan. He was born in St. Cloud, raised in Avon,  and he graduated from the University of Minnesota in Duluth. In 2016,  Kort enlisted in the National Guard as an aircraft electrician. During  his time with the Guard, he served a 9-month deployment in Kuwait,  where his unit provided aerial medical evacuation. Later, when he  returned home, he was hired as a Federal technician, a UH60 mechanic at  St. Cloud's Army Aviation Support Facility.   Kort was only 28 when he lost his life 3 years ago this month in a  tragic helicopter accident. Two other guardsmen, James A. Rogers, Jr.,  and Charles P. Nord, lost their lives in the same accident. I am very  pleased that my friend and fellow colleague in the Minnesota delegation  (Mrs. Fischbach), has offered legislation that will rename post offices  in her district in honor of James and Charles.   Kort will be remembered for his passion for flying and for his love  of his family and friends. Naming the Avon Post Office after him will  allow the community to honor his service to this country and to the  great State of Minnesota.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues in the House of  Representatives to support H.R. 6218 honoring an America patriot who  paid the ultimate sacrifice to our Nation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
