 Mr. Speaker, House Democrats are putting people  over politics by lowering kitchen-table costs, creating better-paying  jobs, cutting costs for healthcare coverage, and capping out-of-pocket  drug costs for seniors.   However, extreme MAGA Republicans have an economic plan that would do  just the opposite. Mr. Speaker, House Republicans are set to advance a  new 30 percent national sales tax. This will increase the average  family's costs for groceries and essentials by hundreds of dollars each  and every month.   Some MAGA Republicans say they want to cut Social Security and  Medicare, and working families will lose their hard-earned benefits.  They are putting special interests of the few over the working-class  majority.   House Democrats will continue to fight for working families. We will  always put people over politics and seniors over party, and we will  always, always put people first.                            ____________________
