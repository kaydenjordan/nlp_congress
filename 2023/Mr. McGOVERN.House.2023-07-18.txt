 Mr. Speaker, Republicans have their priorities all  screwed up. It is a national disgrace how many hungry kids there are in  America, yet Republicans are passing bills out of the Education  Committee not about hunger in our schools but about demonizing  immigrants.   Republican Governors lie to migrants and ship them to States like  Massachusetts with no help, no notification, no nothing. Now, they have  the gall to threaten public school funding for communities that respond  to their cruelty by caring for these poor migrants?   Under Republican rule, the House Education Committee hasn't had a  single markup or hearing on raising teacher pay. No hearings or markups  on school shootings or reducing hunger in schools. Yet, we are bringing  to the floor an immigration bill from the Education Committee while  over 9 million kids in this country--that is 1 in 8 kids, for God's  sake--go hungry.   I am begging Republicans: Stop pushing divisive culture war messaging  bills, and let's focus on making sure every kid has a healthy breakfast  and lunch at school every day. Food ought to be a fundamental human  right for every single person in this country.                            ____________________
