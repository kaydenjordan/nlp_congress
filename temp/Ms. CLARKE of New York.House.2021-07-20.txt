Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, the recent Colonial Pipeline, JBS, and Kaseya  ransomware attacks have brought the Nation's attention to the  tremendous national security threat posed by ransomware.   The Colonial Pipeline breach alone disrupted the supply of gasoline  for a  [[Page H3694]]  large portion of the Nation and contributed to gas shortages across  much of the Southeast. It also spurred conversations about how much of  our Nation's critical infrastructure is privately owned and operated.   Lost on many Americans is how much vulnerable critical infrastructure  is actually in the public sector. Today, emergency services, public  schools, hospitals, and agencies involved in providing essential  services or regulating important industries are all housed in our State  and local governments. In recent years, we have seen communities, big  and small, that lacked dedicated cybersecurity resources fall victim to  ransomware attacks.   The types of incidents we have seen include a ransomware attack on  Baltimore that cost city taxpayers $18 million; a hack on the D.C.  police department that resulted in leaked sensitive personnel files;  and a cyberattack against a Massachusetts school district that forced  it to cancel its first day of in-person instruction earlier this year.   In May, my subcommittee held a hearing on the ransomware crisis where  experts shared their views on the policy solutions that the Federal  Government can consider to address this challenge. Our witnesses  uniformly urged greater investment in prevention, particularly at the  State and local levels.   We cannot just focus on responding to cyber incidents. We must help  our communities reduce their vulnerability and better mitigate  incidents when they occur.   In the long term, front-end cybersecurity investments save money,  protect infrastructure, and prevent disruption to our economy and in  our communities.   That is why I introduced the State and Local Cybersecurity  Improvement Act. It authorizes $500 million annually for grants to  State, local, territorial, and Tribal governments to upgrade their  cybersecurity. It requires States to pay a graduated cost share to  incentivize them to budget better for cybersecurity, and it requires  them to develop cybersecurity plans so we ensure these funds are well- spent.   My bill also requires DHS to create a plan to improve the  cybersecurity posture of State and local governments to ensure that  States have goals and objectives to which they align their own  cybersecurity plans.   We have spent considerable resources enhancing the security of our  Federal networks, and President Biden's recent executive order, along  with investments included in the American Rescue Plan, demonstrate a  continued commitment to strengthening Federal cybersecurity.   These actions are incredibly important, but we need to do more to  address the vulnerabilities at the State and local levels, where there  has been inadequate investment in cybersecurity for years.   It is essential for the Federal Government to be a partner in  protecting State and local digital infrastructure. As Congress  considers ways to invest in our Nation's infrastructure, State and  local digital infrastructure must be a part of that conversation.   As we have seen in recent months, the gap between the digital world  and the physical one is smaller than ever. I appreciate the bipartisan  recognition of that and the strong support this investment in our  infrastructure security received in the Homeland Security Committee.   In particular, I want to thank Chairman Thompson, Ranking Member  Katko, Ranking Member Garbarino, and Representatives McCaul,  Ruppersberger, Kilmer, and Slotkin for cosponsoring this legislation.   By passing the State and Local Cybersecurity Improvement Act today,  we can demonstrate to the American people that Congress can work in a  bipartisan way to make a meaningful difference in addressing our  Nation's cybersecurity risk.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, while cybersecurity threats are not new, this year has  highlighted the serious impact cyber incidents can have on our national  security.   The United States has as much cybersecurity expertise as any country.  But without adequate resources, State and local governments cannot  implement the policies and practices we know will make their digital  infrastructure more secure.   Enactment of the State and Local Cybersecurity Improvement Act will  ensure that they have the funding, planning, and support to adequately  invest in securing government networks and reducing risk.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3138, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 1833) to amend the Homeland Security Act of  2002 to provide for the responsibility of the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency to maintain capabilities to identify  threats to industrial control systems, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1833         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Such report shall include information on       the following:        (1) Any interagency coordination challenges to the ability       of the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure       Agency of the Department of Homeland Security to lead Federal       efforts to identify and mitigate cybersecurity threats to       industrial control systems pursuant to subsection (p)(1) of       such section.        (2) The degree to which the Agency has adequate capacity,       expertise, and resources to carry out threat hunting and       incident response capabilities to mitigate cybersecurity       threats to industrial control systems pursuant to subsection       (p)(2) of such section, as well as additional resources that       would be needed to close any operational gaps in such       capabilities.        (3) The extent to which industrial control system       stakeholders sought cybersecurity technical assistance from       the Agency pursuant to subsection (p)(3) of such section, and       the utility and effectiveness of such technical assistance.        (4) The degree to which the Agency works with security       researchers and other industrial control systems       stakeholders, pursuant to subsection (p)(4) of such section,       to provide vulnerability information to the industrial       control systems community.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1833, the DHS Industrial  Control Systems Capabilities Enhancement Act.   This bill seeks to give the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security  Agency, or CISA, a stronger hand in securing industrial control systems  and would help to clarify its central coordination role across the  Federal Government.                                time  1315    The importance of securing industrial control systems cannot be  overstated. We rely on these systems to provide vital services, like  water treatment, energy distribution, and critical manufacturing.   As control systems have grown more and more connected to business and  IT networks that rely on the internet, we have seen systems become more  vulnerable to cyberattacks.   Industrial control systems have been targeted by groups closely  aligned with nation-states like China and Russia who seek to undermine  the United States and advance their own geopolitical interests.   We have also seen criminal groups, like the perpetrators of the  ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline, create great economic  disruption while extorting companies.   It doesn't take a criminal mastermind to infiltrate an industrial  environment, either. Earlier this year, an unsophisticated, unknown  perpetrator was able to breach a water treatment plant in Oldsmar,  Florida, and manipulate chemical levels in ways that could have  poisoned nearby residents.   H.R. 1833 will strengthen CISA's authority as the lead Federal  coordinator for securing industrial control systems and empower CISA to  hunt for threats, respond to incidents, and to promote strong  cybersecurity for critical infrastructure.   The Department of Homeland Security has been working on control  system security since 2004. H.R. 1833 recognizes that role at a pivotal  time as cyber threats to critical infrastructure reach new heights.   Importantly, this bill also includes a GAO review of whether CISA has  the resources, staffing, and authorities it needs to effectively  implement these provisions. Such oversight will be key, given that  these systems are complex, diverse, and there are a limited number of  skilled cyber experts capable of securing them.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1833, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers,  and I am prepared to close after the gentleman from New York closes. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time to close.   I would like to start by thanking the gentleman from New York for his  outstanding leadership in this regard.   Industrial control systems are a rich target for cyber adversaries  looking to disrupt, extort, and simply wreak havoc. These systems  underpin the functions and services we rely on for our day-to-day  lives, and the threats they face have never been higher.   Successful disruption of one of these systems could have dire  consequences for public health and safety, public confidence, and even  the national and economic security of the United States.   CISA is well-positioned to help owners and operators better  understand risks to operational technology and work with them to close  security gaps.   I again want to congratulate the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko),  my committee colleague and ranking member, on authoring this bill to  codify the role that CISA plays in leading Federal efforts to secure  industrial control systems.   Enactment of H.R. 1833 will help to raise our cybersecurity posture  across the board.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 2980) to amend the Homeland Security Act of  2002 to provide for the remediation of cybersecurity vulnerabilities,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, 5 years ago a Government Accountability Office survey  found that 12 out of 12 Federal agencies used obsolete information  technology. In other words, 12 out of 12 Federal agencies were using  software or hardware for which vendors no longer provided support,  updates, or patches.   The Federal Government is hardly alone. It has been widely reported  that State and local governments and critical infrastructure owners and  operators across the country rely on legacy technology.   We have seen malicious cyber actors wreak havoc by exploiting known  vulnerabilities.   H.R. 2980 would authorize CISA to develop and distribute playbooks to  provide procedures and mitigation strategies for the most critical,  known vulnerabilities, especially those affecting software or hardware  that is no longer supported by a vendor. The playbooks would be  available to Federal agencies, industry, and other stakeholders.   The bill, as introduced by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee), also authorizes the Department of Homeland Security Science and  Technology Directorate, in consultation with CISA, to establish a  competition program for industry, individuals, academia, and others to  provide remediation solutions for cybersecurity vulnerabilities that  are no longer supported.   Importantly, in response to recent cyberattacks, H.R. 2980  prioritizes efforts to address vulnerabilities of industrial control  systems of critical infrastructure that may be targeted, like water  systems and pipelines.   H.R. 2980 is no substitute for investing in new technology, but it  will provide important support to government and private sector  entities that cannot replace legacy technology or rapidly patch known  vulnerabilities because of resource limitations or other system  complications.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 2980, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an  additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, our adversaries are showing no signs of slowing their  efforts to undermine U.S. interests in cyberspace.   Most often, hackers exploit known vulnerabilities. The Federal  Government can and should support efforts to address and mitigate known  vulnerabilities.   H.R. 2980 would do just that.   I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for her foresight, and I urge my  colleagues to support the bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  [[Page H3702]]  and pass the bill (H.R. 3223) to amend the Homeland Security Act of  2002 to establish in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security  Agency the National Cyber Exercise Program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, as Americans prepared for their 4th of July holiday  weekends, a Russian-based cybercrime crime group launched a ransomware  attack that would affect up to 1,500 small- and medium-sized businesses  and local governments.   The Kaseya ransomware attacks followed a series of cyberattacks,  including one that resulted in the shutdown of 5,500 miles of pipeline  on the East Coast.   The unfortunate reality is that the rate and ferocity of cyberattacks  show no signs of ebbing.   State actors and cybercriminals alike use cyber tools to advance  their goals, regardless of whether they are driven by geopolitical  considerations or profiteering.   Together, the Federal Government and its State, local, and private  sector partners must do everything in their power to defend our  networks while deterring and raising the cost of cyberattacks.   At the same time, we must have tested, exercised cyber-incident  response plans in place in the event a malicious hacker successfully  gains access to a victim network.   Last year's National Defense Authorization Act included language  directing DHS, in coordination with interagency partners, to conduct  four exercises over the next 12 years to test the resiliency, response,  and recovery of the U.S. to a significant cyber incident impacting  critical infrastructure.   Such exercises are critical to understanding our national resilience  to cyberattacks and where we need to invest in improving capability.   H.R. 3223 would complement the capstone exercise program authorized  last year.   It directs the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or  CISA, together with sector risk management agencies, to develop an  exercise program that is designed to more regularly test and assess  systemic preparedness and resilience to cyberattacks against critical  infrastructure.   The authorization includes requirements for the development of model  exercises that State and local governments or private sector entities  could readily adapt.   Our collective resilience to cyberattacks demands that we regularly  assess and improve our ability to respond to cyberattacks.   The exercise program authorized by H.R. 3223 will help State and  local governments and private sector critical infrastructure entities  to do just that.   So I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3223, and I reserve the  balance of my time    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Slotkin).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, the country is experiencing an unprecedented number of  significant cyberattacks.   From hospitals to schools to pipelines and a meat processing plant,  nothing is immune.   The key to ensuring we are resilient to cyberattacks is to ensure  that we have trained and tested cyber incident response plans.   H.R. 3223, the CISA Cyber Exercise Act, is critical in that effort.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3223, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 3264) to amend the Homeland Security Act of  2002 to require research and development to identify and evaluate the  extent to which critical domain risks within the United States supply  chain pose a substantial threat to homeland security, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3264         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Domains Critical to Homeland       Security Act''.       SEC. 2. CRITICAL DOMAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

Homeland security critical domain research and                development.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 3264, the Domains  Critical to Homeland Security Act. America's economy depends on diverse  and resilient supply chains that ensure an uninterrupted flow of goods  and services to the Nation.   Disruptions, whether caused by natural disasters or manmade events,  can reduce the availability and integrity of critical supplies. This  has significant Homeland Security implications.   For example, the COVID-19 pandemic revealed vulnerabilities in the  Nation's medical supply chains, which caused persistent shortages for  personal protective equipment and testing supplies; most of which is  manufactured overseas. And the recent ransomware attack on Colonial  Pipeline showed how a brief shutdown of a major gas pipeline can drive  up prices and lead to gas shortages.   H.R. 3264 would authorize DHS to conduct research and development  into supply chain risks for critical domains of the U.S. economy. The  research would include a risk analysis for each critical domain to  identify weaknesses that pose a substantial homeland security threat.   The bill would also require DHS to report on the results of its  research annually through fiscal year 2026. This report will allow the  public and private sectors to take meaningful action to mitigate risk  and to ensure the long-term economic security of the United States.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 3264 to improve America's  economic and homeland security, and I thank the gentleman from New York  [[Page H3705]]  for his forward-leaning legislation in introducing this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 1850) to amend the Homeland Security Act of  2002 relating to the National Urban Security Technology Laboratory, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1850         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 321 the       following new item:  ``Sec. 322. National Urban Security Technology Laboratory.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1850, the Supporting  Research and Development for First Responders Act.   First responders across the Nation are facing unprecedented  challenges. Over the past year, the unrelenting demands of COVID-19  have placed great strain on our hometown heroes. In the West, first  responders have had the added challenge of battling devastating  wildfires; and in the East, they are in the midst of a dangerous  hurricane season.   Compounding these challenges is a terrorism threat landscape that,  according to the Department of Homeland Security, has ``evolved  significantly and become increasingly complex and volatile in 2021.''   Given the complexity of the challenges our men and women on the front  lines face, it is critical that they have the most reliable and  effective technology and equipment to respond. When it comes to  delivering innovative technological solutions, the first responder  community looks to the National Urban Security Technology Laboratory in  New York City.   NUSTL, as it has come to be known, serves a unique mission in the  Federal Government. It is the only Federal lab that is solely dedicated  to researching and developing technology to help first responders  safely and effectively respond to emergencies that range from natural  disasters and industrial incidents to active shooters and terrorist  attacks.   New innovative emergency response technologies are constantly being  deployed, but to keep our first responders safe, they must first be  tried and tested.   Enactment of H.R. 1850 would ensure that NUSTL can continue to carry  out this vital role in Homeland Security. Specifically, it would ensure  that NUSTL could continue to conduct simulated scenarios with first  responders to test new emergency systems, support research for  innovative technology, and assist first responders in evaluating new  tools.   In recent years, despite NUSTL's recognized value to the Nation, we  saw the Trump administration repeatedly propose shuttering it.  Thankfully, Congress rejected those shortsighted proposals and  redoubled its support for this vital institution.   Looking ahead, we must not only permanently authorize NUSTL by  enacting H.R. 1850, but we must also continue to prioritize funding for  the lab so it can continue its critical work.   Once again, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.         House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,                                                 and Technology,                                       Washington, DC, July 8, 2021.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson: I am writing to address the       jurisdictional interests of the Committee on Science, Space,       and Technology (``Science Committee'') in H.R. 1850, the       ``Supporting Research and Development for First Responders       Act.''        While the Science Committee has claimed jurisdiction over       versions of this bill introduced in previous Congresses, I       recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House in an expeditious manner, and,       accordingly agree not to insist on a sequential referral.       This is, of course, conditional on our mutual understanding       that nothing in this legislation or my decision to forgo       sequential referral waives, reduces, or otherwise affects the       jurisdiction of the Science Committee, and that a copy of       this letter and your response will be included in the bill       report to be filed by the Committee on Homeland Security and       included in the Congressional Record when the bill is       considered on the House Floor.        Finally, I ask that you support the appointment of Science       Committee conferees during any House-Senate conference       convened on this, or similar legislation. Thank you for your       attention on this matter.            Sincerely,                                             Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chairwoman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                       Washington, DC, July 8, 2021.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chairwoman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Johnson: Thank you for your letter       regarding H.R. 1850, the ``Supporting Research and       Development for First Responders Act.'' I recognize that the       Committee on Science, Space, and Technology has a       jurisdictional interest in H.R. 1850, and I appreciate your       effort to allow this bill to be considered on the House       floor.        I concur with you that forgoing action on the bill does not       in any way prejudice the Committee on Science, Space, and       Technology with respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on       this bill or similar legislation in the future, and I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this legislation.  [[Page H3706]]         I will include our letters on H.R. 1850 in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of this bill.       I look forward to working with you on this legislation and       other matters of great importance to this Nation.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,                          Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice).   Miss RICE of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my  legislation, H.R. 1850, the Supporting Research and Development for  First Responders Act.   This bipartisan bill would permanently authorize the New York City- based National Urban Security Technology Laboratory, which has been  commonly referred to as NUSTL.                                time  1400    NUSTL's mission is to develop and test new tools for our first  responders to utilize in response to terrorist attacks, natural  disasters, accidents, and other large-scale events.   There is no other lab in the country doing this critical  counterterrorism and emergency response work, and it is more important  now than ever before.   From the rise in domestic extremism to stronger and more frequent  storms as a result of climate change, the threats facing our Nation are  pressing. We must make sure our first responders are best equipped to  handle any potential emergency, and providing support for NUSTL will  help us accomplish that goal.   Madam Speaker, I would like to thank Congressman Garbarino, my  colleague on Long Island, for co-leading this legislation with me, and  I would also like to thank Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Katko  for their help in getting it on the floor.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1850 is a bill to protect our protectors. At the  very least, those on the front lines deserve to go to work with the  certainty that their equipment will work when they need it the most.  They should not have to ask themselves: Will it function under  pressure? Can it take the heat?   We owe it to the nearly 2 million Americans who put their lives on  the line to protect us to ensure that NUSTL is operational and  resourced to test their equipment.   This fall, we will be observing the 20th anniversary of the September  11 terrorist attacks that shook this Nation to its core. The 9/11  attack was not only the single deadliest terrorist attack in human  history, but it was the deadliest incident ever for firefighters and  law enforcement officers in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, 343 New York City firefighters, 23 NYPD officers, and 37  Port Authority officers died that day. By enacting H.R. 1850, we can  ensure that as threats continue to grow and change, NUSTL will be there  to provide critical technical support to our first responder community.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice) for  this legislation, and I ask that my colleagues support this bipartisan  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 3263) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  establish in the Department of Homeland Security a medical  countermeasures program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3263         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Medical Countermeasures       Act''.       SEC. 2. MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURES PROGRAM.         (a) In General.--Subtitle C of title XIX of the Homeland       Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 311 et seq.) is amended by       adding at the end the following new section:       ``SEC. 1932. MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURES.         ``(a) In General.--The Secretary shall establish a medical       countermeasures program to facilitate personnel readiness,       and protection for the Department's employees and working       animals in the event of a chemical, biological, radiological,       nuclear, or explosives attack, naturally occurring disease       outbreak, or pandemic, and to support Department mission       continuity.        ``(b) Oversight.--The Chief Medical Officer of the       Department shall provide programmatic oversight of the       medical countermeasures program established pursuant to       subsection (a), and shall--        ``(1) develop Department-wide standards for medical       countermeasure storage, security, dispensing, and       documentation;        ``(2) maintain a stockpile of medical countermeasures,       including antibiotics, antivirals, and radiological       countermeasures, as appropriate;        ``(3) preposition appropriate medical countermeasures in       strategic locations nationwide, based on threat and employee       density, in accordance with applicable Federal statutes and       regulations;        ``(4) provide oversight and guidance regarding the       dispensing of stockpiled medical countermeasures;        ``(5) ensure rapid deployment and dispensing of medical       countermeasures in a chemical, biological, radiological,       nuclear, or explosives attack, naturally occurring disease       outbreak, or pandemic;        ``(6) provide training to Department employees on medical       countermeasure dispensing; and        ``(7) support dispensing exercises.        ``(c) Medical Countermeasures Working Group.--The Chief       Medical Officer shall establish a medical countermeasures       working group comprised of representatives from appropriate       components and offices of the Department to ensure that       medical countermeasures standards are maintained and guidance       is consistent.        ``(d) Medical Countermeasures Management.--Not later than       120 days after the date of the enactment of this section, the       Chief Medical Officer shall develop and submit to the       Secretary an integrated logistics support plan for medical       countermeasures, including--        ``(1) a methodology for determining the ideal types and       quantities of medical countermeasures to stockpile and how       frequently such methodology shall be reevaluated;        ``(2) a replenishment plan; and        ``(3) inventory tracking, reporting, and reconciliation       procedures for existing stockpiles and new medical       countermeasure purchases.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       adding after the item relating to section 1931 the following       new item: ``Sec. 1932. Medical countermeasures.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3263, the DHS  Medical Countermeasures Act.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3263 seeks to establish a medical countermeasures  program to facilitate the readiness and protection of personnel and  working animals in the event of a chemical, biological, radiological,  nuclear, or explosives attack; disease outbreak; or pandemic.   H.R. 3263 requires DHS' chief medical officer, or CMO, to provide  programmatic oversight of the medical countermeasures program and  establish a medical countermeasures working group comprised of relevant  DHS components.   Additionally, the bill requires the CMO to utilize DHS chemical,  biological, radiological, and nuclear risk assessments, and CDC  guidance, to determine the types and quantities of medical  countermeasures to stockpile.   H.R. 3263, first introduced in the 114th Congress, was developed due  to concerns about the possibility of a severe pandemic that could cause  illnesses and fatalities and destabilize the operations of DHS. The  COVID-19 pandemic has brought these concerns to the forefront.   DHS is responsible for protecting our homeland, but the Department  can only do that if it has a safe workforce. Many of the more than  240,000 employees are out on the front lines due to the nature of their  responsibilities.   Furthermore, critical supply shortages of personal protective  equipment earlier in the pandemic, which affected the Federal  Government and State and local governments, also severely impacted DHS  operations.   H.R. 3263 is informed by an August 2014 DHS inspector general report.  It is also informed by testimony provided during multiple House  Homeland Security Committee hearings.   Enactment of this bill will improve DHS' ability to protect the well- being of DHS personnel so they can fulfill their mission: protecting  our homeland.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I  am prepared to close after the gentleman from New York closes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3263 is a measure that this country needs.   I believe all of us in this body can agree that protecting the health  and safety of DHS personnel is critical to homeland security, and to  that end, we must pass this bill.   Enactment of H.R. 3263 would strengthen medical countermeasure  protocols within the Department and help DHS prepare for and respond to  homeland threats.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 3263, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
