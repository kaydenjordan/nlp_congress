 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Michigan and all  my friends for this Special Order hour.   Paul, you might not know this, but you are an important mentor of  mine, one of the most important mentors I have had in my brief career  in this Chamber. You represent the very most precious and sometimes  rare of attributes in the U.S. Congress, and that is principle.   You are a man of principle at a time when our country needs that and  you more than ever. You are a man of great intelligence and success and  decency and empathy and honesty and integrity.   I remember my first conversation with Paul, we were speaking about  higher education. And it was that conversation that reminded me that we  can learn so much more from people of different perspectives than we do  from those who are cut from the same cloth.    And when Paul made the difficult but very principled decision to  become an Independent at the end of his career here in Congress, he  wrote a letter to the House Clerk to announce the change in  affiliation, and the last line of the letter read: ``While admittedly  symbolic, we all know that symbols matter. We all know that symbols  matter.''   And when you retired from Congress, Paul, you said: ``I can't begin  to express to you how difficult it is to say something like `I am done'  because I have never been done before.''   And let me tell you, my friend, you are not done yet, and we sure as  heck are not done with you. We love you, Paul, and America joins me in  sending our love to you and yours as well.
