 Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank Madam Chair,  our Speaker, our committee chairs--chair of the Black Caucus,  Chairwoman Bass, and Robin Kelly chairs the Health Braintrust for the  Black Caucus--for working together with me to address the unequal  impact of COVID on people of color and the poor and making sure that  people and organizations rooted in our communities play  [[Page H2231]]  the lead role in recovery, including contact tracing.   We are facing the worst health and economic crisis of our lifetime.  Elevated rates of infection and death are in communities of color.  Heroic frontline and essential workers being paid poverty wages. There  are struggling small and minority-owned businesses, millions  unemployed, and millions pushed into poverty.    Mr. Speaker, this House must fight for those  who bear the brunt of this pandemic, not big corporations whose wealth  permits them to weather this crisis.   This pandemic has shone a light, mind you, on the systemic racism,  inequality, and poverty endemic throughout the country. The bill  includes $75 billion for testing, contact tracing, and treatment in the  highest impacted areas.   I am disappointed that we did not include Congresswoman Jayapal's  Paycheck Guarantee Act; however, the Paycheck Guarantee Act would  provide stability of a paycheck through this pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to embrace this in the future as we  move forward.
