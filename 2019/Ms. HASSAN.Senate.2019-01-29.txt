 Madam President, I want to start by thanking my  colleague, Senator Whitehouse from Rhode Island, not only for his  remarks today but for his leadership on this issue. I rise today to  join him in highlighting the toll climate change is taking on coastal  communities throughout New England. Senator Whitehouse has been a  fierce advocate, and he is dedicated to and continues to push our  colleagues to address the dire reality of climate change. I am here to  join him in that effort.   In New Hampshire's Seacoast region, our State's beautiful coastline  helps propel our economy forward, supporting industries such as tourism  and commercial fishing and contributing to our high quality of life.  Just as proximity to the ocean provides vital opportunities, our  communities are finding that as climate change intensifies, these  communities are increasingly at risk.   As you can see from this photo that was taken last year in Rye, NH,  stronger storms and rising sea levels are leading to increased flooding  in our coastal areas. As Senator Whitehouse mentioned, our communities  are already feeling the direct economic impacts of rising sea levels.   According to the First Street Foundation and Columbia University, the  increased risk of flooding and damage is hurting property values  throughout New England. That report states that New Hampshire has  already seen a $15 million loss in property value, particularly in  areas such as Hampton, Exeter, Dover, and Portsmouth. Combined with the  rest of the New England States, coastal properties have experienced  approximately $400 million in property value losses just between 2005  and 2017.   The extent of those losses is just the beginning of the damage. The  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association has estimated that New  Hampshire's sea levels are expected to rise between 0.6 and 2 feet by  2050 and between 1.6 and 6.6 feet by 2100. According to the Union of  Concerned Scientists, rising seas could threaten more than 5,000 homes  on the seacoast of New Hampshire by the end of the century.   Our climate is changing. Sea levels are rising. This is undebatable.  Climate change and sea level rise are not threats to some distant time  in the future; these threats--this damage--are here. These threats are  taking their toll now. The people of New Hampshire know this. We are  witnessing climate change in our communities in real time as storms get  more intense and the floodwaters go higher.   It is our responsibility to help our communities adapt to these  changes. This starts with focusing on planning for resiliency to help  vulnerable communities prepare and on improving our infrastructure and  developing strategies to help plan ahead for storms and extreme weather  events.   At the local level, Granite Staters on the seacoast are already being  proactive on this front. Community members have formed advocacy groups,  and local governments have focused on addressing these challenges head- on and developing resilient strategies. We have to support their  efforts.   We also must do more. We need to redouble efforts to cut carbon  emissions, conserve and protect our natural resources, and build a  stronger, clean energy future. People are calling on us to  [[Page S736]]  act. Study after study has shown that as more Americans see the direct  threats from climate change in their own communities and in the lives  of their fellow citizens, they are becoming increasingly worried. It is  time for us to start dealing with reality and to address their  concerns.   I will keep working to address climate change and to achieve a  cleaner environment and stronger energy future that will help our  citizens, our economy, and our businesses thrive. I urge my colleagues  to join us in those efforts.   Again, I thank Senator Whitehouse for being a leader in those  efforts.   Madam President, I yield the floor.    Madam President, for the first Granite Stater of  the Month of 2019, I am proud to recognize fifth grader Evelyn Ellis- Haines of Belmont for her work helping those in need. Through a youth  civics program at her school, Evelyn launched a clothing drive, and  with the support of her teachers and classmates, she collected more  than 700 items to donate to some of our most vulnerable citizens in the  Granite State.   Evelyn was inspired to start her clothing drive because, in her  words, she ``wanted to help people.'' Addressing poverty is something  that has always concerned Evelyn. Her family even recalls her making  baked goods to  [[Page S739]]  give to people she saw experiencing homelessness and often asking why  they could not do more to help them. When the opportunity to  participate in New Hampshire's Kid Governor Program arose, Evelyn  created a platform based on addressing poverty and worked with her  school to start a clothing drive. Every Monday in December, she  reminded her classmates during their school assembly to bring items to  donate, which resulted in her collecting hundreds of items in just  under a month.   Evelyn donated the items to the largest family shelter in her  community and wants to continue working to help address poverty. She  will be volunteering with the same organization this summer and hopes  to expand her clothing drive beyond just her school. For her efforts to  support her community and help those in need, I am proud to recognize  Evelyn as the January 2019 Granite Stater of the Month.                            ____________________
