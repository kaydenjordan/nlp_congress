 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak as a father and a  new and excited grandfather to advocate for a country that is dedicated  to helping all of its children thrive.   As a scientist, I recognize that one of the most important issues our  children face is the fragility of children's brain development. Early  brain development in children lays the foundation for their success in  adulthood. During the first few years of life, millions of new neural  connections are formed every second. It is during this time that the  brain is the most flexible but also the most vulnerable to the  environment around it.   Polluted environments, chronic stress, extreme poverty, or repeated  abuse are toxic for brain development, and this has a lasting negative  impact on a child's success in life.   It is important to continue research on the impact of children's  environment on early brain development and then to take action to  provide early intervention services for children whose brain  development is at risk.   In fact, as Representative Jacobs mentioned, early childhood  intervention has one of the highest returns on investment of any  investment that our country can make.   Although my grandson is growing up in a supportive, loving, and  hopefully chemically nontoxic environment, I recognize that many  children in the United States are not. But I remain hopeful that we  will continue to combat the challenges that all of our children face  and continue to provide them with the best future possible.
