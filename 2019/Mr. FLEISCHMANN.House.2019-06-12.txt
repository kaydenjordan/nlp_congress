 Mr. Speaker, I rise to welcome a very special guest  to our Nation's Capitol, Father David Carter of the Basilica of Sts.  Peter and Paul in Chattanooga, and the Rist family.   Father David Carter is a man of strong faith and principled  leadership. In our east Tennessee community, he serves as the vice  chancellor for the Diocese of Knoxville and was the chaplain at  Knoxville Catholic High School until his tenure as the rector of the  basilica began in 2013.   Father Carter also enjoys the beauty that God has bestowed on the  Volunteer State, leading treks in the Great Smoky Mountains. But even  outside the House of God, he continues to show his faith, serving as  chaplain to the parish's Trail Life troop.   In my service to east Tennessee in this Chamber, I often seek  guidance from the Lord's word, and I am thankful to have Father Carter  as my priest. I pray that our Nation knows more Father Carters, those  who seek to serve and find Christ as the source of truth. I hope that  Father Carter and his guests enjoy their time in this beautiful city.                            ____________________
