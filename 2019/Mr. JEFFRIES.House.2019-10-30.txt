 Mr. Speaker, earlier today, President Trump urged his  Republican defenders in this House to focus on substance. That is  exactly what House Democrats have been doing from the very beginning of  this impeachment inquiry.   We will continue to proceed in a serious, solemn, and somber fashion.  That is what the Constitution requires at this moment.   House Democrats will continue to follow the facts, apply the law, be  guided by the Constitution, and present the truth to the American  people.   President Trump said focus on substance.   What is the substance underlying this impeachment inquiry?   Well, Congress, on a bipartisan basis, allocated $391 million in  military and economic aid to Ukraine at a time when Ukraine is under  attack by Russian-backed separatists.   Ukraine is in a vulnerable state.   Ukraine is a friend; Russia is a foe.   Ukraine is a democracy; Russia is a dictatorship.   The United States is probably the only thing standing between  Vladimir Putin and Ukraine being completely overrun as part of Putin's  fantasy to reconstruct what he views as the glory days of the Soviet  Union.   We allocated that money because it is in the national security  interest of the United States of America.   What happened to it?   In February, the Trump administration wrote to Congress and said the  aid is on the way. But it never showed up.                                time  1045    And then in May, Trump's Department of Defense wrote to Congress  again and said the aid is on the way and all necessary preconditions to  release the aid have been met, including the implementation of  anticorruption protocols. That was a letter written by the Trump  Department of Defense in May. That is the substance.   Twice Mitch McConnell during this summer called up the Trump  administration and said, ``Where's the aid?'' Mr. McConnell couldn't  get a good answer.   And then on July 18, we know that the Office of Management and Budget  in the White House held a meeting where it was made clear that the  reason the aid had been held up is because of a directive from the  President of the United States.   A week later, on July 25, the President made a phone call to the  Ukrainian leader and pressured a foreign government to target an  American citizen for political gain and solicit foreign interference in  the 2020 election.   That undermines our national security. The American people have a  right to ask: Is that an abuse of power?   That is what the impeachment inquiry is all about, Mr. President.  That is the substance. It doesn't look good. No one is above the law.
