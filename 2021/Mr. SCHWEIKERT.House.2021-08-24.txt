 Madam Speaker, this is a moment where I am hoping our  friends on the left will keep a certain promise that many of you have  made, Madam Speaker, because we have a long list of the promises from  the President to leadership and to others promising that this spending  will be 100 percent paid for.   You already know we are going to have probably a continuing  resolution with the omnibus. There is a trillion dollars of structural  debt there. Okay. And the $1.2 trillion so-called bipartisan-- bipartisan in the Senate.   Okay, when we actually do the honest math, it is not a quarter  trillion of borrowing; it is about $500 billion of borrowing because a  bunch of the pay-fors are fake.   When we start looking at what Senate Finance and others--where are  you getting the other $1.7 trillion on your $3.5 trillion of spending?   Look, I am just asking you to keep a promise because when you add up  all the new revenues, all the new receipts, all the new tax hikes, the  corporate tax hikes that unemployed some million Americans in 24  months, the capital gains tax that loses money, where are you going to  get all this cash that you have promised will be 100 percent paid for?
