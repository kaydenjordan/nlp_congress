 Mr. Speaker, I have heard so many interesting words  on this debate. The last gentleman, whom I respect, said how the  Democrats care so much for these individuals, and yet let's be  perfectly clear. They had ample opportunity after ample opportunity to  solve the problem.   In 2009, they promised that they would do it within 100 days. Then  the President said that he would do it. Democrats had 60 percent of the  votes in the Senate. They had huge majorities in the House, and they  had a bipartisan bill ready to go, and yet they refused to do it.   But this is not a moment to point fingers, as my colleague just spent  all of his time doing. This is a moment to find solutions.   Look, if you believe, like I do, that these folks who are here--no  fault of their own--should have an opportunity to stay here, to be part  of society, to be legalized and to, yes, obtain citizenship, this may  be the best--it is the best and, potentially, the last chance for a  long time to get that done, and this bill does that.   If you believe that minor kids should not be separated from their  families, and if you believe that the best way to guarantee that is  through legislation, this is the best and, potentially, last  opportunity to get that done because this bill does that.   And if you believe that the United States has the right--no, the  obligation--to determine who comes in and who leaves, this is, then,  also the best and, potentially, last shot to get those three things  done.   So, again, a lot of rhetoric, but this bill does three things: It  allows Dreamers to stay here and allows them to become part of society  forever and with pathways to citizenship; it stops, legislatively, the  separation of minors from their parents on the border; and it secures  the border.   That is what this bill does. Everything else, Mr. Speaker, is cheap  rhetoric.
