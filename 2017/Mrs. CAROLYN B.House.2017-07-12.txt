 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, once again,  tomorrow, Senate Republicans will take another shot at passing the most  widely hated and totally disastrous bill in modern American history-- their bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   Once again, 22 million Americans will stand to lose their health  insurance. Once again, Republicans will propose to send premiums and  out-of-pocket costs soaring. Once again, Republicans would allow  insurance companies to discriminate against the sick. Once again, they  will try to pass a law that hurts children, veterans, seniors, and  Americans with disabilities.   They seem desperately determined to pass something instead of doing  the right thing--which would be working on a bill that treats  healthcare as a fundamental American right--and that is as wrong as  wrong can be.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my  colleague and friend for yielding, and I thank her for her  extraordinary leadership. I would like to be associated with her  comments describing this horrific crime.   Human trafficking outpaces drugs and guns as the world's fastest  growing and most prosperous criminal activity. But unlike guns and  drugs, which can only be sold once, in trafficking, the human body is  sold over and over and over again until it kills the person.   I very strongly support the ending of this modern-day slavery through  the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection  Reauthorization Act. I have worked closely with Representative Smith  since 1995,  [[Page H5503]]  Representative Poe, Representative Wagner, and others, to combat this  despicable crime.   This legislation, first passed in 2000, revolutionized U.S. efforts  against trafficking here and abroad. It included language I offered  targeting traffic on the demand side, which is very important and key  to punishing the real criminals here: pimps, johns, and traffickers who  buy and sell their victims.   This legislation makes improvements to programs and policies that  combat trafficking here and around the world. It helps law enforcement  in their efforts to prosecute, which is growing. It improves  professional training to identify potential trafficking victims and  provides services to enable survivors to rebuild their lives with  dignity.   Perpetrators of modern-day slavery are profiting to the tune of $150  billion a year. We need a coordinated, comprehensive approach to stop  it.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes.'' This bill saves lives.  It is important. I am thrilled to be part of the effort to combat human  trafficking in our world.
