 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Scalise), the Republican whip, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at 2 p.m. for legislative  business, with votes postponed until 6:30 p.m.   Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m.  for morning-hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative business.   Members are reminded that when the House is considering  appropriations bills, votes will occur after 7 p.m. and, obviously,  before as well.   On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.  Last votes on Thursday are expected to occur probably between 2 and 3  p.m. That is different, as I know most Members are used to leaving at  11. We are leaving at 10:30 today, but it will be somewhere between 2  and 3 p.m. on that Thursday.   We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The  complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of  business today.   The House will also consider a contempt resolution. This resolution  would force Attorney General Barr and former White House Counsel McGahn  to comply with congressional subpoenas that have been duly issued by  the House Judiciary Committee. The resolution will authorize the  Judiciary Committee to pursue civil action to seek enforcement of its  subpoenas in Federal court.   Madam Speaker, it also authorizes House committees that have issued  subpoenas as part of their oversight and investigation responsibilities  to seek civil enforcement of those subpoenas when they are ignored.   Madam Speaker, in addition to that contempt resolution, the House  will consider H.R. 2740, the Labor, Health and Human Services,  Education, Legislative Branch, Defense, State, Foreign Operations, and  Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act of 2020.   This will be the first of several minibuses, Madam Speaker, that will  be coming to the floor over this work period. It is my intention to  pass all 12 appropriations bills through the House by the end of June.  This package is the first step toward the House doing its work.   This is, as I said, the first step toward precluding the possibility  of a shutdown at the end of this year, as occurred at the beginning of  this year. I am hopeful that all Members will cooperate with Chair  Lowey and Ranking Member Granger, who have led their committees in  working extraordinarily hard, 12 subcommittees, all of which will have  marked up their bills by the middle of next week and be ready for floor  action. This is one of the earliest times we have considered it.   My Republican colleagues passed a number of bills, as well, in the  last year. It was in the Senate that we didn't get that done. But the  fact of the matter is, hopefully, we will be able to get this done.    Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   First of all, of course, there was no budget last year. There was a  budget that was passed in the latter part of the year before, but that  was for reconciliation purposes so that Republicans could pass their  tax bill with less than 60 votes in the United States Senate. So I  wouldn't go too far on the budget.   Republicans were in charge for 8 years, and they never had a budget.  That doesn't mean we didn't pass one through the House, but there was  never a budget. There was never a budget that was implemented, that I  can remember, in the long term.                                time  1045    But that aside, as the gentleman probably knows, I, in January,  started talking with his leadership, with Ranking Member Granger, with  Senator McConnell, with Senator Shelby, with Senator Leahy, with Mrs.  Lowey, and with our leadership about the necessity to reach an  agreement on the level of discretionary spending, which we call the  caps.   Clearly, as Senator McConnell pointed out in our discussions, the  White House was a critical component of that because, as the gentleman  knows, in order to change the sequester, which I think is one of the  stupidest policies that we put in place, but in order to change the  sequester, we would have to have a bill signed by the President. So,  clearly, the President would have to be involved.   Unfortunately, sometime thereafter, Mr. Vought and Mr. Mulvaney  suggested that we ought to go to sequester, that we ought to just march  to the sequester numbers.   For the Members who may not know exactly what that means, that means  a $54 billion cut in defense spending. I don't really think anybody in  this House thinks that is an appropriate step for us to take, but that  is what Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Vought of OMB suggested, except, by the  way, they crossed their fingers to say we will use $180 billion of  additional deficit spending out of the overseas contingency operations  to fund defense.   In other words, yes, we will do the sequester, but it will really  only have an effect on the nondefense, education, healthcare, medical  research, law enforcement, et cetera. It would only have an effect on  that side of the budget.   I didn't think that made much sense. And, very frankly, I think all  of the people that I just mentioned that I had talked to didn't think  it made sense either.   Obviously, Paul Ryan, when he was Speaker, didn't think it made  sense, because he led a deal with Senator Murray to give us numbers  that we thought were reasonable, and we came to an agreement.   I would hope that we could do that now. I know there are some  negotiations at the top four level and in the White House that have not  reached agreement yet. I think that is unfortunate.   Now, the gentleman observed that we haven't passed a budget. He is  correct. But we did pass the exact same number that the Budget  Committee reported out for discretionary spending, and we adopted it in  the rule.   He is right; we did not adopt it in the budget as it was offered, but  that wasn't necessary, because in either event, that wouldn't have  solved the problem.   But we adopted the same exact number, the Democrats voted for that  number, to which the committee marked its bills. As the gentleman  knows, that was $733 billion on defense and $639 billion on nondefense.  There was some argument on our side as to whether those numbers ought  to be closer together, but that aside, that is what those bills have  been.   So there is a number, and it was a number that was used by the  Appropriations Committee, and it is a number that is reflected in the  bills that we will be bringing to the floor.   Now, of course we could wait, as I think, frankly, the White House  wants us to wait, until September, maybe September 27, 28, or 29, and  then they would say: Well, we are going to do a CR at last year's  numbers.   Now, that would be a little more than sequester, no doubt about that,  but it would not be a number that I think the Members of this House on  either side of the aisle would be happy with--maybe for different  reasons but, nevertheless, not happy with.   So I am in agreement that we need to reach a number. We need to pass  a bill, because, if we do not, under the law that we passed some years  ago, 15 days after the first session of this Congress adjourns,  sequester will automatically go into effect.   Nobody would be happy. America will not be happy. Our security will  suffer and our people will suffer under those numbers. So I am in full  agreement that we ought to reach a number.   Now, with respect to the appropriations bills, I think we need to  move them. Obviously, there is going to be a lot of negotiation back  and forth, a lot of different steps will need to be taken. But this is  a first step; it is an important step; and it sets a marker as to where  we are going to start negotiations.   Hopefully, those negotiations will bear fruit with the Senate and  with the White House, because I know the gentleman shares my view that  shutting down the government is not an option that we ought to be  pursuing. Hopefully, we, through these actions, can preclude that from  happening, and I think that will be a positive result.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Very frankly, the person who rejected the premise that this matter  was over was Robert Mueller in a relatively short press conference in  which he answered no questions, but he clearly demonstrated that he  thought Mr. Barr misrepresented the fact that this was over. In fact,  he said:         If we thought the President had not done anything wrong and       we were convinced of that, we would have said so. We did not       say so.    Now, having said that, this is not related to impeachment. This is  related to the Congress' authority, under the Constitution of the  United States, to receive information from the executive on behalf of  the American people.   Now, if Mr. Barr believes that the information requested need not be  submitted, then he had nothing to fear, because what we are seeking is  a court ruling, an independent body's ruling as to whether or not he  ought to be held in contempt and directed by a court to provide the  information to the Congress of the United States, acting pursuant to  its constitutional duty.   Madam Speaker, I will tell my friend that it is a sad day when the  Republicans and Democrats do not stand together on behalf of not only  this institution's constitutional authority, but responsibility to get  the information it needs both with respect to, as, again, Mr. Mueller  pointed out, the very serious issue of the Russians trying to affect  our democracy and our elections.   There is no dispute of that fact. In fact, nine Russians were  indicted by the Mueller special counsel for exactly that purpose.                                time  1100    Now, this resolution to which the gentleman refers authorizes the  Judiciary Committee to pursue civil action to seek enforcement in  Federal court of its subpoenas to Attorney General Barr and former  White House Counsel McGahn, who is no longer a Federal employee. It  also authorizes House committees that have issued subpoenas as part of  their oversight and investigation responsibilities. Let me emphasize  that: Investigation responsibilities, oversight. That is part of the  constitutional responsibility of the Congress of the United States,  which, by the way, your party pursued extraordinarily vigorously over  the last 8 years of the Obama administration, and, very frankly, in  previous administrations.   We are seeking civil enforcement to have a determination as to  whether or not Attorney General Barr, Mr. McGahn, and indeed others,  who have refused to comply with constitutionally sanctioned requests by  the Congress of the United States for information on behalf of the  American people. The President of the United States, like Barr, said it  is over.   Mr. Mueller says it is not over. Mr. Mueller says he did not have the  authority pursuant to Justice policy to go further, but he pointed out  that there are other bodies that have the authority and responsibility  to do so. Who is that? Us, the Congress of the United States.   Now, one of the problems that we are having is that the President has  instructed almost all of government not to respond to the Congress of  the United States, not to answer questions, not to testify, not to  appear. I have called that perhaps the biggest coverup in the history  of any President who  [[Page H4335]]  has, in effect, given a blanket suggestion, and in some cases order,  that people ought not to testify. He said there is no reason to go any  further. He has made that decision. And especially in Congress where it  is very partisan, obviously very partisan. We did think this is not  partisan. This is our responsibility to the American people.   By refusing to cooperate with Congress, the Trump administration has  engaged in a refusal to allow the Congress to exercise its  responsibility, and therefore, we are going to continue to pursue the  facts on behalf of the American people. And that is what this is about.  You will note that we have not sought criminal contempt. We have,  however, found it to be untenable, unacceptable to have an  administration, any administration, Republican or Democrat, tell the  Congress whether it is a Republican Congress or a Democratic Congress  that it will not respond to requests for information, to subpoenas to  testify, and for other information that Congress needs. So that is what  we are going to do.    Will my friend yield?    No, I do not know that.    And he said why he did not.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Let me deal with the question of the supplemental, first. There is a  humanitarian crisis at the border. We need to deal with it. The  President came down with a request some two-plus weeks ago.    The Republicans held up consideration of a disaster bill  that we passed in January. Now, this dealt with natural disasters, not  the humanitarian crisis at the border. I understand that.   We passed that Monday ultimately because the administration wanted to  undermine very badly the American citizens who live in Puerto Rico.  Finally, we got agreement that that was the right thing to do and the  Senate passed it overwhelmingly, then sent it over here. We tried to  pass it by unanimous consent, and your side objected. You objected  three times. So we had to pass it this Monday. We did overwhelmingly.  Not as many perhaps on the gentleman's side as on my side, but we  passed it handily.   The fact of the matter is, we need to deal with this humanitarian  crisis. We need to deal with the humanitarian crisis, and if we limit  it to dealing with  [[Page H4336]]  the humanitarian crisis, Madam Speaker, we will do it. And, in fact,  Ms. Lucille Roybal-Allard is in discussions on that now. My view is the  four corners, meaning the Speaker, the Republican leader, Senator  McConnell, the majority leader, and Mr. Schumer are dealing with it. I  hope they get it done very soon. And if they get it done we are going  to move it because there is a crisis and we need to deal with it.   But I would urge my friend to urge his colleagues not to try to do  some of the President's agenda unrelated to the humanitarian crisis.  And if we can do that, we will get to an agreement, in my opinion.   Now let me go back to your what I believe to be inaccurate,  recitation--as I believe Attorney General Barr's recitation of what the  Mueller report says, and Mr. Mueller clearly made that very, very  crystal clear that he had a different view as to whether that was.   Now, I have got a whole page here of things that the Mueller report  says with reference to--``collusion'' is a word that the President has  created. It is not collusion, not a crime, per se. Conspiracy is a  crime, but the President uses this word ``collusion'' as fake news, as  a distraction, as a magician's trick to look over here, not here, so  that I can fool you.    I asked the gentleman to yield when he said, well, the special  counsel decided to do nothing. The special counsel made it very clear  that under Justice Department directives, a sitting President cannot be  indicted. And Mr. Mueller said if he can't be indicted, I don't want to  make an allegation, which would not be fair because he cannot be  indicted, and therefore, there will be no fora on which to defend  himself. But he observed there was another forum, that was  inappropriate for him, that did have the responsibility and the ability  to take action, and that, as I said, is us.   Now, I won't go through this list of findings that the Mueller  committee or task force, the special counsel concluded, but in my  opinion, and I said this in a release 2 days after, were pretty damning  and at a minimum worthy of the Congress of the United States trying to  get to the bottom of what Manafort and Stone and others did in  reference to WikiLeaks, welcoming the Russian participation that they  thought was helping them. Mueller report.   So we can go into that at great length, but the proper way to do that  is to do what we are doing, ask questions, have witnesses, review  documents and other communications to get to the bottom of this, and we  intend to do that. And we intend to do it in a considered, focused way.   Neither the Speaker nor I, as the gentleman has read, are saying that  we are seeking impeachment, but we are seeking to do our constitutional  duty, our responsibility to the American people and to the Constitution  to ensure that, in fact, the American people know what this  administration or individuals who work with this administration or  others were doing.                                time  1115    Madam Speaker, lastly, because we can go on at length about this, let  me say that the gentleman protests too much. The Republicans control  the United States Senate. Very frankly, the Intelligence Committee is  working in a bipartisan fashion with Mr. Burr from North Carolina and  Mr. Warner from Virginia.   Madam Speaker, if the gentleman, my friend, the whip, is frustrated,  I suggest he call up his friends in the United States Senate to say  they ought to do this; they ought to do that; and they ought to do the  other.   If they think it is the right thing to do, maybe they will do it. But  we intend to do our responsibility here.   Again, I would hope that we could join together in defense of the  Congress' responsibility and authority and not have any  administration--Republican, Democratic, Obama, Trump, any President-- say, no, it is not going to give us any information, that some other  body has disposed of that question.   Some other body is not us, and we need to move ahead on doing our  responsibility.   Again, I would hope the gentleman would cooperate, but we are going  to continue to do the business of the people of this country as well.   We have differences on that. We think this was a pretty historic  week. We passed the disaster bill. We extended flood insurance, and we  extended TANF, so neither one of them expired. Then, we passed the  American Dream and Promise Act, legislation that will relieve the fears  of 2-plus million people who are positive participants in the American  Dream.   It was a bipartisan bill, not a lot from your side, but we think it  is a historic piece of legislation. We hope the Senate takes it up.   We have been trying to get that bill on the floor for 8 years,  without success. We got it on the floor. As I knew it would, it passed.  I think it would have passed had we put it on the floor in the previous  Congress, but we didn't get it to the floor.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with the whip toward  reaching some bipartisan resolutions.   In particular, I agree with him, and I think we all agree that we  want to make sure that we have the resources necessary to handle what  is, in fact, a humanitarian crisis, with so many people fleeing natural  disasters and man-made disasters--terror, murder, mayhem--for safety  for themselves and their families, as have millions and millions and  millions of people who preceded them who came to this country. Whether  they came from Europe, Asia, Africa, South America, Central America,  they came here because America had a beacon that they saw as a land of  opportunity and a land of freedom, equality, and justice, a land in  which they wanted to live and make better.   Madam Speaker, we will continue to do our business as well as  exercise our responsibilities.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 11 a.m. tomorrow, and further,  when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet at 2 p.m. on  Monday next, and that the order of the House of January 3, 2019,  regarding morning-hour debate not apply on that day.
