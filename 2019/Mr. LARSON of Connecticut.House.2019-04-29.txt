 Mr. Speaker, let me first, before we  begin, given the tragedy that, once again, has visited our country over  the weekend, pause and acknowledge--with Rabbi Lazowski from  Connecticut in Washington, D.C., this evening and his son, Alan  Lazowski, joining him at a Holocaust museum dedication, and after  listening to the eloquence of Scott Peters and our own John Lewis--how  indeed saddened we are by these events.   As Mr. Lewis said, we remain focused on ending and focusing on hoping  and praying that these horrific events will stop, but I assure you they  will not stop without action on behalf of the United States Congress.   Mr. Speaker, we are honored to rise this evening and discuss Social  Security 2100. We are honored to be joined by the deputy chair of the  committee, Bill Pascrell from Paterson, New Jersey. We want to make  sure that citizens all across this country understand the number of  hearings that are going on in districts all across the country and here  in the Nation's Capitol, because it is long overdue that we address the  issue of not just protecting Social Security, but enhancing it.   Mr. Speaker, in fact, the last time that the United States Congress  significantly addressed the issue of Social Security was in 1983. Tip  O'Neill was then Speaker of the House, and Ronald Reagan was President.  It does demonstrate that Democrats and Republicans can work together in  the best interests of the country, and there is no bill currently  before the body that does that in a better way than Social Security  2100.   I say that because it is the only bill that has an actuarial report  that verifies that it does everything that it says it will do: keep  Social Security solvent, sustainably solvent beyond the 75-year  requirement by law. But also, not just make it sustainably solvent, but  enhance the program so that people all across this country can benefit  from the Nation's leading insurance program.   Now, the point we always try to make and get across is something that  is intuitively obvious to American citizens, but not often explained  graphically, and that is this: that Social Security is not an  entitlement. Mr. Speaker, you hear people speak of Social Security and  say: we need entitlement reform.   Certainly, you are entitled to Social Security because you paid for  it. This is what every American citizen understands from the first time  they get a paycheck and they look at its stub, and it says: FICA. FICA  stands for Federal Insurance Contribution.   Whose contribution?   Yours.   American citizens throughout their work life contribute into the  program. They do so knowing that since 1940 they have been able to get  a check in return for either their retirement or because of a  disability or spousal or dependent coverage. That is why it is the most  effective and unique governmental program paid for by American citizens  through their FICA premiums that are taken from their paycheck weekly,  biweekly, or monthly.   But what every American knows is that this is the insurance you have  paid for, not an entitlement program that the government somehow just  grants you.   So we come to Congress in this session, as we have in the past,  proposing a bill, but one that we have already had four public hearings  on. In those hearings, we have discussed why, in fact, it is necessary  for us not to just protect and preserve Social Security, make sure that  it is sustainably solvent for 75 years, but, in fact, enhance it,  starting with the fact that the last time we strengthened the program  was in 1983.   So to say that we are overdue is an understatement. We are overdue at  a time when baby boomers are retiring at a record rate. In fact, Mr.  Speaker, 10,000 baby boomers a day become eligible for Social Security.  That, in and of itself, should require an actuarial adjustment, one  that should have been indexed into the law in 1983 but was not.   So now it is incumbent upon the Congress. Citizens can't do this on  their own. They make their premium payments every week, biweekly, or  monthly, but it is up to Congress to make sure the program is  actuarially sound. So we proposed a bill that is not only actuarially  sound beyond 75 years, but also one that is enhanced to make up for the  lack of indexing and make sure that people now in their retirement can  have a rational increase in their Social Security.   Nobody is getting wealthy on Social Security. Nobody is hoarding  their Social Security money. They spend it weekly, biweekly, and  monthly in their respective communities. It is an economic boost to  every community and essential for the survival of many of our citizens.    We have opted to make sure that we enhance Social Security in the  following four ways: number one, there is a modest, 2 percent across- the-board increase for everyone who is receiving Social Security and  who will receive Social Security in the future.   Number two, we make sure that the new level of Social Security  payments is now changed so that as long as you have paid in your  quarters, you have put in your time, and paid your Social Security  benefits, the new floor for Social Security will be 125 percent of what  the Federal Government determines the poverty rate is at that time,  therefore lifting so many people, especially women, and more directly  especially women of color, in this country who have been the caregivers  of our children and family members whether through birth or through  sickness, and therefore have not been in the workforce as long as their  male counterparts. We also know that while they were in the workforce,  they were making 70 cents for every dollar their male counterpart was.  So to raise people out of poverty so they can make their payments to  maintain a lifestyle or quality of life that is just above the poverty  level is the right thing to do.   The third thing we do is something that the AARP has long advocated,  and that is to make sure that we have a COLA that actually reflects the  cost that people incur when they are in retirement.   What are those costs?   Those costs happen to be utility bills--heating and cooling your  home--the doctor visits, the prescription drugs, the nutrition, and the  physical therapy. Those are the essential--along with food--elements  that you need to exist. It ought to be factored into how COLAs are  given. Currently a COLA is just given based on the consumer price index  and an average which incorporates a multitude of expenses, and,  frankly, oftentimes, as every senior in America will attest, they have  gone without COLA payments at a time when the disparity of wealth is  getting greater in this country of ours. So a COLA payment makes sense  and is geared towards your actual expenses, something that we call CPI- E, E standing for the elderly and the expenses that they incur.                                time  1945    Lastly, we also do a fourth thing. We provide a tax break to seniors.  [[Page H3299]]    Again, in 1983, they determined that if you were single and making  more than $24,000 a year, your Social Security was taxed; if you were a  married couple and making more than $32,000 a year, your Social  Security was taxed.   Today, that has certainly not kept pace and is way out of line with  what should happen. So in our bill, Social Security 2100, we move that  to $50,000 per individual and $100,000 per couple. 12.5 million  Americans will get a tax cut immediately, something that I know they  will be able to use.   Why do people remain working when they are retired? Number one,  because many of them have to. Number two, because many of them find it  more purposeful in their lives to stay gainfully employed and involved  and committed in their communities, and they do.   This, again, is another reasonable measure: an increase across the  board of 2 percent, make sure that 125 percent of poverty is the new  floor for Social Security, have a COLA that is based on actual  expenses, and provide a tax break for those who are currently working  or will continue to work after retirement age.   We already have growth in the age group. Just this past year, 66 has  now become the age at which you can become eligible for Social  Security. You can get it if you are at 62, if you can make that case,  but you will receive far less money.   The beauty of Social Security is that it also has built-in incentives  for people, depending on their circumstances. If they can wait longer,  there is more money that they will receive.   An example: If a person who opted to take money at 62 waited until  they were age 70, they could almost double what they would receive, in  terms of a Social Security payment for their retirement.   That is the kind of incentive that we should have for people, knowing  that, if they can, through education, understand what this would be.  They should contact the Social Security office and make sure that they  find out what their payments are and what is in their best interests.   Everybody's case, as we know, is not the same. It is different  depending upon your health and lifestyle circumstances; what you had  for a job and the kind of job and its impact on you physically,  mentally, and emotionally; and where you are, at whatever state in  time, so that you need this.   That is what we are also pleased about, that we are presenting an  opportunity for people to get Social Security in a manner in which it  will be enhanced in these four ways and that it is sustainably solvent.   How do we get there to do this, especially without burdening any  future generation? We do it the same way that Franklin Delano Roosevelt  thought it should be done, and Dwight David Eisenhower when he expanded  the program thought it should be done, and Lyndon Baines Johnson when  he expanded the program, and lastly, when Ronald Reagan agreed to  improve and expand the program.   We do it by way of introducing legislation and then by doing the  time-honored thing of increasing the contribution. This is an insurance  payment--an insurance payment. Americans, in poll after poll after  poll, are saying: My God, we are willing to pay more so that we can  reap the benefit. Why doesn't Congress make it actuarially sound so  that we are able to do this?   By increasing the payment by 1.2 percent but then phasing that in  over 25 years, we are able to come up with an incremental adjustment  that takes the place of what should have happened in 1983, which would  have been the gradual indexing in payment of the program.   This way, we make the program actuarially sound. We make sure that it  is sustainably solvent and that people can have the benefits that they  need.   How do we know this? How does any senior? How can anyone rely on it?  They can because we have the corresponding actuarial report that goes  through every line of the bill and certifies how it is paid for and  that it is sustainably solvent beyond 75 years.   We also scrap the cap on people making over $400,000. Usually, when I  am at a senior hall, I will ask somebody to raise their hand if they  are making over $400,000. It might surprise some of our viewers that  not many hands go up in the room. So far, I have yet to see a hand go  up in any senior center that I have been in.   Nonetheless, it represents about six-tenths of the American people.  We lift the cap on it, and all that means is that they will pay what a  guy making $50,000 a year is paying.   When we first introduced this bill on Social Security, the cap on  Social Security was $112,000. It is now $132,900. It will grow every  year. But we lift the cap on people over $400,000 because baby boomers  will peak around 2022. This helps us ease them into that process  actuarially.   We have two things that are going on that help us both enhance the  program and make sure that it is sustainably solvent.   Another way to explain this--and I often do this by holding up a very  popular brand of coffee and saying to seniors: How much does this  Starbucks cost? Typically, they will know the answer immediately. They  will ask if it is a latte. I will say, yes, it is. They will say $4.50.   That is right. Or, if you are making $50,000 a year, that is 9 weeks  of Social Security payments. Or, if you were those fortunate people at  $400,000 a year, it would still cost you more weekly to buy this latte  than it will to fix Social Security.   Can we do this, America? You bet we can, in the same traditional,  time-honored way that we have done it in the past.   This is not an entitlement. This is insurance that needs to be paid  for. You have contributed to it all your life. For a small enhancement,  for a small contribution--if you are making $25,000 a year, it costs  you 25 cents; if you are making $100,000 a year, it costs you a buck a  week to make sure that Social Security is there for all American  citizens.    Let me say this, too, because I know our viewers know, and especially  the man from Paterson knows this, that it is not just a retirement  plan, though we focus on this. It is also spousal and dependent  coverage, disability coverage. In fact, one in five recipients of  Social Security is not in retirement currently.   That is why we have the support of so many organizations, from Social  Security Works to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security,  the AFL-CIO, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, who have been before  the committee to testify.   If you heard them speak, there is not an American anywhere in this  country who wouldn't stand up and salute and say: This is what we need  to do. This is what we must do for all our citizens but especially  those who have gone above and beyond in terms of the sacrifice that  they have provided for this country.   We are proud of all the sponsors that this has attracted, but it  doesn't happen without the day-to-day work, without the testimony,  without the hearings. There is nobody who has worked harder at this  than the Congressman from Paterson, New Jersey; the deputy chair of the  Subcommittee on Social Security; the former mayor of Paterson; a voice  for America; my dear friend and colleague, Bill Pascrell.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  New Jersey for his continued leadership.   I want to underscore a couple of things that he said, and especially  reaching out to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle.   It is not often that I think you see us come to the floor and talk  about following President Trump, but I believe they should follow their  President in this instance, because he had both the audacity and the  temerity to argue in front of 16 other Republicans when he was  campaigning for President and they attempted to corner him and commit  that Social Security was an entitlement. He said, no, it is an earned  benefit; it needs to be protected. To his credit, he had written before  about it in a book as well, and so he is on the record.   We will pass a bill in the House of Representatives, there is no  question, with more than 206 original cosponsors on the bill, but what  we need to happen here, I think, is for people to come together in a  way that they did in 1983 and present the American people.   Now, some would say, well, geez, that is impossible to do. The House  is Democratic, the President is Republican, and the Senate is  Republican.   In 1983, the House was Democratic and Tip O'Neill was the Speaker;  Ronald Reagan was the President; Howard  [[Page H3301]]  Baker was the Senate majority leader, a Republican.   So what happened then and what needs to happen now is for the  American public to make sure that they are contacting their  Representative, their Senator, the President and saying this can be  done.   I am confident that Nancy Pelosi and Donald Trump could do what Tip  O'Neill and Ronald Reagan did in 1983, except this time it would be  enhanced and indexed and help so many people.   Here are the facts:   Almost 63 million people are receiving Social Security benefits, of  which 55 percent are women and 45 percent are men;   For almost two-thirds of those beneficiaries, Social Security  provides a majority of their income--a majority of their income for  two-thirds of American people--and for almost one-third, it provides 90  percent or more of their income;   The average annual Social Security benefit for a woman is $14,000-- nobody is getting wealthy on these programs that they have paid for-- compared with $18,000 for men;   Without these very modest benefits, nearly half of women 65 years or  older living without a spouse would live in poverty;   Nearly 20 percent of Hispanic women 65 years and older live under  this current program in poverty, and without Social Security increases,  this would rise to 50 percent for Hispanic women over 65 years old;   Today, nearly 18 percent of African Americans live in poverty on  Social Security.   So the Nation's preeminent insurance program, as sound and as solid  as it is and will be, the latest Social Security Trustees report says  that in just 15 years, if we do nothing--which, shamelessly, has been  the role that Congress has played, it has done nothing--if we do  nothing, there will be a 21 percent across-the-board cut in order for  people to continue to receive their checks.   We can do this, America. This is within our grasp. You have a  President who is like-minded, a Speaker of the House who would be very  enthusiastic about making sure that we are taking care of all Americans  with this universal insurance plan that provides retirement funding,  dependent and spousal coverage in time of death.   Three of the members on the Ways and Means Committee and two on the  Subcommittee on Social Security were raised by a single parent, having  lost a father prematurely.   It is incredible to me that we don't just come together and  recognize, as a nation--noting that the President has recognized this;  clearly, the Speaker has; and I am sure that even Mitch McConnell would  recognize this as well--that we need to come together.   What Americans dislike most about Congress is they don't see us  solving problems. They see us straining on the fringes, both making our  points but not coming together to solve a problem that works to their  benefit.   That is why we are elected: to govern and to govern on behalf of the  people who sent us here. We think that this is a good step in the right  direction.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for joining me here this evening. I  hope that those who have heard us here this evening will call their  elected Representative and their United States Senators to talk to them  about coming together to solve the problem for Social Security and pass  Social Security 2100.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 16 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, April 30, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
