 Coach Rollinson, congratulations. You put not Santa Ana  but Santa Ana on the map.   Thank you very much. You have often said that you create the effort  and God controls the outcome. These are words to live by. Thank you  very much.   Last year, I had the opportunity when I was at home on a Friday  night--one of my favorite activities is to go and watch high school  football games. Santa Ana Bowl is about a mile away from my house.   This night you were there coaching Mater Dei vs. St. John Bosco. It  was an epic game of course.   As I got there and looked around, I was on the sidelines--your side,  by the  [[Page H1433]]  way, not Bosco's side--and next to me I saw the USC head coach and  Bama's head coach. There must have been every head coach in the top 20  schools in this country watching your game and watching your athletes  play football that night.   It was unbelievable.   At the end of the game we had a bunch of helicopters come by and take  these coaches away. It was an unbelievable night.   We are going to honor you today, an honor well-deserved. You are  Orange County's all-time leader, and the winningest coach.   You graduated from Mater Dei High School in 1967, and in 1966, you  played against Anaheim High School--my High School. I am a Colonist  too. You played against my coach, Clare Van Hoorebeke.                                time  1215    This is our helmet, sir. Do you remember it?   I wore this helmet that night in 1966. It was the game of the decade.  Anaheim Stadium, a record number of people attending that night; almost  33,000 people in attendance that night in 1966.   Coach Rollinson, if I look at this poster here, we edged you out that  night. We won, 12-7. It is my understanding that you scored those 7  points. Of course, as you can see, the players at the bottom there, I  think that is probably you, one of those players is you.   Coach Van Hoorebeke preceded you in Anaheim, Orange County. I think  we all learned from him. If I think back to the days I played football  under Coach Van Hoorebeke, the one thing the coach taught me is when  you get hit, when you get knocked down, when you get bloodied, you get  up, and you keep going.   I still remember those days. Three-hour football practices. No water,  no rest. Heaven help you, if you made a mistake; you had to go run  laps, full uniform on, helmet on. That was the discipline we grew up  with in Orange County.   Coach Rollinson, I am telling you what you already know; we were a  community. We are a community in Orange County. I am honored to say  today that we are a family.   I often would drive down Bristol Street to take my kids to the local  elementary school, and I would watch your team practice, admiring you  and respecting you because, sir, you put us on the map again and again  and again.   You graduated from Mater Dei. You came back to teach in 1976 at Mater  Dei. That is the year I graduated from Anaheim High School. Like my  colleague Mr. Womack said, four national championships. With the  exception of maybe one or two universities, more Heisman trophies than  anybody else in the country.   I am not going to say good-bye, sir, but I will say that you will be  missed as a head coach, and I know and I do hope your successor will  carry on your tradition because we need to make sure we continue to  build champions in Santa Ana, California.   Let me conclude by saying that success of individuals like you, you  have got to have a team partner. Mrs. Rollinson, thank you for giving  him the strength to do what he does. I think at the end of the day, we  all married up, and we did well.   Like my colleagues have said, you are a great American. I would also  say you are a great member of our Orange County family. Thank you. God  bless. Go Colonists and go Mater Dei. Thank you very much, Coach  Rollinson.
