 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Engel for  yielding me this time. I rise in support of H.R. 1644, the Korean  Interdiction and Modernization of Sanctions Act, legislation that would  more effectively cut off the Kim regime's access to hard currency and  equipment for its ballistic missile and nuclear programs.   This legislation updates and expands the range of sanctions available  for the United States to use against persons or entities that violate  existing U.S. sanction laws and United Nations Security Council  resolutions regarding North Korea. The bill also requires the President  to report to Congress on foreign countries' compliance with those  Security Council resolutions.   The United States is determined to preserve the stability in the  Asia-Pacific region. Our Nation will uphold its treaty commitments to  Japan and South Korea and will defend their security in the face of the  North Korean threat.   I urge my colleagues to join me and vote in favor of this  legislation, which makes clear that the United States will target  individuals, companies, and banks that continue to do business with  North Korea.
