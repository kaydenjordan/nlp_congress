 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  courageous actions of three young lifeguards in  [[Page H3493]]  Fluvanna County at Lake Monticello in the Fifth Congressional District  of Virginia.   On July 6, a woman lost control of her vehicle following a medical  episode, leading her to drive through a gated pool area, hit a picnic  table, and then on to the beach and into Lake Monticello, where her car  began to sink.   Witnessing these events, lifeguards Paige Tomaras, Zachary Butler,  and Savannah Peterson sprang into action to save the driver from her  sinking vehicle. Thankfully, the driver was pulled from her car and  brought to the shore, where eventually EMS would arrive to transfer her  to receive medical attention.   Paige, Zachary, and Savannah ultimately saved the driver's life and  displayed a type of heroism that each of us would hope to resemble.   The Lake Monticello community is blessed to have such an outstanding  group of brave, young lifeguards who are willing to step into action  without hesitation, and it is an honor for me to recognize and  represent these selfless individuals.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Florida  for  [[Page H3541]]  bringing this important amendment, and I appreciate him allowing me to  speak for a moment to support the amendment.   This amendment would prohibit the Biden administration from  unilaterally issuing any restrictions on the 1033 program, which allows  police departments across the country to have access to lifesaving  military surplus equipment.   It is imperative that our Federal, State, and local law enforcement  maintain access to this equipment used to protect and save the lives of  Americans, especially in circumstances of terrorist attacks, search and  rescue operations, natural disasters or, yes, riots in our cities.   The Obama and Biden administrations put restrictions on the 1033  program that helps police departments across the country. Their  antipolice action would limit the ability for police departments to  obtain equipment needed for border security, counterdrug operations,  and more.   In a time when morale is low in police departments across the Nation,  thanks to antipolice riots and calls to defund the police from my  friends across the aisle, we must take every action possible to ensure  our law enforcement officers have the tools they need to keep  themselves and our communities safe, essentially to do their jobs.   Mr. Chair, I am proud to support the amendment, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment  to the NDAA, which would simply block funds from being made available  to the Naming Commission established by Congress just a few years ago.   The intent of that commission was to try to rewrite our Nation's  history by changing the names of our famous military bases and forts,  tearing down statues, and even putting blankets over monuments with  names not deemed worthy of remembrance by some. What a tragedy.   You only have to look outside my district at the famous Monument  Avenue in Richmond, Virginia, which has recently been desecrated by the  removal of once famous beautiful monuments.   This effort to remove statues and rename bases encourages an endless  cycle of renaming institutions, buildings, and cities across the  country under the destructive ruse of political wokeness.   Historical sites are healthy environments to observe varied  perspectives of historical events, engage diverse viewpoints, and  inspire robust conversation as we remember our Nation's history. We  should protect American memorials to preserve and remember our history.   It has been said that those who do not remember history are condemned  to repeat it.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to consider the precedent being  set by this arbitrary effort to rewrite our Nation's history.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this amendment to preserve our history and fight these reckless  efforts to destroy our country, our Founders, and our history.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Rogers).    The true history of America is that no nation  in the history of the world has rescued more people, freed more people,  fed more people, ministered to more people, and, yes, evangelized more  people around the globe.   No nation in the history of the world has been more welcoming to  people from all nationalities, all races, all ethnicities, and given  more opportunity, more upward mobility to people of all races, all  ethnicities, and all nationalities.   No nation in the history of the world did as the United States did  just some 85 years after declaring our independence, where the Nation  went to war with itself where the majority population suffered great  loss of blood and treasure to free the minority population. No nation  in the history of the world has it happened like it has happened in the  United States of America.   It was our Founding documents and principles that provided the  framework for us to realize our ideals of all men being created equal,  endowed by our Creator by unalienable rights.   The United States is unique among the nations of the world. Our  history is worth preserving. It is worth protecting. It is worth  remembering. It is worth honoring. It is worth learning and growing  from.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it is time to defund this Naming  Commission. It is time for us to move past these efforts to change our  history. It is time for us to preserve our history and our Founders and  the principles of our Nation, and to defund the Naming Commission.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1945
