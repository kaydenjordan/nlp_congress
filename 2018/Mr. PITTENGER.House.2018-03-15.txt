 Madam Speaker, I rise in memory of Homer Vaughn  Wagnon, Jr., a veteran of World War II who left this world on November  29, having ``just satisfied his life's ambitions,'' per the obituary  provided for him.   Mr. Wagnon served our country in the infantry, fighting his way  across France, Belgium, Holland, and Germany as he and his fellow  members of the Greatest Generation pushed back against tyranny.   He continued his service to our country in private business, helping  to build a post-World War II incredible economy as a mechanical  engineer. His range of new products included mechanical rubber goods,  radio and TV equipment, and items for naval ships and aircraft  applications.   Mr. Wagnon leaves behind the love of his life, Darlene Raitt Wright,  and Wagnon's 6 children, 11 grandchildren, and 5 great-grandchildren.  His grandson Tariq Bokhari followed his grandfather's example: In  distinction, he now serves as an outstanding member of the Charlotte  City Council.   Madam Speaker, please join me in expressing condolences to the Wagnon  family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I would like to convey my deep  appreciation to my colleague on the Financial Services Committee, Mr.  Tipton, for his efforts to improve and reform the examination process  for our Nation's financial institutions.   H.R. 4545 is designed to address enduring concerns about the lack of  consistency and quality in the bank examination process. The current  exam process can be both opaque and secretive. Coupling this with  overburdensome regulations and increased compliance costs have forced  many community banks and credit unions to close up shop or reduce their  ability to provide for consumers.   Look no further than my State, North Carolina, which has lost about  50 percent of its banks since the financial crisis. In my own city of  Charlotte, a decade ago, we had six community banks. Today, we only  have one because of the burdensome and costly compliance requirements.   Mr. Tipton's legislation creates a fair and impartial process for  financial institutions to appeal their examinations, which gives the  necessary clarity for banks and credit unions to provide services to  their customers, leading to a job creation and economic prosperity  environment.   That is why I want to thank the gentleman from Colorado for working  on this bipartisan piece of legislation. It is long past time that we  provide commonsense reforms in a transparent approach regarding  regulators' decisionmaking during the examination process.
