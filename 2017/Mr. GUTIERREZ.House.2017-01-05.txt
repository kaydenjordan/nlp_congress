 Mr. Speaker, my commitment to the State of Israel is  steadfast, but my first loyalty is to peace--peace that is protected by  genuine self-determination.   I know in my heart that the only path to peace is to have two  separate, sovereign states that peacefully coexist. The two-state  solution is at the heart of American foreign policy, and every  President and every Congress since I got here in 1993 put the two-state  solution at the heart of what America wants for her friend Israel.   As I said on the House floor on December 6, if we are ever going to  achieve the permanent peace that allows Israel to exist without fear  and Palestine to exist without occupation, we must continue to fight  for the two-state solution. But under the current strongman government  in Israel, all pretenses and illusions are being stripped away. From  settlements, to water, to restricting the Muslim call to prayer in  Jerusalem, it seems that anything goes.   Today, as America embarks on its own experiment with strongman  politics, this Congress is falling in line. This Congress that allowed  our Chamber to be used for an Israeli campaign rally and TV commercials  is bending to pressure from abroad and pressure here at home.   Mr. Speaker, I do not doubt the commitment to peace of the American  people, so I urge my colleagues to vote with their hearts and minds and  defeat this House resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record my remarks on the floor of  December 6 in support of a two-state solution.      Two State Solution Is Still The Path To Peace In The Middle East              [Luis V. Gutierrez Floor Remarks, Dec. 6, 2016]         Mr. Speaker, I am very concerned about what is going on in       Israel and I think it has implications both for U.S. foreign       policy and for domestic policy and for our great ally,       Israel.        As the right-wing government of Benjamin Netanyahu       consolidates power and becomes in many ways the one-party       rulers of Israel, a number of things are changing that should       be of concern to all Americans.        Specifically, the increasing dominance of the Likud Party       as the one-party in Israel jeopardizes the two state solution       that I and many others in the United States and Israel feel       is the only way to achieve long-term peace in the Middle       East.        There is a retrenchment of hard line policies--aimed at       solidifying alliances with smaller religious and hardline       parties that keeps Likud in power--that will make it harder       for Israelis and their allies in America--and anyone who       seeks a lasting peace--to maintain progress towards a two       state solution.        Right now, the Knesset is considering legislation to       legalize all Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory on       the West Bank, even those constructed on private Palestinian       land.        Boom, 400,000 people in settlements across the West Bank,       it's all legal because they say it is legal. But it's not.        And Israel is destroying Palestinian homes at a pace faster       than we have seen before.        It is provocative, sweeping, and designed to make it harder       to ever reach an agreement with the Palestinians.        The plan to restrict the Muslim call to prayer in Jerusalem       has been revived, again to placate hardline religious       constituents, by Prime Minister Netanyahu.        There is no clearer statement to people of the Islamic       faith that they do not matter, they do not belong, and they       will not be tolerated than to restrict the Muslim call to       prayer in Jerusalem, a city that has heard the Muslim call to       prayer for thousands of years.        I think what is going on in Israel with Prime Minister       Netanyahu presents a cautionary tale about the consequences       of following a political strongman. The strongman has to keep       proving that he is a strongman over and over.        Like other strongmen who ride fear into leadership--when       you base your political career on injecting fear and       resentment into political affairs--when you use the backdrop       of terrorism and the understandable fear of the Israeli       people as a political tool for years and decades--this is the       kind of policy that results.        There is an appetite for constant escalation of what you       are doing to stand up to the enemy you have constructed--an       enemy based on, but not the same as the enemies that fight       against the state of Israel and tolerance and peace in real       life.        Strongmen construct a foil--in this case based on the       Palestinians, but sometimes exaggerated beyond recognition--      and they need to feed the thirst for more and more action to       attack the caricature that has been constructed.        But strongman politics in Israel have the impact of making       a long-lasting solution that brings peace to the Middle East       harder to achieve.        The fundamental rights of Palestinians to have their own       state, a state alongside the Israeli state where they have       the basic rights and dignity to govern themselves and raise       their families in peace--that is what many Israelis, many       Palestinians, and many around the world have been fighting       for.        If we are ever going to achieve the permanent peace that       allows Israel to exist without fear and Palestine to exist       without occupation, we must continue to fight for the two       state solution.        When I was just a freshman, almost 25 years ago, we       celebrated the accomplishments of Rabin and Arafat and       President Clinton to build towards a peace that recognizes       the rights and dignity of Israelis and the rights and       dignities of the Palestinian people.        For decades, the United States--under different leaders in       different parties from Carter to Reagan to Bush and Obama--      have recognized that peace will only come with mutual respect       and tolerance.        That is what we have based our foreign policy on and should       continue to base our foreign policy on.        Having talked with average people and with leaders on both       sides of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict--I am convinced       that it is the only path to peace.        America has been a catalyst--a constructive influence from       outside--a nation based on religious freedom and democracy       that has served as a model for both Palestinians and       Israelis--and we have worked towards helping parties continue       to move in the direction of two separate but mutually       respectful countries, two nations that are not at war with       each other or subservient to one another.        I fear, Mr. Speaker, that Israel herself is moving away       from the two state solution as a goal and that we as her       closest ally must remind her--and ourselves--of what is at       stake if we lose sight of this important goal.
