 Mr. President, to my colleague from South Carolina,  Senator Graham, we will challenge the Clemson Tigers to the NCAA skiing  championship anytime.   I rise to speak about the bill we are working on today, S. 1,  Strengthening America's Security in the Middle East Act.   I am proud to be a sponsor of this legislation, along with Senator  Rubio and Senator Risch. I commend Chairman Risch for working with the  majority leader in attempting to move this important legislation and  effort without delay.   I think it is important to recognize that this bill combines four  noncontroversial pieces of legislation from the 115th Congress that are  intended to support our strong allies, Israel and Jordan, and to impose  sanctions against the gross human rights abuses of the Assad regime in  Syria.   We have no stronger ally in the Middle East than the State of Israel.  Israel has proven itself to be a resilient beacon of democratic values,  despite facing existential threats daily since its founding in 1948.   Our two nations have worked closely to fight terrorism, to stop the  spread of radical Islamist extremism, and to prevent nuclear and  chemical weapons proliferation by rogue regimes, such as Syria and  Iran. The legislation before us today simply reaffirms our strong  support for Israel, including $3.3 billion per year in annual U.S.  security assistance, consistent with the 10-year U.S.-Israel memorandum  of understanding, which was signed in 2016 by President Obama.   In the 115th Congress, 72 Senators--72 Senators, Republicans and  Democrats--cosponsored this legislation. It passed in the Senate  unanimously on August 1, 2018. There is no reason why my colleagues  across the aisle should not support this legislation today--no reason-- in order to show our strong bipartisan support to our friend and ally,  Israel, at a time of great need.   This package also includes provisions supporting State governments  that have taken action against the anti-Israel and anti-Semitic  movement known as Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions, or BDS. To date,  26 States--including my home State of Colorado--have adopted laws or  executive orders against BDS. This legislation before us today simply  endorses those decisions and clarifies that these measures adopted or  enforced by a State or local government are not preempted by any  Federal law if they comply with the requirements in the legislation.  [[Page S45]]    This anti-BDS legislation had 48 bipartisan cosponsors in the 115th  Congress. There is no reason it should not be passed with bipartisan  support today.   BDS is a vile movement--a vile movement--and should be vociferously  opposed by Republicans, Democrats, and everyone alike. This is why, on  December 20, I led a letter, with 14 of my Senate colleagues, to the  majority leader and the minority leader to take immediate action  against BDS.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                  Washington, DC, December 20, 2018.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      The Capitol, Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Senate Minority Leader,      The Capitol, Washington, DC.        Dear Leaders McConnell and Schumer: We write today to bring       to your attention a disturbing development concerning the       anti-Israel and anti-Semitic movement known as Boycott,       Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS). Regrettably, in recent days,       future members of the U.S. House of Representatives have       publicly expressed support for this extreme movement.        We urge you to issue a joint statement publicly condemning       BDS and to prioritize legislative efforts in the next session       of Congress to counter this destructive trend. We note there       were bipartisan legislative efforts, including the Combating       BDS Act (S. 170) and the Israel Anti-Boycott Act (S. 720),       which were introduced in the 115th Congress.        Israel is our country's most steadfast ally in a highly       volatile region of the world. The State of Israel has proven       itself to be a resilient beacon of democratic values, despite       facing existential threats daily since its founding in 1948.       Working closely together, our two countries have worked to       fight terrorism, to stop the spread of radical Islamist       ideologies, and to prevent nuclear and chemical weapons       proliferation by rogue regimes, such as Syria and the Islamic       Republic of Iran.        As then-President Barack Obama stated in his speech in       Jerusalem on March 21, 2013: ``Israel has established a       thriving democracy with a spirited civil society, proud       political parties, a tireless free press, and a lively public       debate--lively may even be an understatement. And Israel has       achieved this even as it has overcome relentless threats to       its security--through the courage of the Israel Defense       Forces, and a citizenry that is resilient in the face of       terror.''        Simply put, the BDS movement seeks to de-legitimize the       State of Israel and its people. Senator Schumer, as you so       eloquently stated on March 6, 2018: ``We must continue to       stand firm against the profoundly biased campaign to       delegitimize the State of Israel through [BDS] . . . While       Iran publicly executes its citizens, Turkey jails its       journalists, scores of Arab nations punish homosexuality with       imprisonment and torture, why does BDS single Israel out       alone for condemnation?''        It is disheartening to see future members of Congress take       a position on BDS that is not only highly biased, but       contrary to fundamental facts and detrimental to U.S.       national security interests. We therefore respectfully urge       you to immediately condemn these comments and to show       bipartisan support for our ally Israel.            Sincerely,          Cory Gardner, Lindsey Graham, Marco Rubio, Chuck             Grassley, Ted Cruz, Susan M. Collins, Jon Kyl, John             Hoeven, Steve Daines, John Thune, Cindy Hyde-Smith,             Roger Wicker, James E. Risch, David Perdue, Tim Scott.     In that letter, we asked for immediate bipartisan  response against BDS, including moving today's legislation forward. In  that letter, we quote the minority leader, Senator Schumer, when he  spoke at the annual American-Israel Public Affairs Committee conference  just this past March. Less than a year ago, here is what Senator  Schumer told the audience at AIPAC on March 5, 2018:         [W]e must continue to stand firm against the profoundly       biased campaign to delegitimize the State of Israel through       [boycotts, divestment, and sanctions].        While Iran publicly executes its citizens, Turkey jails its       journalists, scores of Arab nations punish homosexuality with       imprisonment and torture, why does BDS single Israel out       alone for condemnation?        When there is such a double standard, when the world treats       everybody one way and the Jew or the Jewish State another       way, there's only one word for it: anti-Semitism. Let us call       out the BDS movement for what it is. Let us delegitimize the       delegitimizers by letting the world know when there is a       double standard. Whether they know it or not, they are       actively participating in an anti-Semitic movement.    Those are the words of the Democratic minority leader in March of  2018. I completely agree with Senator Schumer. Yet today I understand  that he and Members of his caucus plan to vote against the motion to  proceed on bipartisan legislation that would condemn BDS. It is  regrettable. It is unfortunate. It is horrible.   It is also part of a new and disturbing trend that we see from some  of our colleagues in the Democratic caucus. As we noted in our letter,  several Members of the House of Representatives have now publicly  endorsed BDS and have not been condemned by Senator Schumer and other  Democratic leaders. We saw the manifestation of this dangerous trend 2  days ago, when a Democratic Representative issued a statement alleging  that the Senators who introduced the bill before us today, myself  included, forget what country they represent. This is a reprehensible  charge of dual loyalty utterly unbefitting of a sitting Member of  Congress, and we all need to come together to condemn such vile  insinuations.   I am glad to see that respected, nonpartisan organizations, like the  American Jewish Committee, AJC, have now issued strong statements  rebuking this Democratic Member of Congress.   The AJC statement reads in part:         AJC is outraged at the tweet posted by [the Representative]       that U.S. senators who had introduced Israel-related       legislation ``forgot what country they represent.''        That assertion, which completely avoids legitimate debate       about the content of the bill itself, insinuates that a       number of respected, long-serving senators are somehow more       loyal to Israel than they are to the United States.        The charge evokes classical anti-Semitic tropes about dual       loyalty--in this case applied to some lawmakers who are not       even Jewish--that have no place in our political discourse.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  the statement from AJC dated January 7, 2019.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     AJC Outraged by Rep. Tlaib's Tweet                               (Jan. 7, 2019)         New York.--AJC is outraged at the tweet posted by       Representative Rashida Tlaib (D-MI) claiming that U.S.       senators who had introduced Israel-related legislation       ``forgot what country they represent.'' That assertion, which       completely avoids legitimate debate about the content of the       bill itself, insinuates that a number of respected, long-      serving senators are somehow more loyal to Israel than they       are to the United States.        The charge evokes classical anti-Semitic tropes about dual       loyalty--in this case applied to some lawmakers who are not       even Jewish--that have no place in our political discourse.       Ironically, it was Representative Tlaib who took the unusual       step of wrapping herself in a foreign flag upon winning       election to Congress, and who said she would serve as ``a       voice for'' another nation in the House of Representatives.        Her ad hominem attack on congressional colleagues joins a       growing list of troubling statements by the newly elected       member, including her rejection of a two-state solution to       the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.        AJC calls on Rep. Tlaib to apologize for her offensive       remarks.     Mr. President, I believe this body can do different, so  I ask my colleagues to put politics aside and vote yes on the motion to  proceed to this legislation that will help enhance our national  security and will take strong action against a reprehensible and racist  movement known as BDS.   I know there are some who believe we should shut down the Senate  because of the current funding situation in the Federal Government, but  let me remind Members of this Chamber that in 2013, under Democratic  Majority Leader Harry Reid, what was voted on during the shutdown in  2013--here it is--a bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to  take actions to implement the agreement between the United States of  America and the United Mexican States concerning transboundary  hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico. Somehow, in 2013, it was  OK to find time for that measure.   While complaining about finding time for other measures right now,  during the shutdown in 2013, they found time to address the Security  Clearance Oversight and Reform Enhancement Act. They found time for the  Small Airplane Revitalization Act. They found time to ensure that any  new or revised requirement providing for the screening, testing, or  treatment of individuals operating commercial motor  [[Page S46]]  vehicles for sleep disorders is adopted pursuant to a rulemaking  proceeding and for other purposes. Now they don't want to bring up  anti-BDS legislation because we shouldn't be talking about anything  else, but in 2013, they had time to vote on and to consider things like  extending the period during which Iraqis who are employed by the U.S.  Government in Iraq may be granted special immigrant status and  temporarily increasing the fee or surcharge for processing machine- readable nonimmigrant visas.   I am not downplaying the importance of these bills. I am saying that  there seems to be a significant double standard and a significant  partisan double standard because what is being complained about today  is the same thing that was fine in 2013--had time to vote on a couple  of district judges as well, but now there is no time for that.   People are saying we shouldn't vote on this legislation until the  government is funded. I have said it very clearly--we need to fund the  government. What also needs to be very clear is how people will vote on  this legislation, to not hide behind the shutdown how they would vote  on anti-BDS legislation.   We have heard the rhetoric. We have heard the very real comments from  not fictitious Members of Congress but from actual Members of Congress  who support an anti-Semitic movement. We can condemn it today with a  simple vote to proceed. If people don't want to take too much time to  debate it, I think everybody knows that it is right to support an anti- BDS position. They know it is right to oppose Assad and his chemical  attacks and the other torturous actions he has taken against his own  people. It is a pretty simple vote on this motion to proceed--vote yes;  support the underlying legislation. Bipartisan Members, Republicans and  Democrats, just last year supported this legislation, voted for this  legislation, and I hope they will not let partisan politics get in the  way of doing what is right.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
