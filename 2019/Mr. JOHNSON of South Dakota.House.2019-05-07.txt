 Mr. Speaker, in the 1960s, South  Dakota's Ben Reifel became the first Lakota Indian to represent our  country in Congress. He grew up dirt poor in a log cabin. He dropped  out after the eighth grade, later going on to graduate from South  Dakota State and from Harvard.   Throughout his career, Ben Reifel, at the Bureau of Indian Affairs  and for a decade here in Congress, fought to advance economic  opportunity for American Indians. He celebrated hard work, education,  and self-determination. He was respected in Indian Country, and he was  respected in this Chamber.   Last week, I filed a bill to put Ben Reifel's name on the Rosebud  Post Office. I am hopeful that young Indian boys and girls will look  upon that name and realize that great Americans have come and will come  again from that sacred place.                            ____________________
