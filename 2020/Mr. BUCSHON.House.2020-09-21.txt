 Madam Speaker, as a physician and a father of four, I  understand the importance of ensuring the health of mothers during  pregnancy and after the delivery of their newborns. This is a critical  time for both the mother and the child.   Sadly, Indiana has an unacceptably high maternal mortality rate,  ranking third in the country. We can do better.   We must do better in our approach across the entire Nation,  especially in rural America, to use best practices and provide the  necessary resources to stop preventable maternal mortality. The  Maternal Health Quality Improvement Act is a great first step toward  doing just that.   H.R. 4995 includes the Excellence in Maternal Health Act, legislation  I introduced along with my fellow Hoosier, Representative Andre Carson.   This bipartisan legislation will benefit patients and communities  that are currently struggling, like those in my home State of Indiana,  by providing them with the support and the training they so desperately  need.   Madam Speaker, together, we can work to help mothers and their  children achieve better health outcomes. I urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 4995.
