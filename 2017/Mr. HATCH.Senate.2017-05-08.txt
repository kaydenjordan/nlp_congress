 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, a month ago, I spoke in strong support of  Dr. Heather Wilson to be the 24th Secretary of the Air Force. I am  pleased that it appears that her nomination will be confirmed today.   In the many years I have known Dr. Wilson, I have always been  impressed by her intellect and especially by her leadership skills. Her  qualifications and character are beyond dispute. Throughout her life,  she has used her many talents not for personal gain or self- aggrandizement but for the public good.   Dr. Wilson was one of the first female graduates of the Air Force  Academy,  [[Page S2795]]  which is a pretty impressive accomplishment unto itself, but she set an  even higher standard when she earned a Rhodes scholarship to study at  Oxford University.   Upon being awarded her Ph.D., she went to work for the National  Security Council and then ran for Congress. I got to know Dr. Wilson  through her insightful work on the House Intelligence and Armed  Services Committees. Make no mistake--Dr. Wilson made a difference  during her service in the House. As a well-respected member of the  Intelligence Committee, she built a reputation as a no-nonsense  legislator who was deeply committed to upholding our national security.  In all things, she proved herself to be exceptionally competent, and I  have to say that she proved herself to be worthy of the highest trust.   After her service in the House, Dr. Wilson became the president of  the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology. There, she again set a  high bar by leading a school whose alumni, I have been informed, make a  higher average starting salary than do Harvard graduates.   For over 20 years, our Nation's Air Force has been involved in  conflicts all over the world. Now more than ever, the Air Force needs a  proven leader who can modernize the service and lead us to victory. I  believe Dr. Wilson will provide that leadership. I have every  confidence that she will serve with honor and integrity and make a  lasting difference as the next Secretary of the Air Force. I have known  her for a long time. I have gone to her State and worked with her and  campaigned with her. All I can say is that she is a very top-notch  woman leader, one of the best I have seen in all of my time in the U.S.  Senate, and I know she is going to do a terrific job. I am going to  help her every step of the way, and I am sure everybody else here will.   I hope everybody on this floor will vote for Dr. Heather Wilson for  this position. We cannot lose. We are all going to be ahead because she  is willing to serve and serve more, and she is willing to leave what  really is a very comfortable position in order to take one that is not  so comfortable and is very demanding, and I respect her for that and  think the world of her.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
