 Mr. Chief Justice, I send to the desk a question  submitted on behalf of myself and Senator Schatz, directed to both  White House counsel and the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senators Murkowski and Schatz directed to both  parties:         Would you agree that almost any action a President takes,       or indeed any action the vast majority of politicians take,       is, to one degree or another, inherently political? Where is       the line between permissible political actions and       impeachable political actions?    The President's counsel will go first.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for that  question, and I think that the question really hits the nail on the  head.   As I mentioned the other day, in a representative democracy, elected  officials almost always have at least one eye looking on to the next  election and how their actions--their policy decisions, their actions  in office--will be received by the electorate, and there is nothing  wrong with that. That is good. It is part of the way representative  democracy works. So having part of your motives being looking toward  the next election, looking toward how that will affect electoral  chances--that is part of the nature of elected office. And to start  getting into motives about ``Will this affect my prospects in the next  election?'' and calling that corrupt, and, if you have got that as part  of your motive, looking into whether you were doing something for  electoral advantage and saying ``That is going to be a corrupt motive;  we will say that you can be charged for wrongdoing with that or  impeached'' is very dangerous because there is almost no way to get  inside someone's head and parcel out which percentage was one motive  and which percentage was another motive.   If you start down that path, it is totally amorphous. This is part of  the point that Professor Dershowitz was making and that was made here a  couple of times. This idea of impeaching a President on a theory of  abuse of power depends entirely on analyzing subjective motives because  that is what the House managers have suggested--that we are assuming  there is an act, on its face, that is legitimate and is within the  President's authority and is not, on its face, in any way unlawful or  unconstitutional, but solely based on motive, we are going to impeach  him. And by saying ``Well, if it was really directed at the next  election, that is the corrupt motive,'' that is a very dangerous path  because there is always some eye on the next election.   It ends up becoming a standard so malleable that it really is a  substitute for a policy difference: If we don't like your policy, we  attribute it to bad motives. That is something that Justice Iredell  warned about in the North Carolina ratifying convention, that if you  base something just on motive because of what he called ``malignity of  party,'' the other party will always attribute bad motives.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Thank you.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, I think the answer is yes.   I think the answer is yes, that public officials are inherently  political animals. I don't mean that in the derogatory term. They run  for office; they hold office; they conduct acts as political figures.  But if we look at what Hamilton had to say about the core of offenses  that warrant the impeachment power, he talked about the crimes being  political in character and the remedies being political in character  because we are not talking about imprisonment here. We are not talking  about taking away someone's liberty.   So we are talking about a political punishment for a political crime.  Now, what is a political crime? Yes, everyone in office has a political  motivation. But certainly that doesn't mean that we can't draw a line  between corrupt activity that is undertaken, yes, for a political  reason and noncorrupt activity. Indeed, we have to draw that line.    Let's show what Professor Dershowitz had to say about where we should  draw the line.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. Senator Murkowski asks counsel for the  President:         You explain that Ambassador Sondland and Senator Johnson       both said the President explicitly denied that he was looking       for a quid pro quo with Ukraine. The reporting on Ambassador       Bolton's book suggests the President told Bolton directly       that the aid would not be released until Ukraine announced       the investigations the President desired. This dispute about       material facts weighs in favor of calling additional       witnesses with direct knowledge. Why should this body not       call Ambassador Bolton?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for the  question.   I think the primary consideration here is to understand that the  House could have pursued Ambassador Bolton. The House considered  whether or not they would try to have him come testify. They chose not  to subpoena him.   This all goes back to the most important consideration, I think, that  this Chamber has before it in some ways, especially on this threshold  issue of whether there should be witnesses or not. It has to do with  the precedent that is established here for what kind of impeachment  proceeding this body will accept from now going forward, because  whatever is accepted in this case becomes the new normal for every  impeachment proceeding in the future.   And it will do grave damage to this body as an institution to say  that the proceedings in the House don't have to really be complete. You  don't have to subpoena the witnesses that you think are necessary to  prove your case. You don't really have to put it all together before  you bring the package here. When you are impeaching the President of  the United States--the gravest impeachment that they could possibly  consider--you don't have to do all of that work before you get to this  institution.   Instead, when you come to this Chamber, it can be kind of half-baked,  not finished--we need other witnesses, and we want this Chamber to do  the investigation that wasn't done in the House of Representatives. And  then this Chamber will have to be issuing the subpoenas and dealing  with that. And that is not the way this Chamber should allow  impeachments to be presented to it.   We have heard--there was some exchange the other day about, well,  there  [[Page S727]]  were a lot of witnesses in the Judge Porteous impeachment, and this  Chamber was able to handle that. It is very different in the  impeachment of a judge, which is being handled by a committee. My  understanding is that, under rule XI of the Senate procedures, there  was a committee receiving that evidence. But in a Presidential  impeachment, there is not going to be just a committee; it is the  entire Chamber that is going to have to be sitting as Court of  Impeachment, and that will affect the business of the Chamber.   So I think the idea that something comes out and somebody makes an  assertion in a book, allegedly--it is only an alleged; it is simply  alleged now that the manuscript says that; Ambassador Bolton hasn't  come out to verify that, to my knowledge--that then we should start  having this Chamber calling new witnesses and establish the new normal  for impeachment proceedings as being that there doesn't have to be a  complete investigation in the House, I think that is very damaging for  the future of this institution.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Hawaii.
