Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1249, the DHS Multiyear  Acquisition Strategy Act of 2017.   The Department of Homeland Security spends billions of taxpayer  dollars annually on a variety of systems to secure our borders, protect  our aviation system, safeguard our shores, and shield our cyberspace,  among other critical missions. Unfortunately, watchdogs at the  Government Accountability Office and the DHS Office of Inspector  General have found longstanding problems with how DHS has managed these  programs. DHS continues to be on GAO's high-risk list for acquisition  management, meaning these programs are susceptible to fraud, waste,  abuse, and mismanagement.   In addition, the Department has failed to have a strategic vision for  its major purposes. The result has been wasted effort and taxpayer  money gone, with little to show for it. Look at the TSA puffer machines  from a few years ago as a past example.   Without a comprehensive strategy, industry also does not have the  needed information to best support DHS in making smart investments in  executing its mission.   My bill will require DHS to establish this much-needed strategy to  ensure taxpayer dollars are safeguarded and frontline operators receive  the tools they need to successfully protect Americans.   My bill will also ensure that DHS works collaboratively with the  private sector to fully leverage their innovative solutions. As a  former FBI agent, I know how important it is to get critical tools out  to the field to help agents and officers secure our Nation.   I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 1249, and I want to thank my colleague from New Jersey  (Mrs. Watson Coleman) for her bipartisan leadership on a bill that will  surely help keep our country safe.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
