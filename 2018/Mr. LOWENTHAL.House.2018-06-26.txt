 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would increase STARBASE  program funding by $5 million for fiscal year 2019, for a total of $35  million.   STARBASE is currently active in 33 States and Puerto Rico at a total  of 66 locations. It engages local fifth grade elementary students by  exposing them to STEM subjects through a hands-on curriculum. The  program is carried out by the military services because the Department  of Defense has identified a shortage of young adults graduating from  the hard sciences.   Many students in the program have no prior exposure to real-world  STEM opportunities or military services. STARBASE strengthens ties  between the military and their communities, and promotes strong STEM  skills in the next generation of young people.   Not only do students enjoy the STEM program, the program works. In  2017, for example, knowledge scores of chemistry, engineering, math,  physics, and technology increased by almost 30 percent for all  students.   It consistently improves favorability scores of math and science.  Students were 8.28 percent more likely to say that they liked  engineering, for example. Again, I repeat: the program works.   It is one of the most cost-effective programs across the Federal  Government, costing only $328 per student. We had 2,952 classes in  2017, serving 1,381 schools. Since its inception, STARBASE has served  approximately 1,110,590 students from 40 States.   With these additional resources, STARBASE hopes to expand to Patrick  Air Force Base in Florida; the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs;  as well as Anchorage, Alaska; Nashville, Tennessee; and many other  sites across the country that have asked for this program.   Mr. Chairman, this is very important. I, along with my colleague  Representative Cole, urge an ``aye'' vote, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
