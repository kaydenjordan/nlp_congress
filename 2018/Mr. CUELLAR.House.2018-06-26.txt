 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairwoman Granger and Ranking Member  Visclosky for their bipartisan work in support of our Nation's  military. I also thank the staff on both sides of the aisle because  they have worked very hard to put this very important bill together.   Mr. Chair, first I would like to highlight that this bill provides  over $606 billion to rebuild our Armed Forces, including $338 billion  to restore critical military readiness programs. This is a significant  investment in the men and women who sacrifice so much to keep us safe.   This bill also includes a 2.6 percent pay raise for our military  families, the largest in 9 years, which is the least we can do to show  our gratitude for their service to our country.   There are other investments, and let me just highlight a couple of  them.   There is $40 million for military impact aid, which enables schools  to provide specialized counseling programs to meet the unique needs of  our military children.   There is also an additional $10 million to fund programs aimed at  supporting military families that have children with severe  disabilities.   There is also $203 million for the National Guard Counterdrug  Program, which allows units to conduct more counterdrug operations and  training exercises, which, again, will help us reduce the illegal drugs  coming into our country.   It also calls for research for rare cancers within the Department of  Defense to help us better understand the unique exposure to cancer- causing elements impacting our servicemembers.   One more thing that I would like to highlight is that it calls on the  Department of Defense to partner with Hispanic-Serving Institutions in  many specialties, especially foreign language programs and aircraft  pilot programs. These types of partnerships will provide diversity.   Again, there are a lot of other benefits. I want to say to both  sides: A job well done. Keep working together. Let's make this  bipartisan.
