 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Johnson for yielding  time, also for her leadership on the committee, and I thank Chairwoman  Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas for their support of this legislation.   I rise today in support of the Coastal and Ocean Acidification  Stressors and Threats, or COAST, Research Act, my bipartisan bill to  expand scientific research and monitoring of ocean and coastal  acidification.   According to the Fourth National Climate Assessment, catastrophic  carbon dioxide concentrations are now higher than at any time in the  last 3 million years. Approximately one-third of the carbon dioxide in  the atmosphere dissolves into our oceans and estuaries, causing them to  become more acidic.   In addition to atmospheric carbon dioxide, our oceans, estuaries, and  coastal waterways are absorbing chemical inputs and excess nutrient  runoff from land and coastal pollution.   Our understanding of the long-term consequences of changes in water  chemistry on our marine ecosystem is still limited, but we do know that  ocean and coastal acidification make it difficult for marine organisms  to build their shells and skeletal structures. Some finfish, including  endangered salmon in the Pacific Northwest, lose their sense of smell  that they use for identifying prey, reproducing, and navigating their  habitats.   Ocean acidification events are only projected to become more intense,  longer, and increasingly common, especially on the Pacific Coast.   The COAST Research Act would improve scientific research on ocean and  coastal acidification in the context of other environmental stressors  and direct Federal agencies to assess adaptation and mitigation  strategies. Importantly, the bill also expands the definition of ocean  acidification to include estuaries and to recognize mechanisms that  cause changes in coastal chemistry.   As chair of the Interagency Working Group on Ocean Acidification,  NOAA is already leading interdisciplinary efforts to expand our  understanding of changing ocean conditions. This bill would designate  NOAA as the lead Federal agency responsible for implementing the  Federal response to ocean and coastal acidification. This is a  pragmatic response to calls for an interdependent national ocean  acidification program office and recommendations from a September 2014  Government Accountability Office report.   Ocean acidification research is still in its infancy, and the best  way to mitigate its effects is through regionally coordinated  scientific research. The COAST Research Act directs NOAA to maintain a  data archive system to process, store, archive, and provide access to  data on ocean and coastal acidification from federally funded research,  including existing global or national datasets and research from  [[Page H4323]]  State and local agencies, Tribes, academic scientists, citizen  scientists, and industry organizations.   Additionally, the COAST Research Act would increase our understanding  of the socioeconomic effects of ocean and coastal acidification and  engage stakeholders. The bill creates an advisory board comprised of  representatives of the shellfish and crab industry; finfish industry;  seafood processors; recreational fishing; academia; nongovernmental  organizations; State, local, and Tribal governments; and regional  coastal acidification networks. This regionally balanced group will  advise the interagency working group on ocean and coastal acidification  research and monitoring activities.   Our oceans and estuaries are facing the brunt of our inaction to  reduce anthropogenic carbon emissions. We know that even if carbon  dioxide emissions are halted today, many of the effects for our oceans  will continue to occur over the course of the next few decades.   The COAST Research Act will support vulnerable communities,  industries, and coastal and ocean managers by strengthening research on  how they can best prepare and, when possible, adapt to ocean and  coastal acidification. Oregon's shellfish industry and researchers at  Oregon State University have collaborated on ocean acidification  mitigation strategies that have helped the shellfish industry survive.  Their research demonstrates what is possible when we invest in science  and research to help coastal communities adapt to climate change.    Our oceans and estuaries are resilient, and we can help them heal,  but we cannot afford to wait any longer. This is National Ocean Month  and Capitol Hill Ocean Week, a good time to act to help protect the  oceans and our planet.   Mr. Speaker, I want to close by thanking, again, my colleagues,  Representative Young, Representative Posey, and Representative Pingree,  for their leadership on this issue. I truly appreciate the support from  my fellow House Oceans Caucus and Congressional Estuary Caucus co- chairs. I also want to, again, thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking  Member Lucas for their support.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the Oregon  Coordinating Council on Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia and Oregon  State University in support of the COAST Research Act.           The Oregon Coordinating Council on Ocean Acidification             and Hypoxia,                                                     March 8, 2019.      Re Coastal and Ocean Acidification Stressors and Threats           (COAST) Research Act.       Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Bonamici: As the Co-Chairs of the State       legislatively mandated, Oregon Coordinating Council on Ocean       Acidification and Hypoxia (or ``Oregon OAH Council''), we       appreciate the opportunity to provide you with a letter of       strong support for the Coastal and Ocean Acidification       Stressors and Threats (COAST) Research Act. Addressing       intensifying ocean acidification (OA) conditions here in       Oregon, as well as across the United States, is critical to       our Nations understanding of larger impacts from CO2       emissions.        Oregon is among the first places in the world to observe       direct impacts of ocean acidification and hypoxia (OAH), due       to our unique geographic and oceanographic context, putting       our fragile marine ecosystem at risk. Our coastal economies       rely on our vibrant marine ecosystem. Our nearshore waters       are home to sport and commercial fisheries, all of the       State's mariculture operations, and contain critical nursery       grounds for economically important species including       rockfish, oysters, salmon, pink shrimp, and Dungeness crab.       Oregon is not alone in experiencing the impacts from OA or       hypoxia. Through actions such as those in the COAST Research       Act we must act together as Americans to develop solutions       for our coastal communities, economies, and ecosystems to       prepare for future conditions.        In the coming years, the Oregon OAH Council will continue       to take a thoughtful, collaborative, science-based approach       to developing recommendations to address OAH in our state and       beyond. Through further investments and initiatives, Oregon       and the United States will benefit from adaptation and       mitigation measures and will model to the world how to       develop actionable solutions for OA adaptation and       mitigation.    the oregon oah council has identified three urgently needed strategic  actions, which directly align with objectives within the coast research                                    act.         (1) Monitoring of key oceanographic and biological       indicators of impacts from OAH.        At the same time that OA has been impacting our coasts,       oxygen-depletion is on the rise; Oregon and much of the West       coast has seen several seasons in a row with extended periods       of hypoxia in our coastal waters. The Oregon OAH Council is       encouraged that the COAST Research Act identifies the need to       strengthen investments in OA research and monitoring in the       context of other environmental stressors. Ocean acidification       and hypoxia are compounding stressors for a wide range of       marine animals, and as such must continue to be studied       together. Through the COAST Research Acts reauthorization of       funding of NOAA, NSF, and NASA, much needed resources will be       made available to researchers across the United States to       continue to expand our knowledge of OAH. The Oregon OAH       Council also supports the initiative of the COAST Research       Act to create data processing, storage, and archive       facilities to provide for the long-term stewardship and       standardization of data. By creating a central repository for       OAH data it provides governments, scientists, and industry       better access to the information need to inform their       mitigation and adaption planning. Only by maximizing our       current data and filling our knowledge gaps of OAH, can we as       a Nation begin to be able to piece together for solutions for       our coastal communities.        (2) Projects or programs that promote coastal economic and       ecosystem resilience to OAH.        Fisheries and aquaculture are central to our history, are       enjoyed by Americans across the nation year-round, and remain       key to many of Oregon's coastal economies today. Yet, the       future sustainability of these marine resources and       communities' ability to rely on them, are uncertain in the       face of significant ocean changes, including OAH, and       uncertain in the face of our current state of preparation to       adapt to those changes over time. This is why the Oregon OAH       Council supports activities and initiatives that promote       resilience to increased OAH conditions, for both human       communities and ecosystems. The COAST Research Act also       stresses the importance of increasing our understanding of       the socioeconomic effects of OA by expanding federal research       to assess adaptation and mitigation strategies. There will be       costs of inaction relative to CO2 mitigation and the United       States has an obligation to relieve these costs wherever       possible for our citizens.        (3) Tools and strategies to increase awareness of OAH       science, impacts and solutions.        As the impacts of OA intensify, it is going to be vitally       important for our Nation to identify and advance       opportunities to raise awareness of and communicate OAH       science, impacts, and mitigation solutions. This is why the       Oregon OAH Council is encouraged by the fact that the COAST       Research Act recognizes the need to address the effects of OA       on estuaries and integrate research, monitoring, and       adaptation strategies. By integrating OA causes and effects,       it better demonstrates the complexity of this climate issue,       and provides a clearer message to communities. The Oregon OAH       Council also supports the COAST Research Act establishment of       an Advisory Board to increase coordination among       stakeholders, including members of industry, to work with       State and Federal governments to improve coordination.       Recognizing the importance of a broad membership, our Oregon       OAH Council includes members from industry, academia and       state government agencies. For the benefit of our marine       ecosystem and the human communities that rely on a healthy       marine ecosystem, the Nation's adaptation and mitigation       approaches to OA should include successful communication of       new science, monitoring, and adaptation strategies.        As Co-Chairs of the Oregon OAH Council, we appreciate the       opportunity to provide you with a letter of strong support       for the COAST Research Act. The strategic investment and       coordination opportunities outlined in this act are       meaningful and will make a difference in our understanding of       OAH science, impacts, and solutions. Through passage of this       Act and the subsequent investment in science, adaptation and       communications, the United States will demonstrate meaningful       action in fighting OA and the global challenges of climate       change, and preparing our citizens and economies for the       changes ahead.        Thank you for your consideration of these comments.            Sincerely,      John Barth, Ph.D.,        Co-Chair, Oregon OAH Council, Executive Director, Marine       Studies Initiative, Oregon State University.      Caren Braby, Ph.D.,        Co-Chair, Oregon OAH Council, Marine Resources Program       Manager, Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.                                   ____           Office of the Provost and Executive Vice President,             Oregon State University,                                      Corvallis, OR, March 8, 2019.      Re H.R. 1237--The COAST Research Act of 2019.       Hon. Suzanne Bonamici,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Bonamici: We write to offer Oregon       State University's strong support for H.R. 1237, the COAST       Research Act of 2019.  [[Page H4324]]         As marine habitats face new and daunting pressures       threatening their sustainability, the COAST Research Act       identifies the growing need for strategic and robust       investments in ocean acidification (OA) research, monitoring       and stakeholder collaboration.        Oregon State University is committed to interdisciplinary       approaches to address the national and global challenges       facing our oceans and coast communities. OSU has a deep       history of global leadership in oceanography and engages in       nationally ranked oceanographic monitoring programs and       world-leading OA research. Further, the university recognizes       that Oregon's estuaries and coastal regions are home to some       of the world's most productive ecosystems and economically       vital shellfish farms.        The university is encouraged that the COAST Research Act       expands the definition of OA to include coastal and estuarine       systems, and identifies OA as being affected by a combination       of factors, including hypoxia. The university believes that       by expanding federal definitions of OA and by increasing       funding opportunities, researchers and managers will be able       to best utilize resources to find solutions to address OA.        The university also is encouraged that this legislation       recognizes the need for federal engagement to continue       important investments. Doing so will enhance the integration       of OA research, monitoring and adaptation strategies across       principal federal research agencies, including the National       Science Foundation, National Oceanographic and Atmospheric       Administration, and the National Aeronautics and Space       Administration.        Oregon State University understands that effective and       collaborative partnerships and communication are essential       for our state and nation to find adaptive and mitigation       solutions to address OA. For example, the proposal to       establish an Ocean Acidification Advisory Board will be       essential for facilitating the important work still to be       done.        The world's ocean belongs to everyone, and ocean health is       critical to our future. In the coming decades, it will be       essential for the nation and its universities to work       collaboratively to improve and sustain the health of our       oceans. Doing so, we will assure human wellness,       environmental health and economic prosperity for future       generations.        In closing, Oregon State University believes that the COAST       Research Act proposes new strategic tools to expand       understanding and address the problems facing our oceans and       coastal communities.            Sincerely,      Edward Feser,        Provost and Executive Vice President.      Irem Tumer,        Interim Vice President for Research.     Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support  this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding time  and for her support of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Congresswoman Pingree's  Coastal Communities Ocean Acidification Act.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill, which would  direct NOAA to conduct a vulnerability assessment to identify  communities that are dependent on coastal and ocean resources that may  be affected by ocean acidification.   The Pacific Coast is more vulnerable to ocean acidification than  other coastal regions, and it can be used as a testing ground for  different strategies and models to manage and adapt to ocean  acidification.   But ocean acidification is fundamentally a global phenomenon. We must  strengthen our understanding of the socioeconomic effects of ocean  acidification on a range of geographically diverse coastal communities.   Importantly, this bill directs NOAA to work with States, like my home  State of Oregon, that are already developing ocean acidification  response plans.   I thank members of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee for  including my amendment during the full markup to authorize $2.7 million  annually for fiscal years 2020 through 2024.   I hope that my COAST Research Act will complement this bill and  address some of the gaps in our understanding of the socioeconomic  effects of ocean acidification. But there must be a separate  authorization for vulnerability studies.   Finally, and importantly, I thank all the staff who worked on not  only this bill but also the COAST Research Act and the other two ocean  acidification bills, especially, in my office, Maxine Sugarman, but all  the staff on both sides of the aisle in our offices and the hardworking  committee staff.   Finally, I thank Congresswoman Pingree for her continued leadership  on protecting the health of oceans and improving research on ocean  acidification.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairwoman for  yielding and for her support of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Congressman Kilmer's  bipartisan Ocean Acidification Innovation Act. I am proud to be an  original cosponsor of this bill, along with Representative Herrera  Beutler from Washington, and my House Oceans Caucus co-chair  Representative Young from Alaska.   This bill would establish a prize competition for Federal agencies  that serve on the Interagency Working Group on Ocean Acidification to  increase efforts to research, monitor, and manage ocean acidification  and its effects. Our understanding of ocean acidification and its  interactions with other environmental stressors, such as hypoxia,  harmful algal blooms, and warming waters is rapidly evolving, but still  limited in scope.   A 2009 paper from the Ocean Carbon and Biochemistry's Ocean  Acidification Subcommittee estimated that a U.S. national program on  ocean acidification would need $50 million to $100 million per year to  provide timely information for managers and decisionmakers.   A 2012 report from the National Marine Sanctuary Foundation, based on  informal conversations with various Federal agencies, estimated a need  for approximately $95 million for all Federal ocean acidification  research and monitoring by next year, 2020.   In fiscal year 2019, the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program received  only $12 million, so there is no doubt that gaps in funding are a  result of insufficient resources.   The prize competition established in this bill will encourage  collaboration and spur innovative strategies to mitigate and adapt to  ocean acidification. This will help the communities, environments, and  industries that rely on a healthy ocean and are facing harsh realities  of rising carbon emissions.   Again, I thank Congressman Kilmer for his leadership, especially  given the pervasive effects of ocean acidification on the Pacific  Coast. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairwoman for  yielding me the time and for her support of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Congressman Posey's  bipartisan National Estuaries and Acidification Research Act. I am  proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill, which would direct the  National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Ocean Studies  Board to conduct a study that examines the existing science of ocean  acidification and estuaries and provide recommendations to improve  future research and management to inform mitigation decisions.   As co-chair of the House Oceans Caucus and the Congressional Estuary  Caucus, I know that acidification is not only affecting open oceans.  Estuaries and nearshore waters are also faced with environmental  stressors. Ocean and coastal acidification often present itself in the  context of other coastal processes like runoff, erosion, and upwelled  water from the oceans making it difficult to measure its individual  effects on estuaries.   We know that estuaries and nearshore waters are also experiencing the  consequences of our inaction to address ocean and coastal  acidification, and research has not kept pace with the needs of coastal  communities.   The NEAR Act would address the significant research gaps and urgent  need to improve our understanding of the effects of ocean and coastal  acidification.   I want to thank Congressman Posey for his leadership on this bill,  and his efforts to preserve our Nation's estuaries. I urge all of my  colleagues to support this bill.
