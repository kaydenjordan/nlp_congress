 Mr. Speaker, tonight is a very special night for many  of us. Tonight, we honor the memory of an extraordinary Representative,  Ellen Tauscher, who served the Contra Costa area of California for  almost two decades.   She died nearly 3 weeks ago. Tonight is our first opportunity to come  to the floor and to pay tribute to her. I had the pleasure of knowing  her before she became a Member of Congress and then during her years in  Congress and I also had the unique opportunity to take her seat when  she retired to become the Assistant Secretary of State.   So tonight, we pay tribute to this extraordinary woman. We do this in  recognition of the work that she did on Wall Street, the work that she  did here in the House of Representatives, and  [[Page H3782]]  her unyielding desire to reduce nuclear risks throughout the world.   To conduct the rest of tonight's tribute, I am turning to a woman who  served with Ellen for all of the years that she was in Congress, a  woman who is the leader of the Democratic Members of California, Zoe  Lofgren.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
