 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to  honor the life and work of the most prominent merengue artist in the  world who, sadly, passed away yesterday, the great Johnny Ventura.   Johnny Ventura started his career in the 1960s with his Johnny  Ventura El Combo Show. His career quickly flourished both nationally  and internationally with his contagious music.   He also embarked on a life of public service as the mayor in Santo  Domingo and a member of the Congress of the Dominican Republic.   Just last February, we honored him here in Washington, D.C., as part  of the yearly event, Dominicans on the Hill.   He prided himself in being the ambassador of merengue and, as such,  of the Caribbean and the world.   We will always remember him for his contagious songs, including ``I  am the Merengue,'' ``If I am born again,'' ``Tobacco,'' and ``Patacon  Pisao''; ``Yo soy el Merengue,'' ``Si vuelvo a nacer,'' ``El tabaco,''  y ``Patacon Pisao.''   (English translation of the lyrics spoken in Spanish is as follows:)       The sound of the bass drum stops today      The sound of the saxophone rests      The guira also rests today.      El sonido de la tambora para hoy      El sonido del saxofon descansa      La guira tambien descansa hoy.    We will always remember him for his great service to people, and for  his music and dedication to music. He will always be present in our  hearts through his songs that often were funny and sometimes  melancholic as he sang to the diaspora.   Madam Speaker, as you know, folks from all over the world find  themselves in an economic exile and, at times, think of the family they  left behind. They think of the wonderful beaches, rivers, and mountains  that they left behind, and they could only claim that feeling through  songs like the songs that Johnny Ventura often played for all of us.   He had a contagious smile and a wonderful rhythm of music with  African bass instruments.   Adios, Johnny Ventura.   Good-bye, ``Merengue Artist to the Bass Drum''; adios, ``Merenguero  Hasta la Tambora.''   Good-bye, ``Oldest Horse''; adios, ``Caballo Mayor.''                            ____________________
