 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed  in the Congressional Record this scholarly article ``Civil Affairs,  Winston Churchill, and the Power of Paying Attention,'' originally  published in Small Wars Journal, which analyzes the value of Civil  Affairs to supported commands and agencies through the lens of Winston  Churchill's conception of generalship and statesmanship. Its author,  CPT Andrew J. Bibb, U.S. Army, is from Santa Fe, NM.   Although often overlooked, our civil affairs forces contribute to the  ability of policymakers and military commanders to understand the full  landscape and make fully informed decisions. Civil Affairs units also  help us navigate conflicts where we more frequently confront civilians  than combatants. As the article puts it, Civil Affairs ``helps the  commander understand the factors that contribute to civil unrest and  make societies vulnerable to nefarious actors [and] enables them to  make decisions that not only defeat threats but prevent them from  arising in the first place.''   I want to thank our men and women in Civil Affairs and let them know  we value and appreciate their often unheralded work.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:    Civil Affairs, Winston Churchill, and the Power of Paying Attention                     Captain Andrew J. Bibb, U.S. Army         Readiness, the top priority of the U.S. military in the       21st century, begins with awareness. This applies from the       individual all the way up to the national and international       levels, from the tactical level to the operational and       strategic. In this context,  [[Page S5305]]       awareness is defined as the state of consciousness in which       one attains a functional realization of the state and nature       of reality. It is achieved when one pays attention to a given       situation and the factors that contribute to it, analyzing       and examining until he or she achieves an actionable level of       understanding. When the observer understands the problem well       enough, the solutions present themselves.        Clinical psychologist Dr. Jordan Peterson explains, ``If       you identify things, with careful attention and language, you       bring them forward as viable, obedient objects, detaching       them from their underlying near-universal interconnectedness.       You simplify them. You make them specific and useful, and       reduce their complexity.'' This process of enabling awareness       and understanding in support of readiness is what Army Civil       Affairs (CA) does best.        This paper aims to show the value of CA to both the       statesman and general as they are understood by Winston       Churchill in Dr. Larry P. Arnn's scholarly work Churchill's       Trial: Winston Churchill and the Salvation of Free       Government. Although Churchill uses the term ``general'' to       refer to commanders, CA's value is by no means limited to       flag officers. The CA team, the lowest-echelon CA element, is       a battalion-level asset and can inform tactical decisions as       well as operational and strategic ones. Similarly, CA support       to statesmen is not limited to elected officials, as       fostering partnerships within and supporting the various       branches of government fall directly within the purview of       Civil Affairs.        There are at least three good reasons to use Winston       Churchill's concepts of statesmanship and generalship as the       lens through which to analyze the value of CA. First, the       purpose of all Civil Affairs Operations (CAO) is to enable       and execute the decisions of commanders (generals) and policy       makers (statesmen). Second, of all of the world leaders in       the past hundred years few are as qualified to speak       authoritatively on both of these topics as Winston Churchill.       Third, none of these world leaders were as prolific as       Churchill at recording their perspectives, so through his       work we are able to clearly see what the general and       statesmen need that CA can provide.        Churchill served as Prime Minister of Great Britain during       and after World War II, as well as in numerous other       government positions, including First Lord of the Admiralty       at the outbreak of World War I. Throughout his long and       distinguished career he learned that the duty of statesmen       and generals was to comprehend a given situation and act in       concert with reality to produce the desired outcome. The       ability to do this in large part depends on having an       accurate, complete, and nuanced understanding of the       situation and its attending circumstances.        Fortunately for both the statesman and the general, this is       where CA excels. CA not only serves as the informational and       relational link between military and civilian entities, but       also paints an accurate picture of the on-the-ground reality       for the commander. CA focuses specifically on the civil       component of the operational environment (OE), and since the       non-threat (civil) aspect makes up the vast majority of the       OE a proper understanding of that aspect is critical to both       military and political success. Additionally, ``Military       operations always have a degree of involvement (assistance,       interference, or influence) with the civil component,'' so a       dedicated force oriented to that component is necessary to       every operation.                           Defining the Particulars         Churchill believed that the ``right thing to do depends on       the circumstances,'' but those circumstances must be defined       in order to determine what the right course of action is.       CA's most critical function is to establish and maintain       awareness of both the raw civil data and its aggregate       significance. Civil Affairs Activities (CAA), the core       competency of which CA is the proponent, are ``enduring       capabilities that increase the commander's understanding of,       deliberate interaction with, and planning for the civil       component.'' While CA forces are capable of supporting       Military Governance Operations and other joint activities,       such as Foreign Assistance and Populace and Resources       Control, CAA define CA as the commander's asset. The five CAA       functions are Civil Reconnaissance, Civil Engagement, Civil       Information Management, Civil-Military Operations Center, and       Civil Affairs Operations Staff Support.        CAA make CA an invaluable asset to the commander because an       accurate picture of the on-the-ground reality frees the       commander to make timely decisions confidently. Without that       picture every decision is a gamble. In Churchill's mind, the       specifics surrounding each individual circumstance should       drive military decisions. For him, ``Circumstances alone . .       . decide whether a correct conventional maneuver is right or       wrong.'' That these circumstances ``are many in number and       constantly moving'' only emphasizes the need for CA input       into the commander's common operational picture (COP).        Policy makers benefit from this civil information as well,       as it enables them to make decisions in light of their real-      world implications. Churchill believed that, although the       ``statesman lives and judges amidst the details of action,''       he ``serves a master beyond all particulars.'' For the policy       maker to rise above the particulars someone else must gather,       process, and disseminate the detailed information that drives       policy decisions. Someone else must pay close attention to       the specifics of a given civil situation. CA forces meet the       civil information requirements of both the general and the       statesmen in this regard and are uniquely ``trained in       understanding'' the particulars of ``foreign cultures, socio-      economic dynamics, and governance structures.''        Army CA has only two tactical mission tasks in its       doctrine, and both of them are oriented toward defining the       particulars of the civil component. Civil Reconnaissance (CR)       and Civil Engagement (CE), which are also the first two CAA       functions, are dedicated to gathering the raw civil data in a       given area of operations. These two ``CA specific tasks       answer key information gaps in which no other staff section       specializes.'' CA Forces are able to focus their attention on       the ``dynamic relationship'' between ``friendly forces, enemy       forces, and populations as . . . a host of other factors       contend to influence the OE on a daily basis.''        CR, the first tactical task, is the ``targeted, planned,       and coordinated observation and evaluation of specific civil       aspects of the environment.'' CA forces are capable of       conducting CR in any environment the commander deems       necessary by ``deploying to semi- and non-permissive       environments, and operating in places where traditional       military and civilian agencies cannot.'' For this reason,       among many others, Marine COL Jeffrey Lipson concludes that       tactical CA units are ``employed to their best effect'' when       they are tasked ``to gain an accurate picture of a region in       addition to what is gleaned from traditional intelligence       sources.''        CR is proactive in nature, not reactive. It continually       refines the commander's picture of the OE instead of waiting       for specific information requirements to be published,       although CA forces are perfectly capable of answering those       as well. CA forces base their CR on civil information       collection plans, which are specific enough to economize CA       efforts but broad enough to allow for flexibility depending       on the circumstances. The result is quality civil information       gained at a negligible cost. COL Lipson explains, ``When       properly gathered, analyzed, deployed, civil reconnaissance       will `push' information to commanders to help them tailor       their operations. Without it, the same information is       `pulled' through interrogations, patrols, or other more time-      and resource-intensive means and perhaps with less       efficacy.''        Churchill believed that those ``who cannot talk to each       other are likely to fight like roosters.'' CA has an answer       to this problem as well. Civil Engagement (CE), the second       tactical mission task, are ``the planned and targeted       activities in which CA forces deliberately focus on the       interaction with the IPI [indigenous populations and       institutions], unified action partners, and other civil       entities.''        Churchill knew first-hand that fostering relationships       leads to a clearer understanding of the circumstances. While       serving as a war correspondent in South Africa during the       Boer War in the late 1890s, Boer fighters captured Churchill       as well as a number of British soldiers. Churchill, unwilling       to stand passively by, built relationships with his captors,       befriended them, and then leveraged these relationships to       gain valuable information that led to his daring and       successful escape.        Although he did not refer to it as such, Churchill       conducted CE to gain access to and influence with his guards,       and, as a result, gather the necessary information for his       plan. Aside from the fact that his engagements were with       enemy combatants, it is no different than what CA does every       day with non-threat entities. The CE function provides a host       of capabilities to the supported commander, who may employ       ``this task to obtain or disseminate information, mitigate       civilian-military interference, foster legitimacy, gain civil       cooperation, build partner capacity, and obtain unified       action.''        CE is a tactical level task that can have strategic       effects. Dr. David Kilcullen and Marine COL (Ret.) Curtis Lee       observe, ``Civilians are active participants in all       conflicts, making engagement with civil government, civil       society organizations, and community leaders a critical       combat function.'' The commander has in CE the capability to       reach directly down to the level of boots-on-the-ground and       thereby influence key partners to achieve his end-state, as       well as fill critical information gaps with data that can       only be acquired through face-to-face interactions. As Dr.       Peterson observes, ``It's amazing what people will tell you       if you pay attention.'' The commander finds in CA forces a       tool to employ ``in the information environment that can be       used to create effects and operationally desirable       conditions.''                         A Single Unity of Conception         Churchill was not only a soldier, statesman, and writer. He       was also a painter. Painting was his favorite leisure       activity and he used the principles of painting to illustrate       the proper conduct of war as he saw it. He saw many       similarities between the painter, the general, and the       statesman, but the most critical of these similarities was       the need for ``a single unity of conception.''        Churchill describes this single unity of conception as an       ``all-embracing view which presents the beginning and the       end, the whole and each part, as one instantaneous impression       retentively and untiringly held in the mind.'' In both       painting and warfare the ``details,'' or, for CA, the data       points gathered through CR and CE, ``are essential to  [[Page S5306]]       the problem presented by each,'' however these ``details have       no order without'' this single unity of conception.        Perhaps CA as a branch is best seen, using Churchill's       language, as a master painter who accurately depicts the       civil component of the OE in the commander's COP, reflecting       reality but also vividly emphasizing the most relevant       aspects in the foreground. The CA professional is like the       art, movie, or food critic who is so familiar with his or her       craft that he or she grasps details that would slip by the       average consumer unnoticed as the significant particulars       they are. Properly trained, CA forces are so intimately       familiar with the social and political nuances of a given       region that they recognize factors that others would consider       inconsequential. Their ``cultural orientation, regional       expertise, linguistic capabilities, advisory ability, and       civilian-acquired professional skills'' enable them to       discriminate between priority and ancillary data points.        For CA forces, the COP is the canvas and the pieces of       civil information gathered through CR and CE are the colors       on the palette. Information management systems and practices       are the brushes that feed the information into the overall       COP. Civil Information Management (CIM), the third CAA       function, is the process by which the colors are blended and       arranged on the canvas to reflect reality. In this process       ``data relating to the civil component of the operational       environment is gathered, collated, processed, analyzed,       produced into information products, and disseminated.'' CIM       is how the particulars become actionable to the general and       the statesman.        The purpose of the COP is to enable the commander to       achieve a single unity of conception. In a properly       ``painted'' picture of the civil component of the COP, every       detail, ``however distant, however subordinate, is set forth       naturally and in its true proportion and relation.'' This is       vital because, ``Like the details, the conception of the work       must be true. For the painter, nature appears on the canvas       with `startling obedience,' but only when the painter studies       it attentively and faithfully.'' The civil information       gathered during CR and CE must be accurate, but their       aggregation must not skew any aspect or make it any more or       less significant than it is. Reality as communicated by the       data, not preconceived notions, must drive the COP.        Preconceived notions, or assumptions that have not been       confirmed or denied, amount to nothing more than theories.       Churchill believed, ``The painter's art--and also that of the       general . . . and the statesman--does not consist in       admiration for or faith in theories.'' Theories are valuable       as a starting point, but the role of CA includes verifying or       refuting these assumptions to produce hard data that concurs       with reality.        The CIM process and the resulting COP is ``a service to the       truth as it is to be observed in nature.'' The verified       details that feed into the COP are crucial, but the COP ``is       more than and different from the details of which it has been       composed. The nature of the thing seems to bring in       qualitative factors, factors that are apparent only in the       details, but factors that are not the same as the details.''       The aggregate significance of the COP, not just reliable bits       of information, is both built by the details and also becomes       a separate entity. The resulting single unity of conception       drives military and policy decisions.        According to Churchill, both the general and the statesman       ``must see things as they relate to one another in magnitude,       significance, and causality. Seeing in this way is not just       seeing the details but seeing the order in the details.'' The       civil component, perhaps the most ambiguous and constantly       shifting of all aspects of the OE, is also the one that       requires the most persistent engagement. Army CA doctrine       recognizes, ``The land domain is the most complex of the       domains, because it addresses humanity--its cultures,       ethnicities, religions, and politics.'' The information       gathering and production process helps the ``superior''       commander ``bring these shifting details into order and       comprehension,'' thus emphasizing the actionability of the       data, and avoid the danger of becoming merely an       ``intelligent scribe.''                        Actionability and Cooperation         The CIM process produces actionable information of a kind       that Churchill referred to as ``practical knowledge,'' the       purpose of which is ``not knowing, but doing. The result of       prudential reasoning is a choice and the result of a choice       is an action.'' Churchill recognized that the ``business of       statesmanship,'' as well as generalship, ``was choosing.''       Due to the constant flux of circumstances, the statesman and       general must ``choose at the moment when choices are       possible, in the present when the future `though imminent is       obscure.' ''        Statesmen and generals, policy makers and commanders, bear       the burden of making consequential decisions. For this       reason, the purpose of CIM is not academic but action-      oriented. In the CIM process, ``The data is used as civil       considerations input into possible courses of action to       determine the impact of military operations on the civil       component of the OE,'' as well as to describe ``how the civil       population affects military operations.''        In Churchill's experience, ``War actually calls forth the       most intense forms of cooperation.'' War ``is not only a       cooperative and political event: it is the supreme event of       that kind.'' He discerned that the ``maneuver which brings an       ally into the field is as serviceable as that which wins a       great battle.'' CA not only provides the commander with       actionable information through the COP, but also forges       partnerships within and without the U.S. military. CA forces       engage ``IPI and unified action partners to establish and       maintain relationships and communication channels in order to       enhance and influence the relationship between military       forces and the civil component.'' The nexus of this       coordination is the Civil-Military Operations Center (CMOC).        The CMOC, the fourth CAA function, is the workhorse of the       CA branch. It is ``a primary capability for coordination of       the activities of the Armed Forces of the United States with       unified action partners, IPI, and interagency.'' When       necessary, the CMOC can also be augmented with relevant       specialists, such as engineers, military police, medical, and       transportation to provide the supported commander with a one-      stop-shop for subject-matter experts.        Reflecting the proactive nature of CAA, CMOCs may provide       Civil Liaison Teams (CLT) to key partners. The CLT guards       against miscommunication and allows for constant coordination       and near-instantaneous synchronization. It also ``provides       the supported CMOC with a CR and CE capability for . . .       coordination without interfering with the regular staff       functions.'' These capabilities make CA ``the Joint force       of choice to work with many civilian agency, non-      governmental, civil society, and private sector actors       whose capacities best mitigate drivers of conflict and       instability and promote peace.''                         Ultimate Practical Accuracy         For Churchill, success ``on the battlefield cannot be       `calculated on paper alone, and never copied from examples of       the past.' The solution must be `evolved from the eye and       brain and soul of a single man,' '' with the goal of       ``achieving an `ultimate practical accuracy.' '' This is       especially true in the 21st century and, as COL Lipson       asserts, ``There has never been a more pressing need to       understand the importance of the integration of civil       information into operational planning.'' Fortunately, the       commander need not be alone in his pursuit of ``ultimate       practical accuracy.''        Civil Affairs Operations Staff Support, the fifth and final       function of CAA, provides the commander with civil-military       experts who are ``aware of cultural nuances, divergent world       views, biases, prejudices, and stereotypes that affect both       the civil component and military operations.'' CA staff, in       conjunction with and supported by the CMOC, provides       ``support during the military decision-making process (MDMP)       and the joint planning process.'' CA staff also       ``synchronizes, integrates, and coordinates the civil       component with the commander's CMO [Civil-Military       Operations] responsibilities and operational plans.''        Input from CA staff supports whom Churchill would consider       the ``great'' general. In Churchill's view, ``Generals are       supposed to add something to war to bring it to the right       conclusion and to mitigate its effects. `Battles are won by       slaughter and maneuver. The greater the general, the more he       contributes in maneuver, the less he demands in slaughter.'       '' He believed that the greatest ``contribution'' of the       general is to achieve victory while suffering ``few       casualties,'' leaving ``the enemy puzzled as well as       beaten.'' Churchill's generals were challenged to ``find       easier ways other than sheer slaughter of achieving the main       purpose.''        CA staff, more so than traditional command staff positions,       contribute to preventing the loss of human life, property,       and social capital. Rather than simply solve problems after       they have been created, CA staff helps the commander mitigate       or defeat sources of instability well before kinetic action       is called for. The fact is that ``in today's dynamic world,       it's likely that a conflict can arise before the presence of       an enemy is even fully understood.'' These conflicts ``can       only be won at the civil-military level,'' where ``coming to       grips with the deep internal divisions and tensions of the       host country, and the pressures from outside states, are       critical.''        CA staff acts as the commander's conduit to CIM and       facilitate its integration into his COP. Rather than react to       one threat after another, CA staff helps the commander       understand the factors that contribute to civil unrest and       make societies vulnerable to nefarious actors. Facilitating       the commander's single unity of conception, CA staff enables       him to make decisions that not only defeat threats but       prevent them from arising in the first place. When kinetic       operations are the priority, CA staff provides solutions to       reduce ``the friction between U.S. forces and the local       populations,'' as well as mitigate ``their impact on military       operations.''        The effects produced by CA staff are felt well above the       level of their supported command. ``Policy, doctrine, and       strategy have increasingly leaned on the information gleaned       from nontraditional sources . . . such as through social       actions, internet, and private sector partners to create a       more accurate view of the area of responsibility.'' Just as       ``generals must prioritize when they fight,'' they must       prioritize how they train. CA staff provides these real-world       inputs to enable the U.S. military in its entirety to train       as it fights, further contributing to its readiness.                         The Right Way of Warfighting         In Churchill's mind, setting these conditions culminates in       war being fought the  [[Page S5307]]       right way. He saw war and politics as two extremes on the       same spectrum, in which ``the real work of politics begins       where war ends--and ends where war begins.'' He found that       ``the distinction between politics and strategy diminishes as       the point of view is raised. At the summit true politics and       strategy are one.''        This being the case, for Churchill it was ``not enough to       win. One must win in the right way in order to serve the       purposes of peace, which are the purposes of politics.'' The       greatest generals were those who ``conducted war in ways that       were compatible with the aims of politics.'' They ``manage to       make the gravest choices well because they combine the       functions of statesman and general,'' meaning that they       account for both the military and political consequences of       their decisions.        Churchill's analysis holds true in today's geopolitical       climate. Dr. Kevin Melton and COL (Ret.) Christopher Holshek       acknowledge, ``Ultimately, neither stability nor security are       ends within themselves, but a way to foster an environment       necessary for enhancing social cohesion, governance, economic       livelihood that comprise the grand strategic goal of peace.''       Consequently ``the U.S. can neither afford--fiscally nor       politically--to engage in perpetual warfare, nor to ignore       simmering dynamics that have the potential to eventually       threaten national or global security.'' It is in this reality       that CA forces are best positioned to prove their value,       because the end of all CA efforts is to translate military       victory into political gains.        In 2016, then-Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster ``described war as       essentially political, human, and uncertain--and thus the key       role Civil Affairs plays in managing those determinants.'' In       shoring up the civil foundation of a given society, CA forces       lay the groundwork for stable and sustainable governance well       before kinetic operations have begun and long after they have       ended. They do this ``by building and sustaining       relationships with host nation and non-state partners, and       proactively engaging in activities such as supporting local       governance, education and employment programs, and elevating       moderate voices in civil society through active engagement.''        While emphasizing the ethical need to fight wars the right       way to bring about the desired political effects, Churchill       also stressed the economic necessity of doing so. He found,       ``Wars fought strategically are cheaper, in both men and       materiel. They happen faster, and so they economize the time       spent in conflict.'' Both the low-cost and non-kinetic nature       of CA contribute to economy of time and resources, as does       the prevention of economic loss among the civil populace.       Described by COL (Ret.) Holshek as the ``low-tech solution to       low-tech problems,'' CA forces produce effects       disproportionate to their cost.                                  Conclusion         An accurate and complete grasp of the truth, the on-the-      ground reality, in both the particulars and as a single unity       of conception, enables both statesmen and generals to make       those consequential decisions pertaining to the national       security of the United States. Danielle Pletka of the       American Enterprise Institute agrees that the recipe for       success is clear: ``Understand the reality. Look at the       problems. Identify the solution. Keep an eye on dangerous       currents. And remember that any solution that does not lead       back to the true roots of stable governance will be no       solution at all in the long run.'' Army CA forces are single-      mindedly committed to supporting those efforts, and they       start by simply paying attention.                            ____________________
