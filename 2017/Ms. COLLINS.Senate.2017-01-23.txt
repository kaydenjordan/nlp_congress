 Mr. President, first, let me commend the Senator from  Louisiana for his extraordinary work on this bill. It has been a great  pleasure to work so closely with him as we have made a genuine effort  to put together a bill that would be a reasonable replacement for  ObamaCare that would help to bring people together.   I wish to commend the Senator from Louisiana for his expertise. As a  physician, Senator Cassidy brings an important perspective to this  debate, particularly since he has practiced for so many years in  hospitals in Louisiana that serve the uninsured. So I wish to  personally thank him for the privilege of working together to craft  this bill.   There has been much debate recently on the best approach to replacing  and reforming the Affordable Care Act. Considerable confusion and  anxiety exists about the current status of the law and about the future  of health care in our country. However, what is often overlooked in  this discussion is that while the ACA provides valuable assistance for  some people who were previously uninsured, the system created by the  law is under tremendous financial strain.   ObamaCare exchanges are on the verge of collapse in many States. The  reality is that significant changes must be made. Doing nothing is not  an option.   I am, therefore, both surprised and disappointed by the remarks of  the Democratic leader to the press and on the floor today about the  genuine effort that Senator Cassidy and I have put forward in  introducing the Patient Freedom Act.   First of all, let me point out that the Democratic leader could not  possibly have read our bill since we haven't introduced it yet, and it  is evident that he has misunderstood many of its provisions.   For example, in a press statement, he said we gutted the preexisting  condition protections that we strongly support and that are codified in  our bill in section 101(b). Again, that is section 101(b). It ensures  that insurers cannot discriminate against individuals with preexisting  conditions who pay their premiums.   I guess what disappoints me most is that the Democratic leader's  response really represents what is wrong with Washington, DC. The  American people want us to come together. They want Democrats and  Republicans to work as a team to solve the problems facing our Nation.  If we are going to have a leader on the other side of the aisle  denounce to the press and come to the Senate floor to criticize a bill  that has not even been introduced yet, where are we? I really hope this  is an aberration and that we can work together and that the compromises  we put in the bill are recognized as a good-faith effort to bring both  sides of the aisle together in the interests of the American people and  in providing access to affordable health care. That is our goal.   We are not saying our bill is perfect. We are open to refinements. We  have made a good-faith effort, and to hear it described inaccurately  and as other than a genuine effort to solve a problem truly disappoints  me.   The fact is, the ACA has been in effect for years. Yet nearly 30  million Americans still do not have health insurance coverage. Many of  those who do have coverage through the ACA exchanges are experiencing  large spikes in premiums, deductibles, and copays, increasing costs to  consumers and taxpayers alike. Contrary to the predictions made by the  early supporters of the ACA, premiums are increasing in nearly every  State, with an average increase of 25 percent nationally.   In New York State, the average increase on the exchange is 16.6  percent. I don't know, but perhaps the Democratic leader thinks that is  an acceptable rate of increase. It strikes me as pretty high, and even  though it is below the national average, it is still in double digits.  The situation is even more dire in some States like Arizona, where  premiums have increased by 116 percent. In many counties throughout our  country, there are only one or two health insurers offering plans on  the exchanges, severely limiting consumer choice.    In my State of Maine, premiums for the individual market for 2017  have soared by 22 percent, on average, and plan options have become  more limited. Now, while subsidies do cushion the blow for those  consumers who are eligible for them, others have had to shoulder the  full increase, and of course taxpayers have borne a greater burden.  Moreover, individuals and families with incomes exceeding 250 percent  of the poverty rate are not shielded from the dramatic increases in  deductibles and copays. That is important to remember. The premium  subsidy applies to incomes up to 400 percent of the poverty rate. It  then drops off the cliff, and you are eligible for no subsidy  whatsoever--there is no orderly phaseout. For help with copays and  deductibles under the Affordable Care Act, the threshold is 250 percent  of the poverty rate. These huge premium spikes and increases in  deductibles and larger copays are having an effect on families and  individuals--who are by no means wealthy--all over this Nation.   Millions with coverage under the ACA are also facing increasingly  narrow networks, which means they may find their preferred doctors are  not in their networks. This can be particularly difficult for rural  States that may have few specialists and whose citizens rely on major  medical centers in nearby States. If patients want to continue to see  these doctors, they can be faced with enormous costs that are not  covered by their ACA insurance. As one Mainer put it, ``[President]  Obama said I could keep my doctor, and the insurance company says I  can't.''   The co-ops created under the ACA to help provide health insurance  coverage have been failing at an alarming rate. In fact, only 5 of the  23 remain operational. It is also important to carefully consider the  effects that ObamaCare's Medicare cuts have had on providers like rural  hospitals and home health agencies, many of whom are struggling.   In sum, prices are skyrocketing, coverage is narrowing, and the  individual market is likely in a death spiral if Congress fails to act.   I know many Members of this Chamber share the goal of expanding  access to affordable health care. Over the years, I have collaborated  with colleagues on both sides of the aisle on a number of initiatives.  Today I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator and Doctor Bill  Cassidy, in introducing the Patient Freedom Act of 2017 to help ensure  that Americans have access to affordable health care that improves  choices and helps to restrain costs.   Let me emphasize again that our bill is a work in progress. It is not  perfect. However, what it does--and it is virtually unique in this  regard, in this Chamber--is it puts specific proposals on the table as  we seek to craft bills to repair and improve the Affordable Care Act.  Other legislation being discussed,  [[Page S403]]  such as those designed to help small businesses pool risks so they can  better afford to provide insurance to their employees, also deserves  consideration. Let's get a lot of ideas on the table.   We have to start, and we have been willing to step forward and  propose a specific bill. To be criticized for that by the Democratic  leader is just so disappointing, particularly since the leader is well  aware that I work across the aisle all the time to try to find  solutions for our country.   The Patient Freedom Act is built on the premise that giving people  more choices is superior to the one-size-fits-all approach that defined  the Affordable Care Act. We recognize that what works best for people  in Maine or New Hampshire may not be right for people in New York or  California. Our bill respects those differences by giving States  options to choose the path that works best for their citizens.   Now, option one would allow a State to choose to continue operating  its insurance markets pursuant to all the rules of the Affordable Care  Act. So if New York State wants to keep with the status quo, despite  the 16.6-percent increase, on average, in the premiums for the  individual market, New York State can make that choice. If a State  chooses to remain covered by the ACA, exchange policies will continue  to be eligible for cost-sharing subsidies and advanced premium tax  credits, and the insurance markets will still be subject to ACA  requirements. The individual mandate and the employer mandate will also  remain in place for that State. Medicaid expansion States will continue  to receive Federal funding. So if a State is happy with the status  quo--with spiraling costs, with limited choices, with a market that is  broken--fine, keep the ACA. In some States, maybe it is working well.  States should have that option, and they would under the Cassidy- Collins bill.   More appealing to many States, however, would be what we call the  better choice option in the Patient Freedom Act that would allow a  State to waive many of the requirements of the ACA, except for vital  consumer protections, and still receive Federal funding to help its  residents purchase affordable health insurance. Senator Cassidy has  explained how it would work so I will not go through that all again.   Let me just say that eligible individuals in States selecting this  option would receive Federal funding deposited into their Roth health  savings accounts. The aggregate funding for these per-beneficiary  deposits would be determined based on the total amount of funding that  the Federal Government would have provided in the form of ACA subsidies  in each State, plus any funding each State would have received had it  chosen to expand its Medicaid Program--even if, like my State, it has  chosen not to do so. These deposits in the Roth health savings accounts  would be phased out for higher income beneficiaries.   States selecting this option for every resident who does not have  health insurance coverage through his or her employer or through public  programs like Medicare or the VA or the Federal Employees Health  Benefits Program--in those States, the option would be a standard  health insurance plan that would include first-dollar coverage through  the Roth health savings account, basic prescription drug coverage, and  a high-deductible health plan. States could automatically enroll their  residents who are uninsured in this standard plan, unless an individual  opted to use his or her health savings account to purchase more  comprehensive coverage or opted out of coverage altogether. I can't  imagine someone making the choice of opting out altogether when they  would receive this generous subsidy.   In addition to Federal funds, individuals and employers could make  contributions to these health savings accounts, and the balances would  grow tax-free. The bill also provides for a partial tax credit for very  low-income individuals who do receive employer-based coverage to help  these workers pay for their deductibles and their copays.   Here is another important provision of our bill: Health care  providers receiving payments from the Roth health savings accounts  would be required to publish cash prices for their services. That would  add transparency that is sorely lacking in our current system and that  we need to move toward a more patient-directed health care future. For  example, if your physician has suggested that you have a colonoscopy,  you would know whether one hospital or one clinic would charge more  than another so you can make the right decision for you.   Health care reform should be about expanding affordable choices, and  that is what our legislation aims to do by allowing States to structure  their individual health insurance markets and to do so without the  burdensome individual mandate, the employer mandate, or many of the  other restrictive requirements in the ACA that have substantially  driven up costs and forced millions of Americans to buy coverage that  is more than they want, need, or can afford. Americans should have the  choice to purchase more affordable coverage, if that is what works best  for them.   Let me again emphasize, since misinformation was given to the press  about the consumer protections in our bill, the Patient Freedom Act  would retain several important consumer protections, contrary to what  was said earlier today by a colleague who hadn't read our bill.  Dependents will be able to remain on their parents' health insurance  policies until age 26. Insurance companies will still not be able to  exclude coverage for preexisting conditions or discriminate based on  health status. In fact, there is no medical underwriting for the  standard plan offered under the better choice option. Insurance  companies cannot cap benefits by including lifetime or annual limits in  their policies, and they must offer to renew policies as long as  enrollees continue to pay premiums. Insurance companies must also  continue to cover mental health and substance use disorder benefits for  individuals, a particularly important benefit given the nationwide  scope of the opioid crisis that has seriously affected my State of  Maine and so many other States throughout our country, ruining the  lives of individuals, their families, and their communities.   Provisions like these vital consumer protections should be retained.  However, the Washington centric approach of the ACA must be changed if  we are ever to truly reform our broken health care system.   I am pleased to see a growing consensus among Members of both the  Senate and the House that we must fix the Affordable Care Act and  provide reforms at nearly the same time as we repeal the law. This will  help protect the families who rely on the program and give insurers  time to transition to a new marketplace that is based on more choices  for consumers. That is what we are trying to do here. Reforms in the  way we provide health insurance must ensure that individuals relying on  the current system do not experience a needless and avoidable gap in  coverage.   If we are going to reform the system, we must begin to put specific  proposals on the table for our colleagues to debate, refine, amend, and  enact. That is why the criticism is so disappointing. This is an  attempt to put forth a possible solution that would appeal to Members  on both sides of the aisle.   As we continue our work to find a responsible path to repealing and  repairing the ACA, we should give the States the freedom to choose what  they believe works best for their citizens, whether that means staying  with the Affordable Care Act or selecting a different path--in my view,  a better path--that will lead to patient-directed reforms that contain  costs and provide more choice. The Patient Freedom Act does exactly  that, and I commend my colleague Senator Cassidy for his leadership on  this legislation. I also want to thank our cosponsors, including  Senator Isakson and Senator Capito for their support as well.                            ____________________     Mr. President, first, let me commend the Senator from  Louisiana for his extraordinary work on this bill.
