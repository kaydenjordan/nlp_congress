 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is a great honor to participate in this debate with my esteemed  colleague, Mr. Meeks, of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and with a  great patriot such as Mr. James of Michigan.   I welcome the American people to the second part in a legislative  series we are conducting about all of the places on the planet Earth  where Congress still believes that 9/11 justifies current U.S. troop  presence in 2023.   The first in that series was Syria. I came to this floor, only got  about 103 votes, but I made the argument that our troops were  essentially sitting ducks, guarding oil extraction operations where  their presence was known and where their location was easily  identifiable. I called for a withdrawal. That withdrawal was defeated.  Then what happened is precisely what I predicted, more U.S. casualties  from Iranian drones, exactly what I said would occur. It is with no joy  I say that.   I know all of us would take any policy decision we could to reduce  U.S. casualties, and I think this debate will present an excellent  opportunity to reflect on Somalia in that light.   There are currently 900 U.S. troops in Somalia, give or take, and  this resolution would bring them home.   Somalia is a country of 17 million who have been tortured at times by  Al-Shabaab, a group of roughly 7,000 hardened fighters and even more  sympathizers. But to logically believe any of the arguments that my  colleagues are making, you have to believe that 900 U.S. troops is what  is going to save a country of 17 million from a hardened group of  7,000. I think that strains not only logic but understanding of the  history of Somalia, a country that has oscillated between failed state  and just absolute coup revolution over and over again, civil war, and  sectarian violence.   The future of Somalia must be determined by Somalia. To the extent  that foreign influences could be helpful, I would argue that the  African Union is far better positioned to build a stronger sense of  national identity and national unity among clans that have been warring  in Somalia for generations than U.S. troops. I have yet to see the  evidence that U.S. troops are the essential element to fusing  relationships among warring African warlords, clans, and tribes.   Now, the British controlled Somalia, and in nearly half a century  since, we have seen a constant state of despair.   So what is the end state for our military presence in Somalia?   Are we going to be the block captain of Mogadishu, presumably  forever, until we beat the last sympathy for Al-Shabaab out of the last  heart of the last Somali?   That was the argument with Syria and ISIS; we have to stay in Syria  because there are still people who believe the ISIS ideology.   Mr. Speaker, I would argue that the U.S. military is not an effective  capability to deploy to defeat an ideology. We are not able to  permanently stabilize countries by having a presence that can at times  be the very basis for the terrorism recruitment that we seem to work  against.   There is also an opportunity cost to being in Somalia that I would  like to share with the body. I represent constituents who are part of  these missions, these train, equip, and advise missions throughout  Africa. Increasingly, they are having to enter the INDOPACOM to get  analysis and research on the best communication skills, tactical skills  and strategic skills that would be necessary if conflict were to erupt  in the INDOPACOM theater.   What I have observed firsthand is that at times, some of our best and  brightest are having to go split squad, where some are wandering about  Africa on train-and-equip missions. Then there is less of a focused  capability in places where I think America must hold the high ground to  ensure the enduring success of our Nation.   My colleague from the other side of the aisle made mention of the  training that America does in Africa and how critical it is. The  problem is, far too often, we are training the next generation of coup  leaders. We haven't figured that out yet. I got to ask the question of  the leader of AFRICOM: Why so many people who are leading coups in  Africa were trained by Americans? He was unable to identity even  current leaders of African countries, that they were trained by  Americans or that they participated in coups.  [[Page H2059]]    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a piece from The Intercept:  ``AFRICOM Chief to Congress: We share `core values' with coup  leaders.''                    [From The Intercept, April 10, 2023]   Africom Chief to Congress: We Share ``Core Values'' With Coup Leaders                              (By Nick Turse)         In Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire last month, 1,300 U.S., NATO,       and African troops met for tactical and mock raids as part of       Flintlock 2023, an annual exercise sponsored by U.S. Special       Operations Command Africa, or SOCAFRICA. Among the countries       participating was Burkina Faso, which has been restricted       from receiving substantial U.S. security aid since an officer       trained by Americans at previous Flintlock exercises       overthrew his democratically elected government in a coup       last year.        U.S. military officials have spent the last month trying to       explain this curious state of affairs to Congress and the       press. Flintlock provides a ``critical training opportunity''       for special operations forces from the U.S. and Africa and a       chance to ``exchange best practices,'' Rear Adm. Milton       ``Jamie'' Sands, the chief of SOCAFRICA, told The Intercept       and other reporters on a conference call last month. He       didn't mention that, by the Pentagon's own assessments,       militant Islamist attacks in the Sahel have spiked and       security has plummeted across West Africa since SOCAFRICA       began Flintlock trainings in 2005. ``The Sahel now accounts       for 40 percent of all violent activity by militant Islamist       groups in Africa, more than any other region in Africa,''       reads a recent report: by the Defense Department's Africa       Center for Strategic Studies.        The four-star general in charge of U.S. Africa Command, or       AFRICOM, meanwhile, told the House Armed Services Committee       that only a small percentage of U.S.-trained officers       overthrow their governments--while admitting he didn't know       the exact number. This prompted farright Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-      Fla., to ask, ``Why should U.S. taxpayers be paying to train       people who then lead coups in Africa?''        Flintlock attendees have conducted at least five coups in       the last eight years. Since 2008, in fact, U.S.-trained       officers have attempted at least nine coups (and succeeded in       at least eight) across five West African countries, including       Burkina Faso (three times), Guinea, Mali (three times),       Mauritania, and the Gambia.        Before he toppled Burkina Faso's democratically elected       president in 2022, for example, Lt. Col. Paul-Henri Sandaogo       Damiba attended Flintlock exercises in 2010 and 2020,       according to AFRICOM. A fellow Flintlock 2010 attendee, Gen.       Gilbert Diendere, overthrew the government of Burkina Faso in       2015.        Just a year after he attended Flintlock 2019, Col. Assimi       Goita headed the junta that overthrew Mali's government.       After staging that coup, Goita stepped down and took the job       of vice president in a transitional government tasked with       returning Mali to civilian rule. But nine months later, he       seized power for a second time.        Another alum of Flintlock 2019, Col. Mamady Doumbouya,       served as a Guinean unit commander during the exercise,       according to AFRICOM. In 2021, members of Doumbouya's unit       took time out from being trained in small unit tactics and       the law of armed conflict by Green Berets to storm the       presidential palace and depose their country's 83-year-old       president, Alpha Conde. Doumbouya soon declared himself       Guinea's new leader. The U.S. ended the training and       distanced itself from the coup.        ``Core values is what we start off with,'' Gen. Michael       Langley, the AFRICOM chief, told the House Armed Services       Committee last month.        ``Do we share those values with Col. Doumbouya?'' asked       Gaetz.     Mr. Speaker, in this piece, it highlights five countries-- Burkina Faso, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, and Gambia--where the very  people who led the coups were the very people who received this  training from the United States.   I would note that any comparison here to Afghanistan is sorely  misplaced. This legislation provides one year to remove 900 people.  That is far different than unwinding the double helix that was our  multidecade engagement with Afghanistan.   I agree with the sentiment that my colleague Mr. James stated, that  our friends must trust us and our enemies must fear us. But what I have  observed, after 20 years of American war in the Middle East and in  North Africa, is that our enemies often mock us when we try to be the  world's policeman and the world's piggy bank. That should not be the  goal of our country. We should not be engaged in nation-building in  Somalia, the Middle East, or elsewhere.   These 900 U.S. troops have no end state. They are engaging in largely  police force operations. I suggest they should come home, and a vote  for this resolution would do that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I can assure the gentleman from New York that  we will have a more fulsome discussion regarding the continent of  Africa because the next in our legislative series may very well be  Niger. We will have that opportunity, as well.   To my colleague from Minnesota, I think she really hits the nail on  the head that the partnerships between the existing government in  Somalia and the clans that exist throughout the country is the  essential glue to resist the violence and destabilization that we see  from Al-Shabaab.   It is my belief that the government's entrees to those groups to get  them to not side with Al-Shabaab are not facilitated by extensive U.S.  presence. I just don't believe that to get one group of Somalis to stop  killing another group of Somalis that the essential ingredient is us.   It may be other African influencers to a positive extent, but there  is great wisdom in what the gentlewoman shared regarding the utility of  those partnerships and relationships.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Mills).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if what it takes to protect the 17 million people in  Somalia is 900 U.S. troops forever, then I don't have high hopes for  them. I have far more confidence in the strategy that Congresswoman  Omar laid out, which was the Somali Government working to create some  sense of national identity among Somali clans, and no one has made a  compelling argument that we are essential to that process.   I take some exception to my colleague from Texas calling this a get- out-quick resolution. It gives us a year. Can't we move 900 people in a  year?   My colleague from Georgia argued that Somali troop presence was  essential to keep America safe. Let me be clear: I fear China and some  crazy Russian general with nuclear codes far more than I fear Somali  warlords fighting over who controls aid streams.   It is not just my opinion. It is the opinion of our military leaders  at AFRICOM. It was Brigadier General Bailey who said recently:         What we have seen is not necessarily holding land or       territory. It is more extortion, closer to an organized crime       organization.    That was on February 27, 2023, on ``Nightly News with Lester Holt.''   Even General Bailey doesn't view this as a way to get land, seize  land, and keep it away from Al-Shabaab. He is saying that they are not  really holding land. They are just engaged in low-level thuggery, and  it seems unworthy of a sustained U.S. troop presence.   Let's make clear that while the debate was elegant and compelling  about the need to engage Africa, the vote on this resolution is whether  900 U.S. troops should stay in Somalia or come home.   Those who vote against my resolution are functionally taking the  position that the 2001 AUMF, which was voted on when 89 percent of us  who are currently in the House were not even here to vote on it and  which was voted on before Al-Shabaab even existed, has become a global  permission slip for U.S. interventionism everywhere.   Al-Shabaab had nothing to do with 9/11. The fact that they have co- branded with al-Qaida is not indicative of any interoperability.   Mr. Speaker, as we are evaluating whether or not we have to keep 900  troops in Somalia for the safety and security of Americans, the  principal goal of Al-Shabaab is to rule greater Somalia under sharia  law and overthrow the government.   That is not my opinion. That is a February 2023 Congressional  Research Service conclusion. That very same CRS report indicates that  Al-Shabaab does not have the capability to attack the United States.   I guess it is easy to stand up and say that we should be the police  force everywhere because anywhere some bad person could harbor the  desire to kill us, but the best research we have says that that is not  in line with their existing capabilities.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the February 2023 Congressional  Research Service report.        [From Congressional Research Service, updated Feb. 14, 2023]                                 Al Shabaab         Al Shabaab (Harakat Al Shabaab Al Mujahidin, Mujahidin       Youth Movement) is a Somalia-based insurgent and terrorist       group that U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) in 2022 labeled       ``the largest, wealthiest, and most lethal Al Qaeda affiliate       in the world today.'' AFRICOM reports that the group poses       the greatest danger to U.S. citizens and interests in East       Africa, and is a threat to the United States.                                  background         Al Shabaab emerged in the mid-2000s amidst a vacuum of       state authority in Somalia. It evolved out of a militant wing       of the  [[Page H2063]]       federation of Islamic Courts that took control of Mogadishu       and much of southern Somalia in 2006. When Ethiopia, which       backed Somalia's nascent transitional government, intervened       militarily--with U.S. support--to oust the Courts, Al Shabaab       used historical anti-Ethiopian sentiment among Somalis to       draw recruits and support, including among the diaspora in       the United States.        Al Shabaab held much of south-central Somalia, including       the capital, from the late 2000s until African Union (AU)       forces gained momentum against the insurgency in 2011-2012       and reclaimed some territory from the group. Shabaab has       nevertheless retained control over parts of the country,       despite international recognition of Somalia's federal       government in 2012 and a range of multilateral efforts to       degrade its capacity. The group also maintains influence and       the ability to conduct attacks in government-held areas.                          relationship with al qaeda         Some of Al Shabaab's founding members trained with Al Qaeda       (AQ) in Afghanistan, and senior AQ operatives in East Africa,       including Fazul Mohammed--the late mastermind of the U.S.       embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania--have been associated       with the group. After expressions of allegiance to Al Qaeda       in Al Shabaab's early years, the groups announced a formal       affiliation in 2012.        While Al Shabaab's leaders appear to broadly share Al       Qaeda's transnational agenda, the group operates       independently. Among other AQ affiliates, the group maintains       ties with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), with       which it runs a smuggling network.        In 2015, some Al Shabaab members pressed for a shift in       allegiance to the Islamic State (IS). Al Shabaab leadership       rejected the proposal and launched a deadly crackdown against       IS supporters. A small IS faction in northern Somalia       survived the purge. Al Shabaab remains the dominant group and       appears to view the IS cell as a rival.                                  the threat         Al Shabaab has waged an asymmetric campaign against the       Somali government, AU forces, and foreign targets in Somalia.       Per UN data, 2022 was its deadliest year since 2017, when a       truck bomb in Mogadishu killed over 500 people (Al Shabaab's       deadliest single attack to date).        While the group has focused primarily on Somalia, it is       also threatens the countries participating in the African       Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS, previously known as       AMISOM) and has conducted attacks in neighboring countries       and Uganda. Al Shabaab has been most active in Kenya, which       launched a military operation in Somalia against the group in       2011 (Kenya joined AMISOM in 2012). The group has killed       hundreds of Kenyans, many through hit-and-run attacks near       the Somali border. Its 2015 assault on a university in       northeast Kenya, which killed at least 147 people, was the       deadliest terrorist attack in Kenya since Al Qaeda's 1998       bombing of the U.S. embassy.        Al Shabaab's July 2022 incursion into Ethiopia is its       largest operation outside Somalia to date, reportedly       involving some 2,000 Al Shabaab fighters. UN experts estimate       that as many as 1,000 fighters remain in Ethiopia, giving it       a foothold, despite Ethiopian claims of routing the group.        Al Shabaab has threatened U.S. and Western targets in the       region and called for attacks against the United States.       Attacks on international targets in Kenya's capital--the 2013       Westgate Mall siege and the 2019 DusitD2 hotel assault--      raised the group's international profile. Over 50 U.S.       citizens were reportedly in the Westgate mall when the attack       started--all escaped but six were injured. In 2020, Al       Shabaab killed a U.S. soldier and two U.S. contractors during       a raid on Manda Bay Airfield, a Kenyan military facility used       by the U.S. military near the Somali border.        The group has not claimed any attacks in the United States.       It has, however, encouraged lone-wolf attacks in its       propaganda, and in 2015, it produced a video identifying       shopping malls in Europe and the United States as potential       targets. In 2019, a Kenyan national was arrested in the       Philippines and later extradited to the United States on       charges of conspiring to hijack an aircraft on behalf of Al       Shabaab to conduct a 9/11-style attack in the United States.                                  objectives         Al Shabaab rejects democracy, broadly ascribing to a vision       of uniting ethnic Somali-inhabited areas of Djibouti, Kenya,       Ethiopia, and Somalia in an Islamic state under its version       of Sharia law. It characterizes the Somali government as an       illegitimate apostate authority that is beholden to foreign       powers. Al Shabaab leaders have repeatedly expressed their       commitment to global jihad. They justify attacks outside       Somalia as retaliation against countries conducting military       operations in Somalia and as retribution for alleged abuses       against Muslims. Al Shabaab described the Manda Bay and       DusitD2 attacks in Kenya as consistent with Al Qaeda       directives to target U.S. and Israeli interests, and referred       to the airfield as one of the ``launch pads for the American       crusade against Islam in the region.'' Al Shabaab activities       in Kenya more broadly appear focused on sowing internal       dissent and fomenting an insurgency. Its fighters have       specifically targeted non-Muslims in some attacks there.                                  leadership         Ahmed Diriye (aka Abu Ubaidah), a Somali national, has led       Al Shabaab since 2014. He succeeded Ahmed Abdi Godane, who       was killed in a U.S. airstrike that the Obama Administration       described as responding to an ``imminent threat,'' citing       Godane's oversight of ``plots targeting Westerners, including       U.S. persons in East Africa.'' Godane's predecessor was       killed in a U.S. strike in 2008.        Al Shabaab faced infighting under Godane, who consolidated       power by assassinating rivals, reportedly including American       jihadist Omar Hammami in 2013. Some prominent commanders left       the group or surrendered to Somali authorities in exchange       for amnesty during that time. Former deputy leader Mukhtar       Robow defected, and later ran for state office, drawing on       support from his clan. He was detained during his 2018       campaign and held without charge until 2022. He was released       by Somalia's new president, Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, and       appointed Minister of Religious Affairs. In his new role,       Robow is tasked with countering Al Shabaab's extremist       ideology.                     area of operations and capabilities         AMISOM and neighboring militaries pushed Al Shabaab from       Mogadishu and other urban centers and ports between 2011 and       2014. Al Shabaab 's control oflarge areas of south and       central Somalia, however, remained largely unchanged from       2015, when AMISOM's major offensive operations ceased, until       2022, when the Somali government launched a new offensive in       coordination with local militias and a grassroots uprising.       Al Shabaab has since lost significant territory in central       Somalia, but it continues to conduct reprisal attacks there.        While Al Shabaab's loss of Mogadishu and other port cities       initially restricted its revenue, the group has developed an       extensive taxation system covering all aspects of the Somali       economy, per UN and other reporting. Al Shabaab extorts       businesses even in government areas. It generates between $50       and $100 million annually, according to UN monitors, and uses       at least 25 percent on military purchases; Al Shabaab also       supports Al Qaeda directly with its tax proceeds.        UN monitors report that Al Shabaab is estimated to have       7,000-12,000 fighters. The group capitalizes on grievances       and distrust of the government in parts of Somalia and fills       local governance roles, providing basic services and       resolving disputes. It also forcibly recruits fighters,       including children. Al Shabaab uses various propaganda tools       to spread its message in multiple languages. In Kenya,       reportedly its largest source of foreign fighters, Al Shabaab       plays on narratives of collective punishment by the Kenyan       government against Muslims, among other themes. Kenyan       nationals of non-Somali descent led the DusitD2 attack.        Despite territorial losses, Al Shabaab maintains the       ability to conduct frequent attacks in Mogadishu and other       areas beyond its control, including through complex vehicle-      borne improvised explosive devices (VBIEDs). In 2016, an Al       Shabaab suicide bomber on a Somali airliner detonated a bomb       concealed in a laptop computer. (It did not destroy the       plane.) Advances in Al Shabaab's explosives-making capacity       led the UN Security Council to ban the transfer of explosive       precursors to Somalia in 2019.                                u.s. responses         The United States named Al Shabaab a Foreign Terrorist       Organization (FTO) in 2008 and has designated over two dozen       related persons for sanctions, either under Executive Order       (E.O.) 13536 (on Somalia) or as under E.O. 13224 (on       terrorism). Among those designated are several Kenyan clerics       implicated in fundraising and recruiting for the group and       members of its smuggling and weapons trafficking network in       Yemen. The United States has prosecuted several U.S. citizens       for fundraising on Al Shabaab's behalf.        The United States provides security assistance to AU and       Somali forces, and has supported counter-radicalization       programs in the region. In addition to airstrikes, U.S.       forces have engaged in ``advise, assist, and accompany''       missions with Somali and AU forces since 2016.        In late 2016, the Obama Administration publicly named Al       Shabaab an ``associated force'' of Al Qaeda in the context of       the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF, P.L.       107-40). U.S. airstrikes in Somalia were limited until 2015,       when President Obama broadened the justification for U.S.       military action in the country--previously ``to counter Al       Qaeda and associated elements of Al Shabaab''--to cover       support for AU, Somali, and U.S. forces operating there. The       tempo of airstrikes rose. President Trump changed the rules       of engagement for U.S. operations in Somalia in 2017,       authorizing offensive airstrikes and designating parts of the       country as an ``area of active hostilities.'' Airstrikes have       continued, after a brief pause, under President Biden:       AFRICOM conducted over a dozen airstrikes in Somalia in 2022,       citing most as ``collective self-defense,'' in support of the       Somali army.        In late 2019, three months before the Manda Bay attack, Al       Shabaab launched an unsuccessful assault on an airfield used       by the U.S. military in central Somalia--it was the largest       attack on U.S. forces in the country in nearly thirty years.       No U.S. or Somali forces were killed. Trump ordered the       withdrawal of U.S. forces--then estimated at 700--from       Somalia at the end of his term; Biden authorized the       redeployment of U.S. troops to Somalia in May 2022.  [[Page H2064]]                                        outlook         After over 15 years of counterinsurgency operations against       it, Al Shabaab still poses a serious threat in Somalia and       East Africa, despite the ongoing deployment of 18,000 AU       troops. Airstrikes have eliminated some ``high-value''       targets and supported partner operations, but Al Shabaab       maintains the capacity to conduct complex, asymmetric attacks       in Somalia and assaults in neighboring countries.        Over the past decade, political infighting and corruption       have hampered the Somali government's ability to extend state       authority. Donor fatigue and frustration has reduced support       for the AU mission, which is due to withdraw by the end of       2024. The ``total war'' Somalia's new government launched       against Al Shabaab in 2022 could be a turning point, but       Somalia has struggled to ``clear and hold'' when AU forces       have managed to gain ground in the past. For more, see CRS In       Focus IF10155, Somalia.     Moreover, Mr. Speaker, we are seeing the government in  Somalia achieve gains in large part because of local discontent with  Al-Shabaab.   Because of climate change, we are not seeing the same amount of  agricultural and livestock opportunities for people in Somalia, so many  of the groups that were paying extortion money to Al-Shabaab are not  able to pay it anymore because a lot of the land is dried up. That  resulted in Al-Shabaab being incredibly brutal to those local clans and  tribes. They poisoned the water, killed family members, and publicly  executed people. Then what happened was a lot of those local tribes  pushed back and said they would rather align with the government.   That is not a victory delivered at the end of a U.S. missile or  weapon. That is a victory that is occurring as a consequence of the  conditions in Somalia and the choices that Somalis are making.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the ACLED piece that  details how the government is making gains in ground and Al-Shabaab is  losing them. It is titled: ``Somalia: Counterinsurgency Operation Gains  Regional Support in Phase Two as Al-Shabaab Attacks and Political  Differences Persist.''                        [From ACLED, Apr. 21, 2023]   Somalia: Counter-Insurgency Operation Gains Regional Support in Phase        Two as Al-Shabaab Attacks and Political Differences Persist                 somalia at a glance: 18 march-14 april 2023       Vital Trends        ACLED records more than 180 political violence events and       over 420 reported fatalities from 18 March to 14 April 2023.       Most political violence centered in Banadir region, where al-      Shabaab launched attacks targeting Somali security forces and       civilians.        Middle Shabelle region had the highest number of reported       fatalities, with over 120 recorded during the reporting       period. Sool region followed, with more than 80 reported       fatalities. Violence involving al-Shabaab was linked to over       74 percent of total fatalities. Clashes between Sool, Sanaag,       and Cayn (SSC) militia and Somaliland security forces around       Laascaanood town resulted in most of the remaining       fatalities.        The most common event type was battles, with over 100       events, followed by explosions/remote violence, with nearly       60 events. Over 46 percent of explosion/remote violence       events occurred in Banadir region, a nearly 70 percent       increase compared to the previous four weeks.   Counter-Insurgency Operation Gains Regional Support in Phase Two as al-            Shabaab Attacks and Political Differences Persist         President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud announced the second phase       of the military offensive against al-Shabaab at the end of       March. The new phase reportedly aims to flush out al-Shabaab       from the remaining parts of the country under its control,       following the first phase that began in August 2022. While       the operation initially focused on central Somalia, starting       in Hirshabelle and then expanding to Galmudug state, the       second phase aims to expand to southern regions--Southwest       and Jubaland states.        In the first phase, the government sought support from clan       militias from the Hawiye clan, and regained substantial       territory from al-Shabaab. Subsequently, clan militias have       played a vital role in the government-led operation. Since       August 2022, these groups have been involved in more than 155       political violence events against al-Shabaab. Additionally,       they have supported security forces in nearly 60 percent of       events where government forces have regained territory from       al-Shabaab. During the first phase of the offensive against       al-Shabaab, Somali security forces regained control of over       215 locations previously under al-Shabaab's control, mostly       in Hirshabelle and Galmudug states. However, Somali security       forces, who failed to fully drive out al-Shabaab militants       from both states, still lack the military capacity to hold       newly liberated areas. Al-Shabaab, in turn, took advantage of       this weakness to maintain bases and launch complex attacks       against government troops. In particular, they regained lost       territories in Hirshabelle as the government expanded the       offensive to Galmudug state.        As the federal government anticipates a lack of support       from clans in the south for the second phase of operations,       it is seeking more support from neighboring states who are       already present in Somalia under the African Union Transition       Mission in Somalia (ATMIS)--possibly indicating a plan to       scale down the role of clan militias in the operation.       Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Kenya have reportedly promised over       30,000 soldiers to support the offensive in the coming       months. This situation update analyzes the activities of al-      Shabaab and the security forces during the second phase of       the offensive and assesses the risk that political       differences between the federal government and some of member       states, like Jubaland and Puntland, may undermine the       operations.      Al-Shabaab Aims for Hirshabelle While Continuing Attacks in           Banadir        After the counter-insurgency operation against al-Shabaab       expanded to Galmudug state in early 2023, Hirshabelle state       became a vulnerable target for al-Shabaab attacks. These       vulnerabilities have forced Somali security forces to stay       focused on Middle Shabelle and Hiiraan regions in the second       phase of the offensive rather than expanding to Jubaland and       Southwest states. From 18 March to 14 April, ACLED records 19       political violence events involving al-Shabaab in Hirshabelle       state, resulting in at least 145 reported fatalities (see map       below). Over 68 percent of these incidents were remote       violence events, which record an increase of 30 percent       compared to the previous four weeks.        In Middle Shabelle region, al-Shabaab launched several       attacks in Adan Yabaal district--in most instances using       explosives. On 25 March, al-Shabaab detonated three under-      vehicle IEDs (UVIED), targeting security forces and Abgal       clan militias at a base in Run-nirgod village. The explosion       and heavy gunfire exchange that followed resulted in over 50       reported fatalities. A few days earlier, on 20 March, another       al-Shabaab attack at a base in Daarul-        Naciim village reportedly killed at least 55 people from       both sides. The attacks came before the visit of the Somali       President on 26 March to Adan Yabaal town, where he announced       the launch of the second phase of the offensive against al-      Shabaab. The same day, a high-level Ethiopian delegation that       included the head of the Ethiopian National Defense Force and       senior government officials arrived in the capital of Hiiraan       region, Belet Weyne town, to help Somali forces plan the next       phase. Ethiopian troops have been fighting Islamist militants       in Somalia since 2006 independently, and as part of the AU       Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) since January 2014. AMISOM was       eventually replaced by ATMIS in 2022.        Meanwhile, security forces continued offensive operations       in Hiiraan to avert al-Shabaab attacks. The government       deployed troops from Mogadishu to the region, traveling along       the main supply route that connects Mogadishu to Hiiraan. On       25 March, security forces captured Jibiley village in       Jalalaqsi district and Quracley village in Bulo Burto       district from al-Shabaab. While militants peacefully vacated       those villages, they continued to launch attacks on security       forces and clan militias' new bases near Belet Weyne town. On       29 March, an al-Shabaab suicide vehicle-borne IED attack       targeted security forces and Hawadle clan militias at a base-      in Baardheere village, followed by clashes.        Further, al-Shabaab continued measures to end the alliance       between government forces and the Hawadle sub-clan in the       second phase of the offensive. The Hawadle sub-clan of the       Hawiye clan is the largest and most prominent sub-clan in       Hiiraan. There are four main clans in Somalia: Hawiye, Darod,       Dir, and Rahanweyn, with each having several sub-clans and       those sub-divisions, some supporting al-Shabaab, and others       supporting the government operation against al-Shabaab. Since       al-Shabaab controls several remote villages in Hiiraan and       other regions, sub-clans consider it necessary to reach an       agreement with al-Shabaab for their safety, and in return for       their support or neutrality, al-Sahabab offers them peace       deals. On 5 April, al-Shabaab claimed to have signed an       agreement with Hawadle Galible Hassan Agoon sub-clan in Buqda       Caqable village, Bula Burto district. The agreement       stipulates that the sub-clan would not be part of the ongoing       offensive in Hiiraan region. Similar agreements were       reportedly signed between al-Shabaab and at least seven other       sub-divisions of the Hawadle sub-clan in Buqda Caqable       village this year. Al-Shabaab also reached an agreement with       clan elders from Habar Gedir Salebaan sub-clan in Xarardheere       town, Mudug region, in December 2022.        Meanwhile, al-Shabaab continues its efforts to destabilize       the government operation by launching attacks in urban towns.       The capital Mogadishu records the highest number of al-      Shabaab attacks compared to other urban areas in Somalia,       with 49 political violence events and at least 21 reported       fatalities. Al-Shabaab's use of explosions and remote       violence increased in the capital by over 87 percent during       the reporting period compared to the same time period prior;       the group's use of grenades, in particular, increased more       than four-fold.        On 5 April, al-Shabaab carried out coordinated hand grenade       attacks in all 17 districts  [[Page H2065]]       of Mogadishu. The grenade attacks targeted security force       checkpoints, the house of the mayor of Mogadishu and governor       of Banadir, the house of former Prime Minister Hassan Ali       Khaire, and the house of a federal senator. Further, the       militants launched mortar shells targeting the presidential       palace, with some striking the house of the petroleum       minister, reportedly killing a security officer.      Political Differences Undermine the Offensive        As part of the second phase of the offensive, the federal       government plans to expand the offensive to Jubaland and       Southwest states in southern Somalia. Political differences       due to power-sharing disputes in Jubaland and Puntland,       however, undermine the operation.        Amid an ongoing dispute with the Jubaland administration       based in Kismayo, Gedo region politicians and government       officials unilaterally announced the recruitment and       mobilization of local clan militias to participate in the       military operation against al-Shabaab in the region. On the       other hand, Jubaland State Minister of Security Yusuf Hussein       Dhuumal reportedly rejected such plans to involve local clan       militias. The most prominent sub-clan in Gedo region is the       Marehan sub-clan of the Darod clan, which opposes Jubaland       President Ahmed Mohamed Islam--also known as `Madobe'--from       the Ogaden sub-clan of the Darod clan. Marehan and Ogaden       sub-clans have been fighting over the control of Kismayo       since the 1990s. The current dispute between Gedo       politicians, who are mostly from the Marehan sub-clan, and       the Madobe administration escalated in 2020 when a leadership       dispute led to the federal government's decision to deploy       troops in the region. Jubaland administration fears that       arming Marehan clan militias in Gedo would trip the balance       of power in favor of the Marehan sub-clan. Nevertheless,       Jubaland security forces continued conducting military       operations against al-Shabaab despite the lack of support       from local communities. Further, on 3 April, Ethiopian       security forces deployed troops in Doolow town, Gedo region,       as part of Ethiopia's commitment to increase its military       presence in Somalia during the second phase of the counter-      insurgency operation.        Political differences between the Puntland administration       and the federal government have also complicated plans for       the counter-insurgency operation. In mid-March, the federal       government and member states held a national consultative       council meeting in Baidoa town to discuss the fight against       al-Shabaab and to foster cooperation between the federal and       member state governments. Puntland state president did not       attend the meeting citing political differences with the       federal government, including the appointment of the new       special envoy for Somaliland affairs. On 9 January, Puntland       state suspended cooperation with the federal government after       skipping the signing of two outcomes of a national       consultative council meeting held in Mogadishu in late       December. Although al-Shabaab activity decreased in Puntland       during the reporting period compared to the previous four       weeks, fighting between al-Shabaab and IS militants led to       the reported deaths of at least 40 al-Shabaab militants,       including senior members. The fighting erupted after several       al-Shabaab militants moved to the mountainous Bari region,       likely fleeing from the government's offensive.        Different administrations in Somalia have adopted distinct       approaches to the fight against al-Shabaab, often deeply tied       to the clan affiliations of Somali leaders. The previous       government--in power from 2017 to 2022--focused on foreign       policy, rebuilding security forces, and leading       reconciliation between clans. Meanwhile, the current       administration has enlisted support, first from clan militias       and now from neighboring countries, in an intensive offensive       to flush out al-Shabaab militants. President Hassan Sheikh       Mohamud is from the Hawiye clan that has sub-clans supporting       the government operation against al-Shabaab, including       Hawadle and Abgal in Hirshabelle and Habar Gedir in Galmudug.       Former President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, also known as       `Farmajo,' who is from the Marehan sub-clan of the Darod       clan, failed to get support from the Majerteen sub-clan in       Puntland, and Ogaden sub-clan in Jubaland, with the latter       intensifying the dispute between Gedo and Kismayo       administration.        The progress made through the government operation has put       Somalia in a more positive position compared to the last six       years. These efforts could help the country recover the       decades-long political and security instability, but only if       effectively managed through power sharing, reconciliation,       and integration of clan militias into security forces.       Nonetheless, the greater role of forces from neighboring       countries in the offensive might lead to a divide between       clan militias and government forces, and claims of a `foreign       invasion' may be used by al-Shabaab in its propaganda in       order to recruit fighters. Consequently, military support       from Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Kenya might not be a solution       but rather a setback in the fight against al-Shabaab. The       regional countries are already present in Somalia under       ATMIS, although they have not participated in the ongoing       offensive due to funding issues and have only offered       logistical support and medical evacuation. The Abgal, Habar       Gedir, and Hawadle clan militias have played an important       role in the security forces' success since August 2022, and       scaling down their involvement will likely undermine the       government's efforts to defeat al-Shabaab. For the government       to claim ownership of the offensive, integrating clan       militias into security forces should be considered a       priority.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mills).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to my remaining time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   In response to the argument of the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  James), who says that our withdrawals must be event based rather than  time based, I would ask: What events are we waiting for in Somalia  exactly?   Are we waiting for a Jeffersonian democracy to emerge there?   Are we waiting for the sectarian violence that has dominated to  automatically just dissolve into the sands?   Are we waiting for some other foreign power?   I would suggest that in many of these places what we are actually  waiting for is for these countries to take care of themselves and to  demonstrate their own capabilities because the only way you form a  nation is if your own fellow countrymen fight for and win that peace.  That is how you develop national heroes, like those we see throughout  this great Capitol. That is what a nation makes.   A nation is not a bunch of Europeans drawing lines in Africa and then  saying this is what is what. We did that after World War II, and it is  why Africa has been in some degree of turmoil since. I continue to  present to the body that the government in Somalia is actually on the  upswing. They are gaining territory. They are unifying people, and it  is not as a consequence of U.S. presence.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a piece from the International  Crisis Group, ``Sustaining Gains in Somalia's Offensive against Al- Shabaab,'' and it is from 21 March 2023.              [From International Crisis Group, Mar. 21, 2023]              Gains in Somalia's Offensive Against Al-Shabaab         What's new? The Somali government has gained ground in its       war with the Islamist insurgency Al-Shabaab, mainly in       central Somalia. Most of the progress is due to Mogadishu's       leveraging of local discontent with Al-Shabaab to form       alliances with clan militias.        Why does it matter? The joint campaign has dislodged       militants from a swathe of territory in the centre of the       country, reestablishing the government's presence in regions       that Al-Shabaab had controlled for a decade or more. Troops       are now planning to move into the insurgency's southern       bastions.        What should be done? Mogadishu must consolidate its gains       in central Somalia as it goes on the offensive elsewhere. It       should establish holding forces, work for communal       reconciliation and, to the greatest degree possible, meet       local expectations around service delivery.                                   Overview         Starting in August 2022, the Somali government launched a       fresh offensive against Al-Shabaab, capitalising on mounting       discontent with the Islamist insurgency, particularly among       the politically dominant Hawiye clan. The operation has       yielded the most comprehensive territorial gains since the       mid-2010s, as soldiers fighting alongside clan militias       dislodge Al-Shabaab militants from significant parts of       central Somalia. Emboldened by clan backing and foreign       support, Mogadishu now aims to send soldiers into Al-      Shabaab's southern strongholds. As it proceeds, it should       bear in mind the need to consolidate its hold on places it       has recaptured from the insurgency. The government should       assign holding forces to provide security in recovered areas,       support local reconciliation efforts and step up service       delivery, while carefully managing residents' expectations.       If it does not take these measures, it may give Al-Shabaab,       which has proven resilient, a chance to rebound.        The government's push marks a breakthrough in a war that       has raged for more than fifteen years. Historically,       overstretched Somali and partner forces have hunkered down in       urban locales, while Al-Shabaab secured a firm foothold in       rural areas. International forces, in particular the African       Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)--which was rebranded as the       African Union Transition Mission in Somalia (ATMIS) in 2022--      , have led the fight with Al-Shabaab. In contrast, the new       offensive is spearheaded by the Somali military, in       conjunction with local clans.        A unique set of circumstances aided the government advance.       Al-Shabaab overplayed its hand, antagonising clans in central       Somalia. Demands that young male children join their ranks       spurred local clans to take up arms alongside the Somali       military. The insurgents' taxation of communities under their       control hardly helped, as the country suffers impoverishment       and food insecurity amid a record drought. Furthermore,       terrorist attacks in the capital and along Somalia's borders       appear to have prodded Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud       to take a tougher line against the group.        The government now plans to continue the offensive in       southern Somalia, even though it has not fully consolidated       its hold in the centre. Southern Somalia presents a different       set of challenges--for one thing, clans in the south have not       shown the same discontent with the Islamist movement that       prevails in the centre. But even as its plans advance to meet       a new set of challenges, the government should not lose sight       of needs in the centre, as otherwise these areas could slip       back into Al-Shabaab's hands. Before it launches major new       attacks, it should make sure it has adequate holding forces       in recovered areas. It should also conduct reconciliation       efforts and improve basic services of which residents have       long been deprived. For cash-strapped Mogadishu, that could       prove difficult, and international donors will need to step       in to provide support.        Even if the government is successful in holding down       central Somalia and reclaiming territory in the south, Al-      Shabaab will probably survive. The group is playing the long       game, exploiting government weaknesses wherever it can. The       government should thus keep open the possibility of       negotiations as a means of winding down the war for good, as       Crisis Group has argued in the past. The government's recent       wins on the battlefield will, if sustained, strengthen its       position if it indeed decides to engage in talks.                     From Local Anger to ``All-out War''       The Birth of an Offensive        The Somali government's move to wrest back control from Al-      Shabaab in parts of central Somalia is unusual in that the       military has joined forces with clan militias. The offensive       derives its strength from mounting local frustration with Al-      Shabaab's persistent, onerous demands for money and recruits,       as well as the group's violent measures of collective       punishment for non-compliance. Several sub-clans in central       Somalia have resisted the militants previously, but later cut       deals with them to forge a form of coexistence, finding the       cost of fighting Al-Shabaab too high. Still, overall, the       government has made headway.        The insurgents themselves contributed to these dynamics. In       recent years, Al-Shabaab has extended its influence by taking       advantage of political infighting in Mogadishu, which       diverted the attention of Somali elites from the task of       counter-insurgency. As politicians in the capital squabbled,       sub-clans in central Somalia grew increasingly weary of Al-      Shabaab's tactics. The Haber Gedir/Salebaan sub-clan is a       case in point. People from this sub-clan, part of the wider       Hawiye clan family, of which Somali President Hassan Sheikh       Mohamud is a member, live in and around the town of Baxdo,       situated in the central region of Galgaduud (Galmudug state).       They tolerated Al-Shabaab's presence in their area, for the       most part, until 2019, when its commanders ordered families       to provide young men to be enrolled as fighters. An       influential community member told Crisis Group that this       directive proved too much to stomach. Baxdo is a town with       strong Sufi roots; the community perceived Al-Shabaab's       demand as a ploy to inculcate the Salafi-jihadist doctrine in       the younger generation.        The Salebaan's refusal to comply with this de facto draft       triggered a spiral of retaliation, starting with insurgents       confiscating livestock and abducting elders. It culminated in       Al-Shabaab assaulting Baxdo on 17 June 2022, which proved to       be a tactical misstep: a militia from the sub-clan inflicted       heavy casualties among the invading militants, killing an       estimated 70 of them. Still, even after its defeat, Al-      Shabaab carried out raids on smaller and less protected       villages nearby in revenge.        Around the same time, in the eastern part of Hiraan region       (Hirshabelle state) west of Galgaduud, the Hawiye/Hawadle       sub-clan's historically uneasy relationship with Al-Shabaab       became outright hostile. The roots of the Hawadle's       aggravation can be traced to 2021, when the militants took       control of the road connecting Hiraan's capital Beledweyne to       the Galgaduud region. Al-Shabaab had already blocked a       southern route linking Beledweyne to Mogadishu, impeding the       flow of vital supplies to a part of Somalia that has suffered       severe drought for years. Now its checkpoint on the road       headed east choked off the area, in effect. Local  [[Page H2067]]       anger rose, becoming even more pronounced in May 2022, when       the militants killed a Hawadle elder in Beledweyne,       reportedly for having participated in government elections.        The community in Hiraan mobilised to push back against the       group, emboldened at a crucial moment by Ethiopian military       support. Al-Shabaab has long viewed Ethiopia, which invaded       Somalia in 2006 to overthrow its precursor group, the Islamic       Courts Union, as a major adversary; the insurgents have       attempted to infiltrate the country in the past, mostly to no       avail. In July 2022, however, the group launched an       unprecedented incursion into Ethiopia's Somali region.       Alarmed, Addis Ababa beefed up the deployment in the buffer       zone it maintains between its border with Somalia and areas       where Al-Shabaab is active. Ethiopia struck Al-Shabaab       positions in Somalia from the air in late July and early       August, while the head of the Ethiopian Army's Somali Command       Post, General Tesfaye Ayalew, visited Beledweyne.       Interlocutors on both sides of the Ethiopia-Somalia border       confirmed to Crisis Group that Addis Ababa gave military       supplies to local Hawadle at this time, coordinating with       regional officials.        Al-Shabaab responded to the mobilisation by unleashing a       wave of repression upon the sub-clan, which generated still       more resentment. In early August, Al-Shabaab torched Hawadle       villages in Hiraan's Mahas district, destroying wells. Weeks       later, on 2 September, militants ambushed a convoy bringing       food to the area, killing numerous civilians, including women       and children. More clan members joined the militias as a       result.        Another Al-Shabaab attack, this time in Mogadishu, provoked       a strong reaction from the national government. On 20 August       2022, Al-Shabaab stormed the well-known Hayat Hotel in the       Somali capital--a common meeting place for government       officials--putting the premises under siege for 30 hours       before security forces could dislodge them. The operation--      which led to the death of more than twenty people--may have       been an attempt to intimidate President Mohamud, who had been       elected to a second nonconsecutive term that May, out of       taking an aggressive posture toward the group.        If so, Al-Shabaab's leadership miscalculated. While Mohamud       had struck a somewhat conciliatory tone when he first       returned to office--repeatedly talking about the need for       ``different security strategies and tough negotiations'' with       Al-Shabaab--his stance changed dramatically after critics       accused him of mounting a confused, ineffective response to       the siege. He proceeded to declare an ``all-out war'' on Al-      Shabaab that combines military pressure with efforts to rein       in the group's extortion rackets in and around Mogadishu. He       also committed to undercutting the group's Salafi-jihadist       ideology. Previous attempts to combat Al-Shabaab had failed,       he claimed, because they tried to contain rather than       eradicate the group.        The government deployed armed forces to Hiraan that worked       in concert with Hawadle forces to flush militants out of       villages and towns in August. The initial focus was on       securing the main road from Mogadishu to Beledweyne and a       triangular patch of territory between Beledweyne, Mahas and       Bulo Burte. By October, the army and militias had freed much       of Hiraan east of the Shabelle River from Al-Shabaab's       physical control.      Expansion in Central Somalia        The government was eager to replicate the success in       eastern Hiraan, based on the template the Somali army and       clan militias had used there. It encouraged other clans in       central Somalia to mobilise volunteer fighters, or macawisley       (``those who wear the macawis'', a Somali sarong), relying on       prominent personalities to rally their clansmen. Somali       soldiers, particularly special forces units, still lead the       fight with Al-Shabaab, but Mogadishu has provided the clan       militias with logistical support such as ammunition, food and       medical evacuations. The macawisley participate in joint       operations, giving government forces backup from fighters who       know the terrain better. They also provide a crucial link to       the local population, sparing the government from going it       alone or trying to mobilise community support after the fact.       The clan participation also reinforces the narrative that       sections of Somali society are turning against Al-Shabaab,        Foreign partners have also bolstered the campaign against       Al-Shabaab. U.S. airstrikes are helping the Danab, a special       unit of the Somali National Army trained by the U.S. as a       quick strike force, recapture territory from the insurgents       in the regions of Hiraan, Middle Shabelle, Galgaduud and       Mudug. The U.S. has also donated military assistance, with       its ambassador for Somalia praising the war effort as       ``historic''. Turkiye has carried out drone strikes in Lower       and Middle Shabelle, further boosting the government's       firepower. Meanwhile, ATMIS has stayed out of direct combat       thus far,        The combined efforts of the Somali army, clan militias and       international partners have led Al-Shabaab's footprint in       central Somalia to contract. The government seized the       insurgency's regional centre of operations at Adan Yabaal in       Middle Shabelle in December 2022. The next month, it captured       the strategic towns of Ceel Dheere and Xarardheere in       Galgaduud--although militants remain on the outskirts. The       military is likely planning to uproot Al-Shabaab from its       remaining strongholds in the southern Galgaduud districts of       Ceel Buur and Galhareeri. If successful, its campaign would       essentially dislodge the militants from a swathe of territory       east of the Shabelle River.        The playbook from eastern Hiraan has not worked smoothly       everywhere, however. While clans in that region rose up       spontaneously against Al-Shabaab, in other areas the       government had to coax clans to join forces. Military efforts       in Middle Shabelle struggled to get off the ground and were       side-tracked by clashes between two sub-clans in the Adale       district in November. In western Galgaduud, overly       enthusiastic pro-government forces marched on the town of       Wabxo in early November, only to pull out days later in the       face of stiff resistance from Al-Shabaab. They could not hold       the area without support from Somali special forces.        Other advances have also stalled. The army had to stop       south of Qaayib, in Galgaduud, amid Al-Shabaab outreach to       sub-clans to counter government mobilisation. Government       efforts to rally clans in Xarardheere, in the Mudug region,       floundered because of sub-clan frictions and perceptions that       the government had previously failed to support them in       fighting the insurgents. The military ultimately moved to       capture Xarardheere with limited clan militia participation.        Moreover, a string of recent incidents shows that Al-      Shabaab can still inflict severe damage in areas it has lost,       even if it is not reoccupying them. In January alone, the       insurgents deployed at least twelve suicide car bombs in       central Somalia towns, in some cases causing heavy       casualties. A 20 January attack in Galcad (Galmudug state)       was particularly damaging, with Danab forces taking       significant losses, including of a deputy commander. That       incident spurred an internal reconsideration of strategy,       with the offensive in central Somalia slowing in the ensuing       weeks. Additionally, Al-Shabaab militants continue to cross       from west of the Shabelle River to attack macawisley       positions in smaller settlements in Hiraan. The infiltration       raises concerns about the government's ability to hold the       territory it recaptures, especially as it takes over more       areas. It also demonstrates the peril of measuring success in       fighting Al-Shabaab solely with the yardstick of territorial       control.        Still, the government has advantages in its current       offensive, when compared to previous campaigns. For one       thing, the military's collaboration with clan militias is       strengthening ties with local communities, while allowing for       greater government penetration of rural areas. Previous       offensives typically focused on securing cities,       inadvertently deepening the rural-urban divide that has       played to Al-Shabaab's strengths as a mobile organisation       reliant on local communities for recruitment and financing.       Secondly, today's campaign is Somali-led, unlike those from       2011 to 2015, when the government's forces played a secondary       role to what is now ATMIS. This time around, ATMIS has stayed       in the background, essentially serving as the holding force       for urban locales while Somali soldiers venture into less       densely populated areas.        There is also evidence that both the federal government and       the clans are committed to sustaining their momentum. The       current government in Mogadishu has arguably staked its       reputation on defeating Al-Shabaab. Moreover, several of the       operations to date have involved cross-clan collaboration,       demonstrating an unusually high degree of consensus among       those fighting the insurgents in central Somalia.        Progress, however, should not be chalked up exclusively to       Mogadishu or local mobilisation, but rather to the       combination of the two. The campaign has been most successful       where community resistance to Al-Shabaab is strongest, and       the government can be a force multiplier, as in eastern       Hiraan. In cases where local engagement is less apparent, the       government has struggled to advance. In this sense, the       offensive might be characterised as a series of wars between       clans and Al-Shabaab, with the government backing the former.      Al-Shabaab Adjusts to the Pressure        Al-Shabaab has suffered important losses in central       Somalia, but it continues to put up significant resistance,       showing the value it places on the region. An intelligence       source told Crisis Group that the insurgency is likely to       reinforce its fighters in central Somalia with personnel now       stationed in the south, likely sending the wounded south to       recuperate. Somali government officials say militants have       defected, but not in significant numbers. Meanwhile, Al-      Shabaab has sought to increase pressure on the government       with large-scale attacks in Mogadishu and other cities, in       addition to making regular incursions into areas the       government has seized.        Al-Shabaab's flexibility suggests that the organisation is       more likely to adapt to the government campaign than be       defeated by it. For example, the group already appears to be       changing its approach to the population in central Somalia,       realising its coercive model for securing obedience has       backfired. It has started offering more carrots than sticks,       emphasising the need to promulgate the public good (maslaha)       in its rhetoric, rather than exhorting communities to seek       forgiveness (tauba) for having antagonised the group. This       approach has borne fruit: in late December, in a setback for       Mogadishu, a group of Salebaan elders in Galmudug reached a       fresh agreement with Al-Shabaab  [[Page H2068]]       to avoid confrontation, withdrawing support for the       government in return for the release of hostages and seized       property.        The federal government's collaboration with the macawisley       likely prompted Al-Shabaab's shift in tone. In the past, the       group has been more willing to offer concessions to clans       when it feels weak, only to roll them back later when it is       in a stronger position. It remains to be seen if it will       renege on its commitments this time, but Al-Shabaab likely       realised it needed to change tack in order to maintain       community relations.        Al-Shabaab has a track record of turning to guerrilla       warfare when it is on the back foot and it has resorted to       these tactics of late. Thus far, Somali forces have fought       few major battles with the insurgents. The group prefers to       preserve its strength, withdrawing from towns before the       army's advance in favour of conducting hit-and-run attacks on       recovered areas afterward. Sustained military pressure could       certainly erode the group's capacity to act as a de facto       authority in central Somalia. But Al-Shabaab's ability to       exploit government weaknesses leads some observers to believe       that the military cannot expect to quash the insurgency, even       if it maintains a united front with the clan militias.     Mr. Speaker, we must continue to bring to this floor areas  in the world where U.S. troops are present where there is no clear end  game, where there is not an end state that is clearly achievable.   What our generation has learned as a consequence of observing the  great patriotism expressed by many of my colleagues who participated in  this debate today is that we don't have the ability to beat an ideology  out of anyone. We don't have the ability to go into these places that  oftentimes have been riddled with bloodshed and violence and somehow  convince them that a democracy or a parliamentary system is more  beneficial than the greed that has been driving them for far too long.   That is the story of the Middle East. That is the story of North  Africa. If my constituents have to go to Somalia and Syria, then I  think everyone here should have to vote one way or the other, and I  don't expect to win that vote, but I was expecting probably during this  discussion to maybe hear a little bit more about what it is that we  expect these people to do in Somalia to ultimately get them out.   What we have heard is some version of the argument that we have got  to fight them over there so we don't fight them over here, even though  all the evidence in the Record suggests that they don't have the  capability to even strike us here, and that the harboring of terrorism  that seems to justify the 2001 AUMF permission slip for American  intervention in no way relates to the activities, capabilities, goals,  ambitions of this particular group.   What this group wants to do is they want to be able to overthrow the  government in Somalia and orient greater Somalia under their sharia  law, and they are losing in that fight.   What we see online and what many of us have received in briefings in  Congress is that when U.S. troops are present, that serves as a  propaganda vehicle for a lot of these groups to be able to go out and  recruit and add folks to their ranks, and that is certainly not what we  want to see.   If the African Union had a greater role, if the African Union stepped  up and worked to fill that vacuum with greater credibility with  particular partners and particular localized clans, then that might  achieve this objective in the absence of the death, the danger, and the  deployment that has had our military spread far too thin for far too  long.   Mr. Speaker, I heard in my colleague's opening that we have to reject  the siren song of isolationism. I would observe that globalism is no  lullaby. It is often soaked in blood and mired in civil war and  violence, resulting in worse conditions than we found ourselves in.   There are 17 million Somalis. I am rooting for them. I hope that when  my life ends, Somalia isn't synonymous with famine and failed states  and civil wars and coups. I really hope that. However, we must also  exercise sufficient humility in this body to understand the  capabilities of persuasion for a relatively small batch of American  troops given the problem set.   I return to the argument that I made earlier in this discussion.  There is an opportunity cost to this in people. There are specific  units that call my district home that are having to split between  AFRICOM and INDOPACOM when the reality is whether or not our children  are speaking Mandarin, our grandchildren are being dominated by the  Chinese Communist Party is not going to be the result of who wins the  battle of Mogadishu. It is going to be the result of who holds the high  ground against our true pacing adversaries. Becoming the neighborhood  block captain of Somalia is certainly not the behavior of a serious  country engaged in various serious challenges against serious  adversaries.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. I certainly  thank the leadership for permitting me such time, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
