 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for the  underlying legislation, which includes my amendment expanding  apprenticeships for American workers.   I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  supporting this important effort in the Ways and Means Committee, and I  look forward to its passage.   We can all agree that helping people find long-term employment in a  high-demand industry is one of the best ways to ensure that everyone  has economic security. But technological advancements like automation  and artificial intelligence are dramatically shifting the way our  economy works, and these changes are only going to accelerate.   We cannot allow American workers to be left behind. Congress needs to  be forward looking, not reactive, in crafting policies that help  workers who are displaced from the workforce. I believe that means we  need a national  [[Page H5061]]  commitment to addressing the skills gap and mitigating disruption in an  evolving 21st century economy.   Apprenticeships and on-the-job training are an important part of that  equation. Apprenticeships can be an incredible opportunity for  businesses and workers alike.                                time  1245    They allow employers to build a pipeline of qualified workers while  equipping job seekers with the specific skills they need to find and  keep good-paying jobs.   Oftentimes, they provide skills that are portable and meaningful  anywhere in the country, giving workers more freedom to transfer  between companies and industries.   In my home State of Washington, investments and apprenticeships have  been shown to give a higher return on investment than any other job  training program, returning $23 for each dollar that is invested.   It is important to remember these investments not only have an  incredible impact on our economy but also on people's lives by helping  them become more self-sufficient through specialized training and  increased earning potential.   I appreciate my colleague's bipartisan support for this amendment,  and I urge its passage in the underlying legislation.
