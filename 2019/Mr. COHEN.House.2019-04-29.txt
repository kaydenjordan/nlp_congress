 Mr. Speaker, the CDC announced that there are now over 700  cases of measles in our Nation. Measles was allegedly an old disease  that wouldn't come back in 2000 because people got vaccinated. This is  the largest outbreak in measles since, I think, the 1996 time.   I, unfortunately, got polio in 1954. When the polio vaccine was being  given to second grade children, I was not in the second grade; but my  father was giving shots, as a pediatrician, to second graders, which  included my brother. He brought the vaccine home and considered giving  it to me but knew that it was outside of his charge, so he didn't do  it.   I came down with polio 3 or 4 months later. My father and I both  wished I had the vaccine. It would have solved and cured a lot of the  problems I have had since and have even today.   I ask each parent out there to make sure your children get vaccinated  so that they don't get measles and they don't spread measles to others  so we don't have another terrible outbreak.   Vaccinations work.                            ____________________
