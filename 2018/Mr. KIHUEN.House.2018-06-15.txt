 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Brett  Schwanbeck. Brett attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on  October 1. Brett was a retired truck driver who was engaged to be  married to his fiancee, Anna.   Brett was a father of three and a grandfather of five. He was a kind  and loving man who treasured the time he spent with his family. Brett  loved lake trips, family gatherings, hunting, and camping. His favorite  thing to do was go out into the middle of the woods and purposely get  lost. Brett would do anything for anyone who needed help. His family  remembers Brett as being funny, generous, and full of joy.   I would like to extend my condolences to Brett's family and friends.  Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the  whole country grieve with you.  [[Page H5223]]                                ____________________
