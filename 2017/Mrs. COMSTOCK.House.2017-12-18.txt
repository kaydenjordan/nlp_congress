The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie  Bernice Johnson) each will control 20 minutes.

General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 4661, the bill now under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 4661, the bill now under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER  Program Reauthorization Act of 2017 reflects a bipartisan, bicameral  agreement reached between the House and the Senate authorizing  committees.   I want to particularly thank our chairman and ranking member and my  friend, Senator McCain, for his leadership on this bill in the Senate,  in helping us get this agreement today. I note we all appreciate his  service as well as his commitment to the service of all those here whom  we are working for today.   Fire prevention and safety is literally a matter of life and death.  In 2015, there were 1.34 million fires reported in the United States,  causing more than 3,000 civilian deaths and 15,000 injuries. In  addition to this devastating human loss, fires cost $14.3 billion in  property damage.   As I travel throughout my district and visit with firefighters and  paramedics, I am constantly reminded of the sacrifices they make to  protect our neighbors. Certainly, as we have seen the raging fires in  California, that is brought to mind also.   One thing I consistently hear from our volunteer and professional  firefighters is how critical these grants are to their stations.  Whether they help by providing training for additional firefighters or  providing upgraded respirators to ensure their safety, towns and  communities around the district are safer as a result of these grants.   Sadly, last year, 69 of our firefighters across the country lost  their lives in the line of duty.   Fire prevention has improved dramatically since Congress passed the  Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act in 1974, which created the U.S.  Fire Administration and the National Fire Academy. This has certainly  professionalized all of this work, but there are still areas for  improvement.   Firefighting activities and funding are primarily the responsibility  of States and local communities. The USFA and NFA, however, are  responsible for national data collection, public education, and  research and training programs to reduce fire deaths and make our  communities and residents safer, as well as make our firefighters  safer.   For the last 15 years, the Federal Government has also awarded  competitive grants directly to local fire departments and unaffiliated  emergency medical services, or EMS, organizations to help with a  variety of equipment, training, and other needs.   FIRE Act awards provide funding and equipment training to ensure the  safety of our Nation's first responders.   SAFER Act awards help local departments to recruit, hire, and retain  trained firefighters. Many firefighting departments in my district rely  on these grants in order to maintain high-quality fire and emergency  services for their communities.   Loudoun County, in particular, received $2 million through this grant  program. According to Fire Chief Brower: ``These programs greatly  assist localities in the areas of firefighter safety, fire and life  safety education, and improved resourcing for tactical fire  operations.''   More than 80 people lost their lives in the horrific Grenfell Tower  fire in London that occurred earlier this year.   Closer to home, it was just 2 years ago that a Metro fire injured 70  and killed a Virginia resident who was a grandmother of three, who was  on her way to work.   California's huge wildfires are in today's headlines and remind us  that, as communities continue to expand into wildland areas, wildfires  pose growing risk for human life, home and property losses, and entire  communities.   When fires occur, first responders run toward the flames and put  themselves  [[Page H10157]]  in danger in order to prevent lives from being lost.   This bill will reauthorize the USFA and the FIRE and SAFER programs  for 6 years and ensure that our Nation's firefighters and paramedics  have the tools and training they need to fight and prevent devastating  fires.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill today, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                  Washington, DC, December 18, 2017.      Hon. Lamar Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: I am writing to you concerning the       jurisdictional interest of the Committee on Homeland Security       in H.R. 4661, the ``United States Fire Administration, AFG,       and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017.'' The bill       contains provisions that fall within the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Homeland Security.        I recognize and appreciate the desire to bring this       legislation before the House of Representatives in an       expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on       Homeland Security will not assert its jurisdictional claim       over this bill by seeking a sequential referral. The       Committee takes this action with the mutual understanding       that by foregoing action at this time we do not waive any       jurisdiction over subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation.        This waiver is also given with the understanding that the       Committee on Homeland Security expressly reserves its       authority to seek conferees on any provision within its       jurisdiction during any House-Senate conference on this or       any similar legislation, and requests your support for such a       request.        I ask that a copy of this letter and your response be       included in the Congressional Record during consideration of       this bill on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                     Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,                                  Washington, DC, December 18, 2017.      Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Home Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding the       Committee on Homeland Security's jurisdictional interest in       H.R. 4661, the ``United States Fire Administration, AFG, and       SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017,'' and your       willingness to forego consideration of H.R. 4661 by your       committee.        I agree that the Committee on Homeland Security has a valid       jurisdictional interest in certain provisions of H.R. 4661       and that the Committee's jurisdiction will not be adversely       affected by your decision to not request a sequential       referral of H.R. 4661. As you have requested, I will support       your request for an appropriate appointment of outside       conferees from your Committee in the event of a House-Senate       conference on this or similar legislation should such a       conference be convened.        Thank you again for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                       Lamar Smith,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,                                  Washington, DC, December 18, 2017.      Hon. Lamar Smith,      Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith: I write concerning H.R. 4661, the       United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program       Reauthorization Act of 2017. This legislation includes       matters that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.        I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House of Representatives in an       expeditious manner, and accordingly, the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure will forego action on the       bill. However, this is conditional on our mutual       understanding that foregoing consideration of the bill does       not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment       of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the       subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation       that fall within the Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. Lastly,       should a conference on the bill be necessary, I request your       support for the appointment of conferees from the Committee       on Transportation and Infrastructure during any House-Senate       conference convened on this or related legislation.        I would ask that a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest as well as the       mutually agreed upon changes to be incorporated into the bill       be included in the Congressional Record during consideration       of the measure on the House floor, to memorialize our       understanding.        I look forward to working with the Committee on Science,       Space, and Technology as the bill moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                      Bill Shuster,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                     Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,                                  Washington, DC, December 18, 2017.      Hon. Bill Shuster,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure's       jurisdictional interest in H.R. 4661, the ``United States       Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization       Act of 2017,'' and your willingness to forego consideration       of H.R. 4661 by your committee.        I agree that the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure has a valid jurisdictional interest in certain       provisions of H.R. 4661 and that the Committee's jurisdiction       will not be adversely affected by your decision to not       request a sequential referral of H.R. 4661.

Thank you again for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                       Lamar Smith,                                                          Chairman.    Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the United States Fire  Administration, AFG, and SAFER Program Reauthorization Act of 2017.   I hope we can all agree on the urgency of reauthorizing this program  before the sunset in current law would terminate this program in  January. We heard from the local, State, and Federal experts at our  hearing in July just how essential these programs are to ensuring both  firefighter and community safety in all of our districts across the  Nation.   This bill authorizes funding at the 2017 levels for the U.S. Fire  Administration, Assistance to Firefighters Grants, Staffing for  Adequate Fire and Emergency Response Grants.                                time  1730    It also directs establishment of a grant monitoring and oversight  framework. It makes important technical fixes to current law. It  ensures lesser resourced fire departments have the tools to  successfully apply for grants. These are critical programs to ensure  the safety and security of all Americans, and they must be  reauthorized.   Unfortunately, I must also express my disappointment and frustration  with the majority's insistence on including a new sunset clause in this  bill. The sunset currently in law is putting these programs at risk as  we speak. Congress shouldn't need sunsets to do a job properly. In this  case, arbitrary program sunsets puts lives at risk. Every single  firefighting organization wants this sunset out. On a bipartisan basis,  the Senate has voted to remove this sunset, yet here we are today  running up a program termination that nobody wants, and senselessly  adding a future program termination date that nobody wants.   Legislating by self-created emergency is bad for Congress and bad for  our country. Here we are in December desperately trying to avoid  terminating assistance to firefighters. At the same time, we are  desperately trying to keep the Federal Government from shutting down  and we are desperately trying to provide disaster assistance to  Americans who are suffering. Of course, we have already missed the  deadline on CHIP, and now 9 million children all across our country are  in danger of losing health coverage. This is no way to run a country.   So we will vote on this bill today and, in 7 years, probably be right  back in the same boat we are today. We can and should do better than  this.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Mimi Walters).   Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  H.R. 4661, the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER  Program Reauthorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, 2017 has been the most devastating year in California  wildfire history. Thousands of California residents were displaced,  over 1 million  [[Page H10158]]  acres burned, and thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed by  this year's fires.   Now, more than ever, it is critical that California's fire  departments are fully staffed. SAFER grants provide resources for fire  departments that struggle to meet their staffing needs, including  Orange County Fire Authority in my district.   SAFER grants will undoubtedly help fire departments across the  country meet the needs of their communities, while ensuring  firefighters are ready and able to assist with wildfire suppression  efforts.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to offer my  sincerest condolences to CAL FIRE and the family of Cory Iverson, who  tragically lost his life this past week battling the Thomas fire.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no requests  for time, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Abraham).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Abraham).    Mr. Speaker, I would also like to note that the  International Association of Fire Chiefs has endorsed this bill.   I appreciate, again, the bicameral, bipartisan support we were able  to bring together for the sixth year reauthorization--actually, the  seventh year, also, for extra room there.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4375) to provide for a study on broadening participation in  certain National Science Foundation research and education programs, to  collect data on Federal research grants to science agencies, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4375         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie  Bernice Johnson) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Virginia.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 4375, the bill now under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 4375, the bill now under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Virginia?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4375, the STEM Research and Education Effectiveness  and Transparency Act, contains two provisions aimed at providing better  information on how to make taxpayer-funded investments in STEM and  research and development more effective, transparent, and fair.   First, the bill requires the National Science Foundation, for the  first time, to report and make recommendations to Congress regarding  the effectiveness of its research and education programs aimed at  broadening the participation of women and historically underrepresented  individuals in STEM.   This report will give Congress, the National Science Foundation, and  other stakeholders objective information about what kinds of  interventions and assistance are efficient, scalable, and effective.   In order to have a vibrant economy that provides opportunity and  prosperity for all, we must be the leader in STEM fields. To do that,  we need to develop the talent of all Americans. This report will help  us focus resources on what works.   According to the Society of Women Engineers, which partnered with the  Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California's Hastings  College of Law, women represent only about 15 percent of the  engineering workforce.   This is an important issue because studies have found that companies  with higher female representation tend to achieve more and have higher  profits. According to Catalyst research of Fortune 500 companies, firms  with the most female representation showed a 35 percent higher return  on equity and 34 percent higher return to shareholders.   Second, the bill requires all Federal science agencies to collect  standardized information, including demographics, for each application  received for research and development grants. Agencies are to submit  the information annually to the National Science Foundation, which is  directed to publish an annual statistical summary.   This information will provide better transparency to how taxpayer  dollars are spent on research and scientists, who are involved in that  research, across the Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Science, Space, and  Technology Committee, Ms. Johnson, for joining me in sponsoring this  bill, which, as I mentioned, also applies to really getting a much more  diverse workforce, and understanding that our diverse workforce is a  strength; and by only embracing that strength, are we going to be able  to have and lead in STEM throughout the world. So I appreciate Ms.  Johnson's longtime commitment to ensuring STEM reaches into all  communities and provides opportunities for all.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4375, the STEM Research and  Education Effectiveness and Transparency Act.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill, and I thank  the Research and Technology Subcommittee chairwoman, Mrs. Comstock, for  introducing it.   Research shows that the underrepresentation of women and minorities  in STEM fields is not due to a lack of interest or motivation. There  are real institutional and cultural barriers preventing talented  individuals from realizing their dreams of working in STEM careers. We  must better understand these barriers so that we may develop and  support the most effective policies and programs.   H.R. 4375 directs the NSF to report on the effectiveness of current  portfolio of broadening participation programs. This bill also includes  one provision from my STEM Opportunities Act that requires all Federal  science agencies to collect and report annually on data for all  research grant applications and awards.   This would enable researchers to conduct a cross-agency assessment of  the participation and success of Federal grant applicants across  demographic groups. With information about the participation and  success of women and minorities throughout the process of applying for  Federal research funding, including such details as the award size, we  can identify and root out any inequities that reflect implicit bias in  the process.    This bill is a small, but important, step in the right direction  toward ensuring equitable access to STEM education and careers.   I want to take a moment to advocate for this House considering my  STEM Opportunities Act, H.R. 2653, in its entirety. That would allow us  to continue the steps we are taking today to broaden participation in  STEM in our country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Johnson for her work on this legislation in  moving this forward. I know as I go around my district and I see young  people, and I see the engagement of a very diverse population in STEM,  this is really going to be the future of our workforce. It is exciting  to be able to know that we will be able to have a small role in that  today, to make sure that we are reaching everybody, because we cannot  leave anybody behind with our need for more STEM resources, and to be  able to make sure that we have that workforce of the 21st century. I  know in Virginia alone, we have 34,000 or so cyber jobs that we are  still looking for people  [[Page H10160]]  for. So this will help with that pipeline.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4375, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________
