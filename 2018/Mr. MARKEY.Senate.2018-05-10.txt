 Mr. President, today, it is my privilege to honor  the work and achievements of Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, who dedicated his  life to understanding the development of infants and young children and  improving their lives, on what would have been his 100th birthday. Dr.  Brazelton passed away on March 13, 2018, in Barnstable, MA.   Known as America's pediatrician, Dr. Brazelton's pioneering work in  child development changed earlier concepts that parenting needed to be  a rigid process. In addition to the clinical aspects of his work as a  practicing pediatrician, he was also a scientist who observed,  analyzed, and learned about the nature of babies and children and their  interactions with their parents. His observations led to newfound  understandings of how infants develop, including the importance of the  parent-child relationship during the first stages of life. Dr.  Brazelton also developed strong connections to the parents of the  children with whom he worked. He was among the first researchers  [[Page S2616]]  who used video to observe parent-infant interactions, and his teachings  provided parents with the security and skills they needed to understand  their babies. Throughout his career, Dr. Brazelton worked with tens of  thousands of parents and children, published more than 30 books on  pediatrics and child development, and founded the Brazelton Touchpoints  Center at Boston Children's Hospital.   Dr. Brazelton's work and influence extended past the research lab and  his pediatric practice. He created Touchpoints, professional training  programs that equip family-facing providers with the skills they need  to empower parents and families through research-informed family  engagement practice. Dr. Brazelton and I shared a commitment to  advancing the health and safety of children, and his approach to child  wellness helped to inspire much of my work on this critical issue. Dr.  Brazelton was credited for putting the practice of natural childbirth  and breastfeeding back at the forefront of childrearing practices. His  research contributed to the removal of lead from gasoline in the United  States, the enactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act, and many  more policies aimed at expanding the rights of children.   Dr. Brazelton was more than just a clinician and scientist. His  constant curiosity and charisma allowed him to cross many disciplines.  He was a writer, a mentor, and a lover of the arts. He was loved by his  wife, the late Christina Lowell Brazelton, and is survived by his  children, Christina, Catherine, Pauline, and Thomas III, and his seven  grandchildren.   Dr. Brazelton's research and findings garnered him many accolades and  awards, including the Presidential Citizens Medal in 2013. However, the  advances he made in science's understanding of the importance of the  first years of life; the improvements in clinical care of infants,  young children, and their parents; and the policies based on his  scientific contributions to promote healthy child and family  development will leave the biggest mark. We have lost a champion and  visionary, but his legacy will live on in the hearts of many, and his  work will continue to influence advancements in child  development.                            ____________________
