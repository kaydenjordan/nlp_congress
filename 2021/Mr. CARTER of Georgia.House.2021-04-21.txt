 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I am here today to ask my colleagues across the aisle  to set aside this weak bill and support permanently--permanently as in  forever--scheduling fentanyl and its analogues.   We just heard from the gentlewoman from Texas. We all agree: It is  not good. Fentanyl is the problem.   Here, we have an opportunity for us to work together to help stem the  flow of deadly fentanyl and its analogues in our country. This is an  issue that impacts every one of us--every one of us. Whether we are  Republican, Democrat, Independent, it impacts every one of us in our  communities.   Just last week, in my home State of Georgia, the Georgia Attorney  General announced that he is investigating fatal drug overdoses based  on counterfeit medications laced with fentanyl and its analogues. These  individuals bought illegal products they believed to be Xanax,  Percocet, and oxycodone.   Overdoses like this happen every day all over the country--all over  the country. Yet, some of my colleagues want to go soft on fentanyl  analogues and let these products become legal in just mere weeks, or  temporarily schedule it for a few months until they can craft another  weak plan.   How can anyone seriously argue that a drug 50 times more potent than  heroin and which almost always proves fatal when ingested, should ever  be legal?   These products are manufactured illegally, and they are largely  brought into the U.S. through the southern border. Every year, U.S.  agents intercept enough fentanyl and its analogues to kill every single  American several times over. In fact, Customs and Border Patrol  announced in 2019, they had enough seized fentanyl to kill 800 million  people. And that is what they had seized; we don't know what else came  across.   I visited the border last week to see the crisis firsthand. Border  patrol agents are so overwhelmed with a 20-year record high number of  illegal immigrants that smugglers and cartels are using this as an  opportunity to traffic more fentanyl substances.   If the President and Vice President would visit the border, they  would be able to talk to the agents firsthand and see for themselves  how serious the issue is.   Instead, they have elected to leave our border wide open. We are  inviting drug traffickers to bring fentanyl substances into the country  and distribute it in our streets. This should not be a partisan issue.  Fentanyl does not discriminate. It does not.   The individuals manufacturing and distributing fentanyl and its  analogues are criminals, and they are getting our neighbors killed.  This is not an issue that is going away. It is only getting worse. The  CDC reports that there were enough overdoses last year than any single  year before.   This is the time for us to crack down on fentanyl-related substances,  and I hope that we will do that.                                time  1530     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor Assistant Director Darren Cruzan for his outstanding career as  assistant director for National Capital Region Training Operations at  the Department of Homeland Security, Federal Law Enforcement Training  Centers, FLETC, in Washington, D.C.   Mr. Cruzan has had a long distinguished career as a Federal, local,  and Tribal law enforcement official. His law enforcement career began  in 1992, as a reserve patrol officer with the Joplin, Missouri Police  Department. As he rose through the ranks of law enforcement from police  officer to criminal investigator, Mr. Cruzan's service has always  focused on the critical needs of Indian Country, especially law  enforcement training for police, corrections, and telecommunications  officers.   In 2017, the Secretary of the Interior honored Mr. Cruzan with the  Department of Interior's Distinguished Service Award, the highest  recognition an employee within the Department can receive for his  outstanding contributions.   During his time, he has provided FLETC with tremendous executive  leadership and management. Mr. Cruzan has dedicated his life to  protecting others, and I thank him for his years of service.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today with serious reservations about the  proposed infrastructure policies coming before this body.   Every Member in Congress represents a district with infrastructure  needs. Urban or rural, conservative or liberal, we all represent  communities that have dire infrastructure needs we should be  addressing.   That is why President Biden's recent discussion about infrastructure,  along with his comments about wanting to establish a bipartisan  legislative effort were encouraging.   Unfortunately, none of this would come to fruition. We didn't see a  bipartisan push. We didn't see significant input taken from Members and  Senators on our side of the aisle. We didn't see a willingness to want  to work together.   The $2.2 trillion plan wasn't released after significant back-and- forth discussions. No, it was released after development by the White  House and then pushed out in a media blitz.   As anticipated, the package was a partisan exercise. Just 5 percent  goes to repairing roads and bridges. As the core definition of  infrastructure, there is very little attention shown. Only 1 percent  goes to airports. Other countries around the world continue to build  state-of-the-art airports, as airports here in the United States  struggle to keep up with demand. Ports and inland waterways, an issue  important to me as the representative of two major seaports, is even  more astounding. Just one percent of this bill goes to ports and inland  waterways. Ridiculous.   Now is the time for real infrastructure investments, but this isn't  the plan Americans need.   I urge my colleagues to start from scratch and focus on the real  issue here: Our Nation's infrastructure needs.
