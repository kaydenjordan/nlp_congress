 Mr. President, interesting time we have here in the U.S.  Senate. When the Democrats took over this body, we were coming out of a  pandemic and not even close to being fully out of the pandemic yet. If  you think back then, people didn't have shots in their arms, the  economy was in tough shape, and Democrats responded in a way that  helped turn this economy around and helped put us on firm footing as a  leading economic driver in this world.   It is interesting as I hear some of my folks on the other side of the  aisle talk about things like inflation as it applies to food. I happen  to have a couple of bills that will deal with that issue, and hopefully  we can take it up in the lameduck. I don't think we are going to have  time to take it up before the election. But that will help not only our  cow-calf producers but also consumers when it comes to meat prices. I  would hope that we get a large number of folks from across the aisle to  support us on that.   When we talk about the southern border and we talk about national  security--and I am going to approach national security in a little  different vein here with this CR--I think it is important to note that  folks bring up a lot of things wrong, with few solutions.   The bottom line is that we need more manpower and we need more  technology on the southern border. I have been down there, and I have  seen how these folks bring drugs across the line. They don't put it in  backpacks--some, but very little. Most come across in cars and trucks  and equipment. If we have the technology to be able to, for  [[Page S5120]]  lack of a better term, x-ray these vehicles, we can make a big inroad  on what is going on from a drug standpoint. If we have the manpower-- which, by the way, we are very undermanned as far as Border Patrol and  border protection--we could make inroads into illegal border crossings  also.                            Continuing Resolution    Mr. President, I am not here to talk about any of that stuff, per se.  What I do want to talk about is a thing called a continuing resolution  because that is what we are going to vote on hopefully today or  tomorrow. Without this continuing resolution, we will be shutting down  the government, so I would encourage all my fellow Senators to vote for  this continuing resolution.   I am going to approach it from my position as chairman of the  Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, the committee that funds our  military. Our Armed Forces need this funding, this continuing  resolution, for their paychecks, along with the thousands of civilian  employees whom the Department of Defense employs.   The fact that we are debating a continuing resolution instead of a  full government funding bill is truly disappointing. It is  disappointing because Federal Government funding is Congress's primary  job. People of Montana did not send me to the U.S. Senate to play  politics and put off work that needs to be done to another day; they  sent me here to get the job done. Failing to pass this CR would harm  families, businesses, agriculture all across our great Nation. So step  1 is passing this continuing resolution, not kicking the can further  down the road.   But let's do ourselves a favor. Let's make sure that this is the last  CR before we agree to fiscal year 2023's funding package. I can tell  you that after working for the last nearly 2 years as chair of the  Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, that this bill shouldn't be about  politics or partisanship; it should be about national security, keeping  our Nation safe. But by continuing to pass CRs, our military will be  operating on outdated budgets, our troops will not have the resources  that they need to operate at the highest level, and it will waste  taxpayer money.   Make no mistake about it, there are countries out there that wish to  do us harm. With every continuing resolution, we are giving our  enemies--and I don't need to bring them up per list--the ability to  take a second breath and come after us: Russia in Ukraine; China, which  is rapidly modernizing their military and threatening our technological  edge. This is happening, along with a bunch of other stuff, while we  are limiting our military's ability to assess emerging threats around  the globe.   Without a full appropriations package, our Armed Forces lack  certainty needed to operate to their fullest potential--certainty that  is so important for everything. It is important for business, it is  important for families, and it is important for our armed services.   I know what it takes to craft these bills because, quite honestly, we  worked on a pretty darned good appropriations bill, but we weren't  allowed to bring it up. For the sake of our national security and for  our men and women in uniform, we need to work in a bipartisan way.   If you want to talk about what is wrong with this country, the main  thing that is wrong with this country is we point to the different  issues and areas that we could do better on. The main thing that is  wrong with this country right now is dysfunction in Washington, DC, and  the fact that this place is totally divided, and everything is about  politics first and policy second.   We need to find common ground. Failure to find common ground puts our  troops and our Nation and, quite frankly, the whole world in danger.   I will close by saying that my colleagues need to pass this  resolution, and we need to make sure that this is the last continuing  resolution that we pass; that, in fact, we have full appropriations  bills done in the proper timeline, which is at the end of the fiscal  year, which is the end of September. Anything less should be considered  a failure.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
