 Madam President, I wish to commemorate the life of Judy  Heumann, a leader in the disability rights movement, who passed away on  March 4.   Judy was an internationally recognized leader in the disability  community. She was instrumental in the development and implementation  of major disability rights legislation, including the Rehabilitation  Act of 1973, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--IDEA--the  Americans with Disabilities Act, and the UN Convention on the Rights of  Persons with Disabilities.   She was a true public servant having served as the Assistant  Secretary for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative  Services in the Department of Education from 1993 to 2001 and as the  first Special Advisor for International Disability Rights at the  Department of State from 2010 to 2017. In 1974, she helped develop  legislation that became the IDEA while working on the Senate Committee  on Labor and Public Welfare--now the Committee on Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions, which I am proud to chair.   Judy became known as the ``mother of the disability rights movement''  when she fought to implement the Rehabilitation Act. Her activism was a  defining moment in the disability and civil rights movement paving the  way for the future legislation.   Judy changed the world for the one in four Americans living with a  disability and one in six individuals with disabilities around the  world. I join the disability community in honoring her contributions to  the disability and civil rights movement.   Judy was feisty in her many roles fighting for disability rights. And  she will be remembered for the impacts her advocacy made to improve the  lives of people with disabilities.   May the memory of Judy Heumann be for a blessing.                            ____________________
