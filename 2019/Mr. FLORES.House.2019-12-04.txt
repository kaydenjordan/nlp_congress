 Mr. Speaker, I am glad to be here with the honorable  Speaker pro tempore from Texas as well.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support for S. 151, the TRACED Act.  This legislation is a culmination of strong bipartisan work by the  Energy and Commerce Committee in the House and our Senate counterparts.   We all hear complaints from constituents about the scourge of  robocalls, and I am glad we are answering the American people with  decisive action.   This bipartisan bill gives consumers tools to prevent robocalls at no  additional cost. It also provides law enforcement and the FCC with  authority to go after bad actors.   I am also pleased that S. 151 includes language from an amendment  that I offered in committee that raises fines to $10,000 per violation,  which will further deter illegal operators from entering into this  abusive behavior.   Alongside advances from last year's RAY BAUM'S Act and efforts at the  FCC, we are in a better position to restore confidence in our  communication services once again. This is the type of work that the  House of Representatives ought to be engaged in for the American  people.
