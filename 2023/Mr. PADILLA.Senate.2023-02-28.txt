 Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  bipartisan bill that I introduced today with Senator Cramer to help  ensure the financial stability of smaller credit unions.   Congress created the Central Liquidity Facility in 1978 to improve  the general financial stability of credit unions by serving as a  liquidity lender to credit unions experiencing unusual or unexpected  liquidity shortfalls.   Unfortunately, under current law, smaller credit unions often do not  have access to this critical tool that could help them address  liquidity shortfalls, especially amid higher interest rates.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bipartisan legislation with  Senator Cramer to allow corporate credit unions to buy Central  Liquidity Facility capital stock for a chosen subset of its members  rather than all of its members for the next 3 years. This would provide  greater flexibility for smaller credit unions to use the Central  Liquidity Facility's services.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill to meet the  needs of our Nation's 6,000 credit unions and the communities they  serve.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Mr. Lujan):   S. 555. A bill to improve disaster assistance programs of the  Department of Agriculture, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.
