 Mr. Speaker, 20 veterans commit suicide in the United  States every day. This is not only a crisis; it is a national shame.   Today, June 27, is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Day. We  need to come together as Democrats and Republicans to help those  suffering from PTSD.   Too many veterans suffering alone in the dark are not eligible for VA  benefits, or are unable to navigate the VA bureaucracy.   I am proud to have introduced the bipartisan Mental Health Services  for All Veterans Act, H.R. 2736, which would provide every member of  the military mental health services, whether Active Duty, Reserve, or  National Guard, even if they were less-than-honorably discharged.   Mental health, PTSD, 20 suicides a day--this crisis in a community of  heroes must be addressed.                            ____________________
