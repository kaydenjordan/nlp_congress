 Madam Speaker, do you hear that? That is our democracy  crumbling.   I want all of my neighbors, I want all of America to know why the  people's House is here for an emergency vote on Saturday while Senate  Majority Leader McConnell went on vacation: We are experiencing a  global pandemic, and now our U.S. Postal Service is under attack.   Let it be clear: This administration is waging an authoritarian  campaign to sabotage this election by manipulating the Postal Service  to suppress our votes, and they are threatening the livelihood of our  postal workers, our seniors, our veterans, and so many more in the  process.   This is not a conspiracy theory. This is fascism. We will not stand  for this now or ever.   In Michigan right now, machines capable of sorting 35,000 pieces of  mail per hour have disappeared from postal facilities.   Brave workers are blowing the whistle and saying that they have never  seen anything like this, Madam Speaker.   We must put an end to it.   Madam Speaker, I say to the White House: Hands off the United States  Postal Service.   Let's make it clear through this law to fund our Postal Service and  undo these harmful attacks and restore normal operations.
