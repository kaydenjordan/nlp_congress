 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining  votes in this series be 10 minutes in length.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, during the last break in our schedule here  in Congress in Washington, I spent 2 weeks traveling across my State-- as all of us, no doubt, did--and listening and talking to my  constituents about what is on their minds, what they think we ought to  be doing, and what our priorities should be.   In one city, I spoke with students and teachers about the need to  improve college and career readiness for historically underrepresented  populations and how a piece of legislation that we have introduced with  colleagues called the GEAR UP for Success Act would better serve those  students.   It was a little bit of a revelation for me, having come from a family  where my parents expected me to go to college, and they themselves went  to college, that if other children are growing up and don't have that  experience--many times, their parents are not prepared to help counsel  them on which courses they ought to begin to take as early as seventh  grade in order to be prepared with the prerequisites to advance up the  educational ladder and be ready for college, to get into the college of  their choice. So that was an important piece of legislation. Certainly,  working together with colleagues here, I hope we can reauthorize and  fund those grants so that more of our young people can get the  advantage that comes from that sort of counseling and tutoring and  help.   I also spent a little time at Dyess Air Force Base in Abilene, TX, to  talk about military readiness and the importance of the new strategic  bomber--the B-21--mission that is coming to Texas and to the U.S. Air  Force.   I also had a chance to talk to some of my educators and other  advocates about the Jenna Quinn Law, which is designed to help give  caregivers and teachers training so that they can actually recognize  and report signs of child sexual abuse in the children for whom they  are responsible.   It has been interesting to me because it actually follows on  legislation that passed and has been successful in Texas to train  teachers and caregivers on the signs of child sexual abuse so that they  can help get those children the help they need, sometimes by asking  questions they would never ask if they had not been trained to  recognize those signs.   Jenna Quinn herself was an example--this bill is named for her--of  somebody who was asked by her sister: Jenna, has somebody hurt you? And  that opened up the story and, fortunately, a prosecution and began the  path to healing from that trauma.   It is great to be able to talk about a number of topics as we all  return home, and you can imagine, coming from Texas, with 1,200 miles  of common border with Mexico, one of the things we talked about is the  humanitarian crisis along the southwestern border.   Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley Sector encountered  several large groups of people trying to enter the United States last  week. This is just in 1 week. On Thursday, agents near La Joya  responded to a report of a large group of migrants and found more than  220 people in that one group, mostly families and unaccompanied  children from Central America. The very next day, they came across two  additional large groups, one with 145 people and another with nearly  300. On Sunday, they apprehended a group of 170. That brings the total  to more than 800 people from just 4 groups in 1 week.    These numbers represent a surge in the volume of people we see coming  across the border historically. In fact, now almost all of them come  from someplace other than Mexico. There is actually no new net  migration from Mexico. But we see people being recruited and paying for  the services of human smugglers to come from Central America and  actually many other countries around the world where people realize  that if they can get access to Central America and they can pay the  fees to the human smugglers, they can make their way into the United  States.   That is why even President Obama said in 2014 that this is a  humanitarian and security crisis. In fact, the statement that President  Obama made in June of 2014 when he said that came on the heels of 2  months of record-high apprehensions of unaccompanied children. Between  May and June of 2014, more than 135,000 people were apprehended at the  southern border. Those numbers were absolutely mind-boggling to us at  the time, but those figures pale in comparison to the level of  apprehensions we are seeing today.   In February and March of this year--again, a 2-month period--more  than 180,000 people were apprehended at the southwestern border. So in  2014 when President Obama called it a humanitarian and security crisis,  it was 135,000. Today, in February and March, it was 180,000. That is  more than a 33-percent increase from the humanitarian crisis President  Obama referred to in 2014. So if it was a crisis then, it has now  turned into a full system failure, and all lights are blinking red.   Detention centers are at over capacity. The already understaffed  Border Patrol is struggling to meet their needs. Officers and agents  are pulling double duty, as law enforcement officials have become  caregivers for children. Customs agents are being pulled off their duty  to process migrants. NGOs--the nongovernmental organizations--and  community organizations that usually help the migrants process the  system are unable to keep pace. Cities and counties across the border  are bearing the brunt of this massive wave of humanity.   But if you think the situation is bad now, and it is, it will only  continue to get worse because we typically see higher apprehension  rates in April and May than we do in February and  [[Page S2617]]  March. These rapidly depleting resources are being overwhelmed, as I  said, and cannot keep pace.   We need to address the root of the problem, and we need to do it  soon. Only Congress can pass the legislation that is needed in order to  come to grips with this crisis. It is time for us to pass legislation  that will provide our frontline officers and agents with the resources  they need in terms of staffing, authorities, and infrastructure.   It is also important for us to plug some of the holes that are being  exploited by the human smugglers and others that allow them to  successfully place migrants into the United States 97 percent of the  time as long as they are an unaccompanied minor or come with a family.   Fortunately, I found a partner and ally from the House body who  happens to be a Democrat by the name of Henry Cuellar, who is willing  to work with me on this issue. He has been my ally on a number of  efforts to bring commonsense reform, when it comes to border security  or trade, to Texas. We don't always agree, but we can agree on a number  of things, and those are the things on which we like to work together.   Earlier today, Henry Cuellar and I introduced the HUMANE Act, which  will make important and long-overdue reforms to our immigration system,  and it includes commonsense provisions that Republicans and Democrats  can and should agree on.   First, it closes a major loophole that is often exploited by the  human smugglers when they bring families into the United States across  the border illegally. This is called generically the Flores Settlement  Agreement. That name comes from a 1997 agreement that determined that  the Department of Homeland Security can only detain unaccompanied  children for 20 days before releasing them to the Department of Health  and Human Services.   While this was unquestionably well-intentioned at the beginning, it  has morphed into a much bigger problem because in 2016, the Ninth  Circuit Court of Appeals expanded the Flores holding, effectively  applying the settlement not just to unaccompanied children but also to  families and turning it into a pull factor for illegal immigrants  hoping to game the system.   I am grateful for the support of my friend and ally Congressman  Cuellar because we recognize that rather than single adults arriving at  the border alone, many people are now bringing children with them so  they can pose as a family. They realize they can bring a child-- anybody's child--and pose as a family unit so they can be released  after 20 days. Children are literally being kidnapped to serve as a  free ticket into the United States. Sadly, many are abused along the  way, and many arrive at our border in very ill health. We simply cannot  stand by and do nothing and let this continue to occur.   I know today I read in one of our newspapers that the San Antonio  Chamber of Commerce said that because Customs agents are being  redeployed to deal with children and families, handing out juice boxes  and diapers, that there has been a huge slowdown in cross-border  commerce and trade. Because of the unique nature of the supply chains  that apply to manufacturing both in Mexico and the United States, they  estimate that as much as $800 million a day is being lost because now  our infrastructure and our staffing at our borders are being  overwhelmed.   So the HUMANE Act would clarify that the Flores Settlement Agreement  only applies to unaccompanied children and not to families, and it  would provide greater time for processing and immigration proceedings  to take place before the families are released from custody.   Secondly, this legislation would require that all unaccompanied  children are processed the same, regardless of the country of their  origin, because under current law, children from Mexico and Canada can  be promptly returned home if they don't have a legitimate claim, but  processes for other countries move much more slowly, if at all. Put  simply, we should make every effort to safely return these children to  their home countries as quickly as possible if they don't qualify for  an immigration benefit, just as we do now for those from Mexico and  Canada.   It would also require all children to undergo biometric and DNA  screening to establish family relationships and ensure that they are,  in fact, traveling with relatives rather than human smugglers.   To better protect children who are released to Health and Human  Services, this bill would place prohibitions on certain individuals who  could be serving as guardians. For example, no child should be released  to the custody of a sex offender or a human trafficker.    Third, the HUMANE Act would enable family units to stay together-- something, I would think, that all of us should agree on--and  streamline the process for those in custody.   Consistent with the recommendations from the bipartisan DHS Homeland  Security Advisory Council, the bill would require DHS to establish at  least four regional processing centers along the southern border to  house and process families. This would literally serve as a one-stop  shop, with DHS personnel from Customs and Border Protection, ICE,  USCIS, and FEMA assisting migrants and working to process their claims.   Under this legislation, asylum officers and immigration judges would  be forward-deployed to adjudicate claims and expedite the entire  process, which we hope would begin to ease the burden on our current  debilitating immigration court backlog.   In addition to those changes, the legislation also includes  provisions to make commonsense improvements, like additional Customs  and Border Patrol personnel, and training for our CBP and ICE employees  who work with children.   While we know this will not fix all of the problems that exist in our  immigration system, we believe it is an important start to change the  calculation when it comes to people who say: I know I don't qualify for  asylum, but I am going to try anyway, and I am going to pay a human  smuggler $5,000, $6,000, $7,000, or $8,000 to try to get me from my  home in Central America into the United States because right now, 97  percent of the time, it works.   This is also a huge bonanza to these cartels that are commodity  agnostic. They trade in drugs. They traffic children, women, and, yes,  they move migrants across the border for money. This will put a big  dent in their profits, as we should want to do.   It will also send a message to those who do not have valid claims:  Don't even try.   So it will have a deterrent value, which I think will begin to help  us control the huge surge of humanity coming across now, which were, as  I said, 76,000 in February and 103,000 in March. We are going to see  those numbers continue to go up and up and up, further overwhelming our  capacity to deal with this humanitarian crisis unless we do something,  like this legislation that Congressman Cuellar and I have introduced.   I am grateful for the support and cooperation of my friend and  colleague from the House. I am sure there are people in his party who  will say he has done too much, just as there are people in my party who  will say we haven't done enough. But around here, you have to start  somewhere, and where you start is where you can find common cause and  agreement and begin to build consensus to solve problems.   Hopefully, if we are successful in passing this legislation, this  will not only address this humanitarian crisis, but it will maybe  establish a downpayment of goodwill and demonstrate our ability to  solve some of our other problems here in the Congress, particularly  those that relate to our broken immigration system.   I hope we will soon have the opportunity to consider this text in the  Judiciary Committee--I talked to Chairman Graham, who seemed willing to  do that--and bring more members into the debate so we can provide  relief for those struggling to manage the crisis.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Murphy, Ms. Duckworth, Mr.          Blumenthal, Mr. Casey, Mr. Peters, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mr.          Coons):   S. 1315.
