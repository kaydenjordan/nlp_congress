 Madam Speaker, this is the bill, 728 pages, that we got  from the Senate this week. Has anybody read it?   Come on. That is over a billion dollars average per page. That ain't  gold; that is fool's gold.   Look, more IRS agents, as Art Laffer said years ago, that is not  going to increase the amount of revenue to the government, and, in  fact, when you say it is going after the ultrarich, what happens is the  ultrarich are the only ones that can avoid paying taxes. They can hire  attorneys, accountants. They can move, change their business structure.  It comes right back to the middle class every time.   These same policies are the reasons that the average Black household  in the 8 years of Obama lost 30 percent of their net worth.   We keep hearing from the other side that there is this runaway  inflation, and this ugly bill is going to stop it. Well, our President  said it is zero percent inflation. Somebody is lying. We will find out  who.
