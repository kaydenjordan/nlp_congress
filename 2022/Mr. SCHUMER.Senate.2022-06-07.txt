 Mr. President, as the Senate's June work period begins,  the American people have one question front of mind: After years and  decades of gridlock, will the Senate do something about our Nation's  gun violence epidemic?   Democrats are ready to take action, and soon every single Member of  this Chamber is going to have to answer that question.   Today is June 7, 2022. It is the 158th day of the year. Already-- already--this year, we have had over 250 mass shootings--over 250. That  is more than one a day.   Two weeks ago, we saw the worst school shooting in America since the  tragedy at Sandy Hook. An 18-year-old boy bought two assault rifles for  his birthday and gunned down 19 children in Uvalde, TX--9-year-olds,  10-year-olds, 11-year-olds. You see the pictures of kids with their  sweatshirts, with their awards, with their trophies. Every parent has  seen pictures of children that age, and to know that they are no  longer--that they were wiped out, that they were brutally murdered-- breaks your heart. It just sends shivers down your spine. A few hours  later, after it happened, the parents realized and were told they would  never see their children again.   Ten days before that, eleven more people were gunned down while  grocery shopping in Buffalo, simply because of the color of their skin.  I still can't get out of my mind the 3-year-old I met, when I visited  Buffalo, who lost his dad because his dad made a quick stop to the Tops  Supermarket to get his son a birthday cake. It was his son's birthday.  He will never see his dad again and will live with that his whole  life--knowing that his dad was killed in order to get him a birthday  cake.   And for every tragedy that traumatizes the Nation's collective  psyche, there are countless others that take place outside the national  spotlight. They happen every single day in homes and communities in  every part of this country. Across every neighborhood, every school,  every small town, every large city, Americans of all persuasions are  wondering the same thing: When is it going to be enough? When will  Congress find the will to act? One party has that will and soon will  determine whether the other side on the aisle will join. That is the  challenge that faces this Chamber as we begin this work period.    Before Memorial Day, I made clear that the Senate will vote on gun  safety  [[Page S2796]]  legislation in the near future. To that end, a handful of my Democratic  colleagues, led by Senator Murphy, including the great work of Senators  Blumenthal, Sinema, Manchin, Coons, Heinrich, and others, have been  holding extended and substantive talks with Republicans to see what we  can pass in this Chamber that will meaningfully address our Nation's  gunfire epidemic.   I am encouraging my Democratic colleagues to keep talking to see if  Republicans will work with us to come up with something that will make  a meaningful change in the lives of the American people and help stop  gun violence. There is virtual unanimity among Senate Democrats that  getting something passed through this Chamber is worth pursuing if it  will make a tangible difference in preventing gun violence.   We know we are not going to get everything we want. We know the push  for even more meaningful gun safety will continue after this debate,  but making real progress is very important. Senator Murphy has asked  for some space to have these bipartisan talks continue, and I have  given him that space. I look forward to discussing the status of those  talks with my colleagues today.   We owe it to American parents. We owe it to American kids. We owe it  to every single neighborhood, every single community, every single  household that has been ripped apart by gun violence. This is a tough  fight. Nevertheless, we have a moral obligation to do everything  conceivable to break the cycle of violence.   In the wake of the tragedies in Uvalde and Buffalo, we have a chance  to tell the American people that, this time, their anguish will not  fall on deaf ears. We have a chance to tell them we hear them; that we,  too, are angry and we will do everything we can to make real progress  in the Senate, difficult as that is. But it is only going to happen if  both sides keep working. Only with that will hope for a compromise  translate into real, concrete legislation. We know it is a difficult  hurdle to overcome; but, nevertheless, we must do everything we can to  try and succeed.                        Honoring our PACT Act of 2021    Mr. President, now onto the PACT Act. Later this morning, the Senate  will take the first vote to advance one of the most important veteran  healthcare bills that this Chamber has considered in decades.   Memorial Day was a little over a week ago, the day our Nation honors  our war dead and rededicates itself for caring for those who sacrificed  everything to protect our country. Our veterans deserve endless thanks,  not just through words, but through action.   Today, toxic chemical exposure is one of the most devastating health  problems impacting our Nation's veterans. Since 2001, as many as 3\1/2\  million servicemembers--3\1/2\ million--have been exposed to toxic  smoke, including toxic burn pits and Agent Orange. Sadly, many of them  are unable to get the care they need because of outdated rules within  the Veterans Administration that determine eligibility for benefits.   This is long overdue for a change. It is something I have been  advocating for years. And, today, I am thrilled that the Senate will  vote to begin consideration of the Honoring our PACT Act, which my  colleagues Senator Tester and Senator Moran have done a great job  putting together. Every single one of us in this Chamber has heard from  a military servicemember who has struggled to afford quality  healthcare, and this is one of the best steps the Senate can take to  improve the lives of those who have given their all for our country.   The Honoring our PACT Act will be one of the largest expansions in  healthcare benefits in VA history, and it would make sure no military  servicemember exposed to toxic chemicals has to endure the indignity of  carrying the burden of sickness and treatment alone.   I expect today's vote will yield strong bipartisan support, and once  we are on this bill--because today is just a motion to proceed, not  passage of the bill yet--there is no reason we can't pass it quickly  and without needless distraction.   Once again, I want to thank Senators Tester and Moran for their  leadership on this issue. This issue has been important to me. I have  encouraged them, and they have worked so well together adroitly so that  this bill can pass.   I want to thank every single VSO that has advocated for change. And I  want to thank prominent voices like Jon Stewart and John Feal--who I  just met in my office--who have fiercely advocated for our veterans.   We are moving forward today on this bill, and it is my hope we can  reach final passage very quickly.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
