 Mr. Speaker, from the steel mills to the  auto plants, Buffalo and Western New York are communities that respect  hard work and have a long and strong record of leading and supporting  the labor movement.   That tradition continues with local Starbucks workers. Despite  pressure tactics and roadblocks, they were successful in their bid to  organize unions at Starbucks locations in Buffalo and Cheektowaga, New  York.   This weekend, I was proud to stand with the Starbucks Elmwood  employees who were fighting for better working conditions.   Today, I recognize the efforts of all workers who show courage and  solidarity in their fight for fair wages and working conditions.   Every social movement in America started from the ground up, from  people with passion and vision to demand better for their workplace,  for their community, and for our collective future.   Congratulations to Starbucks Workers United. Your organizing  achievement is a victory for many and an inspiration to all.                            ____________________
