 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Protecting Our  Democracy Act. I am very proud to sponsor this legislation, and I am  grateful for the partnership of many chairs and Members who contributed  to the effort, as well as the leadership of Speaker Pelosi.   Our system was founded upon a respect for the rule of law and a  carefully constructed balance of power among the three branches. That  system has, throughout history, been tested. Just as, after Watergate,  Congress worked to pass reforms like campaign finance laws and new  ethics rules, so we must now examine the cracks in the democratic  foundation and address them.   That is precisely what this bill does. It will prevent Presidential  abuses of power, ensure the independence of our justice system, and  reinforce the system of checks and balances.   Specifically, among other things, it would prevent corruption or  misuse of the pardon power. It would ensure that Congress may exercise  its constitutionally mandated oversight responsibilities and enforce  subpoenas in a timely manner. It protects whistleblowers and expands  the independence of inspectors general. It reestablishes Congress'  power of the purse.   This bill has garnered support from groups across the political  spectrum because it is not about politics; it is about the survival of  our democratic system of government. Many of the reforms included in  this package are sponsored and supported by Republicans as well as  Democrats.   I urge all of my colleagues in Congress to support the Protecting Our  Democracy Act. The day that we were sworn into office, we made a sacred  pledge of allegiance and loyalty to the United States. This bill places  our oath to democracy and the Constitution above party politics. This  is a moment and a vote when we have the opportunity to fulfill that  oath.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Representative Ocasio- Cortez's amendment.   The GAO's expertise and technical capacity are critical to Congress'  oversight. This amendment by the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Ocasio- Cortez) gives GAO access to important information in the IC's  possession that is necessary for the conduct of GAO's responsibilities  while also ensuring the protection of sensitive sources and methods. It  strikes the right balance between security, transparency, and needed  oversight.   It also imposes confidentiality restrictions; clarifies that GAO  officers and employees, like their IC colleagues, are subject to  penalties for unauthorized disclosure; and requires the Comptroller  General to consult with the Director of National Intelligence to  establish protections against such unauthorized disclosures.   In sum, the amendment will enhance congressional oversight of the IC  in a manner that protects our national security. I want to thank my  colleague for offering it. I urge a ``yes'' vote.  [[Page H7613]]         Will the gentleman yield?    Let me ask the gentleman, are you aware, just by way of  illustration, that the President's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort,  secretly met with an agent of Russian intelligence and provided  Russian intelligence with internal campaign polling data as well as  strategic insights about their strategy in key battleground States? Are  you aware of that?     Let me ask you, are you aware, while the Trump campaign  chairman was providing internal polling data, that Kremlin intelligence  was leading a clandestine social media campaign to elect Donald Trump?  Are you aware of that?    Would you like me to go on?    Well, I am asking you. You asked me to present you with  some of the information.    If you would like me to continue.    To get to the gentleman's question, I am aware of  President Trump's son meeting secretly in Trump Tower in New York with  the Russian delegation with the purpose of receiving dirt on Hillary  Clinton, which the Russian delegation represented was part of the  Russian Government's effort to help elect Donald Trump in 2016.   I am aware that Donald Trump, Jr., said in response to that Russian  offer of dirt on Donald Trump's opponent that he would ``love it,''  suggested the best time would be in late summer, and had a secret  meeting in Trump Tower. When asked about that secret meeting, both the  President and his son lied about it. Are you aware of those facts?    I am happy to continue to outline the contacts between  the Trump campaign and Russia, their solicitation of Russian help in  the election, the former President's effort to coerce Ukraine into  helping him cheat in the election. I would be happy to go chapter and  verse if you would like me to use your time that way.   Right now, though, the subject of this amendment is to allow the  General Accountability Office, the GAO, to help Congress oversee  aspects of the intelligence community, but if you are more interested--
