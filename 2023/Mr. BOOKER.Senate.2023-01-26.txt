 Mr. President, I really appreciate you recognizing me for  a moment. We are about to adjourn the Senate. Many Senators will travel  back to their home States to do work, to meet with constituents, to go  forward, but something is happening tomorrow that I wanted to  recognize, which is the graduation of this class of Senate pages.   Many people watch the functioning of the Senate, and what draws  attention is not many of the people that do the work of this place. We  have an incredible parliamentary staff. We have incredible people that  serve the different caucuses. We have incredible people who provide  security for this place who often don't get the attention they deserve.   Senators come and go, but one thing that stays consistent is the  incredible human beings, the patriots who make this place work.   I am humbled every day to meet people who so love the institution of  the Senate that they have chosen to serve it, and I am sure you can  agree with me: They are not doing it for the pay, and they are not  doing it for the glory. They do it for the love of country, and,  especially, in particular, the love of this institution.   There is another group, though, that does come and go that I think  play a very special role here, and that is about twice a year--then  there are some summer pages--we see the pages come in from all over the  country to serve this institution in a way that has been done for  generations.   And what is remarkable about them, in their suits, is that they are  not young adults, they are teenagers who have made an irrational  choice, in my opinion. They have decided to leave their high schools,  their comfort, their technological devices, their extracurricular  activities, their sports teams, their homes, and come and live in  Washington, DC, where the rigors of their lives are extraordinary.   Literally, our Senate pages, during the two sessions that are during  the year, they are doing a full class of academics. They actually are  studying difficult topics that--I am not sure how Senators would do on  calculus or chemistry, but they are taking a full load of classes, and  then they are working the equivalent of a full-time job.   And at times, they are up at 5 in the morning, and then they service  this institution. And the jobs they do, I would say, are essential. In  fact, if they were not here--the people that would have to do those  jobs--the Senate would have to hire people to fill those roles.   During my 10 years in the Senate, I have to say, I have met some  remarkable young people. They call them Democratic and Republican  pages, but there is no partisanship here. These are patriots first who  probably ascribe to many different ideals and parties and dependents  and what have you, but when they are here, they are participating in  the Senate.   I often say to Senate pages, it is an honor to have served in the  U.S. Senate with you, and I mean that very meaningfully when I talk to  them.   Now, on a personal note, I have to say the Senate pages adore me. I  tell horrible jokes. I make it a goal to try to embarrass them on the  floor of the Senate as often as I can. I try to get them to encroach  the rules--never break them, just encroach them. But during the course  of my time here, I have watched some of these young people blow me away  with their intellect and their acumen, with their dedication and their  knowledge, but, most importantly, with their hearts.   I look at this class of pages right now as they are about to graduate  and go on to do incredible things in life. How do I know this? With 10  years in this body, I bump into pages every once in a while. They try  their best to pretend like they don't know me, but I call them out, and  I see them doing great things.   I now know Senate pages who have gone off to college, who have  graduated from college, who have now gone into the work world and  continue to distinguish themselves, not by having a common experience  of serving in the Senate but having taken the inspiration of working in  this body into their work as American citizens and living a life of  committed patriotism.   And so to this class, I just want to say to you as well: It has been  an honor to serve this institution with you. You all are some of the  best of our Nation. You have shown a grit and guts while you were here,  handling your coursework and the demands. You have dealt with sometimes  the indignities of being treated like you are wallpaper. But the truth  of the matter is, you guys have risen in service through your course  and your experience here.   For that, on behalf of this entire body, I want to give you my  thanks.  [[Page S129]]  And I want to encourage you to think of yourselves as always a part of  this body. Lots of people have passed through here. We have had former  pages become U.S. Senators. We have former pages that sit on that dais  now. I hope you will always consider this not just your Capitol, but  also your community. And I look forward to seeing you all about in the  world, and I hope for old times' sake, you will at least let me tell  you one bad ``dad'' joke.   With that, I ask unanimous consent to submit a list of names of the  pages to the record.   And I would like the Congressional Record to say that the junior  Senator from New Jersey told them that they are great people, but they  need better senses of humor.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Lynn Egan, Kyle Feitler, Teddy Heffernan, Tess Belisle,       Garrett Bumps, Xavier Cardenas, Ian Chung, Alex Funk, Julia       Lanczycki, Michael Martinez, Kayla Meredith, Madi Paige, Diya       Sethi, Emmy Ward, Charlie Fruge, Riley McCain, Sophia Shenk,       Cooper Stillick, Eleanor Ague, Avery Buchanan, Deanara       Castro, Tucker Coombs, Mackenzie Horton, Abby Redfearn, John       Stimpson, Wyn Winter.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:09 p.m., adjourned until  Monday, January 30, 2023, at 3 p.m.                            ____________________
