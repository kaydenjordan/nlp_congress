 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the rule and the underlying bill.   Climate change is the greatest, the greatest, and most urgent  challenge of our time and this government should never put corporate  profits and those kinds of concerns ahead of the health and safety of  our children and our future.   Climate change isn't just a Democratic or a Republican issue. It is  an existential issue for our species on this planet.   I am hearing so many mischaracterizations of what the Paris accord  is. These standards that are applied to the United States are not from  the outside, not coming from across the pond. We agree to reduce carbon  emissions on our own terms. Every country develops its own plan and its  own program.   This issue about jobs is just ridiculous. Everyone understands that  our future is not in the fossil fuel industry. The future is in the  green technologies that are being developed by entrepreneurs. Young  people get it. The 21st century jobs of the future are clean  technologies that make sure our planet is good and that entrepreneurs  can actually succeed.   The costs of not doing this right now are so enormous. We are seeing,  practically every year, what are called 500-year floods. They are only  supposed to happen once every 500 years, and now we are seeing State  after State, in my own Midwest, under water, and it happens all the  time.    What is the cost that we are bearing in all of our  States and at the Federal level to mitigate the problems that are  caused by climate change? And I want to just say to my colleagues:  These words are on the Record. You might want to consider not  embarrassing your children and your grandchildren and future  generations of yours with making the kinds of statements you are.
