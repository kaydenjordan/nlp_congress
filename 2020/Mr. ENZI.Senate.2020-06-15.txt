 Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Great American  Outdoors Act and on the fact that this legislation will add over $17  billion to our deficit over the next 10 years.   When I first rose to speak on this bill and on my amendment to it, I  closed by saying that if we could not pay for even a portion of this  bill, then we were in worse trouble than I had thought. Sadly, I rise  today, knowing that we, apparently, want such trouble.   During this fiscal year, we have already run up a deficit of $1.9  trillion--more than twice the size of the deficit we ran at the same  time last year. We also just added $2.4 trillion to our debt as the  Nation necessarily responded to the coronavirus pandemic.   For the past 2 years, I have been working on and consistently  suggesting a way to responsibly pay for deferred maintenance at our  national parks. I love our national parks and have fond memories of  visiting our first national park, Yellowstone, and many other parks  when I was younger and still today. That is why I offered my amendment  that would have created a paid-for legacy restoration fund that would  have ensured permanently dedicated revenue for our parks and their  maintenance needs.   For the longest time, I was told that my spending concerns would be  addressed when the bill moved out of committee. When the bill moved to  the floor, I asked that my amendment be included in the substitute or  that it receive a vote. It was not included, and we did not receive a  vote.   While my amendment did not address it, I would also mention that many  of my colleagues regularly express concern about how we increasingly  have moved discretionary spending to mandatory spending. This bill does  just that with the Land and Water Conservation provisions.   Mandatory spending is always renewed and never voted on or evaluated  again. When the Land and Water Conservation Fund was permanently  authorized at the start of this Congress, we were told that its  spending would remain subject to appropriations and the oversight that  goes with that. Instead, we are taking away that protection and  increasing mandatory spending even more without increasing revenue.  That means more additional national debt each year without a single  vote.   So here we are today, asking future generations to pay for what we  are not even willing to consider paying for when we could have  responsibly funded the maintenance provisions. We won't even consider  my amendment that would have a modest charge to foreign visitors as  part of their visa fees to help to address this issue, and that is  revenue that will be lost forever from the tourists because we can only  collect the fees when they buy visas. The revenues cannot be collected  retroactively. If we won't pay for even a part of the bill, what will  we pay for?   Congress must stop with gimmick spending, wherein we attempt to spend  the same money twice. That is what this bill does. If we keep adding  new mandatory spending without adding new revenue, Congress will be  forced at some point to eliminate mandatory spending or to get new  funding streams that survive well into the future. Mandatory spending  is the portion of our bill that will be covered by this that we will  not vote on. We will not take a look at it again. They say, yes, there  will be oversight--not on whether we spend it, not on where the money  comes from. There will not be another opportunity on that. Therefore, I  oppose this legislation and oppose adding to the already massive debt  burden being placed on future generations and the increase in mandatory  spending when the solution to charge foreigners is available.                                Point of Order    Mr. President, the pending amendment, No. 1617, would violate the  Senate pay-go rule by increasing the on-budget deficit. Therefore, I  raise a point of order against this measure pursuant to section 4106(a)  of H. Con. Res. 71, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal  Year 2018.   I yield the floor.
