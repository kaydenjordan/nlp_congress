 Madam Speaker, on January 20, Hoosiers will  celebrate a big milestone. Indiana University will turn 200 and share  those 200 years of academic excellence and notable achievements with  the whole world.   For 200 years, Indiana University has provided top learning  opportunities to Hoosiers and out-of-staters alike, with countless job  opportunities to those in the Bloomington area. It is world-renowned  for programs like the Jacobs School of Music, the Kelley School of  Business, and Hoosier basketball.   Since its establishment in 1820, Hoosiers have graduated from IU and  gone off to change the world. Indiana's faculty and alumni include  Rhodes scholars, Nobel laureates, Olympic medalists, and Pulitzer Prize  winners, just to name a few.   IU's bicentennial will be celebrated on campus in Bloomington by  alumni across the globe and through immense contributions every single  day that the Hoosiers at Indiana University make.   Big Red 200 is a new supercomputer whose name reflects our  bicentennial and the common ``Go Big Red'' cheer played at football and  basketball games. Big Red 200 is the fourth in IU's Big Red computer  series and is on pace to become the fastest university-owned  supercomputer in the Nation.   As a member of the House Financial Services Task Force on Artificial  Intelligence, I have seen the exciting opportunities America has to  invest in AI transform a number of sectors like healthcare and  financial services through that continued data sciences research, and I  am confident that IU will be at the forefront.   Madam Speaker, I extend congratulations on 200 years, and I look  forward to the next 200 years of academic excellence.                            ____________________
