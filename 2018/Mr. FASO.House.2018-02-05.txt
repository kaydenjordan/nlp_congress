 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I may hereafter  be considered to be the first sponsor of H.R. 1057, a bill originally  introduced by Representative Tiberi of Ohio, for the purposes of adding  cosponsors and requesting reprintings pursuant to clause 7 of rule XII.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.                            ____________________
