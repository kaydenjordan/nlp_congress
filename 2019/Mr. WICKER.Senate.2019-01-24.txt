 Madam President, I was going to ask the distinguished  Democratic leader to have yielded under his reservation.   Might I be recognized for just a moment? The objection has already  been heard, and we will not get this done.    Madam President, I appreciate the Senator from Louisiana.   His unanimous consent request would have done one simple thing-- gotten the uniformed servicemembers in the Coast Guard paid just like  we are paying today for members of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and  Marines. The Coast Guard members are the only servicemen out there now  who, under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, are required to  perform their duties under pain of penalty, and they are not being paid  as the others are. It would also protect survivors' benefits for the  retirees and their survivors in the Coast Guard, as is being done with  the other uniformed services.   We may be getting close to a solution on this. I certainly hope so.  In the meantime, I think it would be a significant gesture on the part  of the Democrats and the Republicans in this Senate and in the House of  Representatives to pass this one small change that the President has  said he will sign and to do the right thing by paying members of this  uniformed service. I regret that the Senator has objected, and I  appreciate at least having a chance to explain why this mere carve-out  is different from a larger solution that may be coming soon.
