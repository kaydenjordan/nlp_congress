 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I have come to the floor many times,  and I come to the floor today to say something straightforward.  Healthcare is personal, not political. Despite all the debates,  everything that has gone on around healthcare, for every family in  Michigan and across the country and for every one of us, healthcare is  personal, not political.   If your child gets sick in the middle of the night and needs to be  taken to the emergency room, you don't care who the doctor voted for in  the last Presidential election.   If you are diagnosed with cancer or a chronic condition, you are more  interested in receiving the care you need than the ins and outs of the  insurance plan that provides that care.   If your mom or dad needs to move into a nursing home, you want to  make sure they are happy and that they are treated well, regardless of  the specific Medicaid reimbursement rate.   Healthcare is personal to each and every one of us, not political,  and it affects each and every one of us, whether we watch MSNBC, CNN,  FOX News, or don't turn on the television.   That is why, when this administration and Republicans in Congress try  to take away people's healthcare over and over and over again, I take  it personally. You know who else takes it personally? The American  people. Certainly, I know the people of Michigan do.   Back in November, they sent a message at the ballot box.  Unfortunately, the administration and Republicans in Congress missed  the message. They could be working across the aisle right now to expand  access to care and improve quality and reduce costs. This is something  I work to do all the time. Instead, they are, once again, trying to  take away your healthcare.   If you don't believe me, just take a look at President Trump's  budget. This administration wants to pay for a huge tax giveaway for  the wealthiest among us by taking away people's healthcare.   Let me say that again.   They are asking us to pay for a budget-busting tax giveaway for the  wealthy by taking healthcare away from people who depend on Medicare  and Medicaid. Many of us, when this tax bill passed, said that when  they were creating almost $2 trillion in deficit, watch out because the  next thing will be a discussion to say: Oh. Oh my gosh. We have a big  deficit. We have to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and  the other things that directly affect people, with healthcare at the  top of the list.   So what happens? Well, the Trump budget would cut $800 billion from  Medicare over the next 10 years. That is taking away healthcare from  our seniors, people with disabilities. The Trump budget would cut $1.5  trillion from Medicaid over the next 10 years. That is taking  healthcare away from half of all the babies born in America who are  covered by Medicaid--them and their moms. That is taking healthcare  away from two in three seniors who get their nursing home care from  Medicaid healthcare. That is taking away healthcare from everyone who  has benefited from expanding Medicaid, including low-income, minimum- wage working people, working families, including more than 650,000  people in my State of Michigan covered by a very successful program  called Healthy Michigan.   Ninety-seven percent of Michigan children can see a doctor when they  get sick or hurt now because of what has happened with Michigan, with  Healthy Michigan and other coverage, and the number of people treated  without insurance has dropped 50 percent, which means instead of folks  dropping into the emergency room who can't pay and everybody else's  insurance rates go up to pay for it, people now have their own  insurance, and those costs have dropped by 50 percent--the number of  people walking in without insurance.   What has that meant for the State of Michigan? Taxpayers had more  than $400 million back into the budget in the State of Michigan last  year because of the savings because of Healthy Michigan.   We should be building on this progress. Instead, Republicans are,  once again, trying to take your healthcare away.   Between 2010 and 2018, the Republican majority in Congress voted to  repeal or weaken the Affordable Care Act more than 70 times--70--with  no replacement. Now the Trump administration has stepped in to help  because they weren't successful in Congress. We were able to stop that  because people rose up and said: My healthcare is personal not  political. People from across the country engaged and we were able to  stop it in Congress. So now the Trump administration has stepped in to  do a number of things to sabotage the Affordable Care Act.   Look at what has happened in the last year. Last February, the Trump  administration announced it would provide funding to States that want  to let insurance plans cover fewer services, encouraging fewer services  to be covered.   Last April, they issued a rule that, among other things, allowed  insurers  [[Page S2224]]  to hike premiums 15 percent without justification.   In June and August, they expanded access to Association Health Plans  and what are called short-term plans, which we also call junk health  plans because they are a lot cheaper, but they don't cover much, and  people don't realize that until they get sick. These plans don't have  to cover prescription drugs or mental health or maternity care.   By the way, as the person who led that fight in the Senate Finance  Committee, I can tell you that the vast majority of insurance plans  prior to the Affordable Care Act did not cover maternity care and  prenatal care, which is pretty basic as part of healthcare for women.  Remember when being a woman was considered a preexisting condition?  That is what we meant. These plans are bringing that back, which means  if you are a woman, you have to pay more to be able to get basic  healthcare, and that is wrong. We did away with that 10 years ago.   In July, the Trump administration slashed funding for programs that  help people enroll in health insurance coverage and began steering  people toward the junk plans. So instead of giving people information  through healthcare.gov and encouraging people to find out what would be  the cheapest plan that would be effective and cover what they need,  they made it harder to sign up for comprehensive coverage and pushed  people toward these junk plans.   In October, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced  that healthcare.gov would be shut down for 60 hours during open  enrollment season for ``maintenance,'' so you couldn't even get online  to be able to sign up for more affordable, comprehensive insurance that  actually would cover things you and your family need.   In November, the Trump administration released information for States  on how they could use waivers to undermine consumer protections.  Consumer protections are things like not getting dropped if you get  sick. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, so many times people said to  me: I have paid for insurance all my life and never needed it. I  finally need it, and I got dropped after I got sick. What do you mean  it only covers 1 day in the hospital or doesn't cover maternity care?  What do you mean the insurance company can cap the number of cancer  treatments I need? Isn't that up to my doctor?   Well, it is now, and it has been under the Affordable Care Act.  Instead, we are in a situation where they are trying to get States to  waive consumer protections and put decisions back in the hands of  insurance companies.   Thanks to all of this sabotage, it is estimated that comprehensive  health insurance costs 16.6 percent more this year than it otherwise  would.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my statement,  which will be about 2 minutes.    Thank you very much.   It is estimated that comprehensive health insurance costs 16.6  percent more this year than it otherwise would because of all of this  sabotage, upheaval, and chaos in the healthcare markets.   In case those sabotage attempts were too subtle, last week the  Department of Justice announced that it agrees--the Trump  administration now agrees with the Federal judge in Texas who said that  the entire Affordable Care Act must be struck down. There would be no  more coverage for preexisting conditions, no more consumer protections,  no more capacity to have your child on your insurance until age 26, no  more capacity to be able to expand what we are doing for minimum wage  workers, et cetera.   In other words, if they can't take away your health insurance through  the legislative process, they are trying to do it now through the  courts, which also goes to what is happening now in terms of changing  the rules so they can more quickly put judges through and pack the  courts with folks who will agree with taking away people's healthcare.   What is the Republican alternative to the ACA? Unfortunately, these  folks still don't have one. Don't worry. President Trump now says that  he is going to have a ``really great'' healthcare plan after he is  reelected in 2020. Just wait.   By the way, to emphasize the fact that Senate Republicans support  what President Trump is doing, they passed a budget resolution out of  committee last week through a partisan vote--only Republican votes-- that includes repeal of the Affordable Care Act with no replacement in  place.   In the meantime, the Affordable Care Act could be struck down by the  courts, and more than 20 million people who gained health coverage  through the Affordable Care Act could be out of luck.   Let me say, in conclusion, that just this week I heard from one of  those 20 million people. Lisa from Norton Shores graduated with a  marketing degree in the middle of a recession and worked a low-wage job  at the local hospital for 8 years. When a part-time, temporary job  opened up at a local marketing agency, the Affordable Care Act allowed  Lisa to take the job and get the experience she needed for a career in  her field. She was able to get healthcare separately from her job. That  job led to another marketing job with a local company--this one with  benefits.   A few years later, the original marketing agency offered Lisa a full- time job. Once again, the ACA allowed her to take it. Lisa wrote this:         It was only through the Affordable Care Act that I have       been able to pull myself up to be a contributing member of       society. It has allowed me to rise to my capabilities.    She added that if the ACA is overturned, ``I will have to leave this  job for a position that includes health insurance. It would kill this  awesome small business I work for. . . . This will be a top priority  for me when I vote in 2020.''   Lisa and millions of other people are sending a message. The only  question is, Are folks listening?   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
