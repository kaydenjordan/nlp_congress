 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of  a well-known and generous man from Davenport, Iowa. Mike Duffy passed  away peacefully on January 21 surrounded by his loved ones.   For the overwhelming majority of his life, Mike called Davenport  home. He began working at the age of 11 and did not stop until his  retirement. He helped his father, John, grow the family business, Per  Mar Security, into an Iowa institution.   Mike worked a number of jobs throughout his life, and he always  treated everyone from all walks of life with equal respect. That is  just who Mike was, and he has made the lives of everyone around him  better because of it.   Mike's long list of accomplishments include being recognized by the  Iowa Business Hall of Fame, the Quad Cities Area Junior Achievement  Hall of Fame, and the Security Industry Hall of Fame. Mike served the  Quad Cities around the clock, serving on multiple boards and  committees, including the Davenport Chamber of Commerce, St. Ambrose  University, and the Handicapped Development Center, just to name a few.   Even at his visitation, his employees told his wife, Linda, about his  selfless service in delivering the Sunday paper to them for the  coupons, even though he read it online. Mike worked his entire life to  support his family, his friends, and his community.   Mike's wife, Linda; their children; and 31 grandchildren are in my  prayers.                            ____________________
