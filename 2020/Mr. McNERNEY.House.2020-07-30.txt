 Mr. Speaker, my amendment would increase and decrease  by $5 million the NSF Research and Related Activities budget to support  a National Academy of Sciences study on approaches and procedures for  creating and assessing congressional district maps.   The mathematical community has focused on the theory of district map  drawing and can now provide fair and unbiased methods of creating and  evaluating district maps.   Recent court rulings have shown that objective statistical evidence  can be  [[Page H4128]]  used to assess whether district maps have been drawn in an overly  partisan manner. These rulings which have continually found  congressional and State legislative districts in States across the  country to be too partisan highlight the need for an impartial,  unbiased system of creating and assessing district maps. My amendment  would fund a study to define best practices for creating fair  congressional districts and be in compliance with the Voting Rights Act  of 1965.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her hard work  on the appropriations bill this year. It is never easy. This year is  even harder. I thank, not only the chairwoman, but all the members of  the committee. I thank them for their work, and I thank the chairwoman  for including my amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to division B of  H.R. 7617.   This amendment is critical to advancing our Nation's competitiveness  in artificial intelligence. It will require the National Science  Foundation to examine, including through workshops, and to publish  findings on the following:    First, which universities are putting out significant peer reviewed  AI research, including based on quantity and number of citations;   Second, for each of the identified universities, what specific  factors enabled their AI research, including computing power, data  sets, and availability, specialized curriculum, and industry and other  partnerships; and   Third, how universities not included in this list could implement  these factors to produce AI research as well as  [[Page H4133]]  case studies that universities can look to as examples and potential  pilot programs that the Federal Government could develop or support to  help universities produce AI research.   AI research is critical to our Nation's competitiveness in artificial  intelligence. We need to have a competitive spirit if we want to  compete with China and other countries.   Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the AI Caucus, I am proud that this  important amendment has received strong bipartisan support. I urge all  of my colleagues to support it.    Madam Speaker, first I want to thank the chair and the  ranking member for their hard work in considering all these amendments.   Madam Speaker, my amendment would increase and decrease by $15  million DOE's Energy Information Administration budget to stimulate  more robust data collection and analysis from their commercial and  residential surveys, specifically with regards to water consumption, as  well as to make water consumption data for commercial buildings  available to the public, broken down by principal building activity and  by region.   Our energy and water systems are interdependent.   As water scarcity, availability, and uncertainty become more  prominent, the U.S. energy system risks exposure to potential  associated vulnerabilities.   Therefore, it is time for a more integrated approach to address the  challenges and opportunity of the energy-water nexus.   My amendment aims to assist us in that process by encouraging the EIA  to modify and improve their existing data collection and analysis  programs, enabling us to better collect and utilize energy-water data.   I urge adoption of this amendment.                                time  1415
