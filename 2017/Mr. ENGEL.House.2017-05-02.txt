 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation, and let me  start by thanking our chairman on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Ed  Royce from California. His personal commitment to this important issue  is reflected by his long track record and leadership in crafting the  legislation before us today. We have had innumerable talks about North  Korea and the threat through the years. Ed Royce has always been there  at the forefront in this very important issue.   I am proud to be the lead Democratic cosponsor of the bill. We stand  on the floor today speaking in a unified, bipartisan voice about the  threat that North Korea and the Kim regime pose to the United States,  to our friend and allies, and to peace and stability across the globe.   Already, Mr. Speaker, North Korea poses a potentially catastrophic  danger to our closest allies in Northeast Asia: Japan and South Korea.  With each passing day, the reclusive regime in Pyongyang continues to  make progress on nuclear and ballistic missile technology that could  reach American soil.   This isn't a laughing matter. This isn't a matter about something  that might happen. This is a matter about something that will happen,  unless we take steps to prevent it from happening.   American administrations of both parties have tried and failed to  curb the dangerous behavior of the Kim regime. Before Kim, you had his  father and his grandfather before him. There is plenty of blame to go  around for how we got here, but rehashing past mistakes won't get us  anywhere. Instead, the United States and other global powers need to  focus on this challenge before it is too late.   However, I fear that the administration's inconsistency in recent  weeks has thrown fuel to the fire. We have seen the White House blow  hot and cold on the potential for talks with Pyongyang. We have seen  careless rhetoric alienate South Korea, a critical ally whose  partnership is essential in trying to contain North Korea.   One week we see saber rattling toward North Korea, including the  false claim that an aircraft carrier battle group was headed toward the  Korean Peninsula, and the next week, the President saying he would be  ``honored'' to meet with ``smart cookie'' Kim Jong-un, the latest in a  long list of totalitarian strongmen who seem to have won the  President's admiration.   We are sending mixed signals, Mr. Speaker, and the world is taking  notice. Inconsistency on national security matters is not a foreign  policy strategy that will succeed. When America appears confused or  unmoored, it emboldens our adversaries and gives our friends and allies  pause. When we are talking about nuclear weapons, there is simply no  margin for error.   Fortunately, in this Congress, our priorities are clear: work with  China and our close partners in the region and dial up pressure on the  Kim regime to return to the negotiating table.   Last year, under Chairman Royce's leadership, we passed a sanctions  bill that President Obama signed into law.   Kim Jong-un is exceedingly crafty: his regime is becoming  increasingly effective at invading international sanctions.   When we make sanctions tougher, they come up with new ways to get  around them: phony bank accounts, fake companies overseas, shipments  under foreign flags.   We need to go back to the well to close the loopholes that the regime  exploits. That is what this measure does. It dials up sanctions on  those who do business with the Kim regime, hopefully, making them think  twice before providing cover to one of the most brutal human rights  abusers in the world and the nuclear ambitions of the leader of that  country.   If you buy certain materials like metals or minerals from North  Korea, if you sell fuel that the North Korean military can use, if you  have a role in maintaining overseas bank accounts or insuring the ships  Pyongyang uses to evade the law, then you are going to get caught up in  these new sanctions.   If you ignore the U.N.'s limits on important North Korean coal or  iron, or try to buy cheap textiles or fishing rights from the  government, or help the Kim regime conduct business online, you will be  subject to additional scrutiny with this legislation.   With this bill, we will target those who use North Korean forced  labor, a gross human rights abuse and a cash cow for the regime. We  will consider limiting certain types of assistance to countries buying  or selling American equipment to Pyongyang.   In light of the recent public assassination of Kim's half brother,  and other nefarious activities, we require the State Department to take  a hard look at whether North Korea should be put back on the State  Sponsors of Terrorism list.   The Kim regime must be made to understand that we will not back down  in our effort to cut off support for its dangerous activities. Every  time they cut another corner, we will put up another roadblock. We will  come after them again and again until they realize there is no option  but to sit down and negotiate.   As we have seen, it won't be an easy process. Making real progress on  complex global issues rarely is. Reckless threats and bombastic talk  usually make matters worse, especially when you are dealing with an  unpredictable and impulsive leader.   The stakes are very high. No one wants to see war on the Korean  Peninsula, least of all the 25 million people in Seoul and the nearly  30,000 United States troops who are in Pyongyang's sights every single  day.   We need to remain focused, with clarity of purpose, in order to get  the results we all want. This bipartisan bill builds on our record in  the House of grappling with this challenge. I am  [[Page H3034]]  glad to join with Chairman Royce in this effort. I fully support this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman), the ranking member of the Asia and the  Pacific Subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, before I call on the next speaker, I want to  talk to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson). When we went on  that trip to North Korea, I am sure that he will remember that he took  a clandestine picture of a big billboard that was in Pyongyang showing  a North Korean soldier with a bayonet sticking through an American  soldier's head. So the propaganda and the anti-American  [[Page H3035]]  rhetoric is ingrained, it is taught, and it was very disconcerting. I  remember the gentleman sitting in the front of the bus very  clandestinely taking that picture so no one would know. It was really a  good thing to do. I want to thank the gentleman.    I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Keating), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade of the Committee on Foreign  Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), my friend, co-chair of the Korea Caucus, and a  respected member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Castro), co-chair of the Japan Caucus, a very respected member of  our Committee on Foreign Affairs, and a member of the Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining on both  sides?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Frankel), a very respected and hardworking member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and I  want to close the way I opened. I want to again thank Chairman Royce  for authoring this measure and for his hard work.   One of the things I have been most proud about as the ranking member  of the Foreign Affairs Committee is the collaborative work that the  chairman and I have done together in passing so many bills with both  our names. It is what the American people want us to do, and I think  the Foreign Affairs Committee is a great example of how the American  people want Congress to work together. This bill is exactly a product  of that, of working together.   If we want to pressure the Kim regime and if we want to prevent a  potentially devastating conflict in Northeast Asia, we cannot be  impulsive. The risks are too high. We need a strong, focused, and  consistent policy. We need  [[Page H3037]]  strong measures that cut off support for the Kim regime and careful  diplomacy to bring the relevant players together. This bill represents  an important part of such a policy.   So, again, as I said, I am glad we are advancing this measure with  strong bipartisan support, and I hope the other body will take up this  legislation soon.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
