 I think we all know that we are a nation of immigrants,  but we are also a nation of the rule of law. As President Reagan once  said years ago, ``A nation that cannot control its borders is not a  nation.'' We are very rapidly moving there.   At this very moment, we don't have control of our southern border.  Tens of thousands of migrants are marching, waiting, and illegally  crossing our borders every day with tens of thousands more well on  their way.   We are witnessing one of the worst humanitarian crises in the history  of our Nation. Migrants are dying from starvation, from disease, from  lack of water. Women and children are being trafficked and they are  being abused.   Our administration knew this was coming, yet they have no plan.   How irresponsible is that?   With title 42 set to expire tonight and no concrete plan in place to  handle this situation, we are facing a crisis of epic proportions. This  crisis will result in communities suffering, migrants suffering, and  our Nation suffering, but it isn't too late. It still isn't too late.   We can secure our borders and we can protect our citizens. It will  take leadership and a willingness to reject talking points and a  willingness to do what is best for our Nation and for our people, and  right now it is the House Republicans who are standing up and they are  the ones making the effort.   This bill restarts the border wall. It hires more CBP agents. It ends  incentives to abuse unaccompanied minors.  [[Page H2272]]  It ends catch and release. It reinstates the remain in Mexico policy.   We need action from our leaders, real leaders. We need action from  our elected officials and actions from those who have the power to make  a difference.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from California for bringing this  forward.
