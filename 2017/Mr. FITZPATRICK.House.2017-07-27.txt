 Mr. Speaker, with the fall season fast approaching,  Bucks County's robust agricultural community is in full swing with the  impending harvests, summer fairs, community projects, and recognition  of the important work of the American farm family.   In a few weeks, Bucks County will celebrate their 69th annual  Middletown Grange Fair. From Wednesday, August 16, through Sunday,  August 20, attendees from across our community  [[Page H6472]]  will have the amazing opportunity to come together to enjoy live  entertainment, timeless carnival rides, tons of local food, animal  demonstrations, and 4-H projects on display.   Crowds will gather to see the antique equipment competition and  exhibits in hundreds of categories ranging from a variety of  vegetables, tomatoes, fresh flowers, and livestock to handcrafted  quilts, jewelry, and woodwork.   Mr. Speaker, as an annual attendee, I have seen firsthand how the  Grange Fair brings our community together to enjoy the refreshing  success of our local agricultural community. It is an event that helps  people gain a better appreciation of the importance of agriculture and  how the agricultural industry sustains our local economy--not to  mention all of the jobs that it creates.   We love our farmers in Bucks County. They have contributed so much to  our community. They are an indispensable part of Bucks County's past,  and they will remain an indispensable part of Bucks County's future.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the Morrisville  12U Softball Team. These incredible young athletes from our district  won the Pennsylvania State title and advanced to the regional  tournament in Bristol, Connecticut, to represent the entire State of  Pennsylvania. Not only did these young ladies play an incredible  season, of which they should be extremely proud, they did so while  honoring a member of our community.   The team dedicated their postseason play to the memory of Ms. Donna  Rossi, a committed league volunteer and supporter who passed away  following a battle with cancer shortly before the first district game.  [[Page H6478]]    Mr. Speaker, I am so proud of the accomplishments of these young  ladies: Ainsley McClure; Rowan Mulholland; Katey Brennan; Molly  Milewski; Ella Visco; Laney Freiband; Caitlyn Martell; Ahlana Sesar;  Quinn McGonigle; Emma Hause; Riley Mahony; Hannah Hawkes; Brielle  Crawford; and managers and coaches Joe Sesar, Andy Mahony, and Tim  Hawkes.   Each one of these individuals should be proud of the example they  have set both on and off the field. They do credit to themselves, to  their families, and to our community, and we are so proud of them.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, with my limited time, I just want to  say Brendan said it well. He has done a fabulous job working with  Congressman Meehan and me, all of whom have districts that have been  impacted by this real tragedy, and I stand in full support.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  amendment.
