 Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania for her leadership. Hopefully, we have been able to share  some very important thoughts. I thank her for presiding and leading us  on this very important discussion.   We have a Constitution. I hope that I will be holding the  Constitution in my hand in a short while.   Obviously, Article I is the Congress. We are to represent the people  of this Nation.   Article II is the executive branch.   Article III are supposed to be unfettered, unbiased courts, the  Federal courts. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes all over the  region, all over the Nation. They are what we call Article III courts.   Certainly, there are State courts, and there are county courts, and  there are city courts, but the Federal courts are the place where we  believe that there should be the infrastructure of justice, where I can  come, where no place else, I might find justice. I can even be pro se.  That means, without counsel.   But the laws and the responsibility of the judges, clearly, are to  make me feel that I will be receiving justice.   So it saddens me, as a member of the Bar, and someone who, through  law school, viewed the Federal judiciary in the highest esteem.   I was an Earl Warren training fellow. Earl Warren, the Supreme Court  Justice, Republican, appointed by Eisenhower, I recall, and who  presided over the Brown v. Topeka Board of Education that opened the  doors for many to be able to have an education that was not segregated,  and many other cases that the Court presided over.   But there was something unique that, I believe, that held our  consciousness. We always felt that the courts would render truthful  judgments, or that they would look for the truth, and that they would  discern, between the plaintiff and the defendant, who was telling the  truth; and they would rule in justice and the law for those who told  the truth.   I hold in my hand the Constitution that also includes the Declaration  of Independence, where we all are created equal, with certain  inalienable rights, of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   I loved what the Founding Fathers said: The power under the  Constitution will always be in the people and it is entrusted for  certain defined purposes.   It is important to note that even though the men who have said these  words were not perfect, the words epitomize who we are; that no matter  who you are, what ``unempowerment'' you may have, you should have power  in the courts. You should have power in this country, by the very  essence of the Constitution.   So I watched with intensity, as a Member of this body, and as a  senior member of the Judiciary Committee, all of the confirmation  hearings where they were selecting a United States Supreme Court  Justice.   What struck me most of all, to the last two Justices before Justice  Ketanji Brown Jackson, is the questioning after questioning to ask  them, was Roe v. Wade sound law?   Was Roe v. Wade precedent?   Was Roe v. Wade, for them, a standard of the whole question of  precedent that is a basic premise, tenet, basic foundation of the  justice that we look to have rendered; that we can count on the Supreme  Court's decision; whether it is Brown v. Topeka Board of Education-- maybe that is not solid law, that you can no longer segregate,  discriminate in education at all levels; break the chains of  segregation in the one-story, one-room schoolhouse with no books, for  the Colored children, the Negro children, the Black children, in that  instance, which the South proceeded to try and go around by having  these private schools.   So, your whole life is around getting justice; and Roe v. Wade was to  indicate a stop to back-alley abortions; women dying; being maligned  and disgraced; maybe not able to have children ever again. We were able  to perceive that that was really a medical decision, and it was a  decision that a woman's faith, doctor, and family would help her make;  that no one could police your body; that Roe v. Wade was the law of the  land.   Yet, in a matter of months--I thought it was just simply seconds-- puff went Roe v. Wade, even in spite of the testimony of the two  Justices promoted to the Supreme Court by the former President of the  United States that, over and over again, in answer to the question,  they said, Roe v. Wade was precedent. That it was the law of the land.   They were under oath, and they did not tell the truth because what  happened is that when the Dobbs case came, they immediately jumped to  their personal views, their personal beliefs, their personal dislikes,  their personal cause and crusade, and ruled abortion, as defined by the  Ninth Amendment, of which Roe v. Wade was based on, the right to  privacy, unconstitutional.   I don't even know how that could be.                                time  1800    And States like Texas followed with the most heinous of abortion laws  that you could ever imagine, criminalizing providers and criminalizing  women; creating a havoc in our State; people having to flee across  State lines because they could not get the honest and safe medical  treatment needed, that was dictated by their physician, their  healthcare provider; threatening healthcare providers; threatening  Planned Parenthood; threatening clinics; misinterpreting medical  procedures as abortions.   I, frankly, believe this MAGA extremism is the very reason why the  great tsunami that was expected in the 2022 election did not happen.  They did not pay attention to, in 2021, 861 women died of maternal  causes in the United States. In the U.S., two-thirds of those  pregnancy-related deaths were preventable, and for every pregnancy- related death, there are 70 pregnancy-related near-death experiences.   It is extremely important that we tell it like it is: Women fleeing  to get healthcare; doctors being arrested; nurses being arrested, under  law, because of Dodd; and, of course, women themselves being  threatened.   Let me just read some headlines that came about through this Dodd  decision where the Justices would not adhere to the truth and the  honesty of their testimony during confirmation hearings under oath  where they said that Roe v. Wade was precedent.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article entitled: ``Five  women sued Texas over abortion access.''                       [From BBC News, Mar. 9, 2023]                 Five Women Sue Texas Over Abortion Access                            (By Holly Honderich)         Ms. Zurawski spent three days in intensive care, leaving       the hospital after a week, the legal action says. The ordeal       has made it harder for her to conceive in future, she said.        The four other women had to travel outside Texas for an       abortion.        One of the plaintiffs, Ms. Miller, said: ``Healthcare       should not be determined by some politician with no       understanding of medicine or the critical role that abortion       care plays in pregnancy. How is it that I can get an abortion       for a dog but not for me?''        Two of the women's foetuses had conditions that meant they       did not develop a skull, according to the lawsuit.        These cases ``are just tip of the iceberg'', the Center for       Reproductive Justice's Ms, Northup said.        Their 91-page complaint asks for a ruling that clarifies       Texas' law and its stance on ``medical emergencies'' for       pregnant women facing grave health risks.        ``With the threat of losing their medical licences, fines       of hundreds of thousands of dollars, and up to 99 years in       prison lingering over their heads, it is no wonder that       doctors and hospitals are turning patients away--even       patients in medical emergencies,'' the lawsuit reads.        According to a survey by the Pew Research Center conducted       last year, 61% of Americans say abortion should be legal in       all or most circumstances, though the opinion poll found       public support for the procedure fell as a pregnancy       progressed.        Texas' legislature, which is under Republican control, has       been at the forefront of anti-abortion legislation, becoming       the first state to enact a near-total ban.        And the state will be home to another abortion battle soon:       a Texas judge is expected to rule on a case about abortion       pills this week.        The Trump-appointed US District Court Judge Matthew       Kacsmaryk will decide whether Mifepristone--one of the two       drugs used in an abortion pill regime--can continue to be       sold in the US.        Five women who say they were denied abortions in Texas       despite facing life-threatening health risks have sued the       state over its abortion ban.        Texas bars abortions except for medical emergencies, with       doctors facing punishment of up to 99 years in jail.        According to the lawsuit, doctors are refusing the       procedure even in extreme cases out of fear of prosecution.  [[Page H1240]]         In a statement, the office of Attorney General Ken Paxton       said he would ``enforce the laws'' of the state.        Mr, Paxton ``is committed to doing everything in his power       to protect mothers, families, and unborn children'', the       statement said.        The Center for Reproductive Justice has filed the legal       action on behalf of the five women--Ashley Brandt, Lauren       Hall, Lauren Miller, Anna Zargarian and Amanda Zurawski--and       two healthcare providers that are also plaintiffs.        The pro-choice group said it is the first time pregnant       women themselves have taken action against anti-abortion laws       passed across the US since the Supreme Court last year       removed constitutional protection for abortion rights.        ``It is now dangerous to be pregnant in Texas,'' said Nancy       Northup, the centre's president on Tuesday.        With Ms. Northup outside the Texas Capitol in Austin on       Tuesday, the plaintiffs--two pregnant--shared harrowing       stories of their previous, lost pregnancies.        According to the legal action, all were told that their       foetuses would not survive, but were not given the option of       an abortion, which they described as ``standard medical       procedure'' throughout the country and in the state before       Texas' ban came into effect.        Ms. Zurawski, 35, said she had become pregnant after 18       months of fertility treatments. She had just entered her       second trimester when she was told she had dilated       prematurely and that the loss of her foetus, whom she and her       husband had named Willow, was ``inevitable''.        ``But even though we would, with complete certainty, lose       Willow, my doctor could not intervene while her heart was       still beating or until I was sick enough for the ethics board       at the hospital to consider my life at risk,'' Ms. Zurawski       said.        For three days, trapped in a ``bizarre and avoidable       hell'', Ms. Zurawski was forced to wait until her body       entered sepsis--also known as blood poisoning--and doctors       were allowed to perform an abortion, according to the       lawsuit.     Mr. Speaker, one of them could not get care until  they got blood poisoning, when the doctor was willing to see them.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from The Washington  Post: ``Woman says she carried dead fetus for 2 weeks after Texas  abortion ban.''                 [From the Washington Post, July 20, 2022]   Woman Says She Carried Dead Fetus for 2 Weeks After Texas Abortion Ban                             (By Timothy Bella)         Marlena Stell's happiness turned to heartbreak after she       found out about 9\1/2\ weeks into her pregnancy that she had       suffered a miscarriage.        After she was told last year that the fetus did not have a       heartbeat and she no longer had a viable pregnancy, the Texas       woman asked her doctor to perform a dilation and curettage,       or D and C--a standard procedure to remove the fetus       following a miscarriage to help prevent infection or long-      term health problems. Stell had the procedure after her first       miscarriage in 2018 in Washington state, when she felt so       much pain that she could not walk, and she wanted to go       through with it again before trying again for a second child,       she told The Washington Post.        But Stell was even more devastated to learn that because       the procedure is also used during abortions, which a Texas       law had greatly restricted, the doctor did not want to       perform a D and C. Stell would be forced to carry her dead       fetus for two weeks before she could find a provider to give       her the medical intervention that physicians had denied her.        ``My doctor had said that since the heartbeat bill had just       passed, she didn't want me to do a D and C. And she asked       that I try to miscarry at home,'' said Stell, 42, of Conroe,       Tex. ``It just was emotionally difficult walking around,       knowing that I had a dead fetus inside.''        Stell, a beauty influencer with about 1.5 million YouTube       subscribers, is sharing her story in the weeks after the       Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade as a reminder that the       restrictive abortion laws adopted by states such as Texas       could affect those who have suffered miscarriages.        ``People need to understand how these laws affect all       women, even cases like mine,'' she said. ``I feel like it's       very dangerous for government of any type to be intervening       in a woman's care because there's multiple reasons of why she       may need a procedure.''        Stell's story is an example of what physicians and patients       could face when it comes to care for miscarriages and       maternal health almost a month after the Supreme Court's       ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.        As The Post recently reported, doctors in multiple states       say the standard of care for miscarriages, as well as ectopic       pregnancies and other common complications, are being       scrutinized, delayed, or even denied. In Texas--where       Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) is suing the Biden       administration over federal rules requiring abortions to be       provided in medical emergencies to save the life of the       mother--some doctors are reporting that pharmacists have       begun questioning patients who they suspect could be using       their miscarriage medications for abortions.        ``It is traumatizing to stand in a pharmacy and have to       tell them publicly that you are having a miscarriage, that       there is not a heartbeat,'' Rashmi Kudesia, a fertility       specialist in Houston, told The Post on Saturday.        The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists       estimates that more than 1 in 4 pregnancies end in       miscarriage, the spontaneous demise of a fetus that commonly       happen because of chromosomal abnormalities.        The methods of treatment for miscarriage and abortion are       the same. A miscarriage can be treated using a mix of drugs       such as mifepristone and misoprostol, or through a D and C,       which includes dilating the cervix and clearing tissue from       the uterus.        After her initial miscarriage in 2018, Stell and her       husband had their first child, a daughter, in April 2020.       When the couple moved from Washington state to Texas in 2021,       they were trying to have a second child, Stell said, even       though she knew she was at high risk because of her age,       previous health problems and miscarriage. So when she found a       doctor who specialized in high-risk pregnancies last summer,       she was thrilled to find out that the early weeks of her       pregnancy looked promising.        ``I was about 7\1/2\ weeks pregnant, and everything looked       great,'' Stell said. ``The doctor said there was some       movements and fluttering, but everything with the pregnancy       looked normal.''        Because she was at high risk, Stell was asked to come back       about two weeks later for a follow-up appointment in late       September 2021. Because coronavirus-related guidelines       prevented her husband from accompanying her in the room, she       planned to record on her cellphone what the doctor had to say       about the ultrasound.        ``I'm getting ready to record because I'm excited,'' Stell       recalled. ``But as soon as she started the ultrasound, [the       doctor] got really silent, and was just looking and looking       and didn't see the fluttering or the movement or anything.''        Stell got the news she feared: She had lost the pregnancy.       She was told she had a blighted ovum, which is when a       fertilized egg implants in the uterus but does not develop       into an embryo.        She was shocked to learn that the common procedure she got       so easily in Washington state was anything but simply       obtained in Texas. She said she was told she needed       additional proof, or multiple ultrasounds, showing that her       pregnancy was not viable before she could get a D and C. Nine       days into carrying her dead fetus, the sorrow of her first       miscarriage had returned.        ``I felt like a walking coffin,'' she said, fighting       through tears. ``You're just walking around knowing that you       have something that you hoped was going to be a baby for you,       and it's gone. And you're just walking around carrying it.''        Stell eventually found an abortion services provider in       downtown Houston who would give her the D and C on Oct. 4,       2021. After she was met by antiabortion protesters, Stell       opened up about the experience on her YouTube channel. While       Stell, a cosmetic brand owner and CEO, usually talks about       makeup education and other beauty and lifestyle content, the       influencer's video on her miscarriage showed a different       side.        ``I get so angry that I was treated this way because of       laws that were passed by men who have never been pregnant and       never will be,'' Stell told her followers at the time. ``I'm       frustrated, I'm angry, and I feel like the women here deserve       better than that. It doesn't matter what side of the fence       that you want to sit on, laws like this affect all women       regardless of what situation you're in, and it's not right.''        When Roe was overturned last month, Stell said it was her       duty to share her story with those who might have similar       experiences. After Stell told her story to CNN this week,       Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was among those to cite her       as an example of how ``Republican politicians are risking       women's health and safety.''        Stell said on Twitter this week that the experience almost       10 months ago is the reason she and her husband have decided       that they would not try to have additional children in Texas.       She told The Post that her two miscarriages put her at higher       risk for a third.        ``Our fear is that if I get pregnant and miscarry again       that something will happen,'' she said. ``We just do not feel       confident at all that we'll get the care that we need in       Texas if something were to happen.''        If the miscarriage hadn't happened, Stell and her husband       would have had a boy in May. They would have named him Milan.       She thinks about what could have been when she reflects on       her own story, and how she said she was made to feel as       though she had done something wrong when she was already       grieving.        ``It's added trauma on top of trauma,'' she said. ``It's       important to share this story so people know how these laws       affect all women.''     Mr. Speaker, is there freedom in this Nation?  Because of the Texas abortion law, her wanted pregnancy became a  medical nightmare. The truth had been taken away.   ``Texas woman almost dies because she could not get an abortion.''  These are not willing activities. These are not persons who do not have  loving relationships with children. These are not individuals who, in  fact, are, if you will, persons who want to rush for an  [[Page H1241]]  abortion. These are individuals who have had children, who have loving  children at home, but have a right, with their medical provider, to  deal with their medical procedure.   It is important to take note of the fact that what happens in the  courts can truly save lives or cause a loss of life.   In addition to due process under the Fifth Amendment, equal  protection of the law under the 14th Amendment, and the right to  privacy that this little book holds, the courts play a major role.   I thank Congresswoman Lee for leading us in a discussion that  challenges the question of truth, the question of unbiased, unfettered  decisions, and the question of adherence to the Constitution.   Right now, we are living in a land where the precedent of Roe v.  Wade, the right to choose--I never call it the right to an abortion. It  is the right to choose, and the medical procedure that you choose  should never be limited.   How sad that we have this litany of women, only a few of the  thousands impacted because the court refused to adhere to justice and  truth.   We, as Members of Congress, need to be able to be the people's  representatives, and we must find a way to bring dignity and truth and  justice back to our courts.   I, for one, will continue to work to make sure that this is a living  document, the Constitution, and that those who are poor or not can find  their way to a courthouse under Article III and find justice, freedom,  righteousness, and the opportunity to live freely without  discrimination in education, to have civil rights and voting rights,  and to be able to have jurisdiction over your own body as a woman and  to adhere again to a law by the Supreme Court that said, in Roe v.  Wade, that women do have that choice. For me, it is the law of the  land, and Dodd is a masquerading factor of bias and untruth.   Mr. Speaker, I join my Congressional Progressive Caucus Colleagues  here today to speak about the danger that is among us as a result of  far-right rhetoric that has resulted in the take down of women's rights  in America.   Republicans have continuously proven that they want to police women's  bodies and take away our reproductive freedoms.   In the first week of the 118th Congress, extreme Republicans launched  attacks on reproductive freedom, intruding on medical decision-making,  and keeping their promise to criminalize abortion nationwide with no  exceptions.   Now a Texas Federal Judge is attempting to get rid of the much-needed  abortion pill.   Women's health is an issue that is very near to my heart.   With reproductive rights being stripped from us, maternal mortality  at an all-time high, and violence against women that has surged since  the pandemic started, there is growing concern that women's health will  continue to suffer on a massive scale.   This attempt to remove medically necessary health care is a  disgusting misuse of power and it extremely negligent.   Maternal mortality is an issue that continues to plague the United  States health care system.   In 2020, 861 women died of maternal causes in the United States.   In the U.S., two-thirds of those pregnancy related deaths are  preventable and for every pregnancy-related death, there are 70  pregnancy-related near-death experiences.   It's extremely important that we remove barriers in health care that  may be contributing to these deaths.   Maternal mortality is caused by several issues such as cardiovascular  problems, high blood pressure, blood clots, and complications of labor  and delivery.   Maternal mortality is caused by several issues such as cardiovascular  problems, high blood pressure, blood clots, and complications of labor  and delivery. And Black Maternal mortality is a National Health crises.   Women's health is an issue that is very near to my heart. With  reproductive rights being stripped from us, maternal mortality at an  all-time high, and violence against women that has surged since the  pandemic started, there is growing concern that women's health will  continue to suffer on a massive scale.   I thank the Congressional Progressive Caucus colleagues for having me  here today to talk about this important issue.
