 Mr. Speaker, I associate myself with the remarks of my  colleagues regarding our late colleague Don Young, my friend, someone I  worked with on fishing issues, ferry issues, air service issues. He  will be sorely missed.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6865, which makes significant  investments in the extraordinary work of the United States Coast Guard.   I have deep concerns, though, about one provision in the bill  regarding the sole-sourced crewing of foreign vessels needed to  construct the first offshore wind projects in our country. This  language will prevent existing crews from building already planned  offshore wind projects years before the ships can be built and long  before American seamen are trained to take on these jobs.   We all support U.S. jobs, but here at home, this industry is at its  relative infancy. The requirements in this provision will prevent  participation of the existing fleet of vessels needed to begin  construction on these projects while no U.S. alternative exists.   This will cost us jobs, jeopardizing more than 3,600 jobs, largely  union jobs, from the Vineyard Wind project in my district alone and  create years of delays to the building of offshore wind projects with  an estimated 20,000 new jobs across the eastern seaboard.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the chairman to work with me to amend this  language in conference to ensure that the United States does not falter  as we take our first steps into this burgeoning industry, one that will  increase our energy independence, create American jobs, and move us  away from our reliance on fossil fuels.
