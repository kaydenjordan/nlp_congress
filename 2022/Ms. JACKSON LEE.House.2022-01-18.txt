 Madam Speaker, yesterday was the Federal holiday  honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, and I accepted the challenge of the  Martin Luther King family, under the name of Martin Luther King III,  his oldest child: No celebration without legislation.   So I rise in the middle of the debate and debacle that is going on  over an ill-fated and wrong policy of the filibuster and cloture to  read the words of Dr. Martin Luther King that he issued on April 3,  1968, speaking about having been stabbed by a demented woman and saying  that if he had only sneezed, he might not have been there even in 1968.   And so he says: ``And I want to say tonight, I want to say that I am  happy that I didn't sneeze. Because if I had sneezed, I wouldn't have  been around here in 1960 when students all over the South started  sitting in at lunch counters. And I knew that as they were sitting in,  they were really standing up for the best in the American Dream and  taking the whole Nation back to those great wells of democracy which  were dug deep by the Founding Fathers in the Declaration of  Independence and the Constitution. If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have  been around in 1962 when Negroes in Albany, Georgia, decided to  straighten their backs up. And whenever men and women straighten their  backs up, they are going somewhere because a man can't ride your back  unless it is bent. If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been here in 1963  when the Black people of Birmingham, Alabama, aroused the conscience of  this Nation.''   Finally, I want to say that he wanted to make sure that his life was  not in vain and that he would be recognized and remembered for the work  that he had done.                            ____________________
