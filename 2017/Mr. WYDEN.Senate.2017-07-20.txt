 Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I want to  commend my colleague from Connecticut for a very thoughtful speech. I  think he has made the case that the challenge ahead is really a two- part drill--first, to stop something that is especially ill advised,  and second, to then move to a better way that really focuses on  sunlight and bipartisanship. So I thank my colleague for his very  thoughtful comments.
