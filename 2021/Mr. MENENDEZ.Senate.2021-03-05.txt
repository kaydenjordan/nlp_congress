 Madam President, I ask for 1 minute of the 2 minutes.   This provision is providing fundamental fairness so that hospitals in  every State of this country have the resources they need to hire the  best, most qualified providers.   Years ago, CMS came up with an arbitrary formula that excluded a  series of States from a payment policy that intended to benefit all  hospitals so we are not competing for labor unfairly. A bipartisan  policy that began under President Bush continued through multiple  administrations until the Trump administration ended it without  justification.   Making matters worse, our States were at the epicenter of the COVID  crisis. This provision would simply provide parity, and it would do so,  unlike what the Senator is saying, without decreasing payments for any  other State.   This is the fairest way to provide parity that our States need and to  be able to deal with the challenges of getting people at a time in  which we need them the most.    Madam President, I ask for 15 additional seconds.    And there is nothing that makes any other State in this  country more special than our States.                          Vote on Amendment No. 996     Mr. President, colleagues, this amendment is meant for  one purpose and one purpose only and that is to kill the American  Rescue Plan, to kill all the work that has brought us to this moment,  to kill the $1,400 checks to American families that will help them stay  in their homes and put food on the table, to kill the extended  unemployment checks that millions are depending upon us not to let  lapse next week, to kill the ability to put more vaccine in the arms of  our families, to kill the desperate aid that small businesses need to  stay alive, to kill the chance to lift 50 percent of all of those  children in poverty into the sunlit plains of opportunity.   The Senate has already expressed itself today on Keystone. The  committee rule could not accommodate this referral in the timeframe  offered. Enough is enough. It is time to defeat this amendment and pass  the American Rescue Plan.  [[Page S1261]]    I urge my colleagues to vote against it.
