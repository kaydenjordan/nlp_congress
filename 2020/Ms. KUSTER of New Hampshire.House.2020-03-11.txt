 Madam Speaker, last night, I was so  pleased to hold a telephone townhall with my colleague, Representative  Chris Pappas, New Hampshire public health officials, and over 10,000  Granite Staters to provide an update on the impact of the coronavirus.   I continue to hear from constituents who are concerned, and a  recurring theme for many is a lack of access to paid sick leave, which  complicates our ability to address this public health crisis.   When faced with an illness or medical issue, many Americans face a  challenging decision to put their job and their income at risk or risk  their own health and the health of their colleagues and their  community.   I am proud to support Rosa DeLauro's legislation to expand access to  paid sick leave so that workers are able to follow the directives of  public health officials and stay home from work when they are feeling  ill.   As Congress continues to address policies to protect the American  people against the spread of the coronavirus, I urge consideration of  this important bill.                            ____________________
