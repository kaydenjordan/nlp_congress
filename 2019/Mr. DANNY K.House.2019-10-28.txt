 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the  gentlewoman, first of all, for organizing this Special Order that gives  all the rest of us the opportunity to come to pay tribute to my hero.   As a matter of fact, I am old enough to remember in a very vivid way  the late 1950s and early 1960s with people like John Conyers, Martin  Luther King,   John Lewis, Whitney Young, and other heroes of the  period.   Although John was elected in Michigan, he was really all of our  Congressman. He was the Representative for all of us. We didn't have 55  African American or Black Members of Congress at that time, but we had  those voices that were strong and vibrant, those voices that gave hope.   There was so much hope and possibility being expressed during that  period that those of us who were emerging had no idea that there was  anything that we couldn't accomplish, any changes that we couldn't  bring about, any possibilities that did not exist. And that, to me, was  the true essence of John Conyers.   I was tremendously impressed with John because he was always for the  underdog. He was always for the little guy, always for the little  person, always representing those who were left out, those who were  unheard, even those who were unheard of.   I don't think there was any place in America where action was going  on that John didn't go. As a matter of fact, at the time when we were  electing the first African American mayor in the city of Chicago, John  was there every week. We thought he had moved to Chicago, that he  didn't live in Detroit. I mean, every week, from the time, I guess, he  left here, in churches and churches and block parties and everyplace  that you could possibly turn, there was John Conyers.   John has given the very best that you can give.   To his wife and sons and other members of his family, we say thank  you for lending John to all of us.   I guess the poet Walter Foss maybe had John in mind when he penned  these words that I end with.       There are hermit souls that live withdrawn in the peace of             their self-content;      There are souls, like stars, that dwell apart, in a             fellowless firmament;      There are pioneer souls that blaze their paths where highways             never ran;      But let me live by the side of the road and be a friend to             man.      Let me live in a house by the side of the road, where the             race of men go by;      The men who are good and the men who are bad, as good and as             bad as I.      I would not sit in the scorner's seat, or hurl the cynic's             ban;      Let me live in my house by the side of the road and be a             friend to man.      I see from my house by the side of the road, by the side of             the highway of life,      The men who press with the ardor of hope, the men who are             faint with the strife.      But I turn not away from their smiles nor their tears, both             parts of an infinite plan;      Let me live in my house by the side of the road and be a             friend to man.    So let me live in my house by the side of the road where the race of  men go by, men who are good, men who are bad, wise, foolish, but then  so am I.   So why would I sit in the scorner's seat or hurl the cynic's ban? Let  me live in my house by the side of the road, like John Conyers, and be  a friend to man.
