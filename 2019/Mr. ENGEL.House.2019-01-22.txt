SUNSET.         This Act shall cease to be effective on the date that is 5       years after the date of the enactment of this Act.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 31, the Caesar Syria Civilian  Protection Act, as amended, currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is the third time I have stood on the House floor  to argue in favor of passing this bill, to argue that we need to dial  up the pressure on the Assad regime; that we need to crack down on his  enablers, namely, Iran and Russia; and that we need to push for a  political solution that will end the years of horrific bloodshed.   I made that case in November 2016, when the House unanimously passed  a version of this bill. I did it again in May of 2017, and again it  passed unanimously, only to languish in the other body for the rest of  the Congress, stopped by one single Senator.   In Syria, in the last 26 months that have come since the House first  passed this bill, the suffering has continued. Over the last few weeks,  in the Rukban refugee camp, 13 babies froze to death, and 50,000 more  displaced people in this camp are at grave risk. They have nowhere else  to go. Unchecked, the Assad regime will likely move in and massacre  these innocent people.   I could go on and on, detailing the horrors the Syrian people have  endured at the hands of this butcher, Assad. I could describe the  atrocities we saw in photographs smuggled out of Syria by Caesar, the  government photographer who defected and after whom this bill is named.   But after years of unremitting bloodshed, it is long past time for  more talk about Syria. We need action, and my legislation would be an  important step in the right direction.   This bill would slap sanctions on anyone who does business with the  Assad regime. It would go after anyone who provides financing or parts  for aircraft that are used to bomb civilians or works with the energy  or construction sectors controlled by the Syrian Government.   We don't want to do accidental harm with this bill, so we have made  sure that it would not affect NGOs providing assistance, and we want  the administration to use this tool to create leverage, so sanctions  could be waived or suspended if meaningful negotiations were moving  forward.   In this respect, this bill encourages diplomacy and a peaceful,  sustainable solution to the conflict in Syria.   Some people may be resigned to the idea that Assad is simply going to  take over the country. I disagree. The United States should not abandon  our options for applying pressure to the regime. Syria with Assad at  the helm is a recipe for sustained conflict, not sustainable peace. For  me, sustainable peace for the people of Syria has always been the goal.   Let me be very clear: This bill would impose Syria-related sanctions;  it would not impose nuclear-related sanctions.   I know many of my colleagues are concerned about our withdrawal from  the JCPOA. This legislation is entirely consistent with what President  Obama promised us after entering into the Iran nuclear deal, that we  would continue to sanction Iran for its destabilizing activities in the  region. Sanctions under this bill would not prevent a future President  of the United States from returning to the Iranian nuclear agreement.   There is obviously no easy solution for the crisis in Syria. It  wouldn't have raged on for years and years if there were a simple path  out of it. But this bill represents one tool the administration can use  to try to move toward that solution, to break the status quo.   I also want to mention the fact that so many wonderful Syrian  American groups have been fighting for this legislation, have been  fighting against the Assad regime, and have really worked so hard over  these past years. It has really been good working with them, although,  obviously, very, very difficult.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                    Washington, DC, January 5, 2019.      Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: I am writing concerning H.R. 31, the       ``Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019.''        As a result of your having consulted with the Committee on       Financial Servicing concerning provisions in the bill that       fall within our Rule X jurisdiction, I agree to forgo action       on the bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House       floor. The Committee on Financial Services takes this action       with our mutual understanding that, by foregoing       consideration of H.R. 31 at this time, we do not waive any       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this or       similar legislation, and that our Committee will be       appropriately consulted and involved as this or similar       legislation moves forward. Our Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation and request your support for any such       request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 31 and       would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this       matter be included in the Congressional Record.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman.                                   ____                                    Congress of the United States,                                   Washington, DC, January 10, 2019.      Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       31, the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019.        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on       Financial Services. I acknowledge that your Committee will       not formally consider H.R. 31 and agree that the inaction of       your Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in       H.R. 31 which fall within your Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman.                                   ____                                        Committee on Ways and Means,                                        House of Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, January 9, 2019.      Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,       Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: I am writing with respect to H.R. 31,       the ``Ceasar Syria Civilian Act of 2019.'' As a result of       your having consulted with us on provisions on which the       Committee on Ways and Means has a jurisdictional interest, I       will not request a sequential referral on this measure.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation, and requests your support for such       request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 31.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard E. Neal,      Chairman.                                   ____                                    Congress of the United States,                                   Washington, DC, January 10, 2019.      Hon. Richard E. Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee on H.R. 31, the Caesar Syria       Civilian Protection Act of 2019, and for agreeing to forgo a       sequential referral request so that the bill may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your declining to pursue a referral in this       case does not diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the       Committee on Ways and Means, or prejudice its jurisdictional       prerogatives on this bill or similar legislation in the       future. I would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees from your Committee over any       parts of the bill under the jurisdiction of the Committee on       Ways and Means to any House-Senate conference on this       legislation.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with  [[Page H973]]       you as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman.                                   ____                                    Congress of the United States,                                   Washington, DC, January 10, 2019.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       31, the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act of 2019.        I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation. I recognize that the bill contains provisions       that fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee on the       Judiciary. I acknowledge that your Committee will not       formally consider H.R. 31 and agree that the inaction of your       Committee with respect to the bill does not waive any future       jurisdictional claim over the matters contained in H.R. 31       which fall within your Committee's Rule X jurisdiction.        I will ensure that our exchange of letters is included in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work with you       as this measure moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman.                                   ____                                    Congress of the United States,                                   Washington, DC, January 11, 2019.      Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: This is to advise you that the Committee       on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to review the       provisions in H.R. 31, the ``Caesar Syria Civilian Protection       Act of 2019,'' that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction. I       appreciate your consulting with us on those provisions. The       Judiciary Committee has no objection to your including them       in the bill for consideration on the House floor, and to       expedite that consideration is willing to waive sequential       referral, with the understanding that we do not thereby waive       any future jurisdictional claim over those provisions or       their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                 Jerrold Nadler,                                                           Chairman,                                  House Committee on the Judiciary.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In closing, let me thank the ranking member, Mr. McCaul, for his very  important words.   The world has failed the Syrian people. Nothing can undo the horrors  they have had, and they have had to endure them for nearly 8 years.  Nothing can bring back those who have been lost. But the world owes it  to the living and the dead to try and bring this crisis to an end.   The role America must play is to push for a political solution that  allows the Syrian people to choose their own future. That is what  American leadership looks like. That is what sets us apart from other  great powers on the world stage.   We simply cannot look the other way and allow Assad, Russia, and Iran  to steamroll over Syria. That would send a terrible message to our  allies. It would undermine security across the entire region, and it  would cost so many more innocent lives.   My bill would give the administration greater leverage to raise the  cost for Assad and crack down on his lifelines. I ask that all Members  support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 353) to direct the Secretary of State to develop a strategy to  regain observer status for Taiwan in the World Health Organization, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 353         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE WORLD HEALTH                     ORGANIZATION.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized       agency of the United Nations, charged with coordinating       health efforts within the United Nations system. The World       Health Assembly (WHA) is the decision-making body of the WHO,       which convenes annually in May to set the policies and       priorities of the organization. Statehood is not a       requirement for attendance at the WHA, and numerous       observers, including non-members and non-governmental       organizations, attended the most recent WHA in May 2018.        (2) Taiwan began seeking to participate in the WHO as an       observer in 1997. In 2009, with strong support from       successive United States Administrations, Congress, and like-      minded WHO Member States, and during a period of improved       Cross-Strait relations, Taiwan received an invitation to       attend the WHA as an observer under the name ``Chinese       Taipei''. Taiwan received the same invitation each year until       2016, when following the election of President Tsai-Ing Wen       of the Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's engagement in       the international community began facing increased resistance       from the People's Republic of China (PRC). Taiwan's       invitation to the 2016 WHA was received late and included new       language conditioning Taiwan's participation on the PRC's       ``one China principle''. In 2017 and 2018, Taiwan did not       receive an invitation to the WHA.        (3) Taiwan remains a model contributor to world health,       having provided financial and technical assistance to respond       to numerous global health challenges. Taiwan has invested       over $6 billion in international medical and humanitarian aid       efforts impacting over 80 countries since 1996. In 2014,       Taiwan responded to the Ebola crisis by donating $1 million       and providing 100,000 sets of personal protective equipment.       Through the Global Cooperation and Training Framework, the       United States and Taiwan have jointly conducted training       programs for experts to combat MERS, Dengue Fever, and Zika.       These diseases know no borders, and Taiwan's needless       exclusion from global health cooperation increases the       dangers presented by global pandemics.        (4) Taiwan's international engagement has faced increased       resistance from the PRC. Taiwan was not invited to the 2016       Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization       (ICAO), despite participating as a guest at the       organization's prior summit in 2013. Taiwan's requests to       participate in the General Assembly of the International       Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) have also been       rejected. In May 2017, PRC delegates disrupted a meeting of       the Kimberley Process on conflict diamonds held in Perth,       Australia, until delegates from Taiwan were asked to leave.       Since 2016, the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe,       the Republic of Panama, the Dominican Republic, Burkina Faso,       and the Republic of El Salvador have terminated longstanding       diplomatic relationships with Taiwan and granted diplomatic       recognition to the PRC.        (5) Congress has established a policy of support for       Taiwan's participation in international bodies that address       shared transnational challenges, particularly in the WHO.       Congress passed H.R. 1794 in the 106th Congress, H.R. 428 in       the 107th Congress, and S. 2092 in the 108th Congress to       direct the Secretary of State to establish a strategy for,       and to report annually to Congress on, efforts to obtain       observer status for Taiwan at the WHA. Congress also passed       H.R. 1151 in the 113th Congress, directing the Secretary to       report on a strategy to gain observer status for Taiwan at       the ICAO Assembly, and H.R. 1853 in the 114th Congress,       directing the Secretary to report on a strategy to gain       observer status for Taiwan at the INTERPOL Assembly. However,       since 2016 Taiwan has not received an invitation to attend       any of these events as an observer.        (b) Augmentation of Report Concerning the Participation of       Taiwan in the World Health Organization.--        (1) In general.--Subsection (c) of section 1 of Public Law       108-235 (118 Stat. 656) is amended by adding at the end the       following new paragraph:        ``(3) An account of the changes and improvements the       Secretary of State has made to the United States plan to       endorse and obtain observer status for Taiwan at the World       Health Assembly, following any annual meetings of the World       Health Assembly at which Taiwan did not obtain observer       status.''.        (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1)       shall take effect and apply beginning with the first report       required under subsection (c) of section 1 of Public Law 108-      235 that is submitted after the date of the enactment of this       Act.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 353, a bill to regain observer status for  Taiwan in the World Health Organization, currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will start by thanking Mr. Yoho for his work on this  bill. It passed the House last Congress with broad bipartisan support,  and I look forward to seeing that happen again today.   Mr. Speaker, we all know too well that disease knows no borders, so  it is in the interest of the United States to address global health  challenges. Without the ability to consistently monitor threats and  rapidly coordinate responses globally, health and lives will be at  risk, including those of Americans.   A critical organization in this global public health effort is the  World Health Organization's World Health Assembly. This is a summit  meeting of countries coming together to address global health  challenges.   China is actively lobbying against Taiwan's inclusion in these summit  meetings, part of its larger effort to squeeze Taiwan out of the  international community. Beijing may believe this serves its own narrow  interests in asserting control over Taiwan, but it is to the detriment  of the effort to fight disease wherever it strikes.   This bill before us today is a step to rectify this situation. H.R.  353 enhances reporting requirements, which will provide Congress better  insight into our administration's efforts to obtain Taiwan's observer  status in the annual World Health Assembly meetings.   We need to make every effort to ensure that China does not strong-arm  and manipulate these international meetings, which are important  opportunities to make significant progress on health issues facing the  global community. This progress should not be jeopardized by Beijing's  political agenda.   I support this measure. We should continue to stand with our partners  in Taiwan, and this resolution does just that. I urge my colleagues to  do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We have supported a strong U.S.-Taiwan relationship since we passed  the Taiwan Relations Act back in 1979. It is critical that we continue  to support our close friend and partner, Taiwan, on the world stage and  ensure they maintain a seat at the table when discussing global health  challenges.   But China sees it differently, in pursuit of its own narrow political  agenda. Beijing is jeopardizing international efforts to improve global  health and fight transnational disease outbreaks by redoubling efforts  to prevent Taiwan from participating in organizations like the World  Health Assembly.   Our response to global health challenges and crises is stronger when  more countries are involved in the discussion and prevention. After  all, diseases go from border to border and across borders. It is  ridiculous to try to keep Taiwan out.   Our response to global health challenges is stronger, again, when  more countries are involved in prevention.  [[Page H976]]  There is no reason that the international community should accept a  scenario where we allow Beijing to compromise global health as they  play the bully with respect to their neighbor. That is another reason  why Kosovo should be admitted as well.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 676) to reiterate the support of the Congress of the United  States for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 676         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``NATO Support Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that:        (1) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which       came into being through the North Atlantic Treaty, which       entered into force on April 4, 1949, between the United       States of America and the other founding members of the North       Atlantic Treaty Organization, has served as a pillar of       international peace and stability, a critical component of       United States security, and a deterrent against adversaries       and external threats.        (2) The House of Representatives affirmed in H. Res. 397,       on June 27, 2017, that--        (A) NATO is one of the most successful military alliances       in history, deterring the outbreak of another world war,       protecting the territorial integrity of its members, and       seeing the Cold War through to a peaceful conclusion;        (B) NATO remains the foundation of United States foreign       policy to promote a Europe that is whole, free, and at peace;        (C) the United States is solemnly committed to the North       Atlantic Treaty Organization's principle of collective       defense as enumerated in Article 5 of the North Atlantic       Treaty; and        (D) the House of Representatives--        (i) strongly supports the decision at the NATO Wales Summit       in 2014 that each alliance member would aim to spend at least       2 percent of its nation's gross domestic product on defense       by 2024;        (ii) condemns any threat to the sovereignty, territorial       integrity, freedom and democracy of any NATO ally; and        (iii) welcomes the Republic of Montenegro as the 29th       member of the NATO Alliance.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the President shall not withdraw the United States from       NATO; and        (2) the case Goldwater v. Carter is not controlling legal       precedent with respect to the withdrawal of the United States       from a treaty.       SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States--        (1) to remain a member in good standing of NATO;        (2) to reject any efforts to withdraw the United States       from NATO, or to indirectly withdraw from NATO by condemning       or reducing contributions to NATO structures, activities, or       operations, in a manner that creates a de facto withdrawal;        (3) to continue to work with NATO members to meet their       2014 Wales Defense Investment Pledge commitments; and        (4) to support robust United States funding for the       European Deterrence Initiative, which increases the ability       of the United States and its allies to deter and defend       against Russian aggression.       SEC. 5. PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FUNDS TO WITHDRAW FROM                     NATO.         Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no funds are       authorized to be appropriated, obligated, or expended to take       any action to withdraw the United States from the North       Atlantic Treaty, done at Washington, DC on April 4, 1949,       between the United States of America and the other founding       members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 676, reiterating the support of the  Congress of the United States for the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking the author of this bill, the  gentleman from California (Mr. Panetta). I was glad to join him as an  original cosponsor, and I am grateful as well to our ranking member,  Mr. McCaul, for his strong support of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, for nearly 70 years, the NATO alliance has been the  bedrock of transatlantic peace, security, and stability. For seven  decades, NATO has been synonymous with Western democracy.   The organization's architects had a tremendous vision, and that  vision translated into the most successful political military alliance  in history, an alliance that won the Cold War, that brought peace to  the Balkans, that fought terrorism in Afghanistan, that today is  guarding against Russian aggression in Europe and training forces in  Iraq and elsewhere.   Now, Mr. Speaker, we have heard, most notably from the President,  that NATO is obsolete, that it is ill-suited to 21st century  challenges. That is just plain wrong.   Would we be safer without Article 5, the principle that says an  attack on one is an attack on all, an attack on one NATO member is an  attack on all NATO members, the commitment that brought our NATO allies  to fight at our side after September 11? Would we be better off without  28 other countries that share our values and that know how to fight  together effectively? Of course not.   NATO is not a burden, Mr. Speaker. It is a bulwark against aggressive  forces that seek to undermine democracy and the rule of law, against  strongmen who flout international law and act as though might makes  right.   NATO is our greatest strategic advantage, one built over time and at  great sacrifice. We simply cannot cede such an advantage. Past and  future generations alike would never forgive the squandering of  something so precious. We cannot betray our young soldiers, sailors,  airmen, and marines by sending them into battle alone, without capable  allies to share the burden.   So this bill, again, reiterates Congress' commitment to NATO. It  would also prohibit any withdrawal from NATO.   I am glad we are considering it so early in this Congress. It sends a  clear message to our allies, to our adversaries, and to the  administration that this branch of government fully supports the  alliance, the collective defense of our allies, and peace across the  North Atlantic region.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H977]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta), the author of this legislation who has worked  very hard on this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), a very respected member of the House Foreign  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me again, in closing, thank my friend from Texas  (Mr. McCaul); Mr. Panetta; our majority leader, Mr. Hoyer; and all of  this bill's sponsors.   As this debate has made perfectly clear, there is no partisan  disagreement in this body when it comes to the importance of NATO.   Right now, we are dealing with an adversary in Russia that desires  nothing more than to see the western alliance splinter. Vladimir  Putin's aim is to undermine democracy, to split us apart from our  allies, to drive division in the organizations that have kept Russia in  check.   The last thing the United States should do is send mixed signals  about our commitment, as this President, unfortunately, has done. It  plays right into Putin's hands.   From Congress, you will get no such ambiguity. We hope our allies  hear that and we hope Putin hears it as well.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this bill strongly, I urge  Members to do the same, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 328) to require the Secretary of State to design and establish a  Vulnerability Disclosure Process (VDP) to improve Department of State  cybersecurity and a bug bounty program to identify and report  vulnerabilities of internet-facing information technology of the  Department of State, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 328, the Hack Your State Department  Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking Representative Lieu, a valued  member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, for his hard work on this  bill and on everything else.   This important legislation passed the House in the last Congress with  strong bipartisan support, and I certainly support passing it again.   Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we modernize our government to  better deal with 21st century challenges. The State Department is under  the constant threat of cyberattack from foreign actors bent on stealing  our secrets, disrupting our foreign policy, and undermining our  security.   Mr. Lieu's bill will help shore up the State Department against this  sort of intrusion.   First, it requires the Secretary of State to get out ahead of this  problem. Instead of waiting for the next attack to happen, this bill  would mandate a plan for researchers to actively seek out and report  vulnerabilities.   Secondly, this bill launches a new initiative, the so-called ``bug  bounty program.'' This seeks to tap the expertise of everyday Americans  by rewarding citizens who uncover and report security risks in the  Department's computer system. It will allow security researchers and  friendly hackers to find the cracks in the system so that the  Department can patch them.   This effort is modeled after a successful program at the Defense  Department, which got off the ground in 2016. Since then, 1,400 people  have registered to participate, and they have found roughly 140  vulnerabilities.   Our Federal agencies should learn from one another. It is just common  sense to put this tested practice to work at the State Department and  elsewhere.   Mr. Speaker, I am very glad to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ted Lieu), the author of this bill and a very honored  member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank Mr. Lieu for this important piece  of legislation.   It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, that we have been caught flat-footed  before a range of new threats, including cyberattacks. Our agencies  haven't done enough to root out vulnerabilities, and, frankly, Congress  hasn't done enough to make sure that our government agencies have the  tools they need to tackle these challenges.   As we head into the 116th Congress, I will be leading the Foreign  Affairs Committee in focusing on this. We will be taking a  comprehensive look at cyber threats to make sure the State Department  and all our departments and agencies are properly equipped to handle  this challenge. For now, this bill is an important step in the right  direction.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support the measure before us, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
