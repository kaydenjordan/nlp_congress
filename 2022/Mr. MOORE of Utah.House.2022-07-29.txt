 Madam Chair, while I cannot support the entirety  of the package we are considering today, I am grateful that my  bipartisan, bicameral Saline Lake Ecosystems in the Great Basin States  Program Act was included in this bill.   This important legislation, which moved through the House Natural  Resources Committee with unanimous support, will be the first step in  addressing the challenges many Utahns know we are going through right  now with the Great Salt Lake and other saline lakes.   Let me say a special thank-you to my friend from California,  Congressman Huffman. He and I disagree on many issues, the entirety,  almost, of this bill or this approach, but I do appreciate the  relationship that we have been able to establish so we can get this to  the point where we got it today.   It is very important to my State. My State legislature has been  working on this, as well as our Governor. It has been a key aspect.   Let me add one piece about what we are going to be talking about  today. The Republican team, led by Mr. Westerman, has exceptional ideas  on how to get out ahead of this issue that we are facing with  wildfires, and we want to have that voice and have that be implemented  more on these issues.
