 Mr. Speaker, I am outraged that the CARES Act stimulus  checks, the economic impact payments, have not arrived to many of my  constituents months after being signed into law.   The stimulus checks provide timely and critical relief to families  and individuals across our country who are struggling because of the  coronavirus pandemic, but many constituents have told me they were  forced to wait months for their stimulus checks or have yet to receive  them at all.   To make matters worse, when my office has contacted the IRS on their  behalf, the responses have been wholly inadequate, merely quoting what  is on their website or failing to answer questions altogether.   This is unacceptable.   Families are unable to make ends meet, workers are choosing between  keeping the lights on and buying groceries, and people have been laid  off and are wondering where their next meal will come from.   My constituents are in dire need of urgent assistance.   The IRS must act immediately to expedite these stimulus checks so the  American people can get through this tumultuous time.                            ____________________
