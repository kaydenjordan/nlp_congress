 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the exceptional  career and life of Dr. William Finlayson. Dr. Finlayson is a pillar of  the Milwaukee Black Community and has left an indelible mark on so many  families in Wisconsin's largest city.   Dr. Finlayson was born in 1924 in Manatee, FL. From a young age, he  studied and excelled at school, and at age 16 he started his collegiate  career at Florida A&M. At age 19, Finlayson entered the U.S. Army and  served as a first lieutenant from 1943 through 1946. During his time in  the U.S. Army, he taught illiterate Black soldiers how to read,  receiving a promotion to second lieutenant due to his work. He then  served in the Army Reserves between 1946 to 1953.   While serving in the Reserves, Finlayson moved to Atlanta to attend  Morehouse College. It was during this time that he became classmates  and fraternity brothers with the late Martin Luther King, Jr. Finlayson  graduated from Morehouse in 1948 with his B.S and then attended Meharry  Medical College in 1953.   After graduating from medical school, Dr. Finlayson arrived to the  city of Milwaukee in 1958, where segregation was making it difficult  for Black physicians to get hired by the city's best hospitals. Ever  determined, Dr. Finlayson founded his own private practice, along with  Dr. Walter White, Dr. Randall Pollard, Dr. George Hillard, and Dr.  Gerald Poindexter. He was eventually admitted as the first Black doctor  at St. Joseph's Hospital. He built a successful practice, with people  often sitting on the steps outside of his office just to see him.   However, his passion for helping the Black community did not stop  there. Dr. Finlayson participated in fair housing marches led by  Alderwoman Vel Philips and Father James Groppi. During the civil rights  era, it was Dr. Finlayson who was instrumental in bringing MLK Jr. to  the city of Milwaukee to speak.   Dr. Finlayson was a champion for financial literacy, cofounding the  first Black-owned bank in the city, North Milwaukee State Bank, wanting  to offer full-service banking to underserved communities. He also  founded the W.E.B Du Bois Club, educating high school students with the  financial skills they needed to succeed while preserving Black history.   In his life, Dr. Finlayson delivered over 10,000 babies, served as  president of the Cream City Medical Society, Milwaukee Gynecological  Society, and his local YMCA. He was a house delegate to the Wisconsin  Medical Society, teaching at both the Medical College of Wisconsin and  the University of Wisconsin Medical School. He served as  [[Page S10089]]  vice president of the United Way of Greater Milwaukee and Waukesha  County and continues to be a member of the Urban League, as well as a  lifetime member of the NAACP.   Dr. Finlayson is truly a Milwaukee trailblazer, consistently fighting  for equality in the State of Wisconsin. Recently, the Milwaukee road  that was formerly North 5th Street was renamed Dr. William Finlayson  Street in his honor. At 98 years old, Dr. Finlayson continues to have a  tremendous impact on so many families in Milwaukee. His legacy and  advice will live on due to the insurmountable barriers that he set out  to shatter. His advice for the younger generations consists of, ``I  think the key is learning. Learn as much as you can, do as much as you  can.'' I am pleased to join others in recognizing Dr. Finlayson's  success and contributions to the people of Milwaukee, our State, and  our Nation.                            ____________________
