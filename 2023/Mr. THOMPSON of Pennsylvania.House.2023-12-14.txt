 Mr. Speaker, last night, in a  bipartisan manner, the House passed my legislation, Whole Milk for  Healthy Kids Act. This bill addresses the importance of providing whole  milk in school cafeterias.  [[Page H6946]]    It is proven that milk is the number one provider of 13 essential  nutrients, as well as a great deal of long-term health benefits,  including better bone health, lower blood pressure, and reduced risk of  cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. These benefits are crucial  for the healthy development of our Nation's youth.   Over the years, milk has been unfairly demonized, leading to the loss  of nearly an entire generation of milk drinkers. This bill will give  children a wide variety of milk options and bolster milk consumption, a  win-win for growing children and America's dairy farmers.   Mr. Speaker, farmers feed, nutrition matters, and whole milk heals.  It is time to follow the science and allow whole milk back into school  cafeterias. I call on my Senate colleagues to bring this bill to the  floor and pass this critical legislation.                            ____________________
