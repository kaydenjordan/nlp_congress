 Mr. President, today I wish to raise concerns about  the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, known as VIDA, which is included  in the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Act of 2018.   I voted in favor of the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Act of 2018, along  with 93 of my colleagues, because I strongly support the Coast Guard  and its mission. The women and men of the Coast Guard provide  invaluable services to our Nation, which include homeland security,  maritime safety, drug interdiction, search and rescue, and marine  environmental protection.   However, the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act title in the Coast Guard  authorization bill is a rider that I have long opposed. VIDA imposes a  uniform national standard and preempts California law in a way that  weakens California's ballast water management program, which protects  coastal waters from pollution and invasive species.   California has one of the most stringent ballast water discharge and  management standards in the Nation. It is home to three of the  country's largest and busiest ports with extremely high-volume traffic.   California's ports are often the first stop for vessels from Asia  before they travel up the West Coast. Therefore, California is often  the first line of defense against the spread of invasive species and  other types of pollution. That is why it has led the Nation in one of  the most advanced, stringent ballast water and invasive species  management programs--and with much success.   Invasive species wreak havoc on ecosystems and infrastructure, with  wide ranging effects from damaging levee systems to crippling  commercial fisheries. Due to climate change, warming waters and  shifting currents will increase the spread of invasive species, and  strong safeguards are needed now more than ever.   This is why I strongly oppose VIDA's preemption of California's  ballast water program.   For all these reasons, I supported the Frank LoBiondo Coast Guard Act  of 2018, but do not support the VIDA provision contained therein. Thank  you.                            ____________________
