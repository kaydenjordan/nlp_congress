 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Strengthening VA Cybersecurity Act, legislation I introduced to support  and protect our selfless veterans.   The VA is the largest integrated healthcare network in the United  States, and it stores millions of records with personal information for  veterans and their families.   This legislation will require the VA to obtain an independent  cybersecurity assessment of its most critical information systems and  develop a timeline and budget to fix any identified weaknesses and  deficiencies.   We must continue to work to ensure that the VA has the tools it needs  to effectively protect against new and emerging cybersecurity threats  and safeguard our veterans' information.   I look forward to continuing to collaborate with all of my colleagues  to move this commonsense and bipartisan legislation forward.                            ____________________
