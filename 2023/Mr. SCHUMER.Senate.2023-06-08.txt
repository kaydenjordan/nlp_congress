 Mr. President, as everyone knows, this week, the United  States has suffered through some of the worst wildfire air pollution in  the entire history of our country.   North of the border, over 400 wildfires continue blazing across  Quebec and many parts of Eastern Canada, and winds are sending smoke  and toxic air across the border and into our cities, into our  communities, into our lungs.   To walk through New York City yesterday was to walk on another  planet. The orange fog of wildfire smoke left our city unrecognizable.  Sadly, New York City had the worst air quality of any major city in the  world yesterday, even more than such cities as Delhi or Jakarta, which  always rate at the top for the worst air quality. And even as New York  City had the worst air quality, the pollution was even worse for  Upstate New York. From Bayside to Brooklyn, from Buffalo to Binghamton,  my home State looked like the scene of a scary movie.  [[Page S2014]]    Across the Northeast, schools canceled outdoor activities and  afterschool programs. The Yankees, the Phillies, and the New York  Liberty all postponed their games. People as far west as Indianapolis  and as far south as South Carolina have been impacted.   I urge all people here in Washington and across the United States to  listen to local health officials and take every precaution to stay  safe.   The climate crisis is real, and it is here to stay. We must take  action against the climate crisis, both short term and long term.   In the short term, this morning, I am calling on Secretary Tom  Vilsack to double the number of Forest Service personnel deployed to  fight these fires in Canada. I am calling on the Secretary of  Agriculture to double the number of personnel to mitigate the risk in  the air for millions of Americans. I am sending a letter to him, asking  him to double the Forest Service personnel.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Dear Secretary Vilsack: I am writing to express my concern       for the health and safety of New Yorkers, and all Americans,       affected by the smoke resulting from the wildfires currently       raging in Quebec, Canada. I urge the U.S. Forest Service (FS)       to double the personnel preparing to deploy to help Canada       fight these forest fires and protect the lives and health of       all those impacted.        As you know, the Quebec wildfires of recent days have       caused terrible air quality impacts across much of the       northeastern United States, including New York. Today, the       United States had the worst air quality in the world with New       York City measuring particulate matter 14.5 times greater       than the World Health Organization's annual air quality       guideline value. Over the past two days, much of New York       State has faced Hazardous air quality index (AQI) ratings of       over 300, levels at which all people are likely to be       affected, no matter their health. This poor air quality has       caused flight cancellations, restaurant closures, and       Broadway show cancellations, grinding New York City, and the       rest of the state, to a halt. Rapidly returning our air       quality to normal, healthy levels is of the utmost       importance.        Containing these fires is the best way to prevent more       smoke from drifting into the U.S. and returning air quality       in New York and elsewhere to healthy levels. To assist their       Canadian counterparts in their firefighting efforts, the New       York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) has       already deployed one Forest Ranger to assist with efforts to       contain the raging fires. The Northeastern Forest Fire       Protection Compact (P.L. 81-129) grants the U.S. Forest       Service authority to provide necessary cross-border       assistance to cope with fires beyond a sole entity's       capabilities. I ask that FS prepare to send additional       personnel to provide the Canadian Forest Service with       whatever necessary expertise and service they require to       contain and end these fires as quickly as possible.        Thank you for your attention to this request. Please do not       hesitate to contact me with any questions.            Sincerely,                                                Charles E. Schumer,                                                      U.S. Senator.    These unprecedented wildfires are a crisis for both  Canada and the United States, so both nations must respond speedily and  forcefully to contain the blazes. The best way to ensure the United  States does not suffer another wave of wildfire air pollution is to  contain these fires up in Canada as soon as possible. That is getting  at the source, and that is what we need to do. It won't be easy, but  the Federal Government--our Federal Government--must explore all  options on the table to keep Americans safe.   We must send personnel. We must send equipment. We must offer any  assistance that our friends north of the border need. Over the last 2  years, the Senate passed billions in funding to mitigate and respond to  wildfires. We did it when we passed the bipartisan infrastructure law  and the Inflation Reduction Act. The American Rescue Plan also provided  huge sums to help schools improve their air filtration systems. Today,  these investments are paying off. Many schools are safer and cleaner  because of the legislation we passed, but there is much more to do.   In the long term, there is little doubt that climate change has  exacerbated both the depth and breadth of these fires in Canada. We  cannot fully account for these fires without recognizing that climate  change is making disasters like this far more common and far more  destructive. Temperatures in May reached record levels in Canada, and  warmer temperatures mean that forest fires often burn faster, burn  hotter, burn bigger. We are seeing this play out in realtime. Canadian  officials say their country is now on track for their worst season of  wildfire destruction on record.   What we consider freak accidents today could become the norm  tomorrow, and the more we ignore our obligation to lower carbon  emissions, the greater the risks of these disasters. That is why  Democrats passed the largest package of clean energy investments in  American history last year through the Inflation Reduction Act, but  both parties have an obligation to do more, both to reduce our carbon  emissions and make sure we all have the resources necessary to respond  to natural disasters--so many of them caused or exacerbated by climate  change.   In the coming days, I will continue to reach out to the  administration to ensure that we are doing everything we can to help  contain the fires up north. That is the best thing we can do to keep  American citizens across the country safe and healthy.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 157.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 25.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 171.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 41.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, June 8, be  waived.    Mr. President, today our democracy held firm against  voter discrimination. The Supreme Court has ruled that Alabama's  Republican-drawn congressional districts discriminate against Black  voters, violating the Voting Rights Act and must be redrawn.   This case is a message to every American who has struggled to cast a  ballot or felt like their vote does not matter. Our democracy is worth  fighting for. We can make change happen, and that is what the Voting  Rights Act represents.   But today's case also reminds us that Jim Crow and racial  disenfranchisement live on to this day in ways both subtle and  explicit. Discrimination at the ballot box is very real in today's day  and age.   Alabama State lawmakers intentionally tried to dilute the voices of  Black voters through discriminatory districts. It is a good thing for  democracy that the efforts of the Alabama lawmakers to disenfranchise  Black voters have failed in this case.   So, once again, the democracy held firm, but the struggle for equal  representation, of course, continues.   We must fight to make redistricting much fairer throughout the  country. We must do more at the State level, and we must do more in  Congress to pass legislation that will strengthen the Voting Rights Act  and fight back against racial discrimination at the ballot box.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
