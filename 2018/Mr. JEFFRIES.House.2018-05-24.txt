 Mr. Speaker, while Democrats continue to focus on  better jobs, better wages, and a better future for hardworking  Americans, Republican indifference to the chaos, crisis, and corruption  in this town, for example, at the EPA, is at an all-time high.   Why in the world, in the context of the fact that we have 17  different intelligence agencies who concluded that Russia interfered  with the election and an ongoing investigation into whether the Trump  campaign was involved in selling out our democracy, do some folks  continue to try to undermine this investigation?   The ongoing criminal inquiry is a legitimate undertaking. It is not a  witch hunt. In fact, everyone leading that investigation is a  Republican: Bob Mueller, Republican; Rod Rosenstein, Republican; James  Comey, Republican; Christopher Wray, Republican.   What exactly are you all complaining about? It is time for the cover- up caucus in this institution to stop hiding the truth from the  American people.                            ____________________
