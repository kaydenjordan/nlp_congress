 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to all three of the  anti-American energy dominance bills on the floor this week. I am most  concerned by H.R. 205, which bans energy development in parts of the  Gulf of Mexico.   I do not rise as just another oil-and-gas Texan. I have unique  insights, because, unlike most of the bill's supporters, I started my  naval career, 9 years, at the cradle of naval aviation, NAS Pensacola,  Florida, the home port of the Blue Angels.   I have flown over every ocean on Earth. I patrolled for Russian  nuclear missile submarines to protect our Nation from nuclear war.   A blanket ban on this entire region hurts our national security. This  bill is a hatchet, and we need a precise scalpel. I urge my colleagues  to vote against the rule and against all three bills, especially H.R.  205.                            ____________________
