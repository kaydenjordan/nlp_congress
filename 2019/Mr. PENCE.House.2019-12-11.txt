 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Matthew Clifford on  being named the 2019 State Middle School  [[Page H10022]]  Principal of the Year by the Indiana Association of School Principals.   After being named the District 10 Middle School Principal of the  Year, Clifford was then nominated by his peers at Greensburg Junior  High School and across the State to become the State Principal of the  Year.   Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Matthew for this tremendous honor  and thank him for his dedication to improving the lives of Hoosier kids  and families.                         First Christian Church Grant     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the grant  application submitted by the First Christian Church of Columbus. This  grant will save one of America's treasures in my district.   The First Christian Church has been a staple in the Columbus  community for years and is a jewel of architecture and history.   Since 2001, the First Christian Church has been designated by the  National Park Service as a U.S. National Historic Landmark, but now it  needs essential renovations. I pledge my support for this program so  that this church may be restored to its original beauty.                        IU Health Community Investment     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for IU  Health's investment of $1 million into the Muncie community.   Over the next 3 years, IU Health will give $1 million toward  revitalization of the Thomas Park-Avondale and South Central  neighborhoods in southeast Muncie. The investment plans include bike  lanes, walking trails, access to better food, a new health center, and  much more.   I applaud IU Health for investing in our local community and  promoting healthier Hoosiers.                         Indiana Broadband Expansion     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to show my support for $1.3  million in rural broadband expansion in the Sixth District.   In my time in Congress, I have worked with local groups to address  broadband in schools and hospitals and supported Distance Learning and  Telemedicine grants. I have introduced a bill to make sure Federal  agencies effectively work together in this arena.   I am glad to see the Governor announce a boost for grants to counties  like Jennings, Scott, and my home county of Bartholomew.   I look forward to seeing the State's continued work on this as I  fight for rural high-speed internet on behalf of the Sixth District.                                time  1030                   Wayne County Veteran Appreciation Dinner     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Hoosier veterans and  their brave families I met at the Veterans Christmas Appreciation  Dinner of Wayne County.   Nearly 600 veterans, including World War II vets, gathered in  Richmond to enjoy an evening of celebration and holiday cheer. A career  fair was held before dinner to help those in need to access work  opportunities, resources, and support.   It was a privilege to speak at this appreciation dinner, and I stand  today to wish every veteran across this country and Indiana's Sixth  District a very merry Christmas.             Congress Needs to Address Rising Cost of Healthcare     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask, for the American people,  Congress to do its job and address the rising cost of healthcare, but  Speaker Pelosi's H.R. 3, is not the answer.   H.R. 3 will limit choice and innovation. It is a partisan messaging  bill that will not be considered in the Senate or signed into law. We  are letting the American people down by not voting on bipartisan  legislation that will actually address skyrocketing drug prices.   H.R. 3 would increase premiums while punishing American innovation  and enabling foreign competitors to flourish.   H.R. 19, the Republican's alternative drug pricing bill, is filled  with more than 40 bipartisan, commonsense reforms that reduce  prescription drug costs and increase access to affordable, high-quality  and lifesaving care for Americans.   H.R. 19 expands low-cost options for patients by bringing more  generic competition to the market.   It lowers out-of-pocket spending, protects patients' access to new  medicine and cures, increases transparency, and boosts innovation. The  American people should be empowered by bipartisan proposals not  restricted by partisan politics to make the best healthcare choices for  themselves and their families.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. As  ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health,  I thank my colleague, Dr. Burgess, for his steadfast leadership on this  issue.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join 255 of my colleagues as a cosponsor  of H.R. 2207, the Protect Medical Innovation Act. I rise today to  remind my fellow Members that time is running out. We must repeal the  medical device tax before it goes into effect on January 1, 2020.   This bill has broad bipartisan support from Members in both Chambers  who recognize the detrimental impact this tax has on constituents who  rely on lifesaving medical devices or are employed by the industry.   If Congress fails to act this year, the seemingly small 2.3 percent  excise tax would have a significant impact on patients and the  healthcare industry.   The medical device industry employs 400,000 hardworking Americans,  including 20,000 Hoosiers. When the medical device tax was in effect,  nearly 20,000 industry jobs were lost nationwide.   Eighty percent of these medical manufacturing companies are small  businesses that need certainty. They need certainty in order to  continue their research and investment in critical lifesaving medical  innovations.   This is a tax on innovation and competitiveness, a tax on patients,  and a tax on working families. It is time to end this job-killing tax  once and for all.   I urge my fellow Members to vote ``no'' on the previous question so  we can support H.R. 2207.
