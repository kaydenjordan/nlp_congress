 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor the life of an amazing leader, Paul Beckham, who sadly passed  away on August 30.   Paul was dedicated to improving my alma mater, Young Harris College,  through his work on the Board of Trustees. He served as its chairman  for 8 years and improved the lives of countless students and faculty  members.   Paul had a diversified background in business, marketing, sports, and  finance that included television operations.   Impressively, he served as Turner Broadcasting System's president. He  also served as president of Private Networks, Inc., which is the wholly  owned subsidiary of TBS responsible for developing nontraditional  television opportunities, including the Airport Channel.   Remarkably, he was also chairman and cofounder of Hope-Beckham with  Bob Hope when they purchased the events division of Whittle  Communication LP of Knoxville.   Paul was also a devoted member of his church, Peachtree Road United  Methodist Church, and was active in multiple charitable and community  organizations.   His life was marked by service to others and working to improve the  greater good.   I am immensely grateful for the life he lived. He impacted countless  individuals in all his pursuits, and I was grateful to know him.   Paul's family and friends will continue to be in my thoughts and  prayers during this most difficult time.   I know his legacy will remain for many years to come.

I know Dr. Roe is retiring, and there is  going to be a great void there with him not being here, but I thank him  for his service to the Doctor's Caucus and his service to our country.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about the amazing work our Nation's  top scientists are doing to get a safe and effective coronavirus  vaccine to the American people.   Earlier this year, President Trump initiated Operation Warp Speed, a  collaborative effort between the Federal Government and the private  sector to research, develop, and distribute a coronavirus vaccine.   The merits of this initiative were quickly realized, and Congress  came together in a bipartisan fashion and invested $10 billion to  support the effort. The focus of the initiative works by accelerating  development of vaccines through staggered clinical trials, completely  overseen by Federal regulatory authorities. You have heard that time  and time again tonight as each of the physicians here have explained  how this is taking place.   Traditionally, a vaccine would undergo several separate phases of  trials, with the average trial lasting nearly 7 years. Mr. Speaker, we  don't have 7 years. Our country--our world--needs a vaccine now, and  that is why Operation Warp Speed is on track to deliver vaccines in  record speed, potentially even by the end of the year. This is nothing  short of a miracle. It is phenomenal.    And it is critically important to stress that any vaccine approved by  the FDA will be safe and effective.   Mr. Speaker, I have been a practicing pharmacist for over 30 years. I  have witnessed the process by which the FDA approves medications. They  will not approve it unless it is safe and effective. Don't think for  one minute that any administration or any person is going to have an  impact on that. They are not. It will be safe and effective if it is  approved by the FDA.   I repeat: Only vaccines that are proven to be completely safe and  effective will be allowed for use.   But recently, we have heard dangerous rhetoric from certain  politicians and candidates about Operation Warp Speed, rhetoric and  comments that are lies based in politics instead of science; even  doubting the thousands of scientists who have spent their life working  to find cures and casting fear on the American people.   I have outright confidence in this administration's commitment to  safety and science. And I can tell my constituents and the American  people right now, I will be in line to get the vaccine when approved.   Our communities are suffering, and we are losing loved ones. This  effort will save thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of lives.   I commend this administration and the thousands of scientists working  to find a cure, and I thank them for all they are doing to save lives,  to produce a safe and effective vaccine.
