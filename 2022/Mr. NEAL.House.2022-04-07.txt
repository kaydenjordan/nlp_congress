 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the  Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 7108) to suspend normal trade  relations treatment for the Russian Federation and the Republic of  Belarus, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Suspending Normal Trade       Relations with Russia and Belarus Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The United States is a founding member of the World       Trade Organization (WTO) and is committed to ensuring that       the WTO remains an effective forum for peaceful economic       engagement.        (2) Ukraine is a sovereign nation-state that is entitled to       enter into agreements with other sovereign states and to full       respect of its territorial integrity.        (3) The United States will be unwavering in its support for       a secure, democratic, and sovereign Ukraine, free to choose       its own leaders and future.        (4) Ukraine acceded to the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing       the World Trade Organization (WTO Agreement) and has been a       WTO member since 2008.        (5) Ukraine's participation in the WTO Agreement creates       both rights and obligations vis-a-vis other WTO members.        (6) The Russian Federation acceded to the WTO on August 22,       2012, becoming the 156th WTO member, and the Republic of       Belarus has applied to accede to the WTO.        (7) From the date of its accession, the Russian Federation       committed to apply fully all provisions of the WTO.        (8) The United States Congress authorized permanent normal       trade relations for the Russian Federation through the Russia       and Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei Magnitsky Rule of       Law Accountability Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-208).        (9) Ukraine communicated to the WTO General Council on       March 2, 2022, urging that all WTO members take action       against the Russian Federation and ``consider further steps       with the view to suspending the Russian Federation's       participation in the WTO for its violation of the purpose and       principles of this Organization''.        (10) Vladimir Putin, a ruthless dictator, has led the       Russian Federation into a war of aggression against Ukraine,       which--        (A) denies Ukraine and its people their collective rights       to independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity;        (B) constitutes an emergency in international relations,       because it is a situation of armed conflict that threatens       the peace and security of all countries, including the United       States; and        (C) denies Ukraine its rightful ability to participate in       international organizations, including the WTO.        (11) The Republic of Belarus, also led by a ruthless       dictator, Aleksander Lukashenka, is providing important       material support to the Russian Federation's aggression.        (12) The Russian Federation's exportation of goods in the       energy sector is central to its ability to wage its war of       aggression on Ukraine.        (13) The United States, along with its allies and partners,       has responded to recent aggression by the Russian Federation       in Ukraine by imposing sweeping financial sanctions and       stringent export controls.        (14) The United States cannot allow the consequences of the       Russian Federation's actions to go unaddressed, and must lead       fellow countries, in all fora, including the WTO, to impose       appropriate consequences for the Russian Federation's       aggression.       SEC. 3. SUSPENSION OF NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS WITH THE RUSSIAN                     FEDERATION AND THE REPUBLIC OF BELARUS.         (a) Nondiscriminatory Tariff Treatment.--Notwithstanding       any other provision of law, beginning on the day after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the rates of duty set       forth in column 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the       United States shall apply to all products of the Russian       Federation and of the Republic of Belarus.        (b) Authority to Proclaim Increased Column 2 Rates.--        (1) In general.--The President may proclaim increases in       the rates of duty applicable to products of the Russian       Federation or the Republic of Belarus, above the rates set       forth in column 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the       United States.        (2) Prior consultation.--The President shall, not later       than 5 calendar days before issuing any proclamation under       paragraph (1), consult with the Committee on Ways and Means       of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance       of the Senate regarding the basis for and anticipated impact       of the proposed increases to rates of duty described in       paragraph (1).        (3) Termination.--The authority to issue proclamations       under this subsection shall terminate on January 1, 2024.       SEC. 4.

Such action shall take       effect beginning on the date that is 90 calendar days after       the date of submission of such certification for such period,       unless there is enacted into law during such 90-day period a       joint resolution of disapproval.        (2) Consultation and report.--The President shall, not       later than 45 calendar days before submitting a certification       under paragraph (1)--        (A) consult with--        (i) the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on       Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives; and        (ii) the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Foreign       Relations of the Senate; and        (B) submit to all such committees a report that explains       the basis for the determination of the President contained in       such certification.        (b) Restoration of Normal Trade Relations Treatment.--        (1) In general.--The President is authorized to resume the       application of the rates of duty set forth in column 1 of the       Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to the       products of the Russian Federation, the Republic of Belarus,       or both, if the President submits to Congress with respect to       either or both such countries a certification under       subsection (c). Such action shall take effect beginning on       the date that is 90 calendar days after the date of       submission of such certification, unless there is enacted       into law during such 90-day period a joint resolution of       disapproval.        (2) Consultation and report.--The President shall, not       later than 45 calendar days before submitting a certification       under paragraph (1)--        (A) consult with--        (i) the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on       Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives; and        (ii) the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Foreign       Relations of the Senate; and        (B) submit to all such committees a report that explains       the basis for the determination of the President contained in       such certification.        (3) Products of the russian federation.--If the President       submits pursuant to paragraph (1) a certification under       subsection (c) with respect to the Russian Federation and a       joint resolution of disapproval is not enacted during the 90-      day period described in that paragraph, the President may       grant permanent nondiscriminatory tariff treatment (normal       trade relations) to the products of the Russian Federation.  [[Page H4416]]         (4) Products of the republic of belarus.--If the President       submits pursuant to paragraph (1) a certification under       subsection (c) with respect to the Republic of Belarus and a       joint resolution of disapproval is not enacted during the 90-      day period described in that paragraph, the President may,       subject to the provisions of chapter 1 of title IV of the       Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.), grant       nondiscriminatory tariff treatment (normal trade relations)       to the products of the Republic of Belarus.

(d) Joint Resolution of Disapproval.--        (1) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term       ``joint resolution of disapproval'' means only a joint       resolution--        (A) which does not have a preamble;        (B) the title of which is as follows: ``Joint resolution       disapproving the President's certification under section 4(c)       of the Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and       Belarus Act.''; and        (C) the matter after the resolving clause of which is as       follows: ``That Congress disapproves the certification of the       President under section 4(c) of the Suspending Normal Trade       Relations with Russia and Belarus Act, submitted to Congress       on ___'', the blank space being filled in with the       appropriate date.        (2) Introduction in the house of representatives.--During a       period of 5 legislative days beginning on the date that a       certification under subsection (c) is submitted to Congress,       a joint resolution of disapproval may be introduced in the       House of Representatives by the majority leader or the       minority leader.        (3) Introduction in the senate.--During a period of 5 days       on which the Senate is in session beginning on the date that       a certification under subsection (c) is submitted to       Congress, a joint resolution of disapproval may be introduced       in the Senate by the majority leader (or the majority       leader's designee) or the minority leader (or the minority       leader's designee).        (4) Floor consideration in the house of representatives.--        (A) Reporting and discharge.--If a committee of the House       to which a joint resolution of disapproval has been referred       has not reported such joint resolution within 10 legislative       days after the date of referral, that committee shall be       discharged from further consideration thereof.        (B) Proceeding to consideration.--Beginning on the third       legislative day after each committee to which a joint       resolution of disapproval has been referred reports it to the       House or has been discharged from further consideration       thereof, it shall be in order to move to proceed to consider       the joint resolution in the House. All points of order       against the motion are waived. Such a motion shall not be in       order after the House has disposed of a motion to proceed on       a joint resolution with regard to the same certification. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       motion to its adoption without intervening motion. The motion       shall not be debatable. A motion to reconsider the vote by       which the motion is disposed of shall not be in order.        (C) Consideration.--The joint resolution shall be       considered as read. All points of order against the joint       resolution and against its consideration are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint       resolution to final passage without intervening motion except       two hours of debate equally divided and controlled by the       sponsor of the joint resolution (or a designee) and an       opponent.

(E) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage shall occur       immediately following the conclusion of the debate on the       joint resolution of disapproval and a single quorum call at       the conclusion of the debate, if requested in accordance with       the rules of the Senate.        (F) Rules of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the       decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the       rules of the Senate, as the case may be, to the procedure       relating to the joint resolution of disapproval shall be       decided without debate.        (G) Consideration of veto messages.--Debate in the Senate       of any veto message with respect to the joint resolution of       disapproval, including all debatable motions and appeals in       connection with such joint resolution, shall be limited to 10       hours, to be equally divided between, and controlled by, the       majority leader and the minority leader or their designees.        (6) Procedures in the senate.--Except as otherwise provided       in this subsection, the following procedures shall apply in       the Senate to a joint resolution of disapproval to which this       subsection applies:        (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a joint       resolution of disapproval that has passed the House of       Representatives shall, when received in the Senate, be       referred to the Committee on Finance for consideration in       accordance with this subsection.        (B) If a joint resolution of disapproval to which this       subsection applies was introduced in the Senate before       receipt of a joint resolution of disapproval that has passed       the House of Representatives, the joint resolution from the       House of Representatives shall, when received in the Senate,       be placed on the calendar. If this subparagraph applies, the       procedures in the Senate with respect to a joint resolution       of disapproval introduced in the Senate that contains the       identical matter as the joint resolution of disapproval that       passed the House of Representatives shall be the same as if       no joint resolution of disapproval had been received from the       House of Representatives, except that the vote on passage in       the Senate shall be on the joint resolution of disapproval       that passed the House of Representatives.        (7) Rules of the house of representatives and senate.--This       subsection is enacted by Congress--        (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate       and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such       are deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively,       but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be       followed in that House in the case of legislation described       in those sections, and supersede other rules only to the       extent that they are inconsistent with such rules; and        (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of       either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the       procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and       to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that       House.       SEC. 5. COOPERATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY AT THE WORLD TRADE                     ORGANIZATION.         The United States Trade Representative shall use the voice       and influence of the United States at the WTO to--        (1) condemn the recent aggression in Ukraine;        (2) encourage other WTO members to suspend trade       concessions to the Russian Federation and the Republic of       Belarus;        (3) consider further steps with the view to suspend the       Russian Federation's participation in the WTO; and        (4) seek to halt the accession process of the Republic of       Belarus at the WTO and cease accession-related work.       SEC. 6. REAUTHORIZATION OF SANCTIONS UNDER THE GLOBAL                     MAGNITSKY HUMAN RIGHTS ACCOUNTABILITY ACT WITH                     RESPECT TO HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS AND                     CORRUPTION.         (a) In General.--Section 1265 of the Global Magnitsky Human       Rights Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII of Public       Law 114-328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note) is repealed.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       2(b) and in title XII of division A of the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328)       are each amended by striking the items relating to section       1265.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am relieved that the Senate has sent this measure back  to  [[Page H4417]]  us after the House initially advanced the legislation a month ago. We  are now considering this important legislation to suspend normal trade  relations with Russia.   The facts, the atrocities, and the emotions are all packaged in the  American and Congressional response in the coming moments. We will  shortly consider this amendment to H.R. 6968 which will suspend Russian  oil imports so that both measures may go directly to the President's  desk.   We have no time to waste and must immediately further punish Vladimir  Putin.   What we have witnessed in Bucha over the course of the last 72 hours  alone more than justifies the positions we have taken in the past and  to be even more assertive and aggressive going to the future. Innocent  people are being slaughtered on the streets of Ukraine even as we meet,  and the denial that has taken place from the Russian President is  outrageous.   These atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine are unthinkable.  The disinformation and the misinformation that has been generated from  Russia defies modern logic. But in this modern era, the world can see  the devastation in near real time.   President Zelenskyy is an inspiration to the world. People have been  bombed out of residential neighborhoods, and refugees have been  streaming across the borders to safety. There has occurred  indiscriminate killings of civilians and of innocent children. Congress  must do whatever we can to end this brutality and support the Ukrainian  people.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Brady for his partnership in  advancing this legislation to suspend normal trade relations with  Russia and its enabler, Belarus.   The legislation to ban the import of Russian energy makes enormous  sense today. These actions will further isolate Putin and inflict  greater pressure on the Kremlin to end its campaign of terror on  Ukraine--and that is exactly what it is: a campaign of terror.   We stand with NATO committed to democracy and to peace on the  European continent.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation I know will receive broad support from  our colleagues, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman's position was well-stated. I  think this legislation is powerful in terms of the message it sends to  the world. It reinforces what we have done here over the course of the  last 6 weeks.   The House has been consistent on all of these measures from day one.  I would ask that there be a very strong and assertive vote today to  send a message to a dictator in Russia who is killing innocent women  and children in the streets of Ukraine, and at the moment he appears to  be still unrestrained.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the  Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 6968) to prohibit the importation of  energy products of the Russian Federation, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:          Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the       following:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

(b) Consultation and Report.--The President shall, not       later than 45 calendar days before submitting a certification       under subsection (a)--        (1) consult with--        (A) the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on       Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives; and        (B) the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Foreign       Relations of the Senate; and        (2) submit to all such committees a report that explains       the basis for the determination of the President contained in       such certification.        (c) Certification.--A certification under this subsection       is a certification in writing that--        (1) indicates that the President proposes to terminate       under subsection (a) the prohibition under section 2; and        (2) contains a determination of the President that the       Russian Federation--        (A) has reached an agreement to withdraw Russian forces and       for the cessation of military hostilities that is accepted by       the free and independent government of Ukraine;        (B) poses no immediate military threat of aggression to any       North Atlantic Treaty Organization member; and        (C) recognizes the right of the people of Ukraine to       independently and freely choose their own government.        (d) Joint Resolution of Disapproval.--        (1) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term       ``joint resolution of disapproval'' means only a joint       resolution--        (A) that does not have a preamble;        (B) the title of which is as follows: ``Joint resolution       disapproving the President's certification under section 3(c)       of the Ending Importation of Russian Oil Act.''; and        (C) the matter after the resolving clause of which is as       follows: ``That Congress disapproves the certification of the       President under section 3(c) of the Ending Importation of       Russian Oil Act, submitted to Congress on ___'', the blank       space being filled in with the appropriate date.        (2) Introduction in the house of representatives.--During a       period of 5 legislative days beginning on the date that a       certification under subsection (c) is submitted to Congress,       a joint resolution of disapproval may be introduced in the       House of Representatives by the majority leader or the       minority leader.        (3) Introduction in the senate.--During a period of 5 days       on which the Senate is in session beginning on the date that       a certification under subsection (c) is submitted to       Congress, a joint resolution of disapproval may be introduced       in the Senate by the majority leader (or the majority       leader's designee) or the minority leader (or the minority       leader's designee).        (4) Floor consideration in the house of representatives.--        (A) Reporting and discharge.--If a committee of the House       to which a joint resolution of disapproval has been referred       has not reported such joint resolution within 10 legislative       days after the date of referral, that committee shall be       discharged from further consideration thereof.        (B) Proceeding to consideration.--Beginning on the third       legislative day after each committee to which a joint       resolution of disapproval has been referred reports it to the       House or has been discharged from further consideration       thereof, it shall be in order to move to proceed to consider       the joint resolution in the House. All points of order       against the motion are waived. Such a motion shall not be in       order after the House has disposed of a motion to proceed on       a joint resolution with regard to the same certification. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       motion to its adoption without intervening motion. The motion       shall not be debatable. A motion to reconsider the vote by       which the motion is disposed of shall not be in order.        (C) Consideration.--The joint resolution shall be       considered as read. All points of order against the joint       resolution and against its consideration are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint       resolution to final passage without intervening motion except       two hours of debate equally divided and controlled by the       sponsor of the joint resolution (or a designee) and an       opponent. A motion to reconsider the vote on passage of the       joint resolution shall not be in order.        (5) Consideration in the senate.--        (A) Committee referral.--A joint resolution of disapproval       introduced in the Senate shall be referred to the Committee       on Finance.        (B) Reporting and discharge.--If the Committee on Finance       has not reported such joint resolution of disapproval within       10 days on which the Senate is in session after the date of       referral of such joint resolution, that committee shall be       discharged from further consideration of such joint       resolution and the joint resolution shall be placed on the       appropriate calendar.        (C) Motion to proceed.--Notwithstanding Rule XXII of the       Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in order at any time       after the Committee on Finance reports the joint resolution       of disapproval to the Senate or has been discharged from its       consideration (even though a previous motion to the same       effect has been disagreed to) to move to proceed to the       consideration of the joint resolution, and all points of       order against the joint resolution (and against consideration       of the joint resolution) shall be waived. The motion to       proceed is not debatable. The motion is not subject to a       motion to postpone. A motion to reconsider the vote by which       the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in       order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the       joint resolution of disapproval is agreed to, the joint       resolution shall remain the unfinished business until       disposed of.        (D) Debate.--Debate on the joint resolution of disapproval,       and on all debatable motions and appeals in connection       therewith, shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, which       shall be divided equally between the majority and minority       leaders or their designees. A motion to further limit debate       is in order and not debatable. An amendment to, or a motion       to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of       other business, or a motion to recommit the joint resolution       of disapproval is not in order.        (E) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage shall occur       immediately following the conclusion of the debate on the       joint resolution of disapproval and a single quorum call at       the conclusion of the debate, if requested in accordance with       the rules of the Senate.        (F) Rules of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the       decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the       rules of the Senate, as the case may be, to the procedure       relating to the joint resolution of disapproval shall be       decided without debate.        (G) Consideration of veto messages.--Debate in the Senate       of any veto message with respect to the joint resolution of       disapproval, including all debatable motions and appeals in       connection with such joint resolution, shall be limited to 10       hours, to be equally divided between, and controlled by, the       majority leader and the minority leader or their designees.        (6) Procedures in the senate.--Except as otherwise provided       in this subsection, the following procedures shall apply in       the Senate to a joint resolution of disapproval:        (A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a joint       resolution of disapproval that has passed the House of       Representatives shall, when received in the Senate, be       referred to the Committee on Finance for consideration in       accordance with this subsection.        (B) If a joint resolution of disapproval was introduced in       the Senate before receipt of a joint resolution of       disapproval that has passed the House of Representatives, the       joint resolution from the House of Representatives shall,       when received in the Senate, be placed on the calendar. If       this subparagraph applies, the procedures in the Senate with       respect to a joint resolution of disapproval introduced in       the Senate that contains the identical matter as the joint       resolution of disapproval that passed the House of       Representatives shall be the same as if no joint resolution       of disapproval had been received from the House of       Representatives, except that the vote on passage in the       Senate shall be on the joint resolution of disapproval that       passed the House of Representatives.        (7) Rules of the house of representatives and the senate.--      This subsection is enacted by Congress--        (A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate       and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such       is deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively,       but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be       followed in that House in the case of a joint resolution of       disapproval, and supersedes other rules only to the extent       that it is inconsistent with such rules; and        (B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of       either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the       procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and       to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that       House.  [[Page H4419]]     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think that what we are doing here is to certainly  reassert ourselves on what the Senate has done, which the House did  originally. I strongly support the House taking swift action to concur  in the Senate amendment before us so that the legislation to suspend  energy imports from Russia that we passed a month ago now can move to  the President's desk.   We have no time to waste, as Mr. Brady and I have both indicated. We  must immediately move to further punish Vladimir Putin, a ruthless  dictator hell-bent on destroying an independent nation that he purports  to suggest doesn't really exist. That will come as a vast surprise to  the civilized nations of the world.   Congress must do what we can to end this brutality and continue to  support the Ukrainian people.   I thank Kevin Brady for his partnership in advancing this legislation  to ban the import of Russian energy, as well as our intent here to  suspend normal trade relations with Russia and its enabler, Belarus.   These actions will further isolate Putin and his regime, and inflict  greater pressure on the Kremlin, to end this campaign of terror.   I know this legislation will receive broad support from our  colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge Mr. Brady and the Republican  Members of the House who have stood with Democrats in an unyielding  position of support for the Ukrainian people. On this occasion, we send  another message that civilized people of the world are all Ukrainians  at this moment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
