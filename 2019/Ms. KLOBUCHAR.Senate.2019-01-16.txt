 Mr. President, I appreciate the sentiment of the  Senator from Georgia, and I remember earlier last year when we were  both part of discussions to try to resolve an earlier shutdown issue  and an earlier issue related to immigration reform. We put together a  bipartisan bill involving the Dreamers, and we got some broad support  on our side. Unfortunately, the White House, in the end, was not  supportive of that agreement, even though the Senator from Georgia had  worked so hard.   I think we can't rule out, as much as we have tried and will continue  to try, to come up with bipartisan solutions like the majority and the  minority leader did in December that we all supported and would have  prevented this shutdown. We can't take out the element of the fact that  a number of times we have been gut-punched, basically, when we have  tried to do that. That doesn't mean that the discussion shouldn't  continue, and I appreciate his good work on that.   I want to discuss one Minnesotan, Kathleen DeMaster, who has been  affected by this and her family. She works for the U.S. Department of  Agriculture in Minneapolis. She is currently furloughed. This is  Kathleen and her daughter. She says:         My situation is becoming desperate. . . . I accepted my       position with the federal government only a few months ago       because it is a fantastic way for me to better myself and my       career. I am passionate about public service and have enjoyed       my job very much since I started. While accepting this       position improved my situation, I have lived paycheck to       paycheck. . . . This has not changed unfortunately. I am a       single mother and a homeowner. And while I am college       educated . . . I have struggled to get where I am now. It has       never been easy, and unfortunately, this has only made life       more difficult. My funds are exhausted. At this point in       time, I don't have the money to pay for my mortgage or for       childcare for my daughter. The money I will receive for       unemployment insurance will not cover everything I need [it       to].        Unfortunately this has put me in an untenable situation. Do       I risk losing my home or do I risk having my daughter lose       her daycare and being unable to work when I am recalled?    In other words, she can maybe lose the daycare because she is at home  now, but she is not going to be able to have the daycare when she goes  back to work, when she can.         These are the choices I (and many others, I am sure) are       facing right now.        This may be a story you have heard before, but I felt it       needs to be shared until it is heard by the right ears.    These are this woman's words--``the right ears.''         I am at a loss for what else to do, and I'm terrified for       what it means for my daughter and myself.    Kathleen is doing everything she can do to provide for her daughter.  She recently started picking up shifts with Instacart, the grocery  delivery service, just to make ends meet. If this shutdown drags on--in  her words--she is simply at a loss about how she and her daughter will  get by.   In my State there are 6,100 other Federal workers with these stories.  They are not being paid, and each of these workers has a face and a  name. It is time to end the shutdown and reopen the government.   I yield the floor.
