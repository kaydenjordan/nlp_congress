 Madam President, I want to start my remarks this  afternoon by saying congratulations to our friend Senator Richard  Shelby, Alabama's longest serving U.S. Senator as of this Sunday.   Here in Washington, we know him as chairman of the all-powerful  Senate Appropriations Committee, which holds the congressional purse  strings, but Alabamians, from Huntsville to Gulf Shores, know him as a  devoted public servant working for the good of all of his constituents  and an invaluable Member of the U.S. Senate.   Senator Shelby is a man of principles. He believes in smaller  government, supports the Second Amendment, and works tirelessly for the  military men and women from Alabama.  [[Page S1646]]    There is only one thing he is more proud of than his home State, and  that may be the Crimson Tide football team and the number of their  national championships.   I just wanted to start my comments this afternoon by saying  congratulations to our friend Senator Richard Shelby for 32 years of  serving the people of Alabama.
