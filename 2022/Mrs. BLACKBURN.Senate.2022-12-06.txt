 Madam President, on November 5, the Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame honored Dolly Parton as part of their 2022 class of  inductees. Anyone familiar with Dolly's path to official ``rock star''  status will remember that, when she discovered the Rock Hall was  considering her for a nomination, she declined. She told them she felt  she hadn't earned the right to say yes.   Never has such universal outrage sprung from such universal  admiration. Country fans had no time for humility. Rock fans weren't  having it either--although, to be fair, humility and rock `n' roll go  together like oil and water. Even people who aren't fans of Dolly's  music said that surely she was worthy of any honor bestowed by an  organization whose mission is to ``engage, teach, and inspire through  the power of rock & roll.''   By my estimation, this may have been the first time in history that a  debate over a nominee to the Rock Hall has not devolved into a debate  over what rock and roll is and who should and should not attempt to  create it. I will not attempt to define it here today, but suffice it  to say that, in six decades and over the course of more than 50 studio  albums and 3,000 songs, Dolly discovered the genre's secrets and  mastered them all.   Twenty years ago, Dolly famously mused, ``If somebody said, `You're  [[Page S6995]]  going to have to do one or the other. You're going to have to give up  your music or you're going to go back to being poor,' I would go poor,  totally broke, and start over and do my music. That's how much I love  it.''   On behalf of all Tennesseans, I thank you, Dolly, for giving so much  of yourself to us. The world is a better and richer place because of  your music, and we love you for it.                            ____________________     Madam President, December is always a time of  transitions here on Capitol Hill, and it is time for Team Blackburn to  recognize the transition of our defense fellow, GySgt Martin Aleman,  away from the Senate and toward a bright future rising in the ranks of  the Marine Corps.   On the Armed Services Committee, we spend a great deal of time  considering how the decisions we make in this building will affect  budgets and workload and our overall national security; but paramount  to me is the effect it will have on servicemembers and their families  at home and abroad.   Since day one of his fellowship, Martin has been a bottomless well of  information about what it is like to actually serve in the military.  His stories from his service--sometimes entertaining, sometimes  sobering--helped us remember that when all is said and done, each line  item in a bill, dollar authorized, and penny spent will change the  lives of the brave men and women who put on the uniform.   Martin, we will miss you, but I am sure Casondra is more than ready  to reclaim the time our hectic schedule stole from you this past year.  I wish you the best of luck as you take the next step in your already  impressive career.                            ____________________     Madam President, this month, Team Blackburn is saying  goodbye to Srdjan Simunovic, who has spent 2 years with us as part of a  fellowship program between my office and the Oak Ridge National  Laboratory, which is just outside of Knoxville, TN.   Most staff here on Capitol Hill dabble in politics. Even our most  dedicated policy staff tend to have ambitions that extend beyond their  chosen portfolio, but the position of Oak Ridge fellow is special in  that it attracts people whose expertise transcends politics.   It has been such a pleasure working with Srdjan over the past 2 years  and watching him open my team's eyes to the truly marvelous things  Tennesseans are doing at Oak Ridge. We will miss him tremendously, but  I know his wife Marina and son Thomas will be grateful to have him home  full time.   Srdjan, thank you for giving 2 years of your life to Team Blackburn.  We wish you all the best with what comes next.                            ____________________
