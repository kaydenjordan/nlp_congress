 Mr. Speaker, thank you for your patience as we get  ourselves set up here.   Mr. Speaker, I obviously try to do this every week we are here, and  my goal is not to sound like some idiot economics professor. I am  trying to point out the biggest thing that is ahead of us, the reason  we are here, and the hardest thing we talk about.   I want to start off by saying that, apparently, I hurt some people's  feelings in the last two floor speeches when I walked through the math,  and I don't care. The math is the math, and the math will win. The math  always eventually wins. This is substantially a math-free zone.   Another thing I want to point out for some of the folks who end up  watching a video of this and they get cranky that there is no one in  the House. That is actually the way it is supposed to be. They are  supposed to be off in their committees or other places working.   This is our chance to talk to the body. Please understand that we are  on hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of televisions right now talking  to staff. The reason I show up with these charts is trying to see if  you can breakthrough and understand just the scale of what is going on.    Remember, we have a debt and demographics issue, and that is the  thing that just enrages me. If you are on the left, you say we don't  tax enough. If you are on the right, we can't cut enough, which I am  more on the cut side; however, you still got a mathematical problem.   I will show you in some of the slides that you can get rid of every  dime of Defense and every dime of discretionary and you are still  borrowing hundreds of billions of dollars.   Last year, we borrowed 8.4 percent of the economy. Ever hear these  discussions about having a 2 percent GDP growth? Okay. Fine. That is  what long-run projection is. We borrowed 8.4. That is just the  borrowing, not the spend. That is what we borrowed.   It is also one of the reasons we have tried now not to talk in  percentages of GDP because no one has any idea what the hell you are  talking about.   Mr. Speaker, let's actually have some fun here. We are going to  actually try to break this up in two or three different presentations  over the next couple weeks.   Today, I am just going to relay out the math, see if any of it still  sinks through. Then next week, we are going to try something that we  haven't done in a few months. We are going to come in with optimism  that the breakthroughs in healthcare, the breakthroughs in  technologies, the opportunities that are out there will help us bend  the debt curve.                                time  1230    Once again, I am going to go back to a sentence I had a couple  moments ago, for those who will text my office, call my office, fuss at  me when I am in Costco and say, ``David, I want you to balance the  budget this year.'' I can do it. You just have to be willing to let me  get rid of all of defense, all of discretionary, and $300 or $400  billion of your Medicare. That is how upside-down the numbers are.   Let's walk through some of this. We are two-plus months into this  fiscal year, and the number one spend this fiscal year will be Social  Security. Now, let's talk about this for a moment.   Social Security is its own trust fund, its own funding mechanism.  None of the money is spent in the general fund; it is loaned to the  general fund. Social Security gets these special Treasury notes, and  then they are paid interest twice a year. If you ever geek out and you  are someone who watches U.S. debt and all of a sudden there is this  sudden spike, often that is actually because we made our twice-a-year  interest payment to Social Security, but it is separate.   You have also got to understand the flip side of that. In 8 or 9  years, when the Social Security trust fund is empty, it doesn't have a  claim on the general fund, either.   CBO put out a number of 2033. The Social Security actuaries, which I  think are a year behind in their reports, had projected 2034. However,  let's use CBO's number. CBO projects that a 25 percent cut in your  check is coming in 8\1/2\, 9 years.   For the average couple in America on Social Security, I think that is  like a $17,400 cut. We will double poverty in the senior population in  America. Okay. It is immoral, and the solution we get is, okay, just  raise these taxes, do the cap.   Now, we are still working on the math because it turns out Tax  Foundation, the actuaries, and CBO have vastly different modeling  numbers. We found a couple interesting nuggets, the Democrat bill does  cut benefits, it cuts benefits on high-income earners where they told  us they would never cut benefits.   We are starting to realize rhetoric is often different than reality  when you are trying to make the math work.   Hopefully, in the next couple of weeks we will actually have nailed  down the actual impact, but right now it looks like raising the cap on  Social Security, doing these other mechanisms still does not close that  $616 billion shortfall. That is a $616 billion shortfall. That is the  very first year the Social Security trust fund is gone.   Why this isn't talked about constantly here, when defense is like  $830 billion, and just the shortfall in a single year in Social  Security is over $600 billion, does anyone see the scale we are talking  about?   Understand, if we use the tax solutions, where you say we are just  going to raise these taxes, we are going to take everyone over $400,000  or just everyone, and you are going to pay the extra 12.4 percent, and  then we are going to tax some of these unrealized capital gains and  these things to make up that difference. Okay. If that is the Democrat  solution, you have just used up your entire opportunity because there  is no more money.   What do you do with the other two-thirds of the borrowing, which is  the shortfall in Medicare? You have no more capacity. We are going to  walk through that.   Why this board here is so important to understand is: in 2024, Social  Security will be $1.450 trillion this year, so $1 trillion, $450  billion. Social Security is our number one spend.   Gross interest, that means the interest we pay to Social Security but  also the interest we pay to whoever has been willing to buy one of our  bonds, is over a trillion dollars this year. Interest now is number  two. Interest is now number two this fiscal year. That wasn't supposed  to happen for like 8, 10 years, and it happened.   Number three is Medicare.  [[Page H6735]]    Number four on our spend is defense.   When you have someone who runs around saying, Cut defense, that is  where all our spending is, they are either willfully ignorant or they  are just out of date, they are just so out of date.   Demographics is the driver of our debt, and it is so hard to talk  about that because for one thing, it is not Republican or Democrat. Us  becoming gray hairs, it is not Republican or Democrat, it is math. The  solutions may ultimately be partisan, but what we are as a society  isn't.   I am going to be much more gentle because I have someone behind me,  so I am not going to throw the boards. That was also one of the  complaints.   One more time, the exact thing I just said, but I made it into a bar  chart because the bar chart is much easier to see, particularly on the  television. This is our Social Security. This is interest.   Now, if you say, David, it is not fair to use gross interest because  we are paying ourselves. We are not paying ourselves; we are paying the  trust fund. Remember, we just talked about Social Security being its  own. If you want to conflate the two, then you are sort of breaking the  wall, but God bless you.   If you just go to net interest, it is still right there as the second  biggest expense we have in the Federal Government this year, and then  you have Medicare, and defense now is number four.   Why does this matter? The number of folks who live in this sort of  mathematical fantasy world--and just skip 1965, you can see, but do you  see this red here? This is last year's spend. Seventy-three percent of  the Federal Government's spending was on autopilot, we don't get to  vote on it. You get elected to Congress; you do not vote on 73 percent  of all the spending because it is formula.   You worked your 40 quarters; you got Social Security. You hit a  certain age and participate; you get your Medicare. You are part of a  certain tribal group, you get this. These are things that are formulas.  You fall below a certain income, you get these.   Defense was 13 percent of our spending last year. Well, defense is  really tricky. Yes, we need modernization. Maybe some of the large  weapon platforms need a revolution in technology, those things. That is  fine. However, the fighting you hear, the fighting that ultimately  removed the Speaker, the things that go on here are over this little  green wedge here that is 15 percent, 15 percent.    The punch line you need to just burn into your mind, all of this  green is borrowed, all this blue is borrowed, and last year about $400  billion of the red was borrowed. Everything a Member of Congress votes  on is borrowed money. Sink that in. Everything we vote on is on  borrowed money.   The frustrating thing is we have absolute battles here on the floor  and in our committees, trying to save a little here, trying to save a  little there. Fine, we should do it. One of the reasons the approps  bills are taking so long is we are breaking them down line item by line  item, saying, does this make sense? But stop pretending that at the end  of 10 years you will even notice those differences. They won't even  show up as rounding errors because we are borrowing.   This is really important to me and forgive me if it is slightly  narcissistic. I don't mean it to be. We are trying to find some way to  communicate math.   We started something in our office a couple of weeks ago where you  can go to our official website, and you can sign up. Just give me your  name and your cell number, and every day we are going to text you--and  I know this is really exciting--what the day's borrowing was and what  the day's tax receipts were. We are going to do it two ways, so we are  doing it absolutely intellectually honest. We are going to give you a  364-day clock, so no timing effects because you know Treasury, at the  end of the fiscal year plays some game where they roll some of the  spending into the next year. There are all these timing effects.  Following that, we give you the actual fiscal year.   Mr. Speaker, I won't ask you to actually answer this because I am  actually not supposed to have the dialogue with you, but it is always  fun to point at you.   What would you guess we are borrowing per second, a per second  borrow? I think as of yesterday, because we printed this a couple days  ago, we were at $78,480 per second.   You can sign up on our website and get this wonderful text message  sent to you every day with the actual facts, not the made-up crap that  goes on here. The number of times I hear people speaking behind these  microphones, and you are pulling out your calculator and wondering,  where did they come up with that? They just make things up because  these numbers are so difficult.   If you actually do so far this fiscal year--and it will change as tax  collections come in--we are over $112,000 per second in borrowing; and  of that $78,000 we are borrowing right now per second over the last 364  days, $30,000 to $35,000 of that now is interest.   It gets worse because a lot of the bonds we sold over the last couple  years--because we are idiots--we sold short on the curve, so we had  incredibly low interest rates, and now those bonds are going to have to  be refinanced at these higher interest rates.   I am going to put this chart back. We are just trying to help people  understand. Interest is one of our great fragilities. What that means  is, what happens when Congress is no longer in charge of the Federal  budget, but the bond market is? The bond market gets cranky.   Look, 3 weeks ago we had a 30-year bond auction--I appreciate the  chairman of the Ways and Means Committee letting me take my  subcommittee, and we brought in some of the bond market experts. The  hearing, once again, denigrated back into Republican-Democrat talking  points, which frustrated me because we were supposed to have a serious  conversation.   Three weeks ago, we had a 30-year bond auction where the broker- dealers, the market makers had to take 24 percent of it. Now, everybody  that is listening, you just went, huh?   What happens when there are so few buyers or there is so much  inventory that has to be sold that the broker-dealers don't have enough  credit line to take it all down?   Does that become a failed bond auction?   Do we start to see stress in the world bond market?   Remember, the entire world uses our bonds as the oil, the liquidity  that keeps financial markets working here and around the world, our  mortgages, everything else.   Intellectually, I don't think we understand the serious nature of  what a chart like this tells you when you start looking at gross  interest just marching along, and then this is functionally the last 12  months, so you had some of the lower interest rates in the beginning of  2023. Remember, interest rates didn't really start to move until April  last year, and this is showing, just in the last 12 months, we  functionally added $923 billion in financing costs on those interest  rates. This year it is going to be over a trillion.    Then you come over here, and you start looking at things like net  interest. Net interest is ultimately going up, gross interest is  starting to--the two lines are meeting. Why?   Because the trust funds are getting smaller and smaller because they  are shrinking. Remember, the transportation trust fund is gone in a few  years. Medicare part A, the hospital portion, is gone in 7 years,  Social Security is gone in 8\1/2\, 9 years. You have got to understand  that also has an effect on our borrowing because we can't borrow  internally.   I don't think you need to see this board because I have said it like  six times, we are borrowing $1 trillion gross interest this year.   This one is important. I feel like an idiot, I feel like I am the  only one coming up here and screaming about this. It is like,  Schweikert stop telling us things we don't want, there is math  involved.   What was the movie, there was a joke, or is it Chevy Chase on  ``Saturday Night Live,'' 30 years ago I was promised there would be no  math?   This chart is very, very simple. We have done an estimate with the  Joint Economic economists that we are going to bring this fiscal year  $9.6 trillion to the bond market. About $2 trillion of that will be  what we call virgin, that is new borrowing to cover our shortfall  because about 30 percent of everything we spend is on borrowed money.  The rest is being refinanced.  [[Page H6736]]    You go, what do we care, it is refinancing?   We are now refinancing at much higher interest rates. If we are  blessed, you know, 10 years, a little over 4, but that thing used to be  at 0.6, 0.7. That gap is why we estimate--and so does Treasury, so does  OMB--that we are going to spend over a trillion dollars in interest,  and now it is our second biggest expense. It just continues.                                time  1245    How do you think about this? We actually had 2 months last year--now,  this is timing effects when tax receipts come in and those things-- where we were borrowing to make our interest payments.   Think about that. We were borrowing to be able to pay for our  borrowing. Does anyone care? Is it just too complicated? This is the  reality.   Yet, if you ever listen to us, and, in particular, my brothers and  sisters on the left, they will be behind this microphone saying, if we  just tax rich people, we will be fine. Let's keep spending.   These are major components of the 2023 Federal budget. I am not going  to walk you through all the line items, but here is the basic point.   If you break it out per household, last year, our spending was over  $48,000 a household. Okay. Receipts, that means tax collections,  everything, you know, from excise taxes to income taxes, capital gains,  all of them.   We spent $48,000 per household last year. We took in $33,800. Anyone  see a problem? Structurally, this gets uglier every year, uglier the  next year, uglier the next year.   It is not because of mandatory spending. It is not because we are  spending more money on foreign aid or spending more money on this and  that. It is demographics.   I can show you slides, and I am going to show a couple of these. It  is always the ones I get the most angry emails about.   Mr. Speaker, 100 percent of the spending from today through the next  30 years, 100 percent, according to the CBO--and if anyone has ever  read the CBO reports--Medicare and its interest for its shortfall.   Remember, its cash shortfall is I think $88 trillion over those 30  years and Social Security, if we choose to backfill it, in 9 years when  the trust fund is gone.   It is functionally healthcare and if we choose to backfill Social  Security. So Medicare--healthcare, is the primary driver. It is 70-plus  percent of all future borrowing.   The brain trust here, we will come behind these microphones, and we  talk about financing it. ObamaCare is a financing bill. The ACA is a  financing bill, who gets subsidized and who has to pay.   Let's be honest. Our Republican alternative was a financing bill. It  is who had to pay and who got subsidized.   Medicare for all is a financing bill. None of it is about the  adoption of technology that makes people healthier.   I have come behind this microphone a handful of times this year and  showed the data from the Joint Economic Committee, the Republican  report, go to Chapter 3, and we did some very difficult things, and  they worked very hard.   I vetted this for weeks. We did the thing we hate to talk about, but  it is amazing, the numbers. We talked about diabetes and obesity in  America.   What would happen if I could come to you right now and say the most  powerful thing you could do to roll down U.S. sovereign debt is take on  obesity in America? The morality.   It is also one of the most powerful things you can do for income  inequality, for my Tribal populations, for the rural poor, for the  urban poor.   We actually had some other crazy data talking about the labor force  participation that would go up and family formation.   Is that Republican or Democrat? It is just moral. It is a solution.  It was a few trillion dollars over the 10 years--the single most  powerful thing you could do.   How many people have you had come behind these microphones and want  to talk about we need to help our brothers and sisters live? We are  about to have a fifth year of life expectancy falling in America. Our  brothers and sisters are dying.   If you look at the data, drugs are right up there. Obesity is even  higher. Is it just because you are going to get nasty people saying  horrible things about you on social media? Well, screw them. Morality  is on our side. It is great economics. It is also the right thing to  do, and it is really hard around here.   Let's actually talk about one of the other things. If I get one more  leftist, well, you guys supported tax reform. Okay. The single biggest  movement in closing income inequality, single biggest movement in  raising wages without raising inflation because it allocated money.   Smartly designed tax reform actually puts the money where it gets the  greatest amount of productive growth.   Remember your basic high school economics class. What are the two  ways you get paid more? Inflation. Well, that doesn't get you anything.  When your check goes up for inflation, you are just treading water.   Productivity. We had stagnant productivity for a couple decades. We  did tax reform at the very end of 2017, and we had 2018, 2019, the  first quarter of 2020 before the pandemic, and it was the ultimate  Goldilocks because we were growing. Wages were going up. The poor were  getting less poor. We didn't set off inflation. Income inequality is  shrinking.   The Democrats keep saying, well, the face cost of that was going to  be $1.7 trillion. Yes, we were taking in dramatically more tax receipts  than we ever expected, and it actually added a whole bunch to the life  expectancy of Social Security. Stunning amounts of money came back  repatriated from overseas, but it was a tax cut.   The same brain trust on the left who is attacking tax reform forgets  in just 20 months, President Biden's initiatives have added $4.8  trillion to the 10-year deficit.   They come at us hard. We did tax reform, and the face value of that  was $1.7 trillion, but they have added $4.8 trillion, and it is like  they forget.   This also set off--the best economists--I want to be honest on this-- set off half of inflation. Some of it was supply chain. Half of it was  the amount of stimulus the Democrats dumped into the economy.   I have done it here on the floor showing that the 30 months of  inflation we just had was the single biggest modern tax hike. Whether  you know it or not, you have been crushed.   If you live in the Phoenix-Scottsdale market, and you are not making  22, 23 percent more today than you did 30 months ago, you are poorer.   The brilliance of the left's not liking inflation but not screaming  about it or trying to crush it because there are things we could have  done in this body to help roll down inflation, but it would have  required policy, and it would have required them to admit it was  crushing the working population, particularly the working poor, and the  dirty little secret is it changed the debt to GDP because inflation  devalues the existing debt. You get to pay it back with inflated  dollars.   Whether you know it or not, you are about 20 percent poorer today  than you were 30 months ago. If your paycheck hasn't gone up, if you  are in the Phoenix-Scottsdale area, if you haven't gone up about 22  percent, you are poorer today. It is math.   We keep coming back to the understanding of the scale of the drivers  of our debt. I am not going to belabor this board. I have done it  before.   We can get rid of every dime of discretionary. There is no defense.  There is no State Department. There is no Supreme Court. There is no  Congress. That might actually be a good thing, but there is nothing.  You are still borrowing. Even at the end of 10 years, you are still  borrowing.   To help you understand the scale--and this one I have done entire  presentations on, and this is the one where I get the most interesting  comments from Democrats.   Well, we need to tax people over $400,000 more. Okay. Dirty, fun  little secret. If you made $400,000 4 years ago, 3 years ago, today  your purchasing power is probably 320, 328.   Part of the scam here is let inflation run a bit. You have heard of  bracket creep; same sort of concept. There is a great paper out there.  It is on the Manhattan Institute's, Brian Riedl, where  [[Page H6737]]  he basically took all sorts of studies, leftist studies, OMB studies,  CBO studies, and said, Mr. Speaker, what would happen if you basically  maximized every tax rate, if you took people over $400,000 and said, I  am going to maximize their income tax?   There are formulas now because we have really good modeling for this.  We can get them up to this tax rate before it changes their economic  effects, and the revenues actually go down.   Maximize their capital gains. Maximize their estate tax. Maximize  everything. Adjust for the economic effects.   If you don't believe me, go read the paper. You will get about 1.1 to  2 percent of GDP in new tax receipts. Okay.   Let's split the difference. Let's call it 1.6 of new taxes by  maximizing every tax rate of those over 400,000. Okay.   The reality is the majority of the people that make over $400,000  vote for Democrats anyway, so I don't know why we keep trying to say,  but the economics are theater.   Back to the point when we began. What did we borrow last year? Anyone  listen? We borrowed 8.4 percent of GDP--8.4.   The Democrats' solution covers 1.6 of it. When they do that, the  capacity we need to be able to cover the shortfalls in Social Security,  Medicare, if there is a disaster, if there is a war--we have no more  capacity. This is how fragile we are as a society and intellectually  vacuous, the debate here is.   Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I will try to wrap this up in the next  couple boards so the gentleman from Texas can have his time.   This is pretty much the same thing. We actually did the modelling on  the permanent deficit, its interest carrying costs. That is what is  over here in whatever earth tones that is.   One of the things I have heard the Progressive Caucus talk about,  there is some absurd thing called the oligarch's tax where they are  going to find really rich people, and the richer they are, they are  just going to take portions of their unearned income or their assets.  Okay. Fine.   I guess that is where the left's brain is, but you have to stop lying  to people about the math. It only covers a tiny fraction of the  borrowing.   Part of this even comes from one of the progressive group's own math.  It is revenge for people who made a bunch of money, who vote for them  and contribute to them, and then they make up the math.   This is such an absurd place. Look. Maybe no one actually cares. I  have come here in the past and sort of showed the trajectory we are on  to the amount of our economy that will be in debt, and we are already  right here.    Remember, this is a chart that if you actually start to do the  baseline, and you start to actually do different baseline annual  growths--you have to understand, in less than a decade, if our annual  growth does not exceed the mean, meaning we only grow at a half a  percent over those years, we are already at 125 percent debt to GDP.   Now, because we are the reserve currency, we get a little bit of a  SPIF for more capacity, but basically you have to understand the  number.   The time for doing something was actually a couple years ago. Every  day we wait, the policy options--and this is going to be part of my  closing, and I am going to say it two or three times.   The policy options close because there are things you need to do  policywise. If you look at all the taxes the left wants to do--I just  showed you a slide--it comes in about 1.5, 1.6 percent of GDP. We  borrowed 8.4 last year.   The things we can cut. I can get you a couple of points of GDP we can  cut, and I am willing to do some very difficult cuts.   Is it rational for us to borrow money on our nondefense discretionary  and send it to States and jurisdictions that have their own taxing  authority? We are basically playing a game of here is some free money  that we are borrowing. Well, that is $300 billion of the discretionary,  but that is a fraction of the GDP.   The two ends here, that means the actual structural deficit that is  actually from the demographics, you need a revolution in the costs. You  can't tax enough, and you can't cut enough. It is math.                                time  1300    Once again, another model out there that shows once you do the actual  economic effects of taxing the rich, it gets you only a fraction of the  10-year deficit.   I am going to close on this board because it is the board that  enrages most people. It is the one that has been modeled by left  groups, right groups, some of the honest universities, back to the  point I have made. This board is already a year out of date, meaning  when it says over the next 30 years, we will have $116 trillion in  borrowed money, we have a model in our office that is approaching $130  trillion with the higher interest rates.   On this one, $77 trillion of that shortfall over the next 30 years is  Medicare. It is healthcare costs.   Another one is a $38 trillion shortfall if we backfill Social  Security and the shortfall there.   It is immoral what this body is doing by avoiding, and every day that  we avoid, you find yourself saying taxes are your only opportunity,  though I have just spent the last half an hour trying to explain policy  is where the money is at.   Making people healthier is the single-biggest thing you can do to  reduce the U.S. debt. Actually, you reduce it but stabilize it because  we are going to continue to grow it because we are getting old, and our  healthcare costs are going to go up.   Can we use technology? Can we use cures? I could come to you tomorrow  and point out the simple fact that 33 percent of all healthcare  spending is diabetes. A revolution in our brothers and sisters with  diabetes, which we know how to do it now--we actually have  pharmaceuticals that are remarkable, and I am not thrilled with talking  about pharmaceuticals, but the math is the math. We sometimes have to  deal with the reality in front of us.   If we can cut diabetes in half in America--let's see, 15 percent of  U.S. healthcare costs is about $700 billion a year. If you cut 33  percent and then get the economic effects of people being able to work  and other things, so a trillion dollars a year.   I mean, you start to understand this doesn't have to be dour. It  doesn't have to be dystopian. There is hope. It just requires thinking  and maybe owning a calculator and reading.   We are too busy saying the same crap to our voters because they  applaud for us. Even though it is 20 years out of date, we say the same  crap over and over.   I have been here 10 years. When I first got elected, 1 out of 8 was  65. Today, it is like 1 out of 5.8 is now 65. Demographics is our  destiny.   Why are we incapable of telling each other the truth?   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
