 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  4468, the Choice in Automobile Retail Sales Act, or CARS Act, that I  proudly co-led with Representative Walberg.   This important legislation would prohibit the Biden administration's  EPA from finalizing, implementing, administering, or enforcing its  radical proposed rule that seeks to eliminate gas-powered vehicles.  Additionally, the CARS Act would restrict the EPA's authority under the  Clean Air Act to promulgate similar rules moving forward. Hallelujah.   In April, President Biden's EPA proposed this radical rule that would  set emission standards so high for light- and medium-duty vehicles that  auto manufacturers would be forced to produce a higher percentage of  electric vehicles just to comply. This is a de facto electric vehicle  mandate on the American people. With this rule's implementation, the  EPA projects that EVs could account for as much as 67 percent of new  light-duty vehicle sales by 2032, as compared to electric vehicle sales  of only 6 percent last year.   From assaulting the American people's Second Amendment liberties to  the online censoring of free speech, the Biden administration is  routinely abusing its power in order to further control Americans'  everyday lives. With this new EPA rule, it is very clear that President  Biden is now coming for our combustion engine car keys in his war  against our personal freedoms.   Restricting consumer choice in the name of the left's Green New Deal  garbage agenda represents an illegitimate power grab that hardworking  Americans simply cannot afford.   One thing is clear. The American people already burdened by soaring  energy prices and record-high inflation cannot be further burdened by  this disastrous EV mandate.                                time  1245    I urge my colleagues to support the CARS Act, our commonsense  legislation that would help save the American energy sector. It would  protect both American consumers and auto manufacturers, and it would  stop Biden's authoritarian government overreach in its tracks.
