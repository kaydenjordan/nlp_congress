 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the  resolution.   It is shameful that the temporary Republican majority continue to  waste the American people's time with baseless accusations and  rightwing conspiracy theories.   Instead of joining House Democrats to address the gun violence  epidemic, we are forced to debate on gas stoves and partisan grudges.  This resolution today is motivated by the same groups and individuals  who to this day promote the lie that the 2020 election was stolen--a  lie that Adam Schiff stood up to time and time again.   I have had the privilege of serving alongside Adam in the California  delegation and the January 6th Committee. He has never shied away from  taking on the toughest fights, and he is not going to be intimidated by  anyone, including the former President or his allies.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand with the gentleman from California  today, and I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to this  resolution.
