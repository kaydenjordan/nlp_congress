 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Searching  for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily Burdensome Act, or  the SCRUB Act.   This legislation establishes a commission to review existing Federal  regulations and report to Congress those that should be repealed to  reduce unnecessary costs to the economy--kind of like a regulation  report card.   Federal rules and regulations have sucked the life out of our small  businesses for the last 8 years. Unlike some lawmakers, I have the  unique experience of having operated a business under Obama-era rules  and regulations. Let me tell you that it was very difficult. Our  struggles were not an isolated event. Georgians and Americans across  the country bore those same burdens.   We are ready for growth and innovation and an environment that  encourages an economy like we have never seen before. The SCRUB Act is  a solid step forward in restoring life to the American small-business  community.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                            ____________________
