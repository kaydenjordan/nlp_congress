 Madam President, on November 15, 2021, I was unable to  be present for the rollcall vote No. 466 on the Motion to invoke  cloture on Executive Calendar No. 401, the nomination of Graham Steele  to be an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury.   However, had I been present, I would have voted in favor of the  motion to invoke cloture. I supported Mr. Steele's nomination based on  his strong track record as a respected expert on financial policy and  consumer protection and his years of service in senior level positions  here in the Senate.                            ____________________
