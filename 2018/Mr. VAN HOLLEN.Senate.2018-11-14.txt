 Mr. President, today the Senate will complete work on  a new 2-year authorization for the U.S. Coast Guard, the Federal  Maritime Commission, and on regulations related to vessel discharges  and other matters.   This bill is intended to give our Coast Guard the certainty it needs  to operate in a constantly changing environment, and I appreciate the  significant bipartisan work that has gone into the legislation we vote  on today. Maryland is  [[Page S6940]]  home to the Coast Guard yard in Curtis Bay, our Nation's facility for  maintaining and repairing the Coast Guard fleet, and I am proud of the  work they do every day to support the security of our Nation and ships  at sea. However, I remain concerned with title IV of this bill, the  Vessel Incidental Discharge Act, VIDA, which would regulate ballast  water discharge from ships in the United States. While these provisions  have improved since they were first brought to the floor, the title  continues to preempt State authority on ballast water discharge from  ships. The State of Maryland currently has a more protective standard  that is critical to maintaining a healthy Chesapeake Bay. The  Chesapeake Bay Watershed is enormous: 64,000 square miles, part of six  States and the entire District of Columbia, and almost 18 million  people.   The Chesapeake Bay is one of Maryland's crown jewels, and it is of  upmost importance to me that we continue the progress in cleaning up  the bay. The Chesapeake Bay is a delicate ecosystem that is  particularly sensitive to invasive species that can be spread through  ballast water discharge. These invasive species could compete with our  native species in the bay like blue crab, oysters, and striped bass.   There are many provisions of this bill that I will support through  the conference process, including additional funding for operating  expenses and acquisition funding and $30 million for environmental  compliance and restoration. The Coast Guard yard in Curtis Bay is  currently on EPA's National Priorities List and the Coast Guard's  priority list and is eligible for this funding.   The bill also includes a provision that allows for incentive payments  to go to Curtis Bay's wage-grade employees who demonstrate improvements  in performance or delivery during a project.   I hope to gain clarity on section 310 of the bill, which claims to  provide more flexibility to choose where ship alterations or repairs  can occur. I am concerned that this provision may have unintended  consequences in certain situations, particularly with respect to the  Coast Guard yard. As this bill moves to conference and eventually the  President, I hope to work with my colleagues to clear up this provision  and will continue to advocate for the rights of States like Maryland to  protect their clean water.   I will vote no today, but believe that we can continue to improve  this bill in the conference process. I look forward to working with my  colleagues to do so.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, on the week we celebrated  Veterans Day, I wish to pay particular tribute to our Nation's women  veterans. Maryland women served our Nation long before they were  permitted to serve in the military, from Mary Digges Lee, who collected  money and supplies to support the Revolutionary Army, to Harriet Tubman  who spied for the Union in the Civil War. Today Maryland is home to  over 50,000 women veterans. Our Maryland National Guard is led by the  extraordinary Adjutant General Linda L. Singh and, for the first time  this year, an all-woman command staff.   As we honor our veterans, we must also keep the promises we made, as  a nation, to them. That requires understanding and addressing the  unique and complex needs of our women veterans. We know that they  suffer higher rates of PTSD and suicide than their civilian  counterparts and have medical issues that are too often overlooked or  ignored. Later this week, I will be meeting with some truly heroic  Maryland women who have served their Nation and continue to serve each  other. I look forward to their insight on the programs and services  they use and the ways we can expand the networks that might deliver the  support our women veterans deserve.   This Congress has worked on a bipartisan basis to support our  Nation's veterans, and we must continue those efforts. There is still  much to do, from ensuring that the VA system delivers the care and  programming that Congress has authorized, to assessing the feasibility  of peer-to-peer assistance for women veterans, with emphasis placed on  women who suffered service-related sexual trauma or who are at risk of  becoming homeless.   We live in freedom because of those brave Americans who have chosen  to take up the mantle of service in uniform; they deserve our full  support in making the transition to civilian life, on an equal footing,  regardless of gender, after that service is finished. Women veterans  should not face unequal treatment; we need to broaden the discussion  and strive to make things better for America's daughters who have  served. Every veteran must know that they have our respect and  gratitude and that we will support them as thanks for their sacrifice.                            ____________________
