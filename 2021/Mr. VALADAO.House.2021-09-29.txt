 Madam Speaker, I rise today to again request an urgent  response to the California drought crisis.   Members of Congress have been back in Washington for legislative  business for over one week, and still, my colleagues in the majority  refuse to take up this issue.   My legislation, the NEED Water Act and the RENEW WIIN ACT, are  critical steps to addressing California's ongoing drought and the water  shortages farmers and communities continually face in the State.   Water is the top issue for many families in my district. Securing  this vital resource for our farmers and ensuring communities have a  clean, reliable source of water has always been a priority of mine in  Congress.   It is disappointing that the House majority does not share my  priority of taking care of families in rural California and supporting  farmers that feed our entire Nation.   I implore my colleagues to step across the aisle to work with me to  address the suffering of families and farmers in California.  Communities in my district and across the State urgently need our help.                            ____________________
