 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to  congressional Republicans' attempt to repeal Fair Pay and Safe  Workplaces protections for Federal contract workers.   We all know President Trump is no fan of transparency. He has  steadfastly refused to disclose his own tax returns, so it is no  surprise that he and the Republicans would oppose disclosure of labor,  employment, civil rights, and nondiscrimination law violations by  bidders for Federal contracts.   What I really don't understand is why Members of Congress would ask  American taxpayers to subsidize companies that routinely violate our  labor laws. Voting for this resolution actually rewards companies that  discriminate, stiff their employees on pay, or cut corners on safety,  and it puts responsible businesses that play by the rules at a  disadvantage.   This resolution harms women. Women make up the majority of low-wage  workers. Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces protections ensure that our tax  dollars do not support sexual harassment and sex discrimination on the  job, regular occurrences especially for low-wage working women.   This resolution harms veterans, including disabled veterans. Repeal  means that we won't know whether a contract bidder routinely violates  section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act, which Paralyzed Veterans of  America, Disabled American Veterans, and Vets First say is ``necessary  to prevent discrimination in the workplace and during the hiring  process.''   This resolution also harms older workers. To quote AARP: `` . . . age  discrimination in the workplace persists as a serious and pervasive  problem. The Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Executive Order is the first  executive order since 1964 addressing the obligation of those who  receive federal contracts not to discriminate on the basis of age.''   If you don't want your taxpayer dollars to be used to undermine Fair  Pay and Safe Workplaces protections, then all Members should oppose  this resolution.     Mr. Speaker, refugees that are fleeing for their  lives are not the enemy. Look at this 3-year-old Syrian boy, Aylan  Kurdi, who washed up on a beach in Turkey. He and his older brother and  his mother drowned. They were among, literally, thousands of people who  drowned escaping the violence that was certain in their home country of  Syria.   Now the President is trying to keep them out of our country. He is  condemning more children like Aylan to their death with this executive  order. And in face of this immoral action by the administration, I have  witnessed the decency and generosity of people in my district. I was  proud to join people of all faiths in rallies to support our refugees  and our Muslim neighbors.   I was with lawyers who rushed to O'Hare Airport to offer assistance  to those who suddenly are detained under the executive order.   I have received hundreds of letters. One was from a couple who had  joined with 13 friends to welcome and provide assistance to a family  that wanted to resettle from Syria. They had collected money. They had  collected furniture. They had worked for over a year in order to make  this happen, and they finally got word that they were actually going to  get a family to come.   Then, on January 30, they got official word that the family would not  be allowed to enter. And now they don't know what happened to that  family.   Let me just read the end of that letter. He said:         Now we don't know what happened to the family. Because they       are Syrian, they are indefinitely banned from the United       States.  [[Page H928]]       Meanwhile, we have a warm apartment and $12,000 waiting for       them. We have rooms full of furniture stockpiled, and no way       to get to them.        As a group of Chicagoans, as a second-generation American       myself, we came together to aid a family in dire need and to       affirm the quintessential American values of openness and       inclusiveness.        I can't stop thinking about that couple, what they are       telling their children right now, and where they will sleep       tonight.        Turning our back on families and children who are fleeing a       war is not our best strategic interest as a nation, nor is it       in our best interest as decent human beings.    Thank you from Maria Demopolis, Chicago, Illinois.
