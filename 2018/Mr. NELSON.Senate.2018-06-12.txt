 Mr. President, while the Senator from Kentucky is here, I  want to get his attention and say that the very laudatory comments the  majority whip has said about the Senator--I can add to the accolades  for the Senator from Kentucky by pointing out that he and I have a  common trait, a common denominator between us: We both married above  ourselves. His wife, the Honorable Elaine Chao, now our Secretary of  Transportation, former  [[Page S3738]]  Secretary of Labor--they are truly one of the remarkable couples of  political leadership in the Nation's Capital. I congratulate him on the  comments by the majority whip today.                                 Gun Violence    Mr. President, I am wearing this ribbon because the Orlando community  is mourning once again. Last night, there was another shooting, and a  number of people have been killed again. Today marks 2 years since the  tragic massacre at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, 2 years since a  gunman walked into the club with a Sig Sauer MCX assault rifle and  killed 49 innocent people. They were there celebrating Latin American  night at a gay nightclub. It was one of the deadliest mass shootings in  modern U.S. history with 49 deaths, only to be eclipsed by the massacre  of 58 people a year ago in Las Vegas. In the carnage, a number of  people were severely wounded, and those who did not actually have  physical wounds have the mental and emotional wounds that are not  unlike the PTSD that our soldiers suffer from and have to be treated  for for years and years. That is true in the Orlando community as a  result of the massacre at the Pulse nightclub. Orlando is mourning  again at this 2-year mark.   There were some incredible things that came out of this. I have never  seen the Orlando community so united, with the leadership of the entire  community, regardless of their politics, wearing these kinds of ribbons  to point out their unity and using the phrase ``Orlando Strong.''   Today is a day to pause and honor the victims and the survivors and  to once again thank the first responders who put their lives on the  line to save so many more. Law enforcement was magnificent. The SWAT  team was magnificent. I talked to the SWAT team. There was one of the  SWAT members who actually had stitches across his forehead. But for  millimeters, he would have been dead. That was one of the rounds from  the assault rifle.   I talked to the trauma team at the Orlando regional hospital. A  trauma unit just so happened to be about 10 or 15 blocks from the Pulse  nightclub. But for that trauma unit, those trauma surgeons and their  courage in trying to get victims stabilized, there would have been more  deaths.   This is a day to look back on what we have actually done to prevent  another such tragedy from ever happening again. Unfortunately, not much  had happened until a bold, very courageous group of students after the  massacre in Parkland, FL, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School stood  up and said: We are going to make a difference.   The Orlando community is once again mourning today because last night  a gunman shot a police officer and then killed four young, innocent  children whom he was holding hostage in an apartment. It has happened  again. These children, all under the age of 12--one was just a 1-year- old--were killed by a man who, like so many others, shouldn't have had  a gun in the first place. When are we going to say enough is enough?   At some point Congress has to accept the fact that the only way to  change the current path is that we, as a society, are going to have to  take a step in the right direction to do the right thing. Yet you can  remember that a couple of years ago, in this body we tried to pass a  bill which said that if you were on the terrorist watch list, it was  going to be the law of the land that you could not buy a gun. Mind you,  if they are on the terrorist watch list, we think they are potentially  a terrorist and therefore cannot get on an airplane and fly on a  commercial airline, but we could not pass that to say that they could  not buy or acquire a gun.   So what we see that destroys our communities--we are going to have to  do more than increase security at schools with some wrongheaded  attempts to arm teachers. First of all, the teachers don't want to be  armed in schools. I will tell you who else doesn't want them to be  armed--the SWAT team that has to storm the school building looking for  the shooter, and then if they come upon a teacher with a gun, they  could think that teacher is the shooter.   We have to do more than increase funding for mental health or expand  background checks, which we desperately have to do. We need universal,  comprehensive background checks that would pick up red flags about  mental health issues like those of the Parkland shooter. We have to do  more than raise the minimum age to buy a gun or ban the sale of bump  stocks, which makes a semiautomatic assault rifle into an automatic--a  true military weapon.   At some point, Congress has to start standing up for the people it  represents. It has to turn a deaf ear to the special interests that  have locked down their votes here because they want to sell more guns.  At some point, Congress has to stand up to the NRA, which represents  the gun manufacturers--not the target shooters, not the hunters. It  represents the gun manufacturers to sell more guns.   I say this as a fellow who grew up on a ranch. I have had guns all of  my life and have hunted all my life. I still hunt with my son. An  assault rifle like an AR-15 is not for hunting; it is for killing. We  have to face the fact of banning the sale of military assault rifle  types and the long clips of some 30 rounds of ammunition.   The attack at the Pulse nightclub 2 years ago was an attack of both  terror and hate, and it was an attack on our fundamental American  values of dignity and equality. It was an attack designed to divide us  as a nation, but what we saw instead was an entire community and entire  country come together united.   In remembrance of the victims today in Orlando, you will see this  ribbon worn by many, many citizens in the community. On the 2-year date  of that horrific event, I want us to come together again in the same  way we did after Pulse in Orlando, the same way we did after Parkland  but, this time, not to help each other mourn to get through the tragedy  but to require real change to make sure that it is going to be more  difficult for this to happen again.   Aren't people beginning to realize there is way too much gun violence  in this country--and a lot of it since Sandy Hook Elementary School in  Connecticut? In my State of Florida, just this year, we have seen 17  students gunned down at Marjory Stoneman Douglas. Just in this year, 1  month after that, we saw another student shot at Forest High School in  Ocala. Just last month, a sheriff's deputy was shot and killed in Lake  Placid. Then, this week, we have awakened to the news of an officer  shot in Orlando and the deaths of four young children who were held  hostage.   We should not allow these shootings to become the new normal in this  country. This Senator has been involved in a lot of bipartisan bills to  prohibit known or suspected terrorists from purchasing firearms, to  empower our family members and law enforcement to take guns away from  relatives who pose a danger to themselves and others who bring up these  so-called red flags. These are sensible, bipartisan options to help  make our communities safer, yet there has been little movement in the  Senate to proceed on these proposals.   The student leaders of the March For Our Lives organization have said  it. The parents of the children at Sandy Hook have said it. Those who  have lost loved ones to suicide have said it. Two years after Pulse,  our resolve to end gun violence must be stronger than ever. It is time  for us to act. We realize that with practical politics, it is going to  be very, very difficult to move legislation, but we have to keep  trying.   Let's work on some real bipartisan, commonsense solutions to make our  communities safer. Let's work on how we can prevent these assault  weapons from getting into the wrong hands. Let's work together on how  we can stop massacres that continue to plague this country. We owe it  to the victims of the massacres and to their families. We owe it to  every American, who has the right to live without being in fear of this  violence. Just ask the students in the schools of America today if they  fear that violence.   Really, isn't enough enough?   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
