 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Abbe  Museum in Bar Harbor, ME, which is celebrating its 90th year of serving  the public. The Abbe Museum was founded by Dr. Robert Abbe, a prominent  New York physician, known for pioneering the use of radiation therapy,  who spent his summers in Bar Harbor. Dr. Abbe assembled a collection of  early Native American artifacts from the Frenchman Bay area and  persuaded others with similar collections to join with him to establish  a museum to protect and display these important objects for public  education and enjoyment.   The Abbe Museum was founded in 1926 and opened to the public on  August 14, 1928. It was first opened as a private museum at Sieur de  Monts Spring in Lafayette National Park, later renamed Acadia National  Park. That same year, the Abbe became the first institution in Maine to  also sponsor archaeological research. Today, the museum continues to  conduct excavations throughout the State and is now the main repository  for archaeological collections from the midcoast region.   While the initial focus was archaeology, the Abbe soon expanded to  include ethnographic materials from the 17th to the 20th centuries.  Three years after opening, Mary Cabot Wheelwright donated an important  collection of Native American baskets and other objects. Since then,  other major basket collections have been given to the museum, and it is  now home to the largest and best documented collection of Maine Indian  basketry. The Abbe also houses collections that document 12,000 years  of Native American culture and history in the State, and its  conservation program has been nationally recognized as a model for  other museums to follow.   Education and local involvement is also an important part of the work  at the Abbe. The Abbe has developed a number of publications to share  its knowledge with a larger audience. They offer many resources for  local students and educators, including a summer camp for children ages  7-12, opportunities for local school groups to visit the museum, and an  educator hub to help teachers bring Wabanaki history and culture into  their classrooms. Recently, Native Americans have become increasingly  involved in all aspects of the museum, including as members of the  board of trustees.   In 2013, the Abbe was honored as the first Smithsonian Affiliate in  the State of Maine. Being a part of this prestigious network, the Abbe  Museum now works closely with the Smithsonian Institution to serve the  public through custom developed education programs, traveling  exhibitions, and collaborative research. This partnership has allowed  the Abbe to take advantage of the resources of the Smithsonian  Institution and bring collections that have special significance to  Maine where they can be accessed by the Wabanaki communities.   I am proud to recognize the Abbe Museum for their work over the last  90 years. They have played an important role in educating the people of  Maine about the Wabanaki history of our land and expanding our  knowledge through research and exploration. I want to thank all those  who have been involved with the Abbe Museum over the last 90 years, and  I look forward to their continued success for many years to  come.                            ____________________
