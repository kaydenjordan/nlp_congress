 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to commemorate Faith Month.   As a member of the Christian faith, I see this month as a time to  reflect on my own faith journey. As an American, it is time to  celebrate the foundations of religious liberty that our country is  built upon and the resulting prosperity that it has brought.   Our country is home to over 150 million Christian believers. Now more  than ever, these Americans are under threat as their beliefs are  labeled bigoted, their places of worship are attacked, and their  religious protections are diminished.   Founding Father John Adams once said: ``Nothing is more dreaded than  the national government meddling with religion.'' I agree. In a world  increasingly hostile to people of faith, America must remain a refuge  for those looking to worship God without fear of state reprisal.   Proverbs 29:2 says: ``When the righteous are in authority, the people  rejoice; but when the wicked rule, the people mourn.''   Let us govern in a righteous manner and protect our fellow Americans'  freedom to practice their faith as they choose.
