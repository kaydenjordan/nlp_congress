 Madam Speaker, flu season is upon us, and I rise today to  raise awareness about the 100th anniversary of the deadliest medical  catastrophe in history: the 1918 influenza pandemic.   100 years ago, the flu took the lives of more Americans in 1 month  than in the entirety of World War I.   The 1918 flu pandemic lasted for 15 months. During that time, the  average American's life expectancy dropped by 12 years.   100 years later, there are still many outstanding questions about the  flu pandemic, but what is certain is that the flu virus still poses an  undeniable threat to our Nation.   Last year, an estimated 80,000 Americans died from the flu.   Investing in research and development for novel antivirals and  ensuring people get the flu vaccine is crucial to protecting our Nation  from another flu pandemic like the one we faced 100 years ago.                            ____________________     First, Mr. Speaker, I would like to start by thanking my  colleague, Congressman Garamendi, from the great State of California  for hosting this evening's Special Order hour on the threat climate  change poses for our Nation and our constituents.   Mr. Garamendi has done a great service by hosting timely and  important Special Orders throughout the 115th Congress. Today's Special  Order hour is especially important, as it comes on the heels of the  Trump administration's attempt to bury its own climate change report  and only a day after devastating fires in California were contained.   Because of global climate change, the United States is going to  suffer from more frequent and more devastating disasters like  Superstorm Sandy, which caused massive flooding in my State in 2012 and  the Camp fire, which is the deadliest and most destructive in  California's history.   Considering that Donald Trump thinks that climate change is an  international conspiracy, a hoax concocted by the Chinese, it came as  no surprise to me that he has released his own administration's climate  change report on Black Friday when people are out with their families  shopping and not paying attention to what is going on in the news.   The U.S. climate assessment is damning. It gives President Trump and  his GOP allies no cover to proclaim that climate change isn't real. The  report took our country's top climate scientists 4 years to research  and write. It is more than 1,000 pages long and represents work done by  13 Federal agencies.   One of the authors, Katherine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University,  summarized the evidence like this: Climate change is happening here and  now.   If the United States does not act fast, the effects of climate change  are only going to get worse for the American people. We already have to  deal with increasingly frequent and deadly wildfires, hurricanes, and  extreme weather events. That is going to get worse if we don't curb  greenhouse gas emissions that are impacting our climate. Climate change  also means that some areas will see more rains and more flooding.   Our Nation's infrastructure is already suffering from neglect, as we  have had a Special Order hour on that in the past. The American Society  of Civil Engineers gives our infrastructure a D-plus.   The stress of more frequent and intense rain, flooding, and heat is  likely to cause a great deal of damage to our already frail  infrastructure. Flooding will overwhelm and erode our roads. It will  stress and possibly bring down bridges. We will have to shut down major  roadways, railways, and ports. People's lives and their livelihoods  will be at risk.   For my district in New Jersey, the economic impact will be  devastating. My constituents work at Port Newark, the busiest in the  East. They travel to and from jobs in New York City through the  Nation's busiest tunnels and bridges, which are already overwhelmed.  They live on or near the water.   Our national infrastructure just wasn't built for the kinds of  extreme weather we can expect if climate change goes unchecked. I have  no doubt that the people of New Jersey are resilient, but the longer  our Federal Government takes to address climate change, the more  difficult it will become to adapt.   But it is not just our infrastructure that is at risk if we don't  take action on climate change. If left unchecked, climate change is  going to hospitalize and kill our constituents. According to the 2017  New Jersey Climate and Health Profile Report published by Rutgers  University, air quality changes, such as increased ground-level ozone  and fine particulate matter changes in the air, will cause a rise in  respiratory illness, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. Extreme  heat and increasingly frequent heat waves will exacerbate people's  existing medical conditions and cause more heat-related deaths. Changes  to our ecosystem caused by increased humidity and higher temperatures  will spread pests and infectious diseases.    The vulnerability will not be equal. The people most at risk are  people least able to migrate to safety. The elderly, young children,  and people with existing medical conditions, poorer residents, urban  residents, people of color, and laborers are all the people who are  most at risk.   The Trump administration and our GOP colleagues can keep their heads  buried in the sand or they can work alongside countless people in  government, academia, business, and civil society to mitigate the  effects of climate change. To borrow a warning from a coauthor of the  U.S. climate assessment: ``It's absolutely not too late to take action.  But costs will really start skyrocketing if we don't start reining in  emissions.''   Mr. Speaker, my Democratic colleagues and I are ready to pursue a  greener future for our people. We are ready to transition to cleaner  energy sources. We are ready to make sure auto emissions standards  reflect 21st century technology. We are ready to make sure all  Americans have access to clean air, clean water, and high-quality  healthcare. The question is: Will our Republican friends join us?   Mr. Speaker, I want to once again commend Mr. Garamendi for always  having these timely Special Order hours on issues that are critical to  us at this time. The gentleman never misses a beat in terms of bringing  issues to the floor that are relevant, important, and need to be  addressed as soon as possible.
