 Mr. Speaker, I have had the privilege of working  with Republican and Democratic Presidents, and, I might add, that I  have had the sadness to be standing with them during times of need of  this Nation. Living knowledge, during my tenure, President George W.  Bush was President during 9/11.   I was in this Capitol on September 11, 2001, and so I was physically  evacuated. As we were leaving with no understanding of what was  happening--particularly for those of us who had come for early morning  meetings, not having the full impact of what had happened in New York  and not having the full knowledge. But as we were fleeing this  building, we took a look to our right. We could see the billowing black  smoke in the Pentagon. We were running for our lives. We were running  as Americans, Muslims, Jews, Christians, people of many faiths, many  races, many genders, many orientations. We were running as Americans.   Those families at Ground Zero watched in horror or heard in horror of  their loved ones lost, in spite of the heroic efforts of first  responders. First responders were lost. There, too, was a multitude of  the United Nations.   This Nation has always welcomed and respected people from all over  the world, and so it disturbs me when those of us who have now taken a  visible and stoic stand against an unconstitutional executive order  begin to receive attacks from the very person who should be bringing  this Nation together.   I take great insult from the firing of Deputy Attorney General Sally  Yates, a person whom I have worked with personally as a senior member  of the House Judiciary Committee. She is of profound integrity,  honesty, respectability, and professionalism. I congratulate Deputy  Attorney General Sally Yates for being a patriot.   Last evening, she rendered this statement: ``In addition, I am  responsible for ensuring that the positions we take in court remain  consistent with this institution's solemn obligation to always seek  justice and stand for what is right. At present, I am not convinced  that the defense of the executive order is consistent with these  responsibilities nor am I convinced that the executive order is  lawful.''   Responding to that, almost like Nixon, some decades ago, this White  House fired Attorney General Yates and proceeded to make this  statement: ``The acting Attorney General, Sally Yates, has betrayed the  Department of Justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to  protect the citizens of the United States. This order was approved as  to form and legality by the Department of Justice Office of Legal  Counsel.''   Sally Yates explained it, but there is no betrayal of the Department  of Justice. It is an entity. It is not the American people, and it is  not a Constitution. She has no obligation to the Department of Justice.  She has an obligation to the American people to uphold the  Constitution.                                time  1045    The White House proceeds to go on to say--I assume President Trump-- ``Ms. Yates is an Obama administration appointee who is weak on borders  and very weak on illegal immigration,'' of which I don't know their  proof for such.   But what I will say to you is that she was doing her civic and  patriotic duty by remaining there as a senior member who was the only  person there that could sign subpoenas. She was doing America a favor.   So I will say, in the backdrop of that, were you at the Bush  Intercontinental Airport, as I was, when an Iraqi citizen came in, a  legal permanent resident with a green card, and was detained for 5  hours while his employer and lawyers were gathering and hovering  outside; and CBP, to my understanding, how frightened they were, how  they did not know what was going on, did not allow them to be able to  speak?   Or did you listen last night when an Iraqi woman indicated that her  husband was murdered and she hid for 12 years in Iraq until she was  able to bring her children here?   Did you hear that refugees are being denied to come in for 120 days  on Friday, Mr. Speaker, and that their papers will expire?   Finally, Mr. Speaker, did you hear that the perpetrator in Quebec had  on his social media that he was supporting or praising President Trump?   Enough is enough. Repeal this order. Pass the SOLVE Act. Pass the USA  Act  [[Page H754]]  that I have introduced as well that includes gender and religion.   Stop this madness. The executive order is unconstitutional.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the executive order is patently and  clearly unconstitutional. An executive order to ban Muslims is  unconstitutional.   None of us stand against the stringent review of individuals to  determine who would come to do well, but who would come to do harm. A  ban or a temporary suspension of all of the refugees around the world  who have been vetted over and over again is clearly discriminatory.   It is true that the Constitution of the United States starts with:  ``We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect  Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the  common defence . . .'' and ``welfare. . . .''   Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates made the right decision. Many  court jurisdictions have already said that this is an unconstitutional  and discriminatory order. The office of a public servant in the United  States Federal Government requires that you take an oath to defend and  protect the Constitution of the United States. I believe the President  should uphold his oath.     Request to Call Up H.R. 724, SOLVE Act, and H.R. 735, USA Values Act     Mr. Speaker, today I join with the resolve of the  Deputy Attorney General, and I ask unanimous consent for the SOLVE Act,  and ask unanimous consent for H.R. 724 and H.R. 735, the USA Values  Act, all dealing with banning and repealing and rescinding, now, the  unconstitutional executive order on banning Muslims.    Mr. Speaker, because our Nation has always welcomed  refugees and the poor and those who are in need, I don't know why we  don't bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump's refugee  ban on students like the Iranian-born anthropology student who left the  U.S. to carry out research and is now likely to be unable to return to  defend his thesis. If you do not believe in the ban, bring it up so we  can vote against this ban.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia and,  likewise, congratulate him for his leadership on the Transportation  Committee, along with his chairman.   Mr. Speaker, I rise as a senior member of the Homeland Security  Committee, which committee has had special emphasis on protecting and  responding to our first responders, and so I am excited about the fact  of moving this bill forward. I thank the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee, and I thank my Homeland Security Committee  for moving this forward through an amendment process and now,  ultimately, onto the floor of the House.   I rise, Mr. Speaker, enthusiastically, in support of H.R. 58, the  First Responder Identification of Emergency Needs in Disaster  Situations, or FRIENDS, Act.   I thank my chairman, Mr. McCaul, and Ranking Member Thompson for the  valuable assistance and support in bringing this important bill before  the House for consideration during the 114th Congress. We are now in  the 115th Congress. I appreciate Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member  DeFazio for allowing the FRIENDS Act now to come forward, which was  referred to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to be  considered on today's suspensions.   The FRIENDS Act reflects what America is all about. The FRIENDS Act  reflects what we, as Members of Congress, are all about. How many of us  stop by fire stations, pat a police officer of many different levels on  the back, say ``thank you,'' and recognize that that 911 number is a  very special number to many of our constituents.   But more importantly, when natural disasters or manmade disasters  such as the horrific and heinous terrorist act of 9/11 occur, who are  among the first to come? It is the first responders, and they go to  faraway places.   The FRIENDS Act reflects stakeholder input and bipartisan  collaboration with the majority.   I thank the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the National  Association of State EMS Officials working with me, and The  International Emergency Management Society for their valuable  assistance and input regarding the FRIENDS Act.   Our two committees, Transportation and Infrastructure and Homeland  Security, really respond in a bipartisan way. Our Homeland Security  Committee will be facing many mountains of concerns dealing with  intelligence issues, dealing with the issues with Russia, dealing with  the issues of executive orders, but we do know that we come together to  honor our first responders that are our Nation's heroes. They run into  burning buildings; they rescue people trapped by dangerous floods and  put themselves in harm's way to protect others. Just last week, in San  Bernardino, we saw the brave first responders heroically pursue two  individuals that fled from the scene of a deadly attack recently over  the last year.   To do their jobs, first responders must leave their homes and  families while the rest of us cling to ours. Whether it is to deal with  the aftermath of a terrorist attack, as I indicated, or the fires,  hurricanes, and tornadoes that we have seen across America--devastation  of so many of our constituents, loss of life--first responders leave  their homes to ensure that others are safe.   Unfortunately, today, first responders are asked to answer the call  to action without knowing whether their families will be safe as the  work to rescue others proceeds. Our first responders deserve better.   The FRIENDS Act directs the Government Accountability Office to  conduct a comprehensive review of policies and programs designed to  ensure that first responders are able to do their jobs, and  effectively, by assessing, among other things, measures taken to ensure  first responder families are safe, first of all, and the availability  of personal protective equipment exists so that they can come home to  their families.   It was particularly noticed during 9/11. For those of us who were  able to go to Ground Zero as they were still continuing the recovery,  many of you know they continued to recover for months and months and  months, and you saw the kind of exposure those first responders had.   During committee consideration of the FRIENDS Act, my friend from New  York (Mr. Higgins) offered an amendment to authorize GAO to evaluate  the availability of home med kits for first responders and their  families in assessing the preparedness of first responders. I was  pleased to support the Higgins amendment, and it adds to this bill.   H.R. 58 also directs GAO to distinguish policies available in high- risk urban areas which may be better resourced, and rural areas where  efforts to ensure preparedness for first responders and their families  may require creative leveraging of resources.   This provision will ensure that the information included in the  report will be applicable and adaptable by various communities across  the country as they work to better protect their protectors. Let us  remember both the rural community as well as the urban community.   Additionally, the FRIENDS Act directs the Secretary of Homeland  Security to review its findings and assess whether the policies  identified could be applicable to Federal first responders.   The FRIENDS Act has been endorsed by the International Association of  Fire Chiefs and a number of other organizations.   Before I conclude, let me again thank all of my colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the International  Association of Fire Chiefs and, as well, the National Association of  State EMS Officials.                                           International Association                                                  of Fire Chiefs,                                      Fairfax, VA, January 31, 2017.      Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Jackson Lee: On behalf of the       approximately 12,000 fire and emergency service leaders of       the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), I would       like to thank you for introducing H.R. 58, the First       Responder Identification of Emergency Needs in Disaster       Situations (FRIENDS) Act. The IAFC supports this legislation,       because it will examine an important issue facing the       nation's first responders during a major terrorist attack:       adequate preparedness for the first responders' families.        During terrorist incidents, fire, law enforcement and EMS       officials will be called upon to take heroic actions to       protect the public and provide fire and emergency medical       response. In the case of a large-scale incident or biological       attack, the families of these first responders also will be       at risk. Based on the experience of IAFC members during the       response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the 2014 response       to potential Ebola incidents in the United States, I know       that the welfare of the first responders' families weighs       heavily on them as they serve the public. It is important       that federal, state, and local officials make plans to       provide for the safety of first responders' families in order       to ensure strong morale among local fire, law enforcement,       and EMS officials during a major terrorist attack.        Thank you for introducing this important legislation. We       look forward to working with you to pass this legislation in       the House of Representatives.        Sincerely,                                       Fire Chief John D. Sinclair,      President and Chairman of the Board.                                   ____                                                National Association                                          of State EMS Officials,                               Falls Church, VA, September 28, 2015.      Re: Expressing Support for the Jackson Lee Amendment in the           Nature of a Substitute to H.R. 2795.       Hon. Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman, House Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Martha McSally,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response,           and Communications, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Homeland Security, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Donald M. Pyne,      Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness,           Response, and Communications, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        We are writing to express our support for the Jackson Lee       Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute titled, the       ``Families of Responders Identification of Emergency Needs in       Designated Situations'' or the ``FRIENDS Act.'' This bill       would provide an important report on the state of family       support planning for the families of first responders.        We believe that Federal family support planning is       important to homeland security because this area of       continuity of operations planning addresses the health and       safety needs of first responder families during terrorist       attacks or incidents as well as other emergencies. The       FRIENDS Act will be an  [[Page H774]]       important first step in engaging the first responder       community on the role of family in preparedness and       continuity of operations.        The FRIENDS Act would also engage first responder       organizations to get their perspectives on best practices in       family support planning programs on the local and state       levels.        For these reasons, we support the FRIENDS Act of 2015.            Sincerely,                                                Paul R. Patrick,                                  President, National Association of                                               State EMS Officials.     Mr. Speaker, it is important to know of the  important role that the International Association of Fire Chiefs play  in the lives of first responders and their advocacy for their fellow  brothers and sisters--and they call them their fellow brothers and  sisters. I want to briefly read their words:         Dear Representative Jackson Lee,        On behalf of the approximately 12,000 fire and emergency       service leaders of the International Association of Fire       Chiefs, I would like to thank you for introducing H.R. 58,       the First Responder Identification of Emergency Needs in       Disaster Situations, FRIENDS, Act.        The IAFC supports the legislation because it will examine       an important issue facing the Nation's first responders       during a major terrorist attack, adequate preparedness for       the first responders' families.    It goes on to list terrorist incidents, fire, and law enforcement,  and EMS officials will be called upon to take heroic action, and it  recounts that their concern is what is happening to their family under  these circumstances.   In a letter from the National Association of State EMS Officials  which I will insert into the Record, they indicate in their letter:         We are writing to express our support for the Jackson Lee       amendment, which was the bill the Families of Responders       Identification of Emergency Needs in Designated Situations.       This bill would make an important report on the state of       family support planning for the families of first responders.    Ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to my colleagues for their  assistance as we move the FRIENDS Act forward, but I am more grateful  to those first responders who unselfishly put themselves forward and in  danger to help our constituents and help all of us. To their families,  we owe them the responsibility of ensuring that they are safe during  the time of their loved ones being on the front lines of saving others.   I ask my colleagues to support the FRIENDS Act, H.R. 58.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 58, the ``First Responder  Identification of Emergency Needs in Disaster Situations, or ``Friends'  Act'', and yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for the valuable  assistance and support in bringing this important bill before the House  for consideration during the 114th Congress.   I appreciate and thank Chairman Bill Shuster and Ranking Member Peter  A. DeFazio for allowing the FRIENDS Act, which was referred to the  Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure to be considered under  today's suspensions.   The FRIENDS Act embodies the important and fundamental idea that we  have an obligation to ensure that the first responders who protect our  loved ones in emergencies have the peace of mind that comes from  knowing that their loved ones are safe while they do their duty.   During terrorist incidents, fire, law enforcement, and EMS officials  will be called upon to take heroic actions to protect the public and  provide fire and emergency medical response.   The FRIENDS Act reflects stakeholder input and bipartisan  collaboration with the Majority.   I thank the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the National  Association of State EMS Officials, and the International Emergency  Management Society for their valuable assistance and support for the  FRIENDS Act.   I also thank Kay Goss, the President of the International Emergency  Management Society, who provided technical assistance on the work of  first responders to prepare for catastrophic events.   I am passionate about the work of those who dedicate themselves to  public service.   I hold in high regard the service of firefighters, law enforcement  officers, emergency response technicians, nurses, emergency room  doctors, and the dozens of other professionals who are the ultimate  public servants.   First responders are called to serve and few outside of their ranks  can understand why they do the work they do each day--placing their  lives in harm's way to save a stranger.   Law enforcement officers, fire fighters, and emergency medical  technicians make our lives safer, while often at the same time putting  their own lives at risk.   In the case of a large-scale incident or biological attack, the  families of these first responders also will be at risk.   Based upon the experience of International Fire Chiefs, which  endorsed the FRIENDS Act, the members' experiences during their  response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the 2014 response to  potential Ebola incidents in the United States, know that the welfare  of their families weighs heavily on first responders as they serve the  public.   It is important that federal, state, and local officials make plans  to provide for the safety of first responders' families in order to  ensure strong morale among local fire, law enforcement, and EMS  officials during a major terrorist attack.   H.R. 58 provides Congress an opportunity to let our first responders  know that we know they have families and loved ones who they leave  behind when they are called to duty, and their families will be  protected in the first responder absence.   The GAO study that will be provided as a result of this bill will  report on what is being done by local and state governments to address  the needs of first responder families when threats like Hurricanes  Sandy, Hugo, and Katrina hit communities, or when a terrorist attack  like the ones seen in New York and Boston occur.   The report required by the Jackson Lee FRIENDS Act will also provide  information on the availability of personal protective equipment for  first responders.   The issue of personal protective equipment was an acute problem for  front line first responders during the 2014 Ebola crisis.   First responders, including EMTs, emergency room doctors and nurses  as well as law enforcement and fire department professionals, were not  prepared for the crisis:   1. Nearly 80 percent of first responders report that their hospital  had not communicated to them any policy regarding potential admission  of patients infected by Ebola;   2. 85 percent said their hospital had not provided education on Ebola  that allowed the nurses to interact and ask questions of patients;   3. One-third said their hospital had insufficient supplies of eye  protection (face shields or side shields with goggles) and fluid  resistant/impermeable gowns; and   4. Nearly 40 percent said their hospital did not have plans to equip  isolation rooms with plastic covered mattresses and pillows and discard  all linens after use; fewer than 10 percent said they were aware their  hospital does have such a plan in place.   The Centers for Disease Control and only a few hospitals around the  country with infectious disease units knew the right protocols and had  the right protective gear to be used when treating an Ebola patient.   Ebola in the United States was a frightening experience for many, but  I think we saw the great work that first responders do each day--our  doctors and nurses went to work and treated the sick and did what they  always do--they took care of us.   During the 114th Congress the Homeland Security Committee unanimously  voted to report the FRIENDS Act favorably to the full House, which  passed the measure by an overwhelming margin and in support of local,  state and federal first responders.   The Comptroller General's comprehensive review of the range of  policies and programs in place at the State level to address the  preparedness and protection of first responders will also delineate  high risk urban areas and rural communities; and the degree to which  selected state policies were developed or executed with funding from  the DHS Grant Programs or Urban Area Security Initiative authorized by  the Homeland Security Act.   The report's focus will be on the presence of the family of first  responders in an area affected by a terrorist attack and the  availability of essential personal protective equipment.   This will be the first report that focuses on the family as a  critical factor that should be considered in the work of first  responders during times of crisis such as a terrorist attack or public  emergency like in the massive flooding that occurred in the city of  Houston last year and the year before.   The well-being of family members is a factor that one would expect to  weigh on a first responder called to respond to a terrorist attack or  unprecedented emergency.   The bravery or dedication of first responders is not in question-- they are the people who run into burning buildings to save people whom  they may never have met.   They are some of the best among us and we appreciate their dedication  and service.   Finally, the FRIENDS Act requires the Secretary of Homeland Security  to consider the report's findings and their applicability for federal  first responders.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Natalie Matson, of the Committee's  majority staff and  [[Page H775]]  Moira Bergin, of the Committee's minority staff, both of whom worked  closely with Lillie Coney on my staff on the FRIENDS Act.   I also thank the staff of the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure for their efforts to bring the bill before the full  House for consideration.   I ask all Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 58, the FRIENDS  Act.
