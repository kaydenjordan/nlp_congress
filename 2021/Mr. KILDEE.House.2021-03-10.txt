 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the chairman of the  Budget Committee, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation and the American people  support this legislation because it is good for families, for seniors,  for businesses, and it provides immediate economic relief to the people  who are struggling right now.   $2,000 to every American, supported by Democrats and Republicans.  Speeding up vaccinations, supported by Democrats and Republicans.  Extending unemployment benefits, supported by Democrats and  Republicans. Expanding the earned income tax credit and the child tax  credit, cutting child poverty, supported by Democrats and Republicans.   I say it is supported by Democrats and Republicans with one  exception: the Republicans who serve in this Congress.   Republicans across the country support it. Independents across the  country support it. Democrats support it. This is the time to act.
