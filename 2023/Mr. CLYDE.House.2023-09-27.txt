 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment to the FY24 Defense appropriations  bill would simply prohibit the Department of Defense from using funds  to administer, implement, or enforce the proposed action by the  Department of the Army regarding the removal of the Reconciliation  Monument at Arlington National Cemetery.   Following 4 brutal years of the American Civil War, our Nation's  great leaders, President Abraham Lincoln and future President Union  General Ulysses S. Grant, took great measures to ensure that our Nation  reconciled and unified after the conflict that turned fellow countryman  against fellow countryman. These unifying actions included pardons for  Confederate leaders that waged war as well as the restoration of  confiscated property.   What these great American leaders understood is that a nation divided  against itself cannot stand.   Then, in 1898, following the Spanish-American War, where Union and  Confederate veterans fought side by side under one flag, the American  flag, President McKinley declared in the heart of the South, in  Atlanta, Georgia, the capital of my home State, that the U.S.  Government would commit to sharing the burden of honoring and properly  burying the Confederate dead, stating: ``Sectional feeling no longer  holds back the love we feel for each other. The old flag waves over us  in peace with new glories.''   In 1900, Congress authorized Confederate remains to be buried at  Arlington National Cemetery. In 1906, President McKinley allowed for  the construction of a new monument honoring our country's new shared  reconciliation from its troubled divisions.   In 1914, President Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, unveiled this new  memorial to national unity, which was designed by a Jewish-American  sculptor. The memorial is topped with a woman crowned by an olive  wreath to symbolize peace.   Beginning with the unveiling of the statue and now every year since,  it is the tradition of the President of the United States to send a  wreath to the memorial, honoring the dead buried in a circle around the  monument. This tradition, which shows tremendous national unity, has  been carried on regardless of party or politics of the sitting  President.   In fact, even President Obama understood the Reconciliation Monument  in the context for which it stood, which was unity, not division, when  he continued the Presidential tradition of sending a wreath to the  monument.   Despite the bipartisan support for this monument, the renaming  commission established by the fiscal year 2021 National Defense  Authorization Act overstepped its legislative authority and recommended  that the Department of the Army remove the memorial from Arlington  National Cemetery. The renaming commission's authority given to them by  Congress empowers them to recommend the removal of ``names, symbols,  displays, monuments, and paraphernalia that honor or commemorate the  Confederate States of America.''   Yet, as described previously, the Reconciliation Monument does not  honor nor commemorate the Confederacy. It commemorates reconciliation  and national unity.   Furthermore, the renaming commission's authority explicitly prohibits  the desecration of gravesites. There are hundreds of gravestones  encircling the monument, and I do not know how in the world these  graves will remain untouched if the Department of the Army proceeds  with its proposal to remove the monument.   Former Virginia Democrat Senator Jim Webb, a decorated Marine Corps  officer who served multiple combat tours in Vietnam and later became  the Secretary of the Navy, recently published an op-ed in The Wall  Street Journal concerning the Reconciliation Monument at Arlington  Cemetery.   Senator Webb describes his own journey of reconciliation following  his combat tours in Vietnam. He explains how he hosted a delegation of  Vietnamese officials in Washington to encourage them to be peaceful  toward former South Vietnamese veterans, who were labeled as traitors  after the war and had been treated as such.   Senator Webb described how to make his point to the delegation. He  brought them to the Reconciliation Monument in Arlington and pointed  across the Potomac toward the Lincoln Memorial to show that old wounds  can be healed. Senator Webb concludes with this: If the monument is  taken apart and removed, ``it would send a different message, one of a  deteriorating society willing to erase the generosity of its past, in  favor of bitterness and misunderstanding.''   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a  stand  [[Page H4604]]  against such a divisive and history-erasing action and support my  amendment to defund the effort to remove the Reconciliation Monument  from the Arlington National Cemetery.   My amendment prevents this tyrannical encroachment by legislative  authority, ignorance of congressional intent, and disregard of national  unity.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, it would be an absolute disgrace if this  Reconciliation Monument to our Nation's national unity is removed from  Arlington National Cemetery and the graves that encircle it are  desecrated.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment prevents any funds in this year's  Defense appropriations bill from being spent on section 370 of the  fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, providing a  commonsense solution to block unnecessary and frivolous efforts to  rename military bases across the country.   As a Navy combat veteran, an area of great concern for me is the  inessential renaming of military bases and facilities as this issue is  not a matter of national security nor an improvement of our military's  combat readiness.   The Department of Defense's focus should remain on bolstering our  defense capabilities and ensuring that we maintain the most lethal  fighting force in the world. Instead, the Department of Defense is  continuing to pursue plans to rename military bases, two of which, Fort  Benning and Fort Gordon, are in my home State of Georgia.   The Department of Defense's renaming efforts are expected to cost  taxpayers over $62 million and would have a detrimental economic impact  in the surrounding communities.   Take Fort Gordon, for example, where local small business owners who  take great pride in our Nation's military have named their  establishments or attractions after the local Army base. If the name of  the base is changed, then local entrepreneurs will be forced to rename  and rebrand businesses, replacing merchandise and creating completely  new marketing strategies, which is not cheap. In fact, in many cases,  you may see that rebranding of businesses actually will cause the  businesses to fail.   In rural communities like those in Georgia, this economic burden  would be catastrophic, and I know communities across the country will  be confronted with the same issues if we allow the Department of  Defense to continue this reckless plan.   I was disappointed that earlier this year, when I offered a similar  amendment to the fiscal year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act,  these amendments were not even considered or debated on the House  floor. However, we have a second opportunity right now as we look to  fund the Department of Defense.   We must carefully examine how taxpayer dollars are being used to fund  the Department of Defense and its policies, and I adamantly believe  that Americans' hard-earned tax dollars should not be wasted on  renaming military bases but should be focused on making our military  the most lethal in the world.   Due to President Biden's failed leadership and Big Government  socialist agenda, our Nation is facing an ongoing economic crisis.  Excessive Washington spending has not only ballooned our national debt,  which just surpassed $33 trillion last week, but has also inflated the  prices of basic goods and services for our constituents, while running  an annual deficit of almost $2 trillion.   It is simply unacceptable to spend millions of dollars of borrowed  money to rename military bases and facilities only to undoubtedly  burden hardworking Americans and small business owners already  struggling in Joe Biden's disastrous economy.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  my commonsense amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, renaming does nothing to make our military more  combat-ready. In fact, it is a waste of taxpayer funds. Our military  defense funding should be used to make our troops the most lethal in  the entire world, the most feared in the entire world. It should be  spent on training, not renaming, which does absolutely nothing but  divert resources from the critical mission of our military.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to cut  the funding levels for the Department of Homeland Security's  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, also known as CISA,  by 25 percent, which equals about a $592.7 million reduction.   On CISA's website, the agency's mission reads: ``We lead the national  effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to our cyber and physical  infrastructure.'' Great mission statement.   Unfortunately, CISA has dangerously and nefariously migrated far from  its mission, kind of like one of the illegal aliens coming across our  southern border.   Last year, CISA was involved in the infamous Disinformation  Governance Board established under the Biden administration's  Department of Homeland Security to regulate and police Americans'  speech.   While this dystopian Disinformation Governance Board was rightfully  disbanded a few months later after enormous public outcry, many will be  shocked to learn that CISA has not stopped monitoring Americans' free  speech.   According to a draft copy of DHS' ``Quadrennial Homeland Security  Review,'' CISA drafted plans to target ``inaccurate information'' on a  wide range of topics, including ``the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic,  the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine, racial justice, U.S. withdrawal  from Afghanistan, and the nature of U.S. support to Ukraine.''   Moreover, Twitter's business records suggest that CISA migrated its  true mission to protect the Nation's critical cyber and physical  infrastructure into controlling what Americans can say and what speech  is accessible online.   This is wrong, dangerous, and a massive violation of our  constitutional rights. Americans' First Amendment freedoms shall not be  regulated or controlled by a rogue government agency either directly or  indirectly through Big Tech. This government by proxy censorship has no  place in our constitutional Republic.   For some background, CISA was first created with overwhelming  bipartisan support prior to my service here in the House. Under the  Trump administration, CISA focused on countering foreign cyber  influence. Unfortunately, since the current administration took office,  CISA has aggressively shifted beyond the original mandate of countering  foreign threats.   In January 2021, CISA officials renamed the Countering Foreign  Influence Task Force, one of the key bodies countering foreign  disinformation founded during the Trump administration. They renamed it  to the mis-,  dis-, and malinformation team, or MDM team, meaning they took the word  ``foreign'' out of the title. This shift in name represents a shift in  CISA's mission from foreign to domestic to censor American citizens.                                time  1915    Earlier this year, information was reported that showed members of  CISA had privately characterized those who raised concerns over  government censorship of free speech. CISA had labeled these  individuals bad actors.   CISA needs to return to its original mission of strengthening and  protecting our national cybersecurity and infrastructure, not censoring  free speech and infringing America's First Amendment liberties.   As CISA's budget has drastically increased by 44 percent over the  last 3 fiscal years, this agency has dangerously expanded its mission  to police free speech and to silence the American people.   There is a clear connection here. Given an extraordinary boost in  funding, CISA has weaponized tax dollars to censor Americans and target  speech they find disagreeable. It is time to end this injustice in  order to protect the American people's unalienable First Amendment  rights.   Therefore, I offer this amendment to reduce CISA's funding closer to  its fiscal year 2019-2020 funding level. This agency must be refocused  on its true mission and not get expanded funding to continue  undermining our constitutional rights.   There is nothing like a budget cut to get an agency's attention.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to support my amendment in an effort to  stop CISA's Orwellian practices and defend our cherished First  Amendment freedoms.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the only thing that agencies in this town  respect is funding.   Indeed, reduced funding is the only way that we will bring them back  to their core mission. This agency has had a 44 percent increase in  funding, and yet, they have taken that money, and what they have done  to our First Amendment civil liberties, to our rights, is they have  spied upon us.   In the cybersecurity world, they have taken our information and they  have misused it. I think CISA needs a haircut, and I think this haircut  will get their attention.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
