 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership,  and I thank Congressman McHenry, also.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to just, regretfully, say that this ruling,  Madden v. Midland, is just another layer of Big Brother, a misguided  ruling by some people of good intentions and goodwill, but the net  effect is fewer choices for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I think we have seen what has happened as a result of  Dodd-Frank. We saw what happened to the American economy. We saw what  happened to the American consumers.   Mr. Speaker, regrettably, it is the low-income, minority people who  have suffered the most in the last decade as a result of the misguided  regulations that were put upon the American people. Big Brother really  doesn't have the answers.   What we do have is the opportunity to provide choices for the  American people, and that is what H.R. 3299 is all about.   Mr. Speaker, in North Carolina, we have lost 50 percent of our banks  because of this misguided regulatory overmanagement by the Federal  Government. There is less access to capital and credit for small  business. There is less access to capital for that individual who has a  real need. Maybe they want to start something, or maybe they have an  emergency in their family.   This is what this bill is all about, and we need to be behind it. We  need to support it. We need to understand that the American people know  how to make good choices. We need to trust the American people and not  trust Big Brother and the Big Government.
