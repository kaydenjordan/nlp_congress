 Madam Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the outstanding  accomplishments of Roselle Women on the Move, a volunteer organization  making positive impact in the lives of young women in my community that  came to see me yesterday here at the Capitol.   I was impressed with the mentorship Roselle Women on the Move  provides. Their mentoring has undoubtedly equipped the young women and  girls in my community with the tools they need to achieve their dreams.   I commend Borough of Roselle President and Councilwoman At Large,  Denise Wilkerson, for spearheading this group and the other women and  leaders that joined her yesterday for their mentorship. I am grateful  to each of them for using their life experiences to improve the lives  of our children in my community.                            ____________________
