Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 6411, as  amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6411, as amended, the  Support The Resilience of Our Nation's Great Veterans Act, or STRONG  Veterans Act.   Chairman Takano introduced this bill with Ranking Member Bost, and we  are grateful to them and their staff for working together over many  months to bring this vital package to the House floor. This represents  a true bipartisan effort to address a pressing issue.   Although we all were glad to see the veteran suicide rate drop in the  last year for which we have data, one death is one too many, and  suicide is preventable. We must honor our veterans' service by getting  them the care they have earned and deserve now.   Preventing veteran suicide and strengthening veterans' mental health  and well-being remains a top priority not only of the Biden  administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs but also of our  committee. There are prevention approaches and treatments that work,  and we must expand all veterans' access to these lifesaving and life- improving services.   Madam Speaker, while we are talking about access, I want to make sure  everyone listening today has the Veterans Crisis Line phone number. If  you or somebody you care about is in distress, call 1-800-273-TALK-- that is 1-800-273-8255--and press 1 for responders with military and  veteran expertise. There is no reason to suffer alone.   Along with our colleagues in the Senate, we have advanced bipartisan  bills over the past year that now make up the 22 sections of the STRONG  Veterans Act.   I want to especially thank our colleagues both on and off the  committee for their individual legislative contributions to this  omnibus package.   Congresswoman Brownley, who chairs our Veterans' Affairs Health  Subcommittee, introduced what we consider a cornerstone of STRONG--her  American Indian and Alaska Native Veterans Mental Health Act. This  provision mandates that VA hire full-time minority veteran coordinators  at every VA medical center to provide culturally competent mental  health and suicide prevention outreach to our Tribal veterans.   Congresswoman Slotkin's Solid Start Act is included in STRONG and  will ensure that VA continues to contact and check in with veterans  following their transition from Active Duty during what we know is a  very high-risk time for stress, mental health challenges, and even  suicide.   The committee also was pleased to include the Veteran Peer Specialist  Act from Congressman Scott Peters. This is an important provision  directing VA to expand its peer specialist program which is extremely  popular with veterans.   Although our colleague, former Congressman Delgado, recently left the  House to become Lieutenant Governor of New York, I thank him for  introducing the REACH for Veterans Act in the House. It is a critical  component of STRONG and will strengthen VA's Veterans Crisis Line.   Finally, Chairman Takano's bill in STRONG, the VA Governor's  Challenge Expansion Act, mandates, for the first time, VA-included  Tribes in addition to States in the successful Governors' Challenge  program to prevent veteran suicide. No sovereign nation should have to  wait to be invited to a State Governor's Challenge team. Instead,  Tribes selected for the program will work directly with VA to tailor  innovative suicide prevention ideas to the needs of their own Native  veterans.   Overall, STRONG will give VA important new authorities and resources  to support veterans' mental health and well-being through increased  training, outreach, mental health care delivery, and research in line  with the committee's public health approach and President Biden's  strategy to address veteran suicide.   It addresses gaps along the spectrum of prevention and care by  expanding mental health outreach to traditionally underserved veterans,  developing and delivering the most effective treatments, better  equipping VA's workforce to provide care, and further strengthening  VA's crisis response system.  [[Page H5852]]    With this legislation, we will help VA better meet veterans where  they are--literally. STRONG directs VA to hire more mental health staff  at vet centers close to where veterans live and work.   STRONG also directs VA to assess and improve how well it serves  veterans on college campuses. It requires VA to more consistently and  comprehensively reach out and provide mental health services to  veterans who have been involved with the criminal justice system.   STRONG mandates that as the new three-digit crisis hotline number  goes live across the country in July, VA further strengthen its  Veterans Crisis Line to meet the predicted surge in demand for  emergency care and followup.   STRONG lays out important guidance for VA's research program related  to suicide, substance use challenges, and other mental health issues.  While caring for veterans today, VA must always be investing in science  and looking for tomorrow's innovative solutions to improve veterans'  lives.   STRONG and its component bills are endorsed by too many veterans  service organizations and health organizations to list, but, Madam  Speaker, let me leave you with these words from Andrew Marshall,  National Commander of Disabled American Veterans, ``There is simply no  greater or more urgent challenge within the veteran community right now  than addressing mental health concerns and ensuring our Nation's heroes  have access to the support they need to both prevent and mitigate  crisis.   ``DAV is pleased to support the STRONG Veterans Act, and we urge its  swift passage and signing into law.''   In closing, Madam Speaker, Chairman Takano and I support this  important piece of legislation, and we urge our colleagues to support  H.R. 6411, as amended.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers,  and I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, again, I ask all of my  colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 6411, as amended, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
