 Mr. Speaker, Republicans are now joining Democrats in  calling for Chairman Nunes to recuse himself from the House  Intelligence Committee's current investigation into Russia's  interference in the 2016 election.  [[Page H2640]]    By working hand in glove with the White House around an investigation  that centers on the President and his administration, the chairman has  blown the integrity of this investigation. Through his actions, he has  shown he cannot lead an impartial investigation. His actions  demonstrate why Congress must establish a bipartisan, independent  commission to investigate President Trump's political and personal  business ties to Russia.   The majority of the American people favor an independent commission,  outside of Congress, according to polling done by the Associated Press.  This is a serious matter. Our democracy is at stake. Our national  security is at stake.   Congress must call a bipartisan, independent commission to  investigate these troubling connections between President Trump and  Russia.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 1343, Encouraging Employee Ownership Act of 2017, eliminates  important disclosures that private companies must provide to their  employees in the event they are compensating those employees with  stock.   This bill would limit transparency. If companies want to pay their  employees in stocks, they should have to simply disclose to their  workers the risks associated with those investments.   Currently, private companies can provide up to $5 million worth of  stock compensation annually to their employees and are not required to  provide any financial disclosure. This bill would lift that cap to $10  million.   If companies choose to provide an employee with stock compensation,  they should be required to inform that employee of the appropriate  financial information, benefits, and the risks associated with that  investment, including 2 years of company financial statements. All of  this information is commonly available to typical investors.   Let's be clear: this stock is compensation for their work. Employees  deserve to understand the value of their compensation prior to  accepting it. They deserve the same protections that other investors  would get.   I agree with Professor Mercer Bullard, who is a professor of law at  the University of Mississippi School of Law, who testified before the  Capital Markets, Securities, and Investments Subcommittee voicing his  concerns about the bill. In his testimony, he noted that to take  advantage of the terms of this legislation, an issuer would have to  have at least $34 million in total assets. Surely, such minimal  disclosures are not too burdensome for those sort of companies.   I do also understand that some proponents of this legislation argue  that such an exemption is needed because disclosure of company  information to employees runs the risk that confidential information  could be leaked to competitors.   Employees with access to such information could simply be subject to  nondisclosure agreements, which are typical today. Indeed,  nondisclosure agreements are a simple solution that protects the  company, but does not deny the employees the right to understand the  worth of, or the risks associated with, the compensation they are  receiving. Unfortunately, this bill would limit that transparency and  those protections.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this legislation, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Ellison), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Delaney), a member of the Committee on Financial  Services, my classmate, and a cosponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the comments of my colleague and friend. I do, however,  disagree that the question here derives from a lack of understanding of  the legislation. I think it is entirely possible--in fact, I would  suggest that it is likely--that members of a body such as this, from  435 distinct districts and different experiences, can look at the same  information, fully understand it, and come to different conclusions as  to what sort of policy ought to be in place, and that is where I have  landed on this particular subject. I fully understand.                                time  1545    I also think it is important to note that we can't on one hand say  that this is not about disclosure and on the other hand mention that  these disclosure requirements could have a negative impact and  encourage or discourage companies from engaging in the practice of  awarding employees with stock as a part of their compensation.   It is a question of disclosure. This legislation is about the  disclosure requirements that should be applied in this case. That is  really what we have heard from both sides of this argument: where  should that disclosure requirement be, and at what level should it be  incurred?   What I would say is--and I think this is important to note, speaking  for myself--I know many other members of the Financial Services  Committee and Members of this body that may oppose this legislation  feel strongly that the direction toward awarding employees with stock  ownership is a positive direction. It is something that my friend, Mr.  Delaney, has not only advocated for, but has practiced in his own  private sector experience. It is a positive thing for a company and it  is a positive thing for the employees.   The only point that I continue to drive home and that others have  reiterated is that it is important that employees understand the nature  of the stock that is being awarded to them and that the disclosure  requirements make clear employees are aware of the compensation and its  true value. That is really the point of my objection.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter I received from Public  Citizen, which articulates some of these same arguments.                                                 PUBLIC CITIZEN,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2017.      Member,      House Committee on Financial Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of more than 400,000 members       and supporters of Public Citizen, we offer the following       comments on bills facing a committee vote March 9, 2017.        In securities lawmaking, we believe the committee's compass       should always point to investor protection. Well informed       investors who can trust disclosures form the bedrock of       capital formation. We are concerned that a few of these       measures point in a different direction.        HR 910: The ``Fair Access to Investor Research Act of       2017'' directs the SEC to eliminate restrictions on research       reports that cover Exchange Traded Funds (ETEs). The result       of this measure means that firms promoting ETFs can       simultaneously publish reports that appear to be impartial       analysis. This may lead investors to take unwarranted comfort       in the security. In the last decade, ETFs have grown from       about 100 funds with $100 billion in assets to more than 1300       funds with $1.8 trillion in assets,That makes the playing       field for mischief immense.        Puffery parading as research led to the dot-com bubble in       the late 1990s, where analysts disregarded fundamental       metrics such as a revenue and income when recommending the       purchase of new internet-based firms. This measure improves       on a previous iteration of the legislation by allowing       fundamental fraud oversight by the SEC. But the bill ignores       the basic hazard that a firm's motivation in funding research       may be sales promotion and not bona fide education for its       clients. We also note that ETFs represent the securities of       active firms. That is, an ETF holds assets such as stocks or       bonds. That means this has little to do with capital       formation. Now, research reports insulated from government       scrutiny may too often serve to promote more turnover and       commissions, not sound guidance. For these reasons, we oppose       this bill and encourage members to vote no.        HR 1343: The ``Encouraging Employee Ownership Act of 2017''       increases from $5 million to $10 million the amount of       securities a firm may sell annually to its employees without       providing certain basic financial information. We believe       this is misguided for a number of reasons. First, defenders       of this measure reference the potential for leakage of       propriety information. There's little evidence of this       problem. It's simply not in the self-interest of an employee-      owner to divulge critical information to a rival, especially       if it would undermine the value of the stock. Second,       employees who are compensated in stock (instead of additional       cash) should be entitled to be informed about the financial       condition of their company, the same as any other investor.       Other company creditors, such as the firm's bank or major       supplier, receive this information, however this measure       reduces stock-compensated employees to a class below these       other creditors. Young firms may be struggling with cash-flow       problems and choose to use stock rather than cash for       compensation. But those employees should be informed about       such risks. Third, the basic thrust of this measure is to       lead employees to hold a greater share of their savings in       the firm. An employee invested in his or her own firm may be       more productive and lead to greater profits at the firm that       the employee then shares; but there is a point beyond which       this dynamic dissipates. Any prudent investor should       diversify. Overconcentration in one asset, especially where       the firm's prospects are less than stellar, compounds the       employee-investor's risk. We oppose this bill, and encourage       members to do the same.        HR 1366: The ``U.S. Territories Investor Protection Act''       extends basic U.S. securities law oversight to investment       firms operating in Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories. To       date, these firms have escaped oversight, disclosure and       conflict-of-interest requirements that mainland firms face.       We support this common sense reform.            Sincerely                                                   Bartlett Naylor,                                                    Public Citizen.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), a member of the Committee on Rules  and the Committee on Education and the Workforce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would just point out again that the position many of us are taking  does not contradict the principles that are being articulated. In fact,  the law does not preclude any company from awarding stock as  compensation at any level. It simply requires that information be  provided so that those individuals who are receiving that compensation  have the information and have the resources to understand the value of  that compensation. I just want to reiterate that because it is  important that the position not be mischaracterized as one that wants  to dampen the ability of companies to reward their employees with stock  or use that as a form of compensation. It is just important that they  have transparency in that process so people who are receiving that  compensation understand its true value.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   I have heard a number of my colleagues point to the red tape and the  unnecessary burdens that are placed on a company that wishes to provide  stock compensation.   Let me be clear about what it is that we would require. This is what  is required for a company that exceeds the threshold: That they provide  a copy of the compensation plan or a contract, if they disclose that; a  copy of a summary plan description, if it is an ERISA retirement plan  or, if not, a summary of the plan's material terms; risk factors  associated with the stock; and the company's most recent financial  statements from the last 2 years, which don't need to be audited.   This is important information for anyone receiving stock as  compensation in order to understand the value of that stock and not a  burdensome requirement on a company, particularly a company of the size  that would be required under the increased threshold that is being  proposed by this law.   If there is any aspect of this debate which is common sense, it is  common sense that a person receiving compensation ought to have  information that tells them the value of that compensation.   Mr. Speaker, I think this is an important debate and discussion. It  is one that this body is well-served by taking on.   I do agree, as I said, that this is an important direction for us to  take as a nation. And it certainly makes sense that, in order for us to  fully all participate in the economy, employee ownership is a value. It  creates more productive companies, more competitive companies. It  provides better compensation, and, as has been pointed out, it creates  more stable organizations less likely to lay people off, more likely to  be sustainable companies. That is all good, and that is important.   It comes down to the question of transparency. Employees deserve to  know the state of their employer's finances, if they are to accept  stock in lieu of monetary compensation. They deserve no less protection  than other investors in the company.   We shouldn't fear that kind of transparency. A company that wants its  employees to accept stock instead of monetary compensation should  embrace this sort of compensation. If they want to empower those  employees and they want to make them a part of the company, they should  provide them with  [[Page H2675]]  the information that helps them understand the value of that ownership.    Transparency is important for individuals to make informed choices,  not informed choices coming from a dictate from Washington but  information that they have the right to have. It empowers them with  knowledge that allows them to make choices about the form of  compensation that they would accept.   That is what this legislation really is about, and that is why I  oppose the legislation and encourage my colleagues to join me in that.   I yield back the balance of my time.
