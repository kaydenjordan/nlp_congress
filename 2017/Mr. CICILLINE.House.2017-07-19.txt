 Mr. Speaker, Republicans have threatened to repeal and  replace the Affordable Care Act for 7 years, but earlier this week,  they failed again to deliver on this threat. So next week, the Senate  will vote on a bill to repeal the Affordable Care Act without a  replacement.   If this bill were to pass, 32 million people will lose their health  insurance, insurance premiums will go up, and insurance markets will  unravel. That is exactly why this bill will not pass. But Mitch  McConnell and the Republican leadership are going to have a vote  anyway.  [[Page H5989]]    What is the point?   The American people are sick and tired of Washington failing to get  things done. It is time--in fact, well past time--for Republicans to  stop going it alone. All of us came here to serve our constituents, but  that is not going to happen unless Republicans are willing to work in  good faith with Democrats to make the necessary improvements to the  Affordable Care Act.   If we work together, none of us will get everything we want, which is  true, but our constituents will finally get the progress they have been  waiting for, and that is much more important.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I rise in opposition to the rule and urge my colleagues to defeat the  previous question so that we can take up the legislation that has just  been outlined by Mr. Pascrell.   There is no more responsibility that we have than creating good- paying jobs for the American people; and this is, after all, according  to President Trump, ``Make It in America'' Week, which, in fact, is a  centerpiece of the Democratic agenda. We have a number of bills that  are designed to help reinvigorate and strengthen American  manufacturing.   It is shocking for the American people to learn that we have a Tax  Code, as Mr. Pascrell outlined, that gives a tax break to companies  that ship American jobs overseas, exactly the opposite of what it  should be if we are really concerned about creating good-paying jobs  here in our own country. So defeating the previous question means we  could take up the stop offshoring now legislation, which would get rid  of this nonsensical provision in our Tax Code.   When you go out there and talk to constituents, you say: One of the  reasons we can't keep good manufacturing jobs here in America is  because we incentivize, we use some of your tax dollars to incentivize  companies to ship those jobs overseas. It makes no sense.   So how about, during ``Make It in America'' Week, rather than just  using that phrase, as the President has done, let's do something that  will actually help promote making things in this country--I know,  probably a challenging concept for the President, who does his  manufacturing overseas, not in the United States.   Let's take a bold step today. Remove that provision of the Tax Code,  and have a Tax Code provision that actually incentivizes creating jobs  in our own country and giving tax credits to companies that create jobs  in America. What a novel idea.   I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so that we can  take this piece of legislation up, and perhaps it will then encourage  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to move forward on a  number of bills that are part of the Democratic Make It in America  agenda to help rebuild American manufacturing and put people back to  work in good-paying jobs.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to a question of the privileges of  the House and offer the resolution that was previously noticed.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Collins of Georgia). The Clerk will  report the resolution.   The Clerk read as follows:         Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that       the President shall immediately disclose his tax return       information to the House of Representatives and the American       people.        Whereas, according to the Tax History Project, every       President since Gerald Ford has disclosed his tax return       information to the public;        Whereas, the chairmen of the Committee on Ways and Means,       Joint Committee on Taxation, and the Committee on Finance       have the authority to request the President's tax returns       under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;        Whereas, pursuant to Article I, section 7, clause 1 of the       Constitution, often referred to as the Origination Clause,       the House of Representatives has the sole authority to       initiate legislation that raises revenue for the national       government, and the Committee on Ways and Means is       considering a comprehensive reform of the Tax Code;        Whereas, President Donald J. Trump holds interests as the       sole or principal owner in approximately 500 separate       business entities, and the President's tax plan proposes to       cut the corporate tax from 35 percent to 15 percent,       applicable to many of these entities;        Whereas, against the advice of ethics attorneys and the       nonpartisan Office of Government Ethics, the President has       refused to divest his ownership stake in his businesses, has       instead placed his assets in a trust which is run by his       adult children, and the President can withdraw profits from       his trust at any time of his choosing from any of the       companies he owns;        Whereas, the Director of the Office of Government Ethics,       Walter Shaub, resigned on July 6, 2017, stating that ``There       isn't much more I could accomplish at the Office of       Government Ethics, given the current situation. O.G.E.'s       recent experiences have made it clear that the ethics program       needs to be strengthened'';        Whereas, according to media reports analyzing President       Trump's leaked 2005 tax return, had his own tax plan been in       place, he would have paid an estimated 3.48 percent rate       instead of a 24 percent rate, saving him $31.3 million in       that year alone;        Whereas, without access to the President's tax returns, the       American people cannot determine how much he will personally       benefit from proposed changes to the Tax Code or from policy       decisions he makes, nor can the American people fully       understand the financial interests and motivations of the       President;        Whereas, in June 2017, President Trump filed an updated       financial disclosure with the Office of Government Ethics       which showed that the President reported $37.2 million income       from the Mar-a-Lago resort between January 2016 and April       2017 where he hosted the President of China and from where he       ordered missile strikes against Syria;        Whereas, during the same time period, President Trump       reported $288 million in income from all his golf courses,       including $19.7 million from his course in Bedminister, New       Jersey;        Whereas, over the weekend of July 14, President Trump sent       out eight tweets promoting the U.S. Women's Open Golf       Tournament which took place at his Bedminister club;        Whereas, Mar-a-Lago doubled its new member fees to $200,000       immediately following the 2016 election, and President Trump       personally benefits from such new member fees;        Whereas, disclosure of the President's tax returns would       help those investigating Russian interference in the 2016       election and assist them in better understanding the       President's financial ties to the Russian Federation, Russian       businesses, and Russian individuals;        Whereas, in 2013, President Trump said, ``Well, I've done a       lot of business with the Russians. They're smart and they're       tough,'' and President Trump's son, Donald Trump, Jr., told a       news outlet in 2008 that ``Russians make up a pretty       disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets'';        Whereas, President Trump fired Federal Bureau of       Investigation Director James Comey, who was overseeing an       investigation into ties and any collusion between the Russian       Government and President Trump's campaign;        Whereas, former Director Comey testified before the Senate       Intelligence Committee that President Trump asked him to       ``let go'' of an investigation into former National Security       Advisor Michael Flynn's business ties to Russia;        Whereas, President Trump stated on May 11, 2017, that he       had decided that he was going to fire Comey because of ``this       Russia thing'';        Whereas, at the G-20 Hamburg summit on July 7, 2017,       President Trump took a more than 2 hour closed-door meeting       with President Vladimir Putin, after which he claimed that he       ``strongly pressed'' President Putin on Russian interference       in U.S. elections and that it is ``time to move forward'';        Whereas, on June 9, 2016, then-Candidate Trump's son,       Donald Trump, Jr., then-Trump campaign chairman Paul       Manafort, and Trump son-in-law and current White House       adviser Jared Kushner met with a person described as ``a       Russian government attorney,'' and a former Russian military       intelligence officer who promised to offer incriminating       information about Hillary Clinton which had been collected as       part of a Russian Government effort to assist President Trump       in his campaign for President;        Whereas, the Committee on Ways and Means has in the past       used the authority under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue       Code of 1986 in 2014 to make public the confidential tax       information of 51 taxpayers;        Whereas, the Committee on Ways and Means has now voted       three times along party lines to continue to conceal       President Trump's tax returns;        Whereas, the House of Representatives has now refused ten       times to act on President Trump's tax returns;        Whereas, the Committee on the Judiciary has failed to       conduct even basic oversight on the connections between the       Russian Government and the Trump campaign;        Whereas, the Committee on the Judiciary has now voted twice       along party lines to decline to request documents detailing       the Trump administration's ties with Russian officials;        Whereas, the House of Representatives undermines its       dignity and the integrity of its proceedings by continuing       the cover-up of President Trump's tax returns: Now,       therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives shall--        1. Immediately request the tax return and return       information of Donald J. Trump for tax years 2006 through       2015, as provided under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue       Code of 1986, as well as the tax return, and return       information with respect to the President's businesses, of       each business entity disclosed by Donald J. Trump on his       Office of Government Ethics Form 278e, specifically each       corporation and each partnership, within the meaning of       subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of       1986, where he is listed as an officer, director, or       equivalent, or exercises working control; and        2. Postpone consideration of tax reform legislation until       the elected Representatives of the American people in this       House have obtained President Trump's tax returns and return       information to ascertain how any changes to the Tax Code       might financially benefit the President.                                time  1330    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman from Rhode Island wish to  present argument on the parliamentary question of whether the  resolution  [[Page H5998]]  presents a question of the privileges of the House?    Yes.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized on the question  of order.    Yes.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized on the question  of order.    Yes.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized on the question  of order.    Yes.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized on the question  of order.    Mr. Speaker, this resolution raises the question of  the privilege of the House pursuant to rule IX, clause 1, as it  affects, ``the rights of the House collectively, its dignity, and the  integrity of its proceedings,'' insofar as it raises the House's  failure to undertake its constitutional responsibility of oversight and  the obligation of all elected officials to ensure decisions are made  free of conflicts and with the public interest in mind.   In particular, matters related to the House's constitutionally  granted powers have been recognized as valid questions of the  privileges of the House. The Origination Clause that requires that  revenue bills originate in the House includes the issues related to  revenues generated by our Tax Code.   Clearly, the issues raised by this resolution cover these matters  contemplated by the Origination Clause. There is nothing more of a  threat to the integrity of the House than ignoring our duty to provide  a check and balance to the executive branch.   To restore the dignity of the House, we must use our authority to  request President Trump's tax returns and give the American people the  transparency they deserve.   The stunning conflicts of interest are piling up as the President,  his family, and his friends profit in their personal business endeavors  while serving in public office. President Trump has not divested  himself from his businesses as was recommended.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman's remarks must be confined to  the question of order.    I understand, Mr. Speaker. My point is, in order to  rule on this, it is important for the Chair to understand that the  severity of the questions with respect to the integrity of our  proceedings are undermined because of the potential conflicts of  interest and the lack of information about the tax returns and related  materials of the President.   So you can't make an argument about the rights of the House  collectively, its dignity, and the integrity of the proceedings without  understanding the presence, the evidence of the conflicts of interest,  of the potential foreign entanglements, of the self-dealing that tax  returns would reveal and help illuminate.   You also can't protect the integrity of our responsibilities as a  check on the executive branch without understanding that we have a  responsibility to examine these financial interactions, the influence  of the Russians, and interfering with our elections, the firing of  Director Comey, the secret meetings between the President's campaign.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is again reminded to keep his  remarks confined to the question of order.    Mr. Speaker, I understand the ruling of the Chair with  respect to confining my remarks. These remarks, in fact, relate  directly to whether or not this resolution, which seeks the production  of the President's tax returns, relate to ``the rights of the House  collectively, its dignity, and the integrity of the proceedings.''   What I am suggesting, Mr. Speaker, is that in order for the House to  fulfill its responsibilities, its constitutional responsibilities of  oversight, and check and balance on the executive branch and to  faithfully honor our responsibilities under the Origination Clause that  says the House is the place that revenue generation must begin--and we  are contemplating a reform of the Tax Code--in order to do that, free  from the potential conflicts of interest, the House and the American  people have a right to know what are the real interests of President  Trump, where are his investments, what are the tax policies, will they  benefit him, or will they benefit the American people.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair reminds the gentleman to confine  his remarks to the question of order. The Chair is prepared to rule.   The gentleman from Rhode Island seeks to offer a resolution as a  question of the privileges of the House under rule IX.   In evaluating the resolution under rule IX, the Chair must determine  whether the resolution affects ``the rights of the House collectively,  its safety, dignity, and the integrity of its proceedings.''   The first resolving clause of the resolution offered by the gentleman  from Rhode Island seeks tax returns and tax return information of the  President and certain of his business entities.   Section 702 of the House Rules and Manual states that ``rule IX is  concerned not with the privileges of the Congress, as a legislative  branch, but only with the privileges of the House, as a House.''   As the Chair most recently ruled on June 21, 2017, a resolution  offered under rule IX seeking information from actors entirely  extramural to the House--such as the President and certain business  entities in which the President may be involved--is not uniquely  concerned with the privileges of the House, as a House.   Accordingly, the resolution offered by the gentleman from Rhode  Island does not constitute a question of privilege under rule IX.    Mr. Speaker, I appeal the ruling of the Chair.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Shall the decision of the  Chair stand as the judgment of the House?                               Motion to Table     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15- minute vote on the motion to table will be followed by 5-minute votes  on:   Ordering the previous question on House Resolution 454;   Adopting House Resolution 454, if ordered; and   Agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal, if ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 235,  nays 190, answered ``present'' 1, not voting 7, as follows:                               [Roll No. 392]                                 YEAS--235       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Bridenstine      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Estes (KS)      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Franks (AZ)      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gianforte      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Handel      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
