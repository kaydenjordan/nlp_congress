 Mr. Chair, Americans really shouldn't care that much  about this Duncan amendment if they don't go on the highway; but if you  go on the highway, like hundreds of millions of Americans do, you  better watch out, because this amendment makes it far more likely that  there will be reckless and negligent truckers on the road and that you  won't be able to sue for your damages if they smash up your car.   Take the shocking case of a 19-year-old man whose car was totaled by  a truck driver who was high on crystal meth. He was left injured and  blinded for the rest of his life.   Now, the truck company never drug tested or road tested its  employees, but that didn't stop the shipper from hiring that trucking  company to do business with.   Now, the Duncan amendment would reward the shipper by immunizing it  from any liability for hiring a low-road trucker that doesn't drug test  its employees, or even knowingly hires employees who are high on  crystal meth or who have a drug problem.   This would give the shippers even greater incentive to hire reckless  and negligent truckers, making our roads and highways all the more  dangerous.   In ``Born to Run'', Bruce Springsteen talks about cars that are  suicide machines and a deathtrap.   Mr. Chair, this amendment would make that vision of our highways the  law.   There is no way that the American people support excusing shippers  from liability for their decision to hire low-road truckers, low-road  trucking companies that do not drug test or do background screening on  their employees.
