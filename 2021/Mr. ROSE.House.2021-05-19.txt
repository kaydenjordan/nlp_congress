 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my steadfast support  for the nation of Israel, our closest and greatest ally in the Middle  East.   Hamas, a designated terrorist organization, has been targeting  civilians by firing thousands of rockets on Israeli cities. These  attacks are both tragic and unacceptable, and Israel undeniably has the  right to continue to defend itself.   As Hamas continues these attacks, the United States must show its  unwavering support for Israel, condemn this aggression by Hamas, and  sanction those who fund terrorism, such as Iran. That is why I am a  cosponsor of the Palestinian International Terrorism Support Prevention  Act introduced by Representative Brian Mast. America does not tolerate  those who fund terrorists, and this legislation would put in place  sanctions on governments and individuals that do.   The nation of Israel is the only democracy in the Middle East, and  the relationship we share is indispensable. With the world watching, we  must send a clear message to Hamas, Islamic jihadists, and those that  fund them that the United States stands with Israel.   I unequivocally support our friend, Israel, and recognize its right  to self-defense in the face of these horrific assaults by Hamas. I pray  for peace in Jerusalem and for the safety of all Israelis.
