 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the Senate is now, of course, back in  session following a 2-week home work period, as we refer to it. That is  when we get to go back home and see our friends and constituents and  travel around our States. And in my case, representing 29 million  Texans, that entails a fair amount of travel, but it is always good to  get reconnected with your friends and your neighbors and your  constituents.   I know we are eager to hit the ground running here this week, and  certainly, we have a lot to do. For example, the conference committee  process for the China competitiveness bill will begin soon, and I am  eager to work with the fellow Members of the conference committee to  reach a strong, bipartisan bill.   The long list of unrelated partisan provisions in the House bill,  though, have no place, in my opinion, in the final agreement, but I am  ready to get the ball rolling so we can pass a bill that serves the  American people, our economy, and, most importantly, our national  security.
