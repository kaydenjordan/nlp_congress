 Mr. Speaker, due to a personal conflict, I was unable to  make votes. Had I been present, I would have voted: ``Yea'' on rollcall  No. 532, ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 533, ``Yea'' on rollcall No. 534,  ``Nay'' on rollcall No. 535, ``Nay'' on rollcall No. 536, ``Yea'' on  rollcall No. 537.                            ____________________
