 Madam Speaker, I stand before you today reporting for  duty to our country, to our communities, to our Constitution, and most  importantly, for New Mexico.   As you can see, Madam Speaker, unfortunately, I can't say the same  for my Republican colleagues right here, who hightailed it out of town  because they decided that their weekend plans were more important than  showing up for the American people.   It is reckless. It is disturbing. It is fundamentally irresponsible.   Here we are, on the verge of an economic crisis, and they are  demanding that we cut programs for housing, food, and our veterans.   Let me say this to my friends on the other side of the aisle: If you  are so concerned about people getting to work, how about you show up to  do your own job?   How about you show up for the American people?   How about you show up and do the job you were elected to do?   Let's pass a clean debt ceiling and ensure that we save our economy  and serve our communities.                            ____________________
