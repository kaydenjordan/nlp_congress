 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Madam President, I want to tell my colleagues about a  disappointment I have in some U.S. Department of Agriculture recent  revisions of a proposed rule.   Here is the background: I have long fought to strengthen the safety  net so that Iowa family farmers and other farmers are protected from  natural disasters or other unforeseen events that they have no control  over, like flooding or wind storms.   Family farmers work hard to make sure that Americans have food on the  table. These same family farmers operate on very thin margins. These  farmers ought to qualify for help during tough times since losing these  operations would risk our Nation's food supply.   However, taxpayers and nonfarm State lawmakers may stop supporting a  Federal farm safety net if spending programs aren't held accountable or  left unchecked. Losing urban support for this farm safety net is why I  am deeply concerned about the USDA's recent proposal to roll back rules  that put teeth in the definition of a legal term called ``actively  engaged in farming.''   Long-lost relatives, by changing these rules, who have probably never  lifted a finger on the farm should not get away with collecting farm  payments. Farm payments should only go to operators that--and I have a  definition that is a little facetious but somewhat realistic--unless  they have dirt under their fingernails.   A few weeks ago, I recently complimented Secretary Perdue on what I  thought were very strong rules that were being proposed at that time.  Now the USDA's decision to backtrack on their rules means more  megafarmers will take advantage of this loophole and people who aren't  actively engaged in farming will benefit from farm payments. I am  disappointed with this turnaround.   Once again, Congress must do what it can to oppose these loopholes so  that we have only family farmers benefiting from the farm program.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have an amendment to offset the costs  to the Social Security's disability insurance trust fund associated  with S. 578. Eventhough my amendment did not gain the 60 vote  threshold, I want my colleagues to know that you just can't tap into  the Social Security disability trust funds without dire future  consequences.  [[Page S7174]]    S. 578 waives a waiting period in the disability program for the  compelling case of patients with ALS.   There are, of course, other compelling cases.   And we have to be mindful of the disability trust fund which will  eventually face depletion.   As the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, which is an  umbrella organization representing advocates for a number of disabling  conditions, puts it:         ``Bills that only fix the problem for some people who meet       the strict eligibility standards for SSDI are likely to lead       to interest groups requesting waiver of wait periods for       other impairments.''    So it is likely that Congress will see more requests for waivers of  waiting periods for those afflicted with disabilities arising from  conditions other than ALS.   Waiting periods in the disability insurance program were put into law  for various policy reasons.   When we waive waiting periods for specific conditions, some of which  are terribly disabling and even fatal, we change the nature of the  disability program.   We change benefits and don't have any offsetting change to the tax  that funds the disability insurance trust fund or any offsetting change  to other benefits.   However compelling it is to waive waiting periods, whenever we do it,  we accelerate the exhaustion of the disability trust fund.   And that affects people with all forms of disability.   In order to help make Social Security combined disability and  retirement trust funds whole, my amendment would offset the cost of the  ALS bill.   My amendment simply changes the minimum monthly withholding threshold  for recovery of any overpayment of Social Security benefits to reflect  the increase in benefits we have seen since SSA established the current  minimum of $10 in 1960.   My amendment simply changes the threshold amount from $10 to 10  percent of the monthly benefit payable, as is already done in the SSI  program.   With this change, SSA would recover overpayments more efficiently and  better fulfill its stewardship obligations to Social Security's trust  funds, while retaining safeguards for beneficiaries surrounding  overpayments.   Guardrails to protect beneficiaries to ensure that collections don't  create hardships are maintained.   Nothing in my amendment leads to benefit cuts of even a penny that a  retiree or disabled worker has earned.   This policy is something that has been in numerous budgets of the  President, including President Obama and now President Trump.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, to ensure that we  protect the integrity of Social Security's trust funds while also  protecting beneficiaries.                            ____________________
