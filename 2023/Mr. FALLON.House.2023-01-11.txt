 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life and  service of Brian Clint Worley of Emory, Texas.   Emory is a small town in Rains County where great Americans reside.  During my campaign in 2020, I befriended his parents, Fred and Sue  Worley, who couldn't be more gentle, wonderful, loving souls.   Brian was born in Denton, Texas, on March 11, 1968. He graduated from  Rains High School in Emory in 1987 where he was a star basketball,  baseball, track, and football player. Brian received all-district  honors for his athletic performances and was voted most courteous, best  personality, and most prestigious at Rains High School.   In 1991, Brian graduated from Kilgore College Police Academy, and he  began his law enforcement career at the Mount Pleasant Police  Department. He received several commendations in his first 4 years as a  police officer and once helped save an elderly citizen from choking. He  saved a life. Moreover, his work in the Selective Traffic Enforcement  Program helped apprehend numerous drunk drivers, and again, saved  countless lives.   Brian attended the Texas Department of Public Safety Training Academy  in Austin, Texas, in 1995 and was stationed in Cooper, Texas, and later  Sulphur Springs.   Some of Brian's many recognitions include District Commanders Award,  the Texas Department of Public Safety Chief's Award, and Trooper of the  Year in 1988.   Brian was a man of faith and dedicated his career to serving the  people of Texas. He was a loving father who deeply cared about his  family, his friends, and his pets. He will be closely and fondly  remembered by many.   I have requested that a flag be flown over our Nation's Capitol to  recognize Brian's tremendous life and his extraordinary public service.  He will be dearly missed by his friends, family, and colleagues.   Fred and Sue, his parents, are salt of the earth people. They love  things that are greater than themselves, and that is so incredibly  inspiring. They know that God is greater than they are; that this  country is greater than they are; that Texas, their friends, their  family, and their community is more important than they are. When you  meet people like that and see the lives that they lead, it warms the  heart and it warms the soul.   When you lose a spouse, they call you a ``widow.'' When you lose a  parent, they call you an ``orphan.'' Fred and Sue have lost a child.  When you lose a child, it is so God awful they don't even have a name  for it.   What breaks my heart is not only the loss of Brian, but that his  children, Caden and Emily, have lost their father. I know they are  watching right now, and I want to make sure they understand that a  grateful Nation grieves with them.   I think the greatest compliment you can pay a person is to say that  the world is a better place with them in it. The world sheds a  collective tear now that we have lost Brian.   Mr. Speaker, we should take inspiration from the Worley family,  extend our deepest condolences, and promise them that we will follow in  the footsteps of Brian and emulate his love of this country and of  others.   We will be praying for Brian. We will see him soon. God bless Brian.                            ____________________
