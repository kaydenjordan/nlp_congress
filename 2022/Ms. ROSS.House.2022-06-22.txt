 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution H. Res. 1191 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1191         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4176) to       improve Federal population surveys by requiring the       collection of voluntary, self-disclosed information on sexual       orientation and gender identity in certain surveys, and for       other purposes.

Sec. 8.  House Resolution 188, agreed to March 8, 2021 (as       most recently amended by House Resolution 1170, agreed to       June 14, 2022), is amended by striking ``June 22, 2022'' each       place it appears and inserting (in each instance) ``July 13,       2022''.        Sec. 9.  Notwithstanding clause 8 of rule XX, further       proceedings on a vote by the yeas and nays on the question of       adoption of a motion that the House suspend the rules offered       on the legislative day of June 21, 2022, June 22, 2022, June       23, 2022, or June 24, 2022, may be postponed through the       legislative day of July 15, 2022.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration  of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1191, for three measures.   First, it provides for consideration of H.R. 4176 under a structured  rule. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment, provides 1 hour of  general debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  member of the Committee on Oversight and Reform, makes in order three  amendments, and provides a motion to recommit.   Second, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 5585 under a  structured rule. The rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee  on Energy and Commerce, makes in order one amendment, and provides a  motion to recommit.   Third, the rule provides for consideration of H.R. 7666 under a  structured rule. The rule self-executes a manager's amendment, provides  1 hour of general debate equally controlled by the chair and ranking  member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, makes in order 17  amendments, and provides en bloc authority and a motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule extends recess instructions, suspension authority,  and same-day authority through July 13, and any requested roll call  votes on suspension bills considered from June 21 to June 24 may be  postponed through July 15.   Madam Speaker, I stand in support of the three bills in this rule:  H.R. 7666, the Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act;  H.R. 5585, the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Health Act; and H.R.  4176, the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act.   I want to start by thanking Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman  Pallone and Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers for their work crafting a  bipartisan package to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our  country.   During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a dramatic rise in global  mental health illness associated with anxiety, depression, and  collective grief.   In my State, almost 45 percent of North Carolinians reported symptoms  of anxiety or depression in February 2021, with more than 22 percent  unable to get necessary care, largely because of prohibitive costs.   Almost 130,000 children ages 12 through 17 in North Carolina suffer  from adolescent depression. Multiply that nationwide. More than half of  the children in North Carolina did not receive any care in the past  year. Once they reach high school, these children are twice as likely  to drop out of school as their peers.   These statistics tell just part of the story of families disrupted,  education delayed, and the barriers facing Americans striving to  achieve their full potential and well-being.   Congress has a duty to address this crisis with the same urgency with  which we passed COVID-19 legislation.   Today, we are doing just that with H.R. 7666, the Restoring Hope for  Mental Health and Well-Being Act, which will provide improved access to  healthcare for mental illnesses and substance abuse disorders.   This legislation boosts compliance with mental health parity laws,  supports mental health care through telehealth, and reauthorizes key  programs that fund mental health services, all deeply needed by our  people.   This rule also includes H.R. 5585, the Advanced Research Projects  Agency-Health Act, ARPA-H.   For decades, the United States has been the leader in biomedical  research around the world. However, our country has recently shown  signs of slowing in this sector.   Promising research opportunities are put on hold due to high cost,  complex coordination, long wait periods, and many other factors.   My State of North Carolina became the first State in the country to  have a State-supported entity dedicated to promoting growth of the life  sciences industry after the creation of the North Carolina  Biotechnology Center in 1984.   In my district of Wake County, the Research Triangle Park stands as  the largest research park in North America. ARPA-H will have profound  influences in North Carolina's economy and the national economy and  stimulate the development of breakthroughs in health research that will  benefit millions of Americans.   H.R. 5585 will authorize $500 million each year for the next 5 years  to support ARPA-H and fund groundbreaking research and development to  continue saving American lives.   Finally, this rule includes H.R. 4176, the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion  Act. Most legislators agree that good policy should be evidence-based.  Our Government collects demographic data to ensure we can identify  whether certain groups of Americans are facing obstacles to the equal  opportunities they need to thrive. However, Federal agencies are not  currently required to collect demographic data on sexual orientation  and gender identity. We need this data to know how to address issues  faced by the LGBTQI+ people and combat discrimination.                                time  1230    In 2019, UCLA found that nearly one in four LGBTQ adults in the  South, including in my State of North Carolina,  [[Page H5747]]  live in poverty, a rate higher than the overall poverty rate in the  United States.   LGBTQI+ youth, in particular, face high levels of homelessness and  are at greater risk of depression and suicidal thoughts than their  peers. With good data, we can implement good programs aimed at  eliminating these disparities and help members of this community reach  their full potential.   As Cathy Renna of the National LGBTQ Task Force says, ``If we don't  get counted, we don't count.'' This community is asking to be counted.  Our Nation has already gone through the poor policy of Don't Ask, Don't  Tell. We now have a responsibility to reverse the effects of this  policy to help members of the LGBTQI+ community live as their authentic  selves.   We can do that by allowing individuals to voluntarily disclose their  sexual orientation and gender identities. In other words, by asking and  letting them decide to tell.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for the rule and the three bills it  contains, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a June 11, 2021, CNN  Business article entitled ``LGBTQ+ Americans aren't fully counted by  the government. That's a big problem.''                    [From CNN Business, June, 11, 2021]   LGBTQ+ Americans Aren't Fully Counted by the Government. That's a Big                                  Problem                   (By Anneken Tappe and Alicia Wallace)         Government data help policymakers find and fix problems for       people in need. But that's tricky if some groups aren't       represented in the stats.        This is the case for the LGBTQ+ community, and it's a huge       problem. Here's an example: The government's monthly jobs       report shows how many men and women, Black, White, Asian and       Hispanic workers are unemployed. The stats lay bare a lot of       inequities, but there are no comparable federal data on       LGBTQ+ workers.        ``We are invisible in federal statistics, when it comes to       some policymakers,'' said  [[Page H5748]]       Justin Nelson, co-founder and president of the National LGBT       Chamber of Commerce (NGLCC).        Put more bluntly: ``If we don't get counted, we don't       count,'' said Cathy Renna, communications director at the       National LGBTQ Task Force.        Official stats, including the Census, are used to decide       how federal funds are distributed--to the tune of $1.5       trillion. But data gaps in the jobs reports, health surveys       and the decennial Census affect millions of people: 5.6       percent of US adults identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or       transgender, according to a Gallup survey published in       February.        Official data are needed ``to ensure that LGBT people are       included in efforts to reduce unemployment through increased       labor force participation, as well as to monitor compliance       with anti-discrimination provisions,'' researchers at the       UCLA School of Law's Williams Institute wrote earlier this       year in support of adding LGBTQ+ questions to the Current       Population Survey, which helps create the jobs report.        Recent research has found higher rates of poverty,       unemployment, health disparities, and workplace       discrimination among LGBTQ+ adults, according to the Williams       Institute. The negative outcomes were even greater among       transgender individuals and LGBTQ+ people of color.        Examples of how data can change outcomes for the LGBTQ+       community include the establishment of the Massachusetts       Commission on LGBTQ youth, school training services and       ongoing research after former Governor William Weld sought to       respond to an increase in LGBTQ+ youth suicides; the       improvement of individuals' medical care following research       asking patients about their sexual orientation and gender       identity; and the creation of equity programs within the Los       Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services       following a study that showed LGBTQ+ youth were       overrepresented in the youth foster system and experienced       harsher treatment.        Although independent research from the Williams Institute       and established pollsters such Gallup have provided some data       about the community, that research just doesn't carry the       same weight as government stats in leading to funding of       direct services and addressing the needs of people in the       queer community, Renna said.        Across government agencies, academics and the LGTBQ+       community itself, people have expressed a desire to better       understand the needs of that population. The government is       doing research to figure out how to best ask about sexual       orientation and gender identity.        But the business of big, robust data sets is complicated.        Government statistics are pretty sophisticated and the       methodology behind surveys goes through a lot of prodding.       But when it comes to the LGBTQ+ community, government       institutions haven't done enough research yet to make broader       improvements to the data.        The worry is that reporting errors on questions surrounding       sexual orientation and gender identity may lead to much       bigger errors in the eventual data.        ``Questions for relatively small populations must be       formulated especially carefully; if they are not, even       relatively small sampling or reporting errors can lead to       large errors in estimates,'' the US Bureau of Labor       Statistics told CNN Business in an email.        The questions the Census Bureau asks also have to go       through an established process to review wording and       effectiveness. Ultimately the Office of Management and Budget       approves any new questions.        When the government surveys households, for example to       learn about America's employment situation, one person       answers questions for other members of their household. That       can make it harder to get accurate data on members of the       LGBTQ+ community, especially if a person hasn't come out to       their family, or if the survey respondent is uncomfortable       talking about another household member's sexual orientation       or gender identity.        ``Not everyone's out,'' Renna added. ``Some of us live in       places where you can be fired if you come out.''        The NGLCC, which leans heavily on community-driven surveys       and private sector research, has yet to meet with the Census       and BLS on inclusive data-gathering efforts, Nelson said. But       he said he is optimistic about the Biden-Harris       Administration's efforts to broaden the scope of its data       collection.        President Joe Biden last week, in officially recognizing       June as Pride Month, urged Congress to pass the Equality Act       to ensure civil rights protections for members of the LGBTQ+       community and their families.        ``We are a strong part of the economic fabric . . . not       just in Pride Month,'' Nelson said. ``We need to get       inclusive on data collection immediately, because the sooner       we can normalize that data collection, the less opportunity       there is for erasing it.''        The people behind government surveys are doing research to       move toward a world in which official data are more       inclusive.        Figuring out how to best ask about things as personal as       sexual orientation and gender identity is at the forefront of       that research. The willingness and ability to answer       questions about sexual orientation and gender of other people       is just as critical, the Census Bureau told CNN Business.        The last BLS research paper on the topic is from 2017.       While it's feasible for the government to ask these       questions, the paper recommends more in-depth analysis.        ``The reality is that it's very chicken and egg,'' Renna       said. ``If you don't have the data, you can't understand the       community. If you don't ask the community questions, you       don't have the data.''        Some government surveys already collect information on       gender identity and sexual orientation, including the       National Health Interview Survey, the National Crime       Victimization Survey and the National Survey of Children's       Health.        Last year, the 2020 Census made history by including same-      sex marriage and same-sex unmarried partners as options on       its survey. The Bureau of Labor Statistics--which uses       surveys to compile the government's monthly jobs report--      began including same-sex married couples in its tally of       married workers in January last year.        Considering that only 20 percent LGBTQ+ people live in       same-sex married households, these surveys leave out the vast       majority of the community, said Kerith Conran, the Blachford-      Cooper research director and distinguished scholar at the       Williams Institute.        And there is a greater dearth of data especially when it       comes to LGBTQ+ youth, transgender people and gender       identity, she added.        Earlier this year, Conran and her colleagues highlighted       those and other inequities in a public comment urging the US       Census Bureau and BLS to add sexual orientation, gender       identity and sex assigned at birth questions to the Current       Population Survey.        ``There are ongoing health and economic inequities that       aren't going to go away unless people start paying attention       to them,'' she said in an interview with CNN Business.        Data on sexual orientation and gender identity aren't       collected consistently across states--for example, only 30       states included the SOGI module in a US Centers for Disease       Control-backed behavioral risk survey in 2019. This creates       big gaps in the data, particularly in regions such as the       South and Midwest, Conran added.        ``Those are the places where non-discrimination protections       and social acceptance are also lacking,'' she said. ``In the       places where people probably have worse conditions, [there       are] less data available to see what's going on for people.''    Madam Speaker, we rely on all kinds of data to inform our  policymaking.   Right now, LGBTQI+ Americans aren't represented in Federal  statistics, like for unemployment, poverty, health, and discrimination.   This gap severely impacts our ability to make smart decisions that  may affect their community, let alone decisions that will help those in  their community. It is imperative that we begin to let these  individuals count in our Federal data system just as we do race,  ethnicity, gender, and age.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, a group of 156 organizations committed to  advancing equality and opportunity for the LGBTQI+ community, including  the YWCA, wrote to Congress in support of H.R. 4176.   They said in their letter: ``Collecting this information in federally  supported surveys, such as the Current Population Survey and the  National Health Interview Survey, is essential to improving the well- being of LGBTQI+ populations across key areas of life. For example,  although data are limited, research indicates that LGBTQI+ communities  experience disparities across multiple domains of life compared to non- LGBTQI+ populations.''   This inclusive data ``is a crucial tool to better identify and  address these disparities and to promote more equitable outcomes and  opportunities for LGBTQI+ communities.''   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the letter signed by the 156  organizations.                                                     June 14, 2022.      Hon. Carolyn Maloney,      House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Maloney and Congressman Grijalva: As a       group of 156 organizations committed to advancing equality       and opportunity for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,       queer, intersex, and other sexual and gender diverse       (LGBTQI+) people in the United States, we are writing to       voice our enthusiastic support for the amendment in the       nature of a substitute and passage of the LGBTQI+ Data       Inclusion Act (H.R. 4176).        The LGBTQ Data Inclusion Act, as introduced, would       facilitate the collection of voluntary, self-disclosed       demographic data on sexual orientation and gender identity       across federal surveys. The amendment in the nature of a       substitute would add variations in sex characteristics (also       known as intersex traits) to the data voluntarily collected,       and would accordingly change the bill title to the LGBTQI+       Data Inclusion Act. Collecting this information in federally       supported surveys (such as the Current Population Survey and       National Health Interview Survey) is essential to improving       the well-being of LGBTQI+ populations across key areas of       life. For example, although data are limited, research       indicates that LGBTQI+ communities experience disparities       across multiple domains of life compared to non-LGBTQI+       populations. This includes evidence of higher rates of       poverty, unemployment, and economic instability experiences       of homelessness and housing insecurity; worse mental and       physical health outcomes; heightened barriers to access       adequate health care, and widespread experiences of       discrimination. Due to the intersecting forces of racism,       xenophobia, ableism, ageism, and transphobia, for LGBTQI+       communities of color, LGBTQI+ people with disabilities,       LGBTQI+ older adults, and transgender people, these       disparities are often even more pronounced. LGBTQI+-inclusive       data collection is a critical tool to better identify and       address these disparities and to promote more equitable       outcomes and opportunities for LGBTQI+ communities.        Currently, most surveys fielded by the federal government       not collect data on sexual orientation, gender identity, or       variations in sex characteristics. For example, although some       surveys, such as the decennial census and American Community       Survey, ask questions that allow for the identification of       cohabitating same-sex couples, it is estimated that only 1 in       6 LGBTQ individuals are captured by those kinds of questions.       Although progress has been made in recent years, the overall       lack of routine data collection on sexual orientation, gender       identity, and variations in sex characteristics poses a       significant obstacle for policymakers, researchers, service       providers, and advocates dedicated to improving the wellbeing       of LGBTQI+ communities, especially those living at the       intersection of multiple marginalized identities.        The federal government collects survey data on a wide range       of subjects and populations and is uniquely positioned to       engage in LGBTQI+-inclusive data collection to generate       accurate, consistent, and representative data at a scale that       allows for the disaggregation necessary to describe the       diversity of LGBTQI+ communities. As demonstrated in the       recent consensus report by the National Academies, questions       about sexual orientation, gender identity, and variations in       sex characteristics can and should be added to federally       supported surveys. By doing so, federal agencies can take       meaningful steps to fulfill the Biden-Harris administration's       priorities to promote equity for LGBTQI+ and other       underserved communities through various actions, including       but not limited to expanding data collection efforts.        Passage of this bill is essential to better understand the       experiences of LGBTQI+ communities, generate policy solutions       that are inclusive of LGBTQI+ people and their needs, and to       evaluate the effectiveness of those policies to reduce       disparities and advance equity. Again, we strongly support       the amendment in the nature of a substitute for the LGBTQI+       Data Inclusion Act (H.R. 4176) and urge Congress to quickly       take up and adopt this important proposal.        Thank you for your consideration. Please do not hesitate to       contact Caroline Medina and Madeline Shepherd with any       questions.

Madam Speaker, I ask the gentleman if he is prepared to  close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, the three bills in this rule have the potential to  transform the health and opportunities of millions of Americans.   The Restoring Hope for Mental Health and Well-Being Act reauthorizes  and establishes 35 critical programs that provide access to mental  health care and substance use disorder treatment across the country.   Recognizing the benefits of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic,  this bill promotes behavioral health integration into primary care  through increased access to telehealth as part of the pediatric mental  health care access grant program reauthorization.   The bill also requires self-funded, non-Federal governmental  healthcare plans to comply with mental health parity laws. Mental  health care is healthcare, and it is time we treat it as such.   The Advanced Research Projects Agency-Health Act will jump-start our  Nation's investment in medical research and innovation. I am privileged  to represent part of North Carolina's Research Triangle Park and see  the breakthroughs that happen there. By establishing and funding ARPA- H, we ensure that research like this will continue, that more people  will be able to access groundbreaking treatments and cures, and that  our Nation remains a leader in medical innovation.   The LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act will equip our government agencies  with the data they need to reduce barriers and challenges facing this  community. Good data helps us make good policy. Without data, we are  forced to legislate blindly and guess at solutions to close  disparities.   Madam Speaker, I note that the LGBTQI+ Data Inclusion Act does not  mandate that anyone disclose information about their gender identity or  sexual orientation. Under this bill, individuals choose whether to  share that information or not.   This bill, which we take up during Pride Month, will help us ensure  the LGBTQI+ community is represented in policies aimed at closing  disparities and helping underserved groups.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1191         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 10. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 471) to prohibit the Secretary of Health and Human       Services from lessening the stringency of, and to prohibit       the Secretary of Homeland Security from ceasing or lessening       implementation of, the COVID-19 border health provisions       through the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; and (2) one       motion to recommit.        Sec. 11. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 471.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
