 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the life of Franco Harris, a giant in the football community.   Franco Harris committed his life to excellence. He ran for 12,000  yards and won four Super Bowls with the Pittsburgh Steelers, giving  hope and inspiration to a community.   On Sunday, the Steelers were preparing to recognize Franco's  contribution, 50 years after the play that is remembered as one of the  greatest of all time, the ``Immaculate Reception.''   To remember him only for his legacy on the field would be a  disservice. Franco Harris was committed to servicing and supporting  food banks, blood drives, and youth sports leagues that run throughout  central and western Pennsylvania.   Franco Harris loved the city of Pittsburgh, and he loved his alma  mater of Penn State. He attended events throughout Pennsylvania, and he  never gave the impression of being a Super Bowl MVP. He never gave the  impression of being a first-ballot Hall of Famer.   Franco Harris gave the impression of simply being a man from his  community, a proud Penn Stater, and a proud member of the Pittsburgh  Steelers Nation.   Today, we remember the life of Franco Harris, and we wish that we had  that opportunity to honor him in person on this Sunday.   The success that Franco Harris brought to the Pittsburgh Steelers  carried a fan base far and wide. The success allowed the entire United  States to become in one gleaming moment a Steelers Nation.                          Honoring the Apollo 8 Crew     Madam Speaker, 54 years ago the Apollo 8  crew lifted from Cape Kennedy, Florida, embarking on the first manned  mission to circle the Moon.   On Christmas Eve of that year, they would be the first to be pulled  into lunar orbit. On that same day, they became the first three humans  to cross to the far side of the Moon where no radio contact could be  made with the Earth.   These three men--Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders--would  spend Christmas Eve unconnected from everyone that they loved.   While no other will be as far away from home this Christmas as the  Apollo 8 astronauts, there will still be millions of Americans who will  be unable to spend Christmas with their loved ones.   These will be the truck drivers on icy roads, the doctors and nurses  working long shifts in snowed-in hospitals, police officers patrolling  our streets, and men and women in uniform standing at far-away outposts  serving to keep our Nation free and safe.   We owe a debt of gratitude to those who are unable to be with their  loved ones and their friends this Christmas.   As you gather around your table and celebrate the birth of our Lord  and Savior, Jesus Christ, please join me in saying a prayer for those  who are unable to be at home this Christmas day.   For those unable to see their children opening Christmas presents,  for those unable to be with their grandchildren watching a train circle  a Christmas tree, we are grateful for the work that they do.   From all of us here at the United States Capitol, I extend a  heartfelt thanks for those individuals for their work and for their  commitment to our Nation.             Thanking Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District     Madam Speaker, as Congressional District  lines shift in January, I am saddened by the fact that I will no longer  have the honor of representing the Shanksville and Stoystown  communities in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, the place where 40 heroes  lost their lives while attempting to stop the September 11 terrorist  attacks aboard United Flight 93.   In the weeks that followed, I took my family to that crash site to  pay our respects and to say a prayer for those who had given their  lives to save other lives.   The Shanksville and Stoystown communities have the burden and the  [[Page H9914]]  honor of keeping that legacy for those 40 heroes alive.   National Park Service Director Steve Clark has done an incredible job  to make the memorial a place of remembrance, and I look forward to  continuing to work with him as he oversees the September 11th National  Memorial Trail.   The Flight 93 National Memorial is a fitting tribute to the  passengers and crew who died on that September morning with the  knowledge that their deaths would ultimately save others' lives.   National Park Service Director Steve Clark and his entire team at the  Flight 93 National Memorial have done an incredible job to maintain and  preserve this site.   On behalf of the individuals from Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional  District, I say thank you for that service. I say thank you for  preserving the memories of all those fallen heroes from the Flight 93  National Memorial.                            ____________________
