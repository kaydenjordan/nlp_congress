 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the importance of  life.   Thomas Jefferson famously wrote that every man has the right to  ``life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.'' I hold this quote near  and dear because we must defend these rights. That is certainly true  with the right to life for a baby.   Last week, I met with Rachelle Heidelbaugh with Faith2Action.  Rachelle told me her story about when she chose life and how she has  continued fighting for life through Faith2Action. Her story was truly  moving and pulled at the heartstrings. I couldn't help but give her a  hug because her story is so meaningful and her efforts are truly saving  lives.   While Rachelle visited, we talked about the Heartbeat bill. The  Heartbeat bill would ensure that every unborn child with a heartbeat is  protected. We need to do whatever we can to protect life, and this bill  will allow us to keep on protecting unborn boys and girls.   Rachelle gave me the Heartbeat Bill Hero Award like many in this  House have gotten. The award is this small token that I am proud to  carry because it represents thousands of lives that are being saved.   I will always stand up for a baby's right to life, and I hope my  colleagues will join me in supporting H.R. 490, the Heartbeat bill  legislation.                            ____________________
