 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on  the Judiciary be discharged from any further consideration of H.R. 962,  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the Speaker to immediately schedule this  important legislation that will protect equality of life for the  unborn.
