 Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1.   While we are talking about voter suppression and long lines, I would  like to point out that there is real voter suppression that happens  right here in Congress. Many Members of Congress have to stand in long  lines to enter the Chamber going through metal detectors, emptying our  pockets, and being treated very disrespectfully. That is real voter  suppression, and it is a shame that it happens right here on the House  floor.   Standing in line to vote is not suppression. It is just part of the  voting process, just like people stand in line to buy groceries in the  grocery store.
