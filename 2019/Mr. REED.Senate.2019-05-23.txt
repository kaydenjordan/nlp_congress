 Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining Senator Blunt in  introducing the Ensuring Children's Access to Specialty Care Act.   According to the American Association of Child and Adolescent  Psychiatry, there are currently only 8,300 child and adolescent  psychiatrists (CAPs) in the United States--many of whom are not  practicing full time--far short of the estimated need of over 30,000  CAPs. On average, patients wait almost two months to see a CAP, a  startling concern given that the incidence rates of mental illness and  behavioral disorders among children in the United States continue to  grow. Fifty percent of all lifetime cases of mental illness begin at  age 14; seventy-five percent by age 24.   The National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program (NHSCLRP)  was created by Congress over forty years ago to help recruit and place  trained individuals in underserved communities to provide needed health  care services. Licensed health care providers may earn up to $50,000  toward  [[Page S3113]]  student loans in exchange for a two-year commitment at an NHSC-approved  site, within two years of completing their residency. Accepted  participants may serve as primary care medical, dental, or mental/ behavioral health clinicians.   NHSCLRP provides critical relief to physicians who have completed  pediatrics or psychiatry residency training programs; however,  pediatric subspecialists, such as child and adolescent psychiatrists,  are effectively barred from participating due to the extra training  these physicians are required to take after completing their residency.  This extra training, which often results in increased student debt,  typically consists of a fellowship that takes place in the two-year  window of eligibility for NHSCLRP. The creation of NHSCLRP preceded the  expansion of many pediatric subspecialties, not taking into account the  extra years of training required for these physicians.   The Ensuring Children's Access to Specialty Care Act would correct  this loophole and allow pediatric subspecialists practicing in  underserved areas to benefit from the NHSCLRP. By so doing, this bill  would increase access to specialty care for children and improve mental  health parity for children.   Providers across the spectrum of care support this bipartisan  legislation including: the American Association of Child and Adolescent  Psychiatry, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Arthritis  Foundation, Children's Hospital Association, March of Dimes, and the  National Alliance on Mental Illness. I look forward to working with  these and other stakeholders as well as Senator Blunt and our  colleagues to pass the Ensuring Children's Access to Specialty Care Act  in order to help ensure children have greater access to the health care  they need.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KENNEDY:   S. 1693. A bill to reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program;  considered and passed.                                  S. 1693         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Flood Insurance       Program Extension Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. REAUTHORIZATION OF NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM.         (a) Financing.--Section 1309(a) of the National Flood       Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4016(a)) is amended by       striking ``May 31, 2019'' and inserting ``June 14, 2019''.        (b) Program Expiration.--Section 1319 of the National Flood       Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4026) is amended by striking       ``May 31, 2019'' and inserting ``June 14, 2019''.        (c) Retroactive Effective Date.--If this Act is enacted       after May 31, 2019, the amendments made by subsections (a)       and (b) shall take effect as if enacted on May 31, 2019.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining Senator Blunt in  introducing the Ensuring Children's Access to Specialty Care Act.
