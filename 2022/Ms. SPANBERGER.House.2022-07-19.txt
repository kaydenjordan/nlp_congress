 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment  to protect seniors and crack down on drug companies obscuring the side  effects of their prescription drugs in their television ads.   The United States is one of only two countries that allow direct-to- consumer pharmaceutical advertising, and there are serious consumer  safety concerns about these ads. These ads use distracting imagery,  such as butterflies, happy puppies, cheesy music, and  [[Page H6847]]  beautiful sunrises to distract consumers from a drug's dangerous side  effects.   Congress instructed the FDA to crack down on these deceptive  techniques more than a decade ago. However, the FDA has misused that  statutory deadline by more than a decade.   My amendment simply instructs the agency to finalize the rulemaking  as soon as possible. Medical decisions should always be made between a  patient and their doctor, not between a patient and their TV screen.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my commonsense consumer  protection amendment.
