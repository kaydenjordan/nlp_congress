 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  Department of Defense's vaccine mandate.   My district is home to the Sierra Army Depot in Lassen County, which  uses a large contingent of civilian military contractors. Sierra Army  Depot repairs equipment, salvages old tanks and armored carriers for  platforms that are still serviceable.   Over the past year, the depot has served as the Army's global storage  and distribution center for COVID-19 testing kits and personal  protective equipment. As a Nation, we leaned on the Sierra Army Depot,  and other similar ones around the country, to protect our  servicemembers while they were busy protecting us. They put it on the  line during the worst of the pandemic and didn't question it.   Now, the Biden administration is planning to fire hundreds of these  contractors because they have not made the personal choice to be  vaccinated with emergency-use vaccines, two of which are still under  emergency-use authorization.   After a year, putting the weight of the Army on this workforce,  asking them to work overtime and get the job done, and take the risks  we did not know about a year and a half ago, the President is going to  fire them? Is that really the kind of message we want to send to our  military?                            ____________________
