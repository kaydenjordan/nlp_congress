 Madam Speaker, over the past few weeks, I  have released the transcripts of the interviews from Peter Strzok,  Bruce Ohr, and Lisa Page from the Judiciary Committee's investigation  into apparent wrongdoing at the FBI and DOJ. I have said I would make  additional transcripts from the investigation public, and I am here  today to keep that promise.   As I stated then, our interview transcripts were pertinent to  congressional investigation. But the 115th Congress ended, the  investigation was closed, and copies were shared with certain Members  of Congress.   Madam Speaker, I request that the link www.dougcollins.house.gov/ papadopoulos be placed in the Record so the American people can review  the transcript of George Papadopoulos. The American people deserve to  know the origins of the probe against President Trump's campaign.   I will continue to release as many transcripts as possible. The  American people deserve transparency.                            ____________________
