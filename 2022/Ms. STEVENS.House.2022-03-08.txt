 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in awe of the courageous  Ukrainian people defending their sovereign land, and in fierce  condemnation of the sickening violence the Kremlin is inflicting upon  them.   Our children are watching an attack on democracy and a grave  violation of international law and global peace unfold, and we must  continue to show them it will not be tolerated.   For over 3 years, the Kremlin has tried to intimidate America with  the wrongful detention of my constituent, Paul Whelan. While we remain  profoundly concerned about our citizens wrongfully detained in Russia,  including Trevor Reed and now, Brittney Griner, we will never give up  on our mission to bring them home and make President Putin pay.   Financially, economically, militarily, and strategically, the United  States is battling for the Ukrainian people.   It is time to ban Russian oil. We prepared for this moment in close  coordination with our allies, and the Kremlin will be held accountable.   Our country is united in praying for the safety and well-being of the  Ukrainian people on the front lines, for nearly 2 million seeking  refuge in neighboring countries, and for those who dwell within our own  borders doing everything they can to support their family and friends  back home.   I ask my colleagues to join me in demanding Russia end its invasion  of Ukraine, withdraw its military forces at once, and release political  prisoners.                            ____________________
