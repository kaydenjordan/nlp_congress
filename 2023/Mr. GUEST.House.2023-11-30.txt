 Mr. Speaker, George Santos has built his persona, his  personal and his political life, on a foundation of lies. Many of those  lies are well-documented. We know that Mr. Santos lied about his  education, both graduate and postgraduate, claiming that he attended  universities where he was never enrolled and claiming that he obtained  degrees that he did not earn.   We know that Mr. Santos lied about his employment when he claimed  that he worked for two prestigious financial institutions, Citigroup  and Goldman Sachs.   We know that Mr. Santos lied about his religious faith when he said  he was Jewish and then later, when called out, said he meant to say he  was Jew-ish.   We know Mr. Santos lied when he said that he had four employees who  were killed in a mass shooting in Florida.   Nonetheless, Mr. Speaker, those lies, while troubling, did not  justify his removal from this body. However, these and other misleading  statements reflect directly on Mr. Santos' credibility.   In May, Mr. Speaker, George Santos said that he looked forward to  seeing the ethics process play out and that if the committee finds  reason to remove him, then that is the process.   Today, Mr. Speaker, George Santos would have you believe that the  process that he endorsed in May is fatally flawed and that he, instead,  is the subject of a political witch hunt.   Mr. Santos has described the report issued by the Ethics Committee as  slanderous. He said that if there was a single ounce of ethics in the  Ethics Committee then they would not have released the biased report.  He referred to the report as a political hit piece.   Mr. Speaker, I want to remind you that in March of this year, George  Santos promised to fully cooperate with the ethics investigation. Just  weeks ago, Mr. Santos said: I have been very cooperative since the  investigation started, and I have no plans to change that.   Nonetheless, Mr. Speaker, the record of the investigation reveals  otherwise. The report of the Ethics Committee noted these things, Mr.  Speaker: first, that Mr. Santos failed to submit a written response to  the allegations filed by his fellow Members; that Mr. Santos failed to  provide many of the documents requested by the investigative  subcommittee; that when given an opportunity to provide a statement  under oath that Mr. Santos declined to do so; and that when asked to  voluntarily testify, Mr. Santos refused.   The committee learned through his counsel that if the investigative  subcommittee were to subpoena Mr. Santos that he would plead the Fifth  Amendment and not give any testimony for fear that it may incriminate  him.   So while Mr. Santos has failed to speak with the committee, Mr.  Speaker, he has spoken freely to the media. Just this past weekend, he  was participating in a 3-hour X Livestream Podcast with Monica  Matthews.   In that 3-hour interview, he said:         I have made it very clear, I am not running for reelection,       not because this was a damning report. I am not running for       reelection because I don't want to work with a bunch of  [[Page H6017]]       hypocrites. It is gross. I have colleagues who are more       worried about getting drunk every night with the next       lobbyist that they are going to screw and pretend none of us       know what is going on, and sell off the American people, not       show up to vote because they are too hungover or whatever the       reason is or not show up to vote at all and just give their       card out like candy for someone else to vote for them.    He went on to say regarding the Ethics report:         It is flawed. It was designed to smear me. It was designed       to force me from my seat. That was the intention of the       report. This wasn't a finding of fact.    So, Mr. Speaker, I want to talk a few minutes about the report of the  investigative subcommittee and the report of the Ethics Committee and  the work that they did over an 8-month period. I will tell you that the  findings of the committee were shocking.   We know that the Ethics Committee authorized 37 subpoenas, they  issued 43 requests for information, they interviewed 40 witnesses, they  reviewed 172,000 pages of documents, and they issued a 56-page  investigation report.   In addition to this 56-page investigation report, Mr. Speaker, these  are the exhibits that they attached to the investigative report. The  50-plus page report goes into great detail, and it paints a picture of  the fraud committed by Mr. Santos. In many cases it also tracks the  allegations for which Mr. Santos has been indicted in the Eastern  District of New York.   Mr. Speaker, if you look at the language of the report, the language  of the report says, the investigative subcommittee revealed a complex  web of unlawful activity involving Representative Santos' campaign,  personal, and business finances.   It says that Representative Santos sought to fraudulently exploit  every aspect of his House candidacy for his own personal profit.   The report says that he blatantly stole from his campaign and that he  deceived donors into providing what they thought were contributions to  his campaign, but they were, in fact, payments for his personal  benefit.   The report goes on to say that he reported fictitious loans to his  political committees to induce donors and party committees to make  further contributions to his campaign.   Then later the report said that despite Santos' efforts to blame his  former treasurer for the numerous campaign violations, the ISC's record  demonstrates that Representative Santos knowingly and actively  participated in the misconduct.    Mr. Speaker, through records that were subpoenaed by the Ethics  Committee, we learned that Mr. Santos spent campaign-related funds on  personal rent, on personal credit card payments, and on ATM  withdrawals. We know that he made luxury designer purchases at at least  two high-end stores, that he spent money on payments made at OnlyFans,  and that Mr. Santos spent almost $3,000 on Botox treatments, in  addition to questionable expenses involving travel expenses for trips  to Atlantic City; Las Vegas, Nevada; and The Hamptons.   Mr. Speaker, in addition to this, there was additional fraud that was  uncovered and contained in this report issued by the Ethics Committee.   The Ethics Committee found in 2020 that bank records indicate that  Mr. Santos was repaid over $29,000 for fictitious loans that he never  made to his campaign.   The report goes on to say that in 2021 he falsely reported loaning  his campaign $580,000, and he falsely reported loaning an additional  $25,000 to his leadership PAC.   The report goes on to document that the committee found, according to  bank records, that Mr. Santos transferred $200,000 from RedStone  Strategies and they were found to be an unregistered super PAC  controlled by Mr. Santos, and that he transferred in 2022 alone over  $200,000 into his personal account.   Mr. Speaker, I know that some Members of this body have expressed  concern about due process. They believe that Mr. Santos was not given  due process, therefore that this should not go forward.   Mr. Speaker, I want to address the argument of due process. Mr.  Speaker, you are well aware that due process was referred to in the  Fifth and 14th Amendments. In the Fifth Amendment it says no person  shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of  law.   We know the 14th Amendment then applies the Fifth Amendment to the  States where it says no State shall deprive any person of life,  liberty, or property without due process of law.   Then as you are also well aware, Mr. Speaker, the Sixth Amendment  talks about criminal proceedings and the rights that attach to a  criminal proceeding.   Mr. Speaker, we are not here today on a criminal proceeding. The  rights of the Sixth Amendment do not apply, but due process under the  Fifth and 14th Amendments do apply here at these proceedings, and so it  is important to talk about due process.   The due process that is contained in the Fifth and 14th Amendments,  if you study due process, Mr. Speaker, you will know that there are two  subsections; two components, if you will; two legs upon which due  process must stand.   That first subsection, that first leg, is substantive due process.   What is substantive due process?   Substantive due process asks this question: Is there a right to bring  the action in question?   Mr. Speaker, I say that there is. We know that that right exists  because that right is found in the United States Constitution. The  expulsion clause, which is found in Article I, Section 5, Clause 2 of  the United States Constitution says this, Mr. Speaker: Each House may  determine the rules of its proceedings, punish its Members for  disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of a two-thirds vote,  expel a Member.   So, Mr. Speaker, I tell you that as it relates to substantive due  process, clearly substantive due process applies in this case.  Nonetheless, that second leg of the stool of due process, is procedural  due process.   Procedural due process is a process that governs the fairness of the  proceedings.   There are three primary requirements, three primary tenets of  procedural due process.   Those requirements are, first, was adequate notice given?   Mr. Speaker, I hold in this case that adequate notice was given.  Adequate notice was given by the fact that the investigative  subcommittee notified Mr. Santos in February that the investigation was  going to be ongoing. It actually had contact with him and his office  well before that in January shortly after he was sworn in.   I would argue that Mr. Santos had notice of this hearing because the  motion was filed 2 weeks ago, the resolution was filed to expel him  from this body. So, clearly, Mr. Santos has been given proper notice.   The second requirement of due process says: Did Mr. Santos have an  opportunity to be heard?   Mr. Speaker, I will tell you that he has had an opportunity to be  heard. He had an opportunity repeatedly to be heard by the Ethics  Committee. He had the opportunity to submit a written statement, but he  refused to do so. He had an opportunity to submit a statement under  oath. He refused to do so. He had an opportunity to come in and  testify, and he declined to do so.   Even when faced with a subpoena, he was planning to come in before  the Ethics Committee and exercise his Fifth Amendment right not to  testify.   So, Mr. Speaker, I hold that he has had ample opportunity to be heard  by the investigative subcommittee, and he has been, once again,  presented the opportunity here today, before this body and before the  American people, he has the opportunity today to rebut the findings of  the Ethics Committee. He has the opportunity to point out any errors or  omissions that he claims are in the report.   So, clearly, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Santos has had the opportunity to be  heard.   Then finally, the third and final point is the opportunity to have a  fair tribunal. We are following the Constitution which says that the  body of other elected Members, this body as a whole, must be the body  that conducts a vote in this case.   So, Mr. Speaker, I want to remind you of a statement I earlier  referenced, that statement made by Mr. Santos in May, that statement  where he said that he looked forward to seeing the ethics process play  out and that if the Ethics Committee finds a reason to remove him, then  that is the process.  [[Page H6018]]                                     time  1515    Mr. Speaker, the Ethics Committee found substantial evidence--this is  language taken directly from the report: Substantial evidence that  Representative Santos knowingly caused his campaign to file false or  incomplete reports with the Federal Election Commission.   The Investigative Subcommittee found substantial evidence that he  used campaign funds for personal purposes. It found substantial  evidence that he engaged in fraudulent conduct in connections with  RedStone Strategies, LLC. It found substantial evidence that Mr. Santos  did knowingly and willfully engage in violations of the Ethics and  Government Act.   Mr. Speaker, I ask in accordance with Article I, Section 5, Clause 2  of the United States Constitution, that all Members vote to support the  expulsion of Representative Santos.
