 Madam Speaker, first, to my colleague and  friend,   Andy Barr, what a beautiful tribute to Carol. And I join my  colleagues, everyone here today, in strong support of the CAROL Act. We  love you. We love Carol. Our hearts go out to you.    I am sitting here, and I am thinking what a beautiful tribute. And to  Eleanor and Mary Clay, I just saw their Christmas card, and I was  thinking they are beautiful, and they are loved, and they shine  brightly just like their mom did. I know that this has been such a  difficult time, and to see Andy step forward, bring this legislation-- the CAROL Act that is going to help thousands of others across the  country--to highlight important research that needs to be done so that  others will not have to go through something similar because Andy has  led in such a strong way. We are grateful to know Andy, and we want him  to know that he is not alone.   I will always remember the times that I was with Carol. She was one  of those people who seemed to do it all and do it all so well. And my  memory of her is one of just lighting up the room. She shined so  brightly. And Andy continues to shine. And their girls are shining  today.   We join today in strong support of this legislation. It is going to  help us get answers so that others will not be impacted the same way.  And let's get this done, as Carol said.                                time  1630
