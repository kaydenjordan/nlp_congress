 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Columbus Police  Department for its support of National Guard and military Reserve  employees.   The Columbus Police Department recently received the Above and Beyond  Award for its dedication to its officers who are also members of the  National Guard and military Reserves. This award goes to organizations  that go above and beyond when it comes to employees who also serve in  our Nation's Armed Forces.   The Columbus Police Department currently has 11 officers who also  serve in the National Guard or military Reserve roles. In fact, 33  percent of its employees are either currently serving or are veterans  of our Armed Forces.   I thank the Columbus Police Department for caring for our veterans  and for those currently serving our country.                 Recognizing IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize IU Health Ball Memorial  Hospital in celebrating 90 years of service to the Muncie community.    The hospital has grown with the city to offer the highest quality of  care. Throughout the years, Ball Memorial Hospital has been with the  city of Muncie through many ups and downs, including the Great  Depression and the polio epidemic of the 1940s.   Ball Memorial Hospital merged with IU Health in 2010, a move that  only expanded the hospital's reach throughout east central Indiana.   Congratulations to IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital on 90 years of  success. I thank them for serving the city of Muncie and the State of  Indiana.                    Recognizing ASAP of Bartholomew County     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Alliance for  Substance Abuse Progress in Bartholomew County, a group that has been  on the front lines of combating the opioid crisis.   The alliance, known as ASAP, partners with law enforcement, courts,  counselors, health systems, and community leaders to address the opioid  crisis through prevention, intervention, treatment, and recovery.   I want to recognize its new executive director, Doug Leonard, who  officially started this Monday. Doug is a former local and State  healthcare leader, serving as the president of the Indiana Hospital  Association from 2007 until 2017.   While we have much work to do, ASAP of Bartholomew County can be a  model for other counties looking to combat this terrible scourge.                                time  1015    I rise today to reiterate my commitment to passing the USMCA, which  will lead to stronger economic growth and rising wages for all Hoosiers  and all Americans. The USMCA will generate tens of billions of dollars,  and it will create over 175,000 new American jobs.   The USMCA will also rebalance trade to support American  manufacturing, strengthen U.S. trade in agriculture, and support  American small business. It increases market access for Hoosier and  American dairy providers.   It is imperative that Congress act on behalf of American farmers,  ranchers, businesses, and all workers.                            ____________________
