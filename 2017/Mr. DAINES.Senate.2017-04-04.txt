 Mr. President, today I am joining my colleagues on the  floor with a bit of confusion, a bit of disappointment, and, frankly, a  lot of questions. I am referring to the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch as  the next Supreme Court Justice.   As a Senator, one of the most consequential votes I will cast is a  vote to confirm a U.S. Supreme Court nominee. It is a lifetime  appointment to our Nation's highest Court.   I recently spoke with some students back in Montana, some FFA  students. The average age 17, 18 years old. God willing, Neil Gorsuch  may serve on the Court for 30 or more years. These FFA students'  children and perhaps even grandchildren will be part of Neil Gorsuch's  time on the Court, given that he likely will serve for three decades or  more.   As it stands today, the Senate is on the precipice of confirming Neil  Gorsuch to be our next U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice. However,  as the news has been reporting, as our Twitter feeds are overflowing  with information, it looks as though my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle are caving to the pressures of the far left, and they are set  to unleash an unprecedented filibuster.   I have met with Judge Gorsuch. I watched his confirmation hearings.  What I have seen and what most Americans agree--Judge Neil Gorsuch has  been incredibly transparent, he has been accessible, and he is the  right man for the position. He is mainstream. He is a westerner. He is  committed to judicial independence. He has a brilliant legal mind--that  is without dispute. He is exceptionally qualified. In fact, the  American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Gorsuch as ``well  qualified.'' That is its highest rating.   He has met with nearly 80 Senators. Prior to his hearing, he provided  the Judiciary Committee over 70 pages of written answers about his  personal record. He provided 75,000-plus pages of documents, including  speeches, case briefs, opinions, and written works going as far back as  his college days. The White House archives produced over 180,000 pages  of email and paper records related to Judge Gorsuch's time at the  Department of Justice.   Judge Gorsuch sat for three rounds of questioning, totaling nearly 20  hours, in committee. As the American people watched Judge Gorsuch  before that committee, they saw an exceptionally qualified nominee for  the highest Court in the land, someone who was bright, who was kind. I  would argue that Judge Gorsuch's mind, his intellectual capacity, is  only exceeded by his heart. This is a kind and independent jurist.   When he came before the Judiciary Committee, this was the longest  hearing of any 21st-century nominee. He answered nearly 1,200 questions  during his hearing, which is nearly twice as many questions posed to  Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, or Ginsburg. He was given 299 questions for  the record by Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee--the most in  recent history of any Supreme Court nominee. Judge Gorsuch did all of  this with the utmost integrity and with transparency and humility. Yet  here we are, with Democrats engaged in unprecedented obstruction,  refusing to give Neil Gorsuch an up-or-down vote.   The Senate has only ever employed a cloture motion for a Supreme  Court nominee four times in modern history. We voted on cloture when  Justice Alito was nominated in 2006. We did the same in 1968, 1971, and  1986. In 1991, Clarence Thomas was confirmed on a 52-to-48 vote, and in  2006, Samuel Alito was confirmed on a 58-to-42 vote. In fact, when  President Obama was in the White House, Republicans did not filibuster  a nominee. This body confirmed Sonya Sotomayor in 2009 by a vote of 68- to-31 and confirmed Justice Kagan by a rollcall vote of 63-to-37 in  2010. We did not filibuster.    Let me remind folks that cloture is in place to stop debate, not to  stop a vote. Cloture was put in place to speed the Senate up, end  debate, and move to a vote, not to stop a vote. It was never intended  to be a stall tactic or something to obstruct this body.   This bears repeating. Cloture was put in place to speed up the  process, to prevent obstruction.   This Chamber has never had a partisan filibuster to a Supreme Court  nominee. Let me say that again. This Chamber has never had a partisan  filibuster to a Supreme Court nominee.  [[Page S2189]]    So here we are today, with no other option but to invoke this so- called nuclear option to put an eminently qualified individual on the  U.S. Supreme Court. Judge Gorsuch is the definition of a mainstream  judge. In more than 2,700 cases in which he has participated in the  Tenth Circuit, 97 percent of them have been decided unanimously; in  fact, he was in the majority 99 percent of the time. Yet Senate  Democrats would rather play politics and place the demands of extreme  liberal interests over ensuring regular order.   Let's talk about what we are and what we are not doing. We are in the  Senate, a Chamber I am honored to serve in, representing more than 1  million Montanans. We operate on a set of Parliamentary criteria based  on things that have happened before. Therefore, we are going to  establish a new precedent; we aren't changing the rules. This isn't  happening for the first time. Let us remember that in November of 2013,  Senate majority leader Harry Reid established a new precedent of how  many votes are necessary on executive branch nominees, with the  exclusion of Supreme Court picks.   What is even more shocking to me is that over the past few weeks,  through the hearing process, through the debate and discussions about  Judge Gorsuch on the floor, and with support from across my State of  Montana--let me just name some of those organizations and people in  support of Judge Gorsuch: the Montana Chamber of Commerce; four of  Montana's Tribes--the CSKT, the Crow Tribe, Fort Belknap and Fort Peck;  the Montana Farm Bureau, Judge Russell Fagg of the 13th judicial  district, Judge Jeffrey Langton of the 21st judicial district, Judge  John Larson of the 4th judicial district, State senator Nels Swandal,  retired judge of the 6th Judicial District; the Montana NRA members;  the Montana Grain Growers Association and the Montana Wool Growers  Association; the Montana Stockgrowers Association; our attorney general  in Montana, our auditor in Montana, our speaker of the Montana House.  This is a very mainstream group of Montanans, leaders back home who are  in support of Judge Gorsuch. Yet my colleagues are rejecting the will  of the American people, rejecting the will of Montanans, filibustering  this nomination, and not even allowing for an up-or-down vote.   The American people deserve a Supreme Court Justice who upholds the  rule of law and will follow the Constitution. The American people  deserve a Supreme Court Justice who doesn't legislate from the bench.  The American people deserve Judge Neil Gorsuch to serve on the U.S.  Supreme Court.   Thank you, Mr. President.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I have the honor and  privilege of recognizing the faculty, administrators, staff, and  students of Flathead Valley Community College for their service to the  people of northwest Montana--2017 marks the school's 50-year  anniversary. FVCC serves thousands of students of every age and  background. In its five decades of existence, the college and its  faculty have won numerous awards for providing a high-quality and low- cost education in Kalispell, MT.   The college provides more than 50 career and technical programs,  while also giving students a cheaper and more convenient option for  their first 2 years of college. FVCC also has developed programs that  can help high school students get a ``Running Start'' on their college  careers. FVCC has given generations of students the tools they need to  succeed. The college also serves a vital role in supplying the region's  employers with a skilled workforce.   The idea for a community college in northwest Montana began in 1960  when Kalispell School Board chairman Owen Sowerwine noted a study that  80 percent of local high school graduates were receiving no higher  education whatsoever. Sowerwine worked with other local educational  leaders such as Bill McClaren, Thelma Hetland, Les Stirling, and Norm  Beyer to create a new community college. The college opened its doors  in 1967, and today we celebrate their legacy.   FVCC continues to grow and find new and better ways to serve the  community. Its Kalispell campus has grown to eight buildings, with new  on-campus housing opening this year. FVCC also has an extension campus  in Libby, MT.   I look forward to seeing what the next 50 years will hold, and I  congratulate all involved in the success of FVCC on reaching this  milestone.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as a fifth-generation Montanan who grew up  just a short drive from our Nation's first national park, Yellowstone  National Park, and as chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources  Subcommittee on National Parks, the resolution before us is critically  important to reassure the public that the U.S. Senate recognizes the  remarkable value our national parks bring to our national heritage.   I especially want to thank my good friend from Hawaii, Senator  Hirono, who serves as ranking member of our subcommittee, for her  partnership on bringing this resolution to the floor here this evening.  She has been invaluable in working together to bring us to this moment.   In fact, 33 of our colleagues joined us in submitting this  resolution--nearly half Republican and half Democrat--including Alaska,  Washington, Tennessee, New Mexico, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Missouri,  Minnesota, Florida, Michigan, Colorado, Virginia, Louisiana, Ohio,  California, Wyoming, Rhode Island, Maine, Arkansas, Wisconsin, and New  Hampshire. There are small States and large States, States that boast  vast landscapes and big game like Alaska and Montana, diverse  ecosystems like the oceans of Hawaii or the Florida Everglades. Other  States boast historic and cultural treasures, like our hallowed  battlefields in Virginia.   At a time when our country and Congress seem to be torn, it is only  fitting that tonight our national parks are going to bring us together  for a moment, to bridge this political divide, to bring remarkable  opportunities for cultural education, outdoor recreation for  [[Page S2353]]  our families and for people around the world to enjoy, and, frankly, to  bring us together as family and friends.   As the National Park System begins its second century this year, we  have seen record visitation, with 331 million visits in 2016, but  record visitation also brings additional strain to our national parks  and strain to our infrastructure.   I am hopeful that with the adoption of this resolution, we can all be  reminded of the importance of continued investment in our national  parks to ensure their legacy truly endures for our children,  grandchildren, and for generations to come.   Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 117, submitted  earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, as a fifth-generation Montanan who grew up  just a short drive from our Nation's first national park, Yellowstone  National Park, and as chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources  Subcommittee on National Parks, I am excited to introduce this  resolution to reassure the public that Congress recognizes the  remarkable value that our National Parks bring to our national  heritage. From America's hallowed battlefields in Gettysburg and  Fredericksburg, to the glacial peaks, geysers, and big game in my home  State of Montana, to the ancient cultural resources, volcanoes, and  marine life of Hawaii and all across the plains, many of the units of  the National Park System bring remarkable opportunities for cultural  education and outdoor recreation for people from around the world to  enjoy. I am excited to be joined by ranking member Mazie Hirono and  over 30 of our bipartisan colleagues from Alaska to Maine and Florida  in introducing this resolution. The support of this resolution is a  reflection that our National Parks bridge political divides and make  our Nation uniquely American. As the National Park System begins its  second century this year, we have seen record visitation with 331  million visits in 2016, but record visitation also brings additional  strain on the National Park Service's failing infrastructure. I am  hopeful  [[Page S2371]]  that Congress, the Trump administration and future administrations will  continue to invest in our National parks to ensure their legacy endures  for our children and generations to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, one of the most consequential votes that I  will ever cast is a vote to confirm a U.S. Supreme Court nominee. It is  a lifetime appointment to our Nation's highest Court. In fact,  tomorrow, when I cast that vote for Judge Gorsuch, it will be the first  chance I have had as a Senator to confirm a Supreme Court nominee.   As it stands today, the U.S. Senate is on the precipice of confirming  Neil Gorsuch to be our next U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice. Just  a few short hours ago, my colleagues on the other side caved to the  pressures of the far left and unleashed an unprecedented, partisan  filibuster for the first time in 238 years of this institution.   I was honored to be at the White House's East Wing on January 31,  with President Trump, when he made the announcement that Judge Neil  Gorsuch would be the nominee to replace Antonin Scalia.   Judge Gorsuch's academic accomplishments are nothing short of being  absolutely stellar. His decision to serve as a Justice on the highest  Court in the land is a true testament to his character, his  intelligence, his understanding of the law, and his commitment to the  Constitution.   Judge Gorsuch was appointed by President George W. Bush to the Tenth  Circuit in 2006 and was unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate. In  fact, some of those Democrats who did not oppose Judge Gorsuch then  included his Harvard Law classmate Barack Obama, Vice President Joe  Biden, and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.   Of utmost importance in a Justice is the desire and the ability to  apply the law as it is intended, not to legislate from the bench. So I  can say that I was very thrilled to here Judge Gorsuch say this: ``A  judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge,  stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.''   On February 9, I met Judge Gorsuch in my office. Let me tell my  colleagues, he is impressive. We discussed the Constitution. We  discussed the Second Amendment. I represent the State of Montana. I can  tell my colleagues that as we look at our Constitution and our Bill of  Rights, the Second Amendment is very important to the people of  Montana. He will defend the Second Amendment. We also talked about the  separation of powers, the role of government and federalism, and the  Fourth Amendment.   Through 4 full days of hearings, Judge Gorsuch eloquently answered  Judiciary Committee members' questions, and certainly, before the  entire viewing audience of the American people, he showcased his  brilliant legal mind.   Prior to his hearing, he met with 80 Senators. He provided the  Judiciary Committee with 70 pages of written answers regarding his  personal record and over 75,000 pages of documents, including speeches,  case briefs, opinions, and written works going as far back as his  college days. The White House archives produced over 180 pages of email  and paper records related to Judge Gorsuch's time at the Department of  Justice.   During the committee hearing, Judge Gorsuch sat for three rounds of  questioning totaling nearly 20 hours. In fact, when Judge Gorsuch  appeared before the Judiciary Committee of the U.S. Senate, it was the  longest hearing of any nominee in this century. He answered nearly  1,200 questions during that hearing. By the way, that is nearly twice  as many questions as Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, or Ginsburg.   Today's vote was nothing more than a campaign fundraising effort for  Senate Democrats. In fact, the Democratic Members who have pledged to  support him already have threats from liberals of voting them out of  office. It is a sad day that this body has become so partisan that, for  the first time in this body's history, we had a partisan filibuster to  a more than qualified nominee.   Judge John Kane, a judge appointed by Democrat Jimmy Carter, said in  an op-ed for an online legal website:         As the saying goes, we could do worse. I'm not sure we       could expect better, or that better presently exists.    There is just no arguing that Judge Gorsuch a mainstream nominee.   Take the remarks of Obama's Solicitor General, Neal Katyal:         Judge Gorsuch is one of the most thoughtful and brilliant       judges to have served our nation over the last century. As a       judge, he has always put aside his personal views to serve       the rule of law. To boot, as those of us who have worked with       him can attest, he is a wonderfully decent and humane person.       I strongly support his nomination to the Supreme Court.    I remind my colleagues that those are the words of President Obama's  Solicitor General.   A nominee of this caliber who has undergone, as I just mentioned,  rigorous vetting deserves the respect of the Members of this Chamber.  Yet Senate Democrats walked down the road that their former leader did  in 2013 by changing the precedent of this body and allowing the U.S.  Senate to become even more partisan.   The American people want Judge Gorsuch. The polls show that. In fact,  [[Page S2398]]  they demanded nine Justices on the Court. Today, we are one step closer  to confirming him.   Judge Gorsuch is the right replacement to honor the legacy of Justice  Antonin Scalia. He has widespread support across the State of Montana,  including our agriculture groups, the NRA, and leaders from across our  State. Four Indian Tribes in Montana have endorsed Judge Gorsuch.   The American people deserve a Supreme Court Justice who will uphold  the rule of law and follow the Constitution. The American people  deserve a Supreme Court Justice who doesn't legislate from the bench.  The American people deserve Judge Gorsuch to serve them on the U.S.  Supreme Court.   As the American people watched Judge Gorsuch before the Judiciary  Committee, they saw an exceptionally qualified nominee for the highest  Court in the land. They saw someone who is bright--Columbia  undergraduate, Harvard Law School, Oxford Ph.D. I would submit that  Judge Gorsuch's intellectual capacities are only exceeded by the size  of his heart. This is a kind man. This is a brilliant man. This is an  independent jurist.   I very much look forward to casting my vote tomorrow to confirm Judge  Gorsuch.    Mr. President, the Department of Homeland Security, DHS,  is tasked with keeping Americans safe in the homeland. To carry out  this mission, DHS spends over $7 billion on acquisition programs  annually. DHS and its agencies are held to a high standard for keeping  our Nation safe. We also must hold it to a high standard of fiscal  responsibility. DHS must be good stewards of taxpayer resources.   DHS's acquisition process has long faced problems resulting in waste,  delays, and under delivery of performance objectives. Since the  inception of DHS, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, has  highlighted challenges and offered recommendations to improve the  acquisition process. There has been progress; however, there continues  to be room for improvement. According to a GAO report released today,  DHS's acquisition process remains a high-risk issue, susceptible to  cost overruns and schedules delays. These issues reduce buying power  and force security employees to wait for new capabilities. This is not  fair to those on the front lines tasked with keeping us safe and it is  not fair to the American taxpayers.   I spent 28 years in the private sector. I know when tough business  decisions need to be made, you convene a board that brings with it a  breadth of experience and a deep understanding of strategic objectives  and goals.   That is why I am introducing the OHS Acquisition Review Board Act of  2017. This legislation will create a review board within the Department  to strengthen accountability and uniformity across all agencies and the  entire acquisition process, ensure long term strategic objectives are  met, and ensure the use of industry-proven best practices.   I thank Senator McCaskill for being an original cosponsor of this  bill and Representatives Thomas Garrett and Michael McCaul for leading  introduction of companion legislation in the House of Representatives.  I ask my Senate colleagues to join us in support of this important  legislation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 886         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Acquisition Review Board.''.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DAINES (for himself and Mrs. McCaskill):   S. 887. A bill to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require  a multiyear acquisition strategy for the Department of Homeland  Security, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security  and Governmental Affairs.    Mr. President, the Department of Homeland Security, DHS,  is tasked with keeping Americans safe in the homeland. To carry out  this mission, DHS spends over $7 billion on acquisition programs  annually. DHS and its agencies are held to a high standard for keeping  our Nation safe. We also must hold it to a high standard of fiscal  responsibility. DHS must be good stewards of taxpayer resources.   DHS's acquisition process has long faced problems resulting in waste,  delays, and under delivery of performance objectives. Since the  inception of DHS, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, has  highlighted challenges and offered recommendations to improve the  acquisition process. There has been progress; however, there continues  to be room for improvement. According to a GAO report release today,  DHS's acquisition process remains a high-risk issue, susceptible to  cost overruns and schedules delays. These issues reduce buying power  and force security employees to wait for new capabilities. This is not  fair to those on the frontlines tasked with keeping us safe, and it is  not fair to the American taxpayers.   That is why I am introducing the DHS Multiyear Acquisition Strategy  Act of 2017. This legislation will require DHS to develop a multiyear  acquisition plan to guide the overall direction of the Department's  acquisitions, across all agencies, and include it annually in the  Department's budget request to Congress. It will create a  Departmentwide prioritized list of investment, to ensure limited  resources are being directed to the highest valued use.   This legislation will increase communication internal to DHS, as well  as with industry and with academia, to help identify current capability  gaps and future technological needs. It also includes private sector  principles, such as developing incentives for program managers to  exceed project cost, schedule, and capabilities goals. I have seen  these principles work during my 28-year private sector career, and it  is long past due that we apply them to government. We must move away  from the ``spend it or lose it'' mentality of government budgeting.   I thank Senator Claire McCaskill for being an original cosponsor of  this bill and Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick and Michael McCaul for  leading introduction of companion legislation in the House of  Representatives. I ask my Senate colleagues to join us in support of  this important legislation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 887         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Acquisition Review Board.''.                                  ______    Mr. President, the Department of Homeland Security, DHS,  is tasked with keeping Americans safe in the homeland. To carry out  this mission, DHS spends over $7 billion on acquisition programs  annually. DHS and its agencies are held to a high standard for keeping  our Nation safe. We also must hold it to a high standard of fiscal  responsibility. DHS must be good stewards of taxpayer resources.   DHS's acquisition process has long faced problems resulting in waste,  delays, and under delivery of performance objectives. Since the  inception of DHS, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, has  highlighted challenges and offered recommendations to improve the  acquisition process. There has been progress; however, there continues  to be room for improvement. According to a GAO report release today,  DHS's acquisition process remains a high-risk issue, susceptible to  cost overruns and schedules delays. These issues reduce buying power  and force security employees to wait for new capabilities. This is not  fair to those on the frontlines tasked with keeping us safe, and it is  not fair to the American taxpayers.   That is why I am introducing the DHS Multiyear Acquisition Strategy  Act of 2017. This legislation will require DHS to develop a multiyear  acquisition plan to guide the overall direction of the Department's  acquisitions, across all agencies, and include it annually in the  Department's budget request to Congress. It will create a  Departmentwide prioritized list of investment, to ensure limited  resources are being directed to the highest valued use.   This legislation will increase communication internal to DHS, as well  as with industry and with academia, to help identify current capability  gaps and future technological needs. It also includes private sector  principles, such as developing incentives for program managers to  exceed project cost, schedule, and capabilities goals. I have seen  these principles work during my 28-year private sector career, and it  is long past due that we apply them to government. We must move away  from the ``spend it or lose it'' mentality of government budgeting.   I thank Senator Claire McCaskill for being an original cosponsor of  this bill and Representatives Brian Fitzpatrick and Michael McCaul for  leading introduction of companion legislation in the House of  Representatives. I ask my Senate colleagues to join us in support of  this important legislation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 887         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
