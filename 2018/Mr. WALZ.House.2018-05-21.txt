 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 1972, but I would once  again like to note we are here again with the most productive committee  in the United States Congress, the most bipartisan committee, the most  open, and it is fitting, going into Memorial Day, that the question of  the shared commitment to this Nation's veterans is never in question.  So I am grateful.   I would also like to extend thanks to the gentleman from Minnesota  (Mr. Emmer), for his work on this piece of legislation, bringing it to  light and continuing to carry this until we got it to the floor.   This committee has heard from veterans across the country that have  experienced harassment from debt collectors or experienced adverse  credit reporting through no fault of their own.   The bill simply requires VA to waive any of those copayments due by a  veteran when VA makes an error that causes significant delay in  notification of the copayment. It is a very simple solution to a  problem that can significantly impact nearly every aspect of a  veterans' life. This can add unnecessary stress for veterans when they  are trying to pay their medical expenses and make ends meet. Veterans  shouldn't be hung out to dry when the VA is at fault. This legislation  would mitigate the harm a delayed copayment notification could create  for a veteran.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for this bill being brought up today by  the gentleman, and I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H4248]]         Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, I too, would like to thank the  gentleman from Pennsylvania, Representative Smucker, and Representative  Emmer for their tireless work for care of veterans not just in  Minnesota, but across the country. I also thank the gentleman from  Florida.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please join me in passing H.R.  1972, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of high-quality, accessible treatment  options for survivors of military sexual trauma. I want to thank the  gentleman. His concern is exactly in the right place. It is focusing  our attention on this issue.   There are some things in the bill, though, that I would like to point  out, and these concerns have been shared by some of the veterans  service organizations. I do this in the spirit of the gentleman is  exactly right on what needs to be done.   This is about a process of trying to improve upon a piece of  language. The VA was unable to submit views on this bill because of  timing on how it was brought up. For this reason, I would like to read  just a few quotes from a statement the VA submitted on this bill to  reflect the concerns shared by our staff and the VSO community.   These are VA quotes:   ``Aspects of the bill could jeopardize patient safety and well-being  and create the ethically problematic situation of VA condoning and  supporting a substandard level of care for program participants.''   ``It is possible some veterans would even choose to leave VA care  entirely to avoid the study.''  [[Page H4250]]    While I certainly appreciate the effort, I am of the belief that this  study could misallocate VA's limited resources to define a problem to  which the RAND Corporation and the National Academy of Sciences have  already offered potential solutions.                                time  1515    I am supporting today's amendment in the nature of a substitute but  warning against future efforts to erode the high quality of care that  VA is providing.   In order to better reflect VA's position on improving access to  military sexual trauma, I am excited to work with our VSO partners on  legislation that would implement some of the recommendations made in  previous assessments and increase access to high-quality care.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues across the aisle to join us in  drafting legislation that continues to heal military sexual trauma  victims.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman's commitment to this  issue. I appreciate the work that has been spent to continue to evolve  to get this right, because I do think there is, obviously, no  disagreement in the scourge and the horrific crimes committed against  servicemembers that we must deal with and the treatment of those  victims afterwards. With that, I encourage my colleagues to support  this piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the gentleman's Veterans  Opioid Abuse Prevention Act. It was about 10 years ago to the day that  we stood on this floor when I had a piece of legislation, one of the  first ones I authored as a Member of Congress, the stepped-care pain  management for the prescription of opioids in the VA, and I remember  delivering a speech right here that if we don't do something about what  is happening with the overprescription, we are going to be in a  situation of crisis, I think, were the terms that I used.   At that time, we started talking about multiple approaches to pain  management. At the time we brought it up, the VA did not even want to  consider things like acupuncture and yoga, and now we are at a  situation where the gentleman is exactly right. Even with that, moving  forward, according to the Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law,  between 2010 and 2015, the number of veterans addicted to opioids rose  55 percent to a total of roughly 68,000. This represents about 13  percent of all veterans currently prescribed opioids.   Various published studies have found that there is a significant  increased risk of suicide among our veterans and the general U.S.  population when opioid use disorders are apparent.   H.R. 3832, as amended, will require VA to enter into a memorandum of  understanding with a State-based prescription drug monitoring program  in order to further reduce opioid misuse and dependency.   By requiring VA to partner with the prescription drug program, the VA  can better ensure veterans are receiving the most appropriate treatment  available while significantly reducing the likelihood of abuse.   We have an ethical responsibility to do everything we can in this  country to reduce the opioid epidemic, certainly amongst our veterans.  It is a step in the right direction to prevent the overprescription of  opioids to veterans so that we can start preventing those veterans  becoming addicted in the first place. I stand in strong support of  this.   Mr. Speaker, as stated, this is a good piece of legislation, smart  move forward, and I encourage my colleagues to vote for it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to add my voice to those supporting H.R. 3946,  which does name the VA community-based outpatient clinic in Statesboro,  Georgia, the Ray Hendrix Veterans Clinic.   I would like to say at this time, I often hear from people, and they  talk about things going on here. And they say: Oh, yeah, they are  naming another post office, or VA clinic.   That is right, we are. Today, we are naming a VA clinic after someone  who gave their life serving this Nation, coming back doing the things  that build our community, and I think, when people think is this just  an exercise we go through, I would encourage, Mr. Speaker, for  everyone, when they go by one of these buildings and they see a name on  the side of it and wonder what it is after--we can now google those  things pretty easy.   I will guarantee you, every time you google that name, you will come  away amazed at what your fellow citizens did, what they gave to this  country, and in this case, you heard it from the gentleman, about Ray  Hendrix's service, 42 years in uniform, back in that, and I will  guarantee you that Statesboro, Georgia, is a better place because of  what Sergeant Major Ray Hendrix did.   So I don't think these are things to fill time. I think these are  things that we honor what is right about the country. We honor people  that put country first, and it is very obvious to me, having never met  Ray Hendrix, or until this bill was brought forward, I sure wished I  had known him, and I would have loved to have been in a unit where  Sergeant Major Hendrix served because it is obvious that he cared. With  that, I strongly support this piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for taking the time  to tell us about Sergeant Major Hendrix.   This is exactly the point I'm making: If you want to exemplify what  this Nation is about, we are a Nation of people, we are a Nation of  patriots; and when they rise above it, like Ray Hendrix did, I think it  is appropriate. Of all of the things that we do on this floor, I make a  case that these namings are a pretty important piece of what  [[Page H4253]]  we do. So I thank the gentleman for this, and encourage my colleagues  to enthusiastically support this piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 4245, the Veterans' Electronic Health  Record Modernization Oversight Act of 2017.   When I first came to Congress back in 2007, as a veteran myself, one  of the questions we asked was--Electronic medical records had been out  there for quite some time. The VA was a pioneer in their VistA System,  on VistA, on  [[Page H4254]]  managing health, and it is not just a database. As Dr. Dunn knows well,  these are important diagnostic tools and they have to be right.   But the thing that every veteran for 20 years was saying was: Why do  we have one medical record in the Department of Defense, so when we  leave the Army, the Navy, the Marines, or the Air Force, we drop off a  cliff--we all carry around a paper file they print out to us--and then  we try to get back into the VA and it is an entirely different system  that doesn't talk to one another?   It seems pretty self-evident that from the time you raise your hand  until the time you are buried with honors, it would make sense that we  had a joint electronic medical record. That was the genesis of this.   I am proud to say that it was a long road, but we had the signing of  the Cerner contract.   What this piece of legislation does is--and I want to be very careful  about--we do this many times here, we pass a piece of legislation, pat  ourselves on the back, and send it away, only to watch it die a  horrible death in the executive branch, not be implemented correctly,  or not provide our oversight.   This simply says--and Dr. Dunn was exactly right--this is a $16  billion 10-year project. I want to be clear, though: that is our  current projection.   Everyone in here knows that if we get a 10 percent delay and a 10  percent cost overrun, we will probably be relatively happy with that.  That is over a year, and it will be a nearly $2 billion addition. That  money will have to come from somewhere. It will slow down  implementation. We saw reports early last week that there were serious  concerns in the pilot program that are out there.   So what this does--and I, once again, thank the chairman and the  majority staff for recognizing this is our responsibility. We will not  shirk that here--it asks them to report to us. It let's us stay on top  of this before it becomes a crisis. Because every single one of us here  knows that it is coming some day--that we are going to hear about  misinformation, something dropping through, a cost overrun--and this  just gives us that added security.   This is a project that cannot fail. I have witnessed in my time in  Congress too many IT failures, specifically at the VA: a contract is  signed, it is going to happen, and it is a good thing. It has the  potential to, as again the gentleman said, revolutionize how we deliver  care. But it has the potential to go in the wrong direction if we are  not doing our constitutional right of oversight.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this piece of  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I think this is, once again, the legislative branch, as  it was meant to be, taking back its oversight responsibility. We are  going to authorize this and we are going to appropriate the funds. I  think it is only prudent that we have another layer of oversight to  make sure that this huge, huge project, nearly unprecedented, upgrade  in integration of electronic health records of anywhere in the world,  happens correctly.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ``yes'' vote on this, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for, once again,  bringing up a really important piece of legislation. I believe the  gentleman is also the longest serving member of the Veterans' Affairs  Committee. Any piece of important legislation over the last decade-plus  has had his hand in it.   H.R. 4830, as amended, is a bill that we have worked on in a  bipartisan basis with TAPS, the Tragedy Assistance Program for  Survivors. TAPS came to the committee and to Mr. Bilirakis, after they  heard from many surviving spouses that with all of the changes that  were being implemented on August 1, there will be delayed payments and  processing times for payments for veterans and survivors enrolled for  the fall 2018 semester.                                time  1545    The Forever GI Bill that we are all in this body proud of passing and  proud of updating contains several large-scale changes the VA is  currently working very hard to implement. Some of those changes went  into effect in the fall of 2017, and TAPS reported to the committee  that, because of delays in VA payments, many schools demanded payment  from students.   There were stories of students who were not allowed to attend class,  register for classes, or use campus facilities only because the VA  payment was delayed. In some cases, students were even put on a payment  plan they could not afford or forced to take out student loans with  egregious orientation fees in order to continue their education.   This bill will provide students receiving VA payments with the same  protections as those who receive title IV funding, such as Pell Grants  and Federal student loans. These title IV students are allowed to  attend classes, participate in extracurricular activities, and use  campus facilities as long as their school knows payment is forthcoming.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4830, as amended, will give the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs the ability to disapprove any course of education  unless the educational institution providing the course permits  individuals to attend or participate in courses pending payment by the  VA and accept a certificate of eligibility as a promise. As such, the  bill will serve as a preventive measure to discourage schools from  engaging in shutting out VA beneficiaries simply because of an  administrative delay. This is a really good step toward ensuring that  our student veterans and other GI Bill beneficiaries are not  unnecessarily prevented from getting the most of their benefits due.   To be very clear about this, there are very few benefits that are  really earned in the way a GI Bill benefit is earned. Those of us who  have used the GI Bill to get an education know how important it is.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for continuing to show care for  these veterans. This is a great, smart piece of legislation. I  encourage its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida for his  great work on this. I encourage its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5215, the Veterans Affairs  Purchase Card Mitigation Act.   I have often said I am the VA's staunchest supporter, but I will be  their harshest critic. On this one, I will be their harshest critic.   Time and again when we hear reports of VA employees misusing purchase  cards, that cannot stand. Every dollar that is misused, whether it is  through fraud, waste, or abuse, is one less dollar that is not being  used towards veterans, and it is the taxpayers' dollars that need to be  guarded. This misuse erodes Congress' ability to oversee the VA budget  and the use of the money.   Employees who misuse purchase cards should be held accountable and  should be prevented from being a purchase card holder or authorizing  official, because they can't be trusted to follow the regulations or be  good stewards of taxpayer dollars.   This legislation will ensure that taxpayer dollars are protected from  purchase card misuse. If you are doing it right, you can still use the  card and it can serve veterans. If you choose to ignore the rules, you  are not going to be able to do it anymore.   It is pretty simple. It is a smart piece of legislation. I urge its  passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the gentleman whether he has  any further speakers.  [[Page H4257]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and  I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to note, on this, there are other issues at  hand here. There are certainly some of these cases where people are  just blatantly misusing them. That is a small percentage. The vast  majority is of leadership not implementing policies. Especially we were  talking about the medical-surgical supply formulary, and people are  taking the shortcut to getting things instead of getting--we had this  conversation on contracts and the way it should be done.   The part about this is it isn't somebody going out and buying  themselves a new phone or something; it is them going out and buying  things that are actually going to be used, but it is a stupid way to do  it because we end up paying more money. We don't have certain  contracts. It is just is not the way to budget.   So I think this has a lot of really good things that it can do. One  of them that it should continue to do is force VA leadership to have a  better plan in place. We see it right here in the D.C. VA, not having  this supply management piece down right.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage support of this piece of legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5418, as amended. The Veterans  Affairs Medical-Surgical Purchasing Stabilization Act ties into what we  were just discussing.   For many years, we have heard complaints that the VA formulary did  not meet the needs of VA healthcare providers, thus making the delivery  of healthcare to our Nation's heroes even more challenging.   As VA worked toward a solution, the Government Accountability Office  recommended that clinicians who treat veterans should be at the center  of the decision making.   Involving clinicians at every step of building a medical supply  formulary is the same best practice employed by other private sector  and nonprofit hospitals.   We have got wonderful physicians on this committee. It makes sense  that they should be there. I have heard it time and time again over the  years that we get better results when we do that.   That is why this committee was concerned when VA proposed that it  would outsource the development of its medical-surgical supply  formulary to vendors who had no experience treating patients. This  proposal goes against best practices in the private and nonprofit  healthcare industry.   This legislation would prevent VA from outsourcing formulary  development. It would also ensure VA follows best practices and sticks  to a timeline so that VA facilities and vendors have a predictable,  functional medical supply.   Now VA must demonstrate it is willing to put the right leadership and  resources in place to appropriately manage the project and ensure the  actual end users of the formulary, the clinicians treating veterans,  have the supplies as needed.   Mr. Speaker, again, another good piece of legislation, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this is a good piece of legislation, I support  its passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4958, the Veterans  Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act.   As the chairman said, it is our responsibility to make sure the  guarantee of these benefits is not eroded by inflation. It provides for  a simple cost-of-living adjustment at the same rate as set for Social  Security benefits. It may seem like a small amount in any one year, but  without the adjustment for inflation, the impact on veterans' finances  is significant when compounded over time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the subcommittee chairman,  Mike Bost,  for his work, and Elizabeth Esty, both for cosponsoring the bill and  bringing it to us today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe and his staff for their work  clearing this bill. It is an important one. Our veterans have been  waiting for word on this. I think I am happy to report it looks like we  have taken that step moving it forward. It will make a lot of folks  happy.   I hear about this one a lot, so you know it is on their minds. It  just makes sense, and doing it before Memorial Day sends a really  strong message.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 4958, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this is a good piece of legislation. I thank  the gentleman for bringing it up. The taxpayers understand that this is  exactly what we are supposed to be doing. I encourage a ``yes'' vote,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of H.R. 5044. The gentleman  has brought a really important point forward.   Currently, if a veteran's death results in their small business  becoming less than 51 percent owned by a service-disabled veteran, the  surviving spouse can acquire the veteran's ownership interest if the  veteran had a 100-percent disability rating. This allows the surviving  spouse to keep their loved one's small business status.   However, the surviving spouse of a deceased veteran who had less than  a 100-percent disability is not allowed to do the same.   This is a clear-cut case, I think, of spirit and intent of the law. I  don't think anyone intended for a 60-percent service-disabled veteran  who maybe lost a limb in combat, and then who dies, for their spouse to  lose their eligibility. It is a really important point to bring up.   This bill will now permit a surviving spouse to maintain a Service  Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business status  [[Page H4260]]  for a period of 3 years after the veteran's death, or until the spouse  remarries.   This simply allows a Gold Star spouse a bit more time after a loved  one's death to settle any business affairs of the deceased spouse it  had.   It is the right thing to do to ease the burden that comes with the  loss of a spouse in expression of our gratitude for their family's  service.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Ohio's willingness to  point this out, I strongly support this, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, this is a good piece of legislation. I am  grateful for the gentleman bringing it up. I encourage its passage, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in strong support of S. 1282, which names  three veterans clinics in Montana.   Again, I will reiterate what I said earlier, that sometimes I hear  people disparagingly talk about how we are not doing anything in  Congress except naming VA clinics and post offices. That is right. We  are naming three VA clinics for three American heroes again. You just  heard Chairman Roe give the stories of David Thatcher, Ben Steele, and  Dakaak Baako and what they did for this Nation.   These are movie scripts in any other world, except this is real life,  real American heroes who did exactly what was asked of them and then,  in each one of these cases, returned back home to build this Nation.   I oftentimes, and I will continue to say it, when you drive by a VA  clinic and there is a name on it, google it, because you will be amazed  at what your fellow citizens can do.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ``yes'' vote on this piece of legislation,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I, too, rise in support of designating the VA medical center in  Huntington, West Virginia, the Hershel ``Woody'' Williams VA Medical  Center.   You are going to hear more detail from the gentleman from West  Virginia, but it is once again proving the point that these are not  exercises in futility. This is how America honors and remembers. Our  children need to know who these people were when their name shows up on  the VA medical center.   On this one, I think the gentleman from West Virginia knows this, but  we were discussing this over here, all of us in Minnesota got to know  who he was last February when the world was watching. Some of us  remember the moment when people said: ``Who is that marine who walked  out and tossed the coin at the Super Bowl?'' It was this gentleman.   I remember the sense of pride and the sense of awe, and we kind of  got things into perspective because they told a little background on  his story: that we were going to watch a game, and this gentleman was  out there fighting for the freedoms to allow that game to happen.   It was a wonderful moment. I am certainly proud and grateful to  encourage people to cast a ``yes'' vote on this piece of legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   In closing, once again, Mr. Speaker, I would just remind everyone  here that these are not just naming bills. This is our history; it is  important. The four stories told today are an amazing testament to what  bill we can do as a people, and these individuals deserve this honor.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4451, and thank the gentleman  and everyone involved in this piece of legislation. Veteran  homelessness, combating it and reducing it to zero, has been a focus of  this committee for many years.   Direct services provided by HVRP include placement, skills training,  job development, career counseling, and resume writing. It is the only  nationwide program focused on assisting homeless veterans in  reintegrating into the workforce. This is incredibly important because  reintegrating homeless veterans into the workforce is the best way to  ensure that they do not reenter homelessness again.   This would reauthorize the program for 5 years. Reducing veteran  homelessness remains our priority. I believe this piece of legislation  will get us there.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Brownley), my good friend. She is a true champion of  veterans and is the conscience on this issue in our committee of  alleviating veterans' homelessness.    Mr. Speaker, again, I want to thank the gentleman from Ohio  and the gentlewoman from California for addressing this. It is a smart  move to do this, continuing to keep our focus. While our numbers are  improving in areas, we know this is a zero-sum proposition. Any veteran  on the street is one too many. So I appreciate any effort that is made.  This is a good piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of Congressman Correa's and Chairman Roe's bill,  H.R. 4334, the Improving Oversight of Women Veterans' Care Act.   The gentleman from California has proven over the course of his time  in Congress that he is a dedicated advocate for our fastest growing  population of veterans: female veterans. His experience working on  behalf of veterans in the State of California in the legislature has  translated into an informed compassion that has earned the respect of  the committee.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4334 does require VA to exercise proper oversight  of community care providers it contracts with in order to provide sex- specific healthcare to women when its facilities do not have the  equipment or the specialists necessary to care for them.   The latest study by the RAND Corporation confirms that VA delivers  superior healthcare to veterans, when compared to the private sector.  Previous independent studies confirm this.   For this reason, VA should better monitor the quality of care  received by women in the community, and this bill would require that  careful monitoring so that women veterans receive high-quality care.   VA should always remain at the center of managing veterans'  healthcare. And managing the care veterans receive in the community by  only contracting with high-quality providers with the competence to  provide treatment to veterans is a major part of ensuring that they  receive the highest quality care.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa), the chief author of this bill and a good  friend to veterans across the country.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Brownley), a champion of veterans--a champion in many  areas--and on this issue of treating our female veterans with the  dignity, respect, and services that they have earned.     Mr. Speaker, I would certainly encourage my colleagues to  vote ``yes'' on this important piece of legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
