 Madam President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Russell James of Missoula County for his impact on the  Whitewater community.   A third generation Montanan, Russell was born and raised in Ovando,  MT. Mr. James graduated high school from Thompson Falls, where he went  to the University of Montana. Directly after graduation in 1980,  Russell dove into the workforce, taking a job as a professional truck  driver.   Russell has been a professional truck driver for 38 years and has  accumulated over 1 million accident-free miles. He has won numerous  awards during his tenure as a driver, including the 2008 YRC employee  of the Year Award and the 2018 YRC Road to Excellence Award. He has  represented YRC every year at the Montana Truck Driving Championships  since 2005, as well as the National Truck Driving Championships in 2011  and 2014. Russell is active in the community, volunteering with the  Blackfoot River Preservation Group and environmental quality  improvement and wildlife habitat. He is also an avid outdoorsman and  enjoys tending to his small family farm.   I congratulate Russell on his lifetime of outstanding achievements  and willingness to give back to his community. A tried and true  Montanan, I look forward to seeing his success in his future  endeavors.                            ____________________
