 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for yielding me the time.   I heard a few minutes ago that there had been no hearings. Well, I  have heard from the people of the Seventh District of Illinois. They  have told me what to do. They have said: Impeach this President.  Impeach this President, and do it now.   I will follow their instructions and vote ``yes'' to impeach this  President.
