 Madam Speaker, for the past 16 months, the  United States' border with Canada has been closed to nonessential  travel, tearing loved ones apart, preventing people from accessing  cottages that they own, devastating businesses and local economies on  both sides of the border.   This week, the Canadian Government announced plans to reopen the  border to fully vaccinated Americans on August 9. On January 21 of this  year, we were promised a plan would be developed by the United States  to address travel to Canada within 14 days.   Madam Speaker, 180 days have now passed. We are still waiting for  that plan. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  publicly advised that fully vaccinated Americans are free to safely  resume all pre-pandemic activity. It is time for the United States to  align its border policy with the science, with the facts, and with the  data. Action is long overdue. Open the U.S. border to our Canadian  neighbors.                            ____________________
