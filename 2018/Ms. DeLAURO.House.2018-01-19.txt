 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this rule  and the underlying bill. With this bill, the Majority has declared war  on the health and wellbeing of millions of women, rolling back women's  health care. The bill's inflammatory language is an insult to women and  the doctors who provide them with care.   This legislation is redundant, and would criminalize the work that  doctors do legally today. This would unnecessarily intimidate  healthcare providers like Planned Parenthood, who serve 2.4 million  Americans every year with lifesaving services like pap tests, breast  exams, and screenings for sexually transmitted infections. For many  low-income families, Planned Parenthood is their only option.   Family planning is a critical component of women's economic security.  Being able to determine when and how to have children has a direct  effect on a working woman's ability to chart their course in terms of  schooling, careers, and family. These decisions should be left to  women, their loved ones, and doctors.   This bill is spiteful, mean-spirited, and dangerous. It limits  women's healthcare choices and interferes with the patient doctor  relationship--in fact, the American Congress of Obstetricians and  Gynecologists call this legislation, and I quote ``a gross interference  in the practice of medicine.''   The Congress should not stop women from accessing care, and we  certainly should not be hindering a woman's ability to make her own  healthcare decisions. We ought to be protecting the rights of every  woman to make her own family planning decisions, and to have access to  a full range of healthcare services. I urge my colleagues to reject  this partisan, cruel bill.
