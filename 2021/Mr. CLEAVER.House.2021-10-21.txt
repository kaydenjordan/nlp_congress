 Mr. Speaker, I thank Madam Chair for yielding. Let me  begin my comments by thanking the gentlewoman, as I have done in front  of you and away from you, because I think you have placed housing on  the front burner in this country right now, and it could not have come  sooner.   Let me just say that--because I was disoriented because of the  earlier speakers and then got a really bad headache, but I am going to  still be able to share these comments--I probably did not grow up like  many of the people in a contemporary United States. I grew up in Texas  just outside of downtown Dallas, and I had no idea that we were poor.                                time  1845    Never mind the fact that we had an outhouse about 30 or 40 yards down  a hill by a little creek. Never mind the fact that we didn't have  windows in our house. Actually, we did have windows, but my father or  somebody had put tin over the windows to keep the winter cold out. The  good blessing there was, in Texas, the weather is quite mild in the  winter.   But I lived in a shack, and there were six people in it. There were  two rooms. My three sisters slept on one side of the room, and I slept  on the other side of the room. The kitchen was not really a kitchen. We  had what was called an icebox, and the iceman would bring a big block  of ice every 2 or 3 days for 50 cents.   So I guess somebody could say, well, his parents weren't working and  that is what happens in this country when people don't work. It may be  interesting, at least for some, to know that my father attended Prairie  View, did not graduate from Prairie View, came back home and started  his own business, Cleaver's Cleaners. And in a town where there was  rigid segregation, he could only do the people in the neighborhood, and  that didn't provide enough income.   But he kept us in this house as comfortably as possible. In fact, one  night, I asked my mother if I could share something that is called hoe  cakes, big biscuits. She would make syrup, and I loved it. It was like  heaven. I asked her if I could share those with the people who lived on  the big street. We lived in an ally, and there were big mansions that  are still there today, and I wanted to take some over and give it to  the rich kids, because my mother said they didn't have any hoe cakes.   But we lived in a house. And my father, who turned 100 on July 16,  paid $20 a month on a shack, probably was worth maybe $250. So I grew  up in that house.   We then moved to public housing. My father worked--and, in fact, I  don't know how he made it, and I don't know how he lived to be 100,  because my father worked three jobs. He worked at the First Baptist  Church, a huge church, still is a huge church that is known all over  the country. And then, on Saturday mornings, he cleaned up the T. A.  Litteken's Construction Company office building. Then on Saturdays, he  would serve parties. He did that for years and years and years and  years.  [[Page H5786]]    I hope he is watching this tonight, because I want to say thank you  to him, because I don't know how he did all of that. Because my mother  did not go to school, college, he felt like it was his responsibility  to send her to college.   So we moved to public housing. And as I have said publicly, my father  lied to the officials at the public housing, the Rosewood projects. He  would not tell them that he had another job, because to do so meant  that he would have to increase his rent.   So he saved every dime he could get, every dime, and bought a house  in the White neighborhood and had it moved on a Saturday night to the  east side of town where African Americans lived.   This was his dream. My father had the house fixed up. We moved into  the house. I had my own bedroom. I thought we were rich. I mean, we  actually had an indoor bathroom. I remember, I spent one night just  flushing the toilet, just playing with it. It was like heaven. Then my  mother started college when I was in the seventh grade. My father  insisted.   My father was willing to do whatever he had to do to build his  family. But the key to all of it was housing. That separated us from a  lot of others. Housing, it is the most significant thing a human being  can have. It makes them a part of the American Dream.   My daddy is somebody--and this rose so high--that his lawn was put on  display in the local newspaper. The lawn of the summer, that is what he  wanted to do.   Madam Chair, I appreciate everything you have done and said to bring  us to this point.   I want to say to anybody watching, if you live in the United States,  the most powerful, the richest Nation on this planet, you have no  business sleeping outside with 700,000 people who do it every single  night in this country. You have no business being unable to afford a  house in the United States, because the average price now is almost  $400,000.
