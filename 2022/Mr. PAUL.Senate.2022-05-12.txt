 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today out of a desire to protect  the rights and the health of the young men and women who serve the  Senate as pages.   I think we could all agree that the Senate wouldn't function well  without pages. The very first Senate page was a 9-year-old boy named  Grafton Hanson. He was appointed by Daniel Webster in 1829. In those  days, the pages' jobs were to refill the inkwells and clean out  spittoons. Fortunately, things have improved a bit for the pages. The  work isn't quite as messy anymore, but it is still a high-pressure job  for a high school student.   When I was here on the floor voting last week, I noticed that the  pages were all wearing masks, but none of my colleagues were. I  threatened to come to the floor to seek unanimous consent to end the  mask mandate, and the next day, the mandate ended. Coincidence?  Perhaps.   The new policy states, though, that the mask-wearing will become  optional for pages who test negative. But once again, we see the masks  on the floor.   I urge my colleagues to look around. The pages are still wearing  masks. The COVID policy for the Senate pages requires the reinstitution  of a mask mandate if they have supposedly been exposed.   Apparently, there are rules for the pages of the Senate, but not for  the President of the Senate, Kamala Harris. When Vice President Harris  was deemed potentially exposed to COVID, she not only presided over the  Senate's confirmation vote of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, but was  also seen at the White House with the President, the First Lady, and  the Justice without a mask. Rules for thee but not for me.   Jen Psaki justified the Vice President's violation of the COVID  guidelines by stating that it was an emotional day. I guess if you are  feeling like it is an emotional day then you can do what you please,  unless you are a page. The impressive thing about that absurd defense  was that Psaki was able to say it with a straight--and maskless--face.   But an unseasoned mask mandate is not all that is required of the  pages. According to the guidelines: ``All pages are required to be  fully vaccinated; if their initial vaccination series was completed at  least five months ago, pages are required to obtain [a] booster  [shot]'' to participate in the Page Program.   From day one, our country's response to this pandemic has made the  comfortable more comfortable, while the working class or kids or people  with no power have to keep on working but have to obey rules that the  adults don't have to themselves.   Now in the halls of Congress we have created a privileged class that  can choose whether to get vaccinated and an underclass that has to  abide by dictate. It makes absolutely no sense to mandate COVID  vaccinations for teenagers who are healthy. It makes even less sense to  mandate a booster. There is no scientific evidence that boosters are  valuable, and there is scientific evidence that boosters increase the  risk of a heart inflammation for young adolescent males.   A study published last month in the Journal of the American Medical  Association Cardiology examined over 23 million people ages 12 and up  across Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. It concluded that the risk  of myocarditis, an inflation of the heart, ``was more pronounced''  after a second mRNA vaccine dose, ``and the risk was highest among  males aged 16 to 24 years.''   This is exactly why several European countries, including Germany,  France, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, all restrict the use of  mRNA vaccines for COVID--particularly for adolescents, particularly for  adolescent males. The policy of our pages does not address this issue  at all and blindly commands boosters.   In fact, if you read the policy, you could imagine an endless stream  of boosters. Every 5 months that you haven't had another vaccine you  would be required to get a booster.    Last fall, the director and deputy director at the FDA's Office of  Vaccines Research and Review both resigned. Realize who these people  are. They are on the vaccine committee. They are pro-vaccine. Both of  them are actually pro-vaccine mandate. Yet, they resigned from the  Government, as reported, ``citing White House pressure to approve third  doses for all adults and writing damning op-ed's critical of the FDA's  subsequent decision to do so.''   It became a political decision. The committee voted against extending  boosters to kids, and then it was overruled by politicians at the White  House. These two researchers, long esteemed, who have been on this  committee for years, resigned in protest.   One of the op-eds that ran in the Washington Post was coauthored by  Dr. Paul Offitt, a professor of pediatrics and director of the Vaccine  Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.   Once again--not an opponent of vaccines; a proponent of vaccines, a  guy who has been on the vaccine committee for decades.   As a Member of the FDA's advisory committee, Dr. Offitt, though, did  not support widespread boosting when the committee met to consider  boosters for all adults in September and October. He and the two former  FDA officials wrote: ``A healthy young person with two mRNA doses is  extremely unlikely to be hospitalized with COVID, so the case for  risking any side effects,'' the case for forcing them to take a third  vaccine when their risk of COVID after two vaccines is nearly, if not  virtually, zero, he says--or they said that the case for risking any  side effects--such as myocarditis--diminishes substantially.  [[Page S2474]]    What happens is myocarditis is a rare event for vaccines, more common  with young adolescent males. But you have to compare the risk of  getting myocarditis with the vaccine to the risk of the disease. Young  people who have been vaccinated twice--even without vaccines, young  people, the death rate under 15 is 1 in 2.32 million. With the vaccine  it is probably zero. We have studies of millions of people. We can't  find kids that are dying or going to the hospital with two vaccines.  And yet the policy for pages in this body is a booster--a mandated  booster. It is actually malpractice. It is malpractice to give a  booster, a third vaccine, to an adolescent male and probably to an  adolescent female. There is no evidence it helps them.   Then the other argument goes like this: Oh, we don't want them to  transmit it to people. Guess what? We have done a study on that, too.  Vaccinated versus unvaccinated: 25 percent of the household will  transmit it. It is the same for both groups. The vaccine protects you  from hospitalization and death. It does not prevent transmission.   So we are going to vaccinate these kids to take care of the old folks  in the Senate. It is not true. And they have already been vaccinated  twice. The third vaccine--there is no scientific evidence. There is,  however, evidence that it is a danger to them. And to ignore that  danger, to be supportive of force I think is without question the wrong  way to go.   In January, a piece in The Atlantic cited Dr. Offitt--once again, a  vaccine supporter who has been part of the vaccine committee with the  FDA for decades--as saying this:         Getting boosted would not be worth the risk for the average       healthy 17-year-old boy.    This is coming from an advocate of vaccines--not a denier, not  someone who hasn't been vaccinated. His son has been vaccinated, I  believe, twice. But he said he wouldn't do it for a 17-year-old. In  fact, he advised his son publicly, who is in his early 20s, not to get  the third dose.   What if I am wrong? What if Dr. Offitt is wrong? I don't know. What  if it is a controversy? Wouldn't we allow it, maybe, in a free society,  up to free individuals consulting with their parents whether you want  to get them? But, no. Everything is about force. Everything is about  mandates. Do as I am told, even when the science doesn't support it-- even when the science is arguable. Do it or we will fire you. Do it or  we will send you home. I think it is a terrible example and, coming  from the Senate, an awful precedent.   The Chicago Thinker is a paper for the University of Chicago, and the  students there put it in a January 11 editorial. These are the kids who  are being forced to do boosters as well:         If being ``boosted'' becomes a prerequisite for       participation in normal life, the vaccine's diminishing       efficacy means the booster campaign will never end.    See, we know this. This is the truth of the matter. While the vaccine  does help you to prevent hospitalization and death, we know it has  diminishing efficacy, meaning that it wears off, so you have to keep  getting boosted and boosted and boosted. But shouldn't we at least  study it? Shouldn't we be honest with these kids in that their death  rate is virtually zero with nothing? If you vaccinate them, it is zero,  and then we have just got to keep vaccinating them. Just do as you are  told. Submit to the State. Do whatever people tell you despite the  science; despite three scientists from the FDA's vaccine committee  saying it is not warranted; despite people arguing that it is actually  malpractice and puts these young people at risk to make them get a  third vaccine.   In December, Dr. Marty Makary, a professor at the Johns Hopkins  School of Medicine, wrote in the Wall Street Journal:         The U.S. government is pushing Covid-19 vaccine boosters       for 16- and 17-year-olds without supporting clinical data. A       large Israeli population study, published in the New England       Journal of Medicine earlier this month, found that the risk       of COVID death in people under 30 with two vaccine shots was       zero.    The risk of death is zero, and we are forcing them to get a third  shot for which we know, from large, million-person studies, there is a  side effect of heart inflammation.   Even World Health Organization Chief Scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan  said in January that there is no evidence right now that suggests  healthy children and adolescents need booster shots.   So most of Europe has actually said don't take it because of the risk  of myocarditis, and the head of the WHO says there is no health reason  for which to do it. Yet the Senate thinks it is smart enough to mandate  these kids. God forbid one of them dies. God forbid one of them gets  myocarditis.   Dr. Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist from Harvard Medical School,  says that mandating people who have already had COVID to still get  vaccinated ``makes zero sense from a scientific point of view, and it  makes zero sense from a public health point of view.''   Furthermore, we now know the CDC released that, under age 11, 75  percent of the kids have already had it. So, in the age category of the  pages and a little older than that, we are looking at a 70- to 75- percent chance they have already had it; they have already been  vaccinated; their chance of death is zero. Yet it is not enough. They  must submit--submit to the man; submit to the woman; submit to the  State.   The science isn't there. It is all about submission.   Then we have weak lapdogs who just say: Go ahead and force them. We  don't care. It is not very likely they will die. It is only a few out  of 100,000 we may lose.   A study in The Lancet last September supported this view, stating:         Current evidence does not . . . appear to show a need for       boosting in the general population.    This is not just in kids. This is in The Lancet, saying there isn't  evidence for boosting in the general population.   What has been accepted by most people is that boosting for those at  risk--those of age, those with obesity, those with, you know, other  risk factors--is not an unreasonable thing. For most of the people our  age and older, the vaccine, without question, is safer than the  disease, but the disease is so rare, so uneventful, and the death rate  so low in children that you need a near-perfect vaccine to say: Take  the vaccine versus the disease.   Even then, wouldn't you want to know if they had had it? Wouldn't we  want the CDC to release, if you have had COVID or if you have had COVID  and have been vaccinated, what your chances are of going to the  hospital?   They actually did look at this for a large population study, and they  found that, if you were vaccinated versus unvaccinated, you were 20  times less likely to go to the hospital. I still believe that to be  true, and I think it is for the overall population. It is probably not  measurable for kids because kids aren't largely affected by this.   Do you know what they also measured? They measured unvaccinated  versus the unvaccinated who have had COVID--and guess what. You were 55  times less likely to go to the hospital. The disease is an incredibly  potent source of immunity. If you have been vaccinated and had the  disease, I think you would calculate that in.   Do you just blindly submit and just take 100 vaccines and take it  every 6 months or would you want to talk to your doctor and say: Well,  I had COVID in January, and I have had two vaccines. I am relatively  thin and relatively healthy. What do you think?    Wouldn't there be a decision-making process?   When we are talking to children--the young men and women at the ages  of 15 and 16 years old, many of whom have had COVID already and have  already had vaccines--wouldn't we want them to be part of the decision  making?   Wouldn't we say: What do your parents think?   Wouldn't we ask for parental consent?   This is insane what we are doing. We have taken off on a tangent  where things that were once private decisions are now the realm of the  State.   In the study in The Lancet, they stated that the ``[c]urrent evidence  does not . . . appear to show a need for boosting in the general  population, in which efficacy against severe disease remains high,''  and ``currently available evidence''--this is also from The Lancet-- ``does not show the need for widespread use of booster vaccination in  populations that have received an effective primary regimen.''  [[Page S2475]]    So here we have a not insubstantial journal, The Lancet. Now, you can  disagree. You can disagree with the New England Journal of Medicine.  You can disagree with The Lancet, but for goodness' sake, wouldn't you  at least admit that it is an argument and that when there is an  argument that has valid facts on both sides of it that maybe the  individual ought to get to decide?   The Lancet says:         Currently available evidence does not show the need for       widespread booster vaccination in populations that have       received an effective primary vaccination regimen.    There is absolutely no clinical data to support other than a bunch of  bureaucrats who want to command you. There is no clinical data to say  that 15- and 16-year-olds ought to get a booster--zero.   When we consider the rules for pages, we ought to ask: Will these  policies be expected to continue indefinitely? And, if so, to what end?  based on what data? When will they change?   We have got them in here wearing masks. The Vice President doesn't  wear a mask when she is exposed. Look across all the pages of the news.  Everybody has been exposed. I think we have had 8 to 10 Senators who  have had COVID in the last couple of weeks. Do you think everybody who  ran into them wore a mask for 2 weeks? No, nobody is doing it. Nobody  is paying any attention to these people, but the pages are stuck under  the thumb of these public health czars.   When we consider the rules, we ought to ask: When will this end?   When it comes to vaccines, though, they can benefit the vaccinated  person, but it doesn't stop transmission. The best data we have comes  from Denmark, where vaccines were not shown to have any impact on  household viral transmission or the secondary attack rate. In other  words, whether vaccinated or unvaccinated, they both transmitted the  disease equally.   It is no coincidence that the Scandinavian countries have moved on to  a targeted testing and treatment regime. They are no longer just saying  for everybody to submit and for everybody to do the same thing. They  are targeting the disease and those who are at risk. They don't expect  people to live in a state of constant fear under an endless public  health emergency. Instead, public health officials issue  recommendations about how those at risk can protect themselves. They  give advice.   There was a time in the history of our country when public health  officials gave advice, not dictates or mandates. Realize the policy we  are adhering to is the same policy that Dr. Fauci espouses, and you  know what his response was.   When the court struck down the mask mandate on planes, do you know  what Dr. Fauci had the audacity to say? He said: How dare the courts  involve themselves in public health. We are not smart enough. Nobody  outside the realm of Dr. Fauci is smart enough, but how dare the courts  or the Constitution adjudicate what is individual liberty, what is the  responsibility of government, and whether the CDC has the power to have  mask mandates--none of this.   How dare they? That was his response.   Some offered a different approach. Some offered a more targeted  approach to this. It is what Dr. Scott Atlas called for when he was at  the White House in the last administration, but his voice was  deliberately drowned out by Dr. Fauci and others who attempted to  govern by stick rather than carrot.   Public health measures should be backed up with proof that the  benefits outweigh the burdens. There is no evidence of that when it  comes to vaccination mandates, especially for teenagers, who as a group  are less vulnerable to this virus than any Senator. That is why I am  asking unanimous consent that the Senate pass my resolution to end all  COVID mandates for pages and respect their privacy, their rights, their  medical freedom, and their health for the young men and women who serve  in this Chamber.   Madam President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 631, which is at the  desk. I further ask that the resolution be agreed to and that the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.     Reserving the right to object, I agree that members of the  judicial branch need better protection. In fact, I have been appalled  that leftwing pro-abortion groups released the addresses of our Supreme  Court Justices and that there have been people at their houses trying  to intimidate them. It is appalling and shouldn't happen. Whoever it  was that released the addresses of the Supreme Court Justices should be  punished.   So I think there is bipartisan support in this. I was disappointed  though that the White House has not condemned the release of the  Supreme Court Justices. I think that ranting and raving and noise all  night is disturbing the peace and isn't actually First Amendment  protected speech.   But if recent years have taught us anything, it is that Members of  the legislative branch also need protection. That was clear in 2011  when Congresswoman Gabby Giffords was tragically shot while doing the  most important part of her job, meeting with constituents.    Words cannot express how happy and inspired I was to see  Congresswoman Giffords was in the Chamber as her husband, Senator  Kelly, was recently sworn in, but words also cannot express the pain  felt by the families of the people who were killed and wounded that  day.   That should have been a wakeup call to better protect Members of  Congress and, in doing so, better protect the people around them. But  just a few years ago, a shooter nearly killed Congressman   Steve  Scalise during practice for the annual charity baseball game. I know. I  was there. One staffer was shot less than 10 feet from me.   The Capitol Hill police were there and saved our lives. Had they not  been there, things might have been much worse. But the Capitol Police  aren't everywhere, and our families live in many cities outside of  Washington. Extending the provisions of this bill to Members of  Congress would do nothing to change the content. In fact, I believe our  legislative changes add four words ``and Members of Congress.''   So I think these protections actually are good protections. I agree  with the spirit of the bill; I agree with the letter of the bill, but  really it should be judicial folks protected as well as Congress.   My substitute amendment, which I will offer for unanimous consent,  would make a simple change. My amendment would simply extend the  protections that would be offered to the judicial branch to the  legislative branch.   So I ask the committee-reported amendment be withdrawn and that the  Senator modify his request to include my substitute amendment which is  at the desk; that the substitute amendment be considered read a third  time and passed and that the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table.    I object.    Reserving the right to object, my oath of office is to the  U.S. Constitution, not to any foreign nation. And no matter how  sympathetic the cause, my oath of office is to the national security of  the United States of America.   We cannot save Ukraine by dooming the U.S. economy. In March,  inflation hit a 40-year high. Gasoline alone is up 48 percent, and  energy prices are up 32 percent over the last year. Food prices have  increased by nearly 9 percent. Used vehicle prices are up 35 percent  for the year, and new vehicle prices have increased 12 percent or more.   Yes, inflation doesn't just come out of nowhere; it comes from  deficit spending.   The United States spent nearly $5 trillion on COVID-19 bailouts,  leading to one of the highest and most sustained levels of inflation in  U.S. history.   Americans are feeling the pain, and Congress seems intent only on  adding to that pain by shoveling more money out the door as fast as  they can.   This bill under consideration would spend $40 billion. This is the  second spending bill for Ukraine in 2 months, and this bill is three  times larger than the first.   Our military aid to Ukraine is nothing new, though. Since 2014, the  United States has provided more than $6 billion in security assistance  to Ukraine. In addition to the $14 billion Congress authorized just a  month ago, if this bill passes, the United States will have authorized  roughly $60 billion in total spending for Ukraine.   For those who say this is not enough, for those of you in this  Chamber who say that our military spending is never enough, let's put  $60 billion into perspective.   According to Elias Yousef, a security assistance expert at the  Stimson Center, Kyiv would become the largest yearly recipient of U.S.  military aid of the past two decades.   Except for the top five countries, $60 billion is more than every  other country in the world spends on their entire military  expenditures.   If this gift to Ukraine passes, our total aid to Ukraine will almost  equal the entire military budget of Russia. And it is not as if we have  that money lying around. We will have to borrow that money from China  to send it to Ukraine.   The cost of this package we are voting on today is more than the  United States spent during the first year of the U.S. conflict in  Afghanistan. Congress authorized force, and the President sent troops  into the conflict. The same cannot be said of Ukraine.   This proposal towers over domestic priorities as well. The massive  package of $60 billion to Ukraine dwarfs the $6 million spent on cancer  research annually, and $60 billion is more than the amount the  government collects in gas taxes each year to build roads and bridges.  The $60 billion to Ukraine can fund substantial portions or entire  large Cabinet Departments. The $60 billion nearly equals the entire  State Department budget. The $60 billion exceeds the budget for the  Department of Homeland Security and for the Department of Energy. And  Congress just wants to keep on spending and spending.    Our allies and partners have sent aid to Ukraine. Some of them even  broke longstanding traditions by sending military assistance. Germany,  Poland, the United Kingdom, and others are stepping up to defend  Ukraine like never before.   In other words, it is not all about us. It isn't that we always have  to be the Uncle Sam, the policeman who saves the world, particularly  when it is on borrowed money. Yet the United States accounted for  nearly half of what has been spent so far.   With a $30 trillion debt, America can't afford to be the world's  policeman. The United States is trying to recover from the $1.6  trillion we spent on wars in the Middle East, not to mention the $5  trillion borrowed for COVID.   We should not forget that the Soviet Union collapsed, in large part,  not because it was defeated militarily but because it ran out of money.  In an attempt to save Ukraine, will we doom the United States to such a  future?   In the past 2 years, the United States has borrowed more money than  at any time in our history. We are already experiencing the greatest  rate of inflation in over four decades. The assault on monetary  discipline is untenable, and it cannot go on forever. Unless we put an  end to the fiscal insanity, a day of reckoning awaits us.   Congress should evaluate the cost of continuing down this path. The  biggest threat to the United States today is debt and inflation and the  destruction of the dollar. We cannot save Ukraine by killing our  economic strength.   So I ask to modify the bill to allow for a special inspector general.  This would be the inspector general who has been overseeing the waste  in Afghanistan and has done a great job.   Therefore, I ask the Senator to modify his request so that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 368, H.R. 7691;  furthermore, that the Paul amendment at the desk be considered and  agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time;  and that the Senate vote on passage of the bill, as amended, with a 60- affirmative vote threshold for passage.    I object.    Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week, I  recognize an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the  American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to  recognize the small business, Florek Family Chiropractic of Ft. Thomas,  KY, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   Take a look at any small business owner's story, and you will find a  common theme: determination in the face of risk. Thus proceeds the  story of Florek Family Chiropractic. Justin Florek, owner and manager  of the chiropractic office, went out on a limb in 2019 and opened his  own chiropractic office after spending several years working in a  larger chiropractor's office in Falmouth. However, the story would be  incomplete without the mention of Justin's wife Samantha, who took out  a small business loan and joined him in facing down the odds to embark  on this new venture. Together, Justin, Samantha, and the rest of the  team at Florek Family Chiropractic weathered the storm of the COVID-19  pandemic only 1 year after opening their doors, and today, they  continue to proudly service the residents of Ft. Thomas and wider  Campbell County.   Justin Florek has long been passionate about the body's health and  wellness. In fact, Justin first became interested in the chiropractic  field as far back as ninth grade. A school assignment required each  student to shadow three different occupations and write a paper on  their findings. A teenage Justin shadowed a police officer, a baker,  and a chiropractor. While shadowing the chiropractor, Justin saw how  chiropractic adjustments were able to help those struggling with  unaddressed injuries. Just having recently suffered a football injury  himself, Justin appreciated how much a chiropractor's touch and advice  would have benefited someone in his own position. Thus what started as  a school assignment led to a life-long career choice.   After graduating from Logan College of Chiropractic in 2014, Justin  set out to join a larger practice to offer his services to the  community of Falmouth. To this day, Justin is profoundly grateful to  the Falmouth community for the 5 years he spent in office honing in on  his skills and trade before deciding to take the big leap and open his  own shop. From Falmouth, Justin ventured north towards the Ohio border  to settle in Ft. Thomas. In a convenient turn of events, Justin and his  wife Samantha identified an affordable piece of property for sale that  was perfectly located between Bellevue, Newport, Cold Spring, and  Highland Heights. This lucky opportunity led to their venture in small  business ownership, which proudly stands today as a testament to their  hard work and determination.   As previously mentioned, Justin takes a genuine interest in the  health and well-being of those around him. He remains dedicated to  improving the health of others and serves as one of the few  chiropractors in Campbell County that accepts Medicaid payments. Justin  takes pride in ensuring that all residents are cared for, regardless of  their tax bracket. Moreover, he looks out for his community beyond just  providing his chiropractic services. He often donates to northern  Kentucky school groups and other local fundraisers; after all, he does  owe the inspiration for his livelihood to that long-ago school  assignment. Justin is a man who not only cares for the community in a  medical sense, but also is a man who bolsters the environment with his  good cheer and giving nature.   I want to congratulate this upstanding entrepreneur for the  dedication and grit he displayed throughout the pandemic and for  navigating the uncharted terrain involved in owning your own business.  I wish Justin and Samantha the best of luck and look forward to seeing  their continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
