 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solidarity with  the people of Hong Kong.   Last month, I had the opportunity to hear directly from leaders in  Hong Kong dedicated to both religious tolerance and to democracy, as  promised in the ``one country, two systems'' agreement.   The people of Hong Kong wave American flags during their protests as  a symbol of the freedoms that they desire.   Now is the time for Congress to support the people of Hong Kong and  pass Representative Chris Smith's bill, the Hong Kong Human Rights and  Democracy Act. This measure states without question that the United  States Government supports the people of Hong Kong and their right to  freedom of expression and democratic governance guaranteed under their  50-year arrangement agreed to in 1997 by China and the United Kingdom.                   Stop Ignoring Red Lines in Idlib, Syria     Mr. Speaker, I rise today again to bring  attention to the travesty happening in Idlib province, Syria.   Since mid-August, the brutal dictator Assad, his protector Putin, and  Iranian coconspirators have repeatedly bombed Idlib and the surrounding  region. Their aerial slaughter and shelling have displaced all but 2  percent to 3 percent of the population. They have bombed hospitals,  even killing a former kindergarten student of the Wisdom House School,  a school supported by constituents in my home of Arkansas, supported  before the school was closed due to bombing.   After nearly 10 years of death and destruction, some say this  conflict is drawing to a close. When we look back on this calamitous  conflict, we and our allies in Europe will hang our heads in shame for  ignoring red lines that gave a green light to Assad's slaughter of his  own civilians by the hundreds of thousands.                              Honoring Bob Shell     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of my friend Bob Shell, who passed away last month at the age of  88.   In 1950, Bob joined The Baldwin Company for a job scheduled to last 9  months and ended up staying for almost 70 years. Bob started in the  field as a payroll clerk and worked his way up in the company,  eventually becoming president, chairman, and chairman emeritus. The  company's name was changed when Bob became president and CEO to Baldwin  & Shell Construction Company, the name it holds today.   Bob is one of the five charter members of the Arkansas Construction  Hall of Fame. He was named Arkansas Business Executive of the Year in  1990 and was featured by Arkansas Business as one of 10 business icons  for our State in 2016.   During his time with the company, he had been involved in more than  2,700 projects, including hospitals, offices, schools, churches, and  industrial plants.   I admired this good and decent man. He was a role model and a friend  to many across our State of Arkansas, and I extend my respect,  affection, and prayers to his friends, family, and loved ones.                          Honoring Nicholas Burrell     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize an  amazing young man from my district, Nicholas Burrell from Benton,  Arkansas.   Nicholas started as a Cub Scout in third grade and, at age 14, became  the youngest Eagle Scout in Troop 99 in Benton. He is also a cancer  survivor.   Nicholas was diagnosed with cancer of the brain and spine when he was  11. He has had multiple tumors and underwent 26 rounds of chemotherapy  but was always back to participating in projects with the Boy Scouts  just a few months after his last treatment.   For his Eagle project, he built a free outdoor pantry called the  Blessing Box at Salem United Methodist Church, where Troop 99 holds its  meetings.   Nicholas is currently a ninth-grader at Bryant Junior High School,  and his cancer has been in remission since 2017.   Nicholas' strength and perseverance are a testament and witness to us  all. I wish him much continued success as he grows and makes Arkansas  proud.                            ____________________
