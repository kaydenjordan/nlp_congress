 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senators from South Carolina, Tennessee, Washington State, and Alabama  be allowed to speak for brief moments on the great job they have done  and that I be given back my leadership time at 10:50.    Madam President, first, let me thank my colleagues from  South Carolina, Tennessee, Washington State, Alabama, and Delaware for  their hard work on this very important issue. I appreciated their  words, and I think far more appreciated even than their eloquent words  is the fact that we are getting this done, finally. I am so glad for  it.   Let me just add my words of support for the FUTURE Act. A few minutes  ago, as I mentioned, we passed the FUTURE Act by unanimous consent. I  am so glad and grateful that the Senate came together today to give  these institutions and the students they serve the certainty needed to  continue focusing on their important mission.   In America, we believe in ladders up. People should have to climb  those ladders. No one is going to put them up on a pedestal. But there  should be the ladders there so that if somebody wants to work hard,  they are given fair opportunity and barriers--sometimes barriers based  on bigotry and discrimination--do not stand in their way.   One of the best ladders-up we have in America is our HBCUs. HBCUs  make up 3 percent of colleges and universities, but they produce 27  percent of African-American students with bachelor degrees in STEM  fields, 80 percent of African-American judges, 40 percent of African- American engineers, 50 percent of African-American lawyers, and 40  percent of African-American colleagues here in the Congress are HBCU  graduates. So this is one fine ladder-up, as are our other institutions  that spend much time helping Hispanic Americans and Native Americans as  well.   We need these ladders. They are part of America. We should help them  whenever we can. Tribal colleges and universities serving Black,  Hispanic, and Native American populations serve more than 130,000  American Indians and Alaska Natives, the most underserved group in  higher education. Hispanic-serving institutions have grown by nearly 40  percent since 2009, helping the Latino community make big inroads in  college enrollment and completion. They now enroll 66 percent of all  Hispanic undergraduates but account for only 15 percent of nonprofit  colleges.   So all three of these types of institutions--the HBCUs, the colleges  and universities serving American Indians and Alaska Natives, and  Hispanic-serving institutions--are amazing ladders up. They are  essential for making higher education accessible, affordable, and  attainable for all Americans; essential for having that bright Sun--the  American dream--actually shine on people instead of it being some words  that are meaningless to them.   This is a very fine moment, and I want to thank all of those who put  this all together and made it happen. We can celebrate. Most of the  things that pass by UC around here--or many of them--are really kind of  small and narrow. This is not. This is very important. And my salute to  those who made it happen, whom I mentioned earlier.                                 Impeachment    Madam President, now on a less happy subject, this morning the  Speaker of the House instructed House committee chairs to begin  drafting articles of impeachment against the President of the United  States. That is a very solemn duty and solemn undertaking. The  Speaker's decision comes after the House Intelligence Committee  reported that its inquiry had ``uncovered a months-long effort by  President Trump to use the powers of his office to solicit foreign  interference on his behalf in the 2020 election.''   We know Russia interfered on Trump's behalf in 2016, and now he is  trying to make it happen again, this time by trying to push Ukraine.   The charges against the President are extremely serious. No  belittling of these charges will hold any water. The charge to use  foreign interference on behalf of a candidate in the 2020 elections is  dramatic and awful stuff.   These charges concern our national security. They concern the  sanctity of our elections and the potential corruption of our Nation's  foreign policy for  [[Page S6868]]  personal political interests of the President of the United States. The  gravity of those charges demands that Senators, if Articles of  Impeachment are served to us, to put country over party and examine the  evidence without prejudice or partisanship, which is why it is so  disheartening, confounding, and deeply disappointing that, at this  historic moment, I heard the Republican leader criticizing in such  strident terms the process of the impeachment inquiry in the House for  being too short and not including enough witnesses or due process for  the President.   I respond on two counts. First, the Republican leader is simply wrong  to suggest that the House process has been anything but deliberate,  evenhanded, and serious. Speaker Pelosi, the House Intelligence  Committee, and the House Judiciary Committee are proceeding exactly how  the Constitution prescribes. But, second, it is the height of hypocrisy  to criticize the House process for being too short and not including  enough witnesses when the Trump administration is the one blocking  witnesses from testifying.   What hypocrisy? How can a leader even say it with a straight face?  Will this febrile obeisance to President Trump never cease? Are they so  afraid of him and his bullying that they can't admit the obvious truth  and twist themselves in pretzel knots to make arguments that are so  spurious? It is the height of hypocrisy to criticize the House for not  including enough opportunities for the President to make his defense  when the President is refusing to participate. It is the height of  hypocrisy to say that there are not enough witnesses when we don't hear  a peep out of the Republicans urging the President to allow the  witnesses that the House wanted to come forward.   This hyperventilation about the length of the House process and the  number of witnesses is simply ridiculous. The Trump administration is  responsible for those things, not House Democrats. Everyone knows that.  Everyone knows they have gone to court to block witnesses and  documents.   I remind my colleagues, if the Articles of Impeachment are indeed  passed by the House, Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans must work  with Democrats to set the parameters of a fair and impartial trial.  Every Member of the Senate should support a fair process. The House is  running a fair process now. We must do the same in the Senate if it  comes to that.   All week, I have been urging my Senate Republican colleagues not to  spread or even speculate about the dangerous myth that Ukraine--not  just Putin--interfered in the 2016 elections. The myth was invented by  Putin's intelligence services to deflect blame away from Putin while  driving a wedge between the United States and Ukraine, one of Putin's  top goals. When certain Senate Republicans are parroting Putin's  talking points, we have a serious problem.   Hopefully, the overwhelming criticisms of the Members who did that  this week have convinced them to stop and back off in the Republicans'  absurd denial of fact and total defense of President Trump, even when  it is obvious that he is not telling the truth. We have reached a low  moment, and maybe the lowest of all was the mounting of Putin's  conspiracy theory about Ukraine.   Now, another insidious conspiracy theory was doused with cold water  this morning. The truth comes out, Republicans, sooner or later.  Another theory was doused with cold water when it was reported that  Attorney General Barr's handpicked prosecutor had reportedly found no  evidence that the FBI probe into the Trump campaign was a setup.  Republicans in the House, conservative media personalities, FOX News,  and other blind partisan loyalists to the President have long conjured  and peddled these deep-state conspiracy theories without evidence.   The Attorney General is even using the resources of the Justice  Department--which could be exposing Chinese Communist Party's spies or  tracking would-be radical terrorists or fighting opioids or tackling  ransomware attacks on cities across the country--to investigate the  origins of the 2016 probe. Attorney General Barr's actions are  presumably in the hopes of turning up evidence to support these far- fetched theories.   Well, too bad, Republicans. Too bad, hard right. The Attorney  General's handpicked prosecutor found no evidence to these conspiracy  theories, that the investigation of President Trump was started with  evil and political intent. The only evidence we have is that the  outlandish loyalist theories peddled by President Trump and his allies  to defend this administration are totally baseless.                               Border Security    Now, on another note, airport face scans, this morning, it was  reported that the Trump administration will propose a rule to require  U.S. citizens to have their faces scanned whenever they enter or leave  the United States. This sounds like something out of China. Currently,  all U.S. citizens are allowed to opt out of facial scans when entering  or exiting the country. Now, the Trump administration is poised to  remove that option and make facial scans mandatory for all travelers,  including U.S. citizens.   I have significant concerns about what this policy would mean for the  privacy of every American citizen. Just last year, a cyber attack of  CBP compromised the personal information--in this case, it was license  plates--and facial data of just under 100,000 people. Imagine if DHS  were required to retain the facial data of every American who travels  in and out of the country.   There are, of course, legitimate questions about whether the Federal  Government is legally allowed to collect and store this data. Those  questions must be answered before--not after--the Trump administration  moves forward with its new rules. On something as serious as this,  Congress should debate this issue.   Regardless, I see no reason why the current opt-out policy must  change, and I will work with privacy advocates in the Senate, like my  friend Senator Markey, to legislatively prevent the administration from  moving forward.                                  TRACED Act    Another issue, robocalls, the House of Representatives yesterday  passed bipartisan legislation to crack down on the tens of billions of  robocalls that plague Americans every year. All of us are bothered by  these darn robocalls. They come at the worse times, and they are on and  on. You can't even shut them off.   Last year alone, Americans were battered by 48 billion--billion-- robocalls. That is 150 calls per person, per year. Robocalls are  annoying. They are persistent, and beyond that, many of them are  dangerous to consumers. Foreign companies can make thousands of calls  with a push of a button and can charge Americans simply for picking up  the call. Can you believe that? Many are designed to scam elderly  Americans. We have heard about elderly Americans who are frightened and  send their life savings to these criminal callers. Many of the calls  target institutions like hospitals and slow down important businesses.   The TRACED Act passed by the Senate in May and recently amended and  passed by the House requires phone companies to block robocalls without  charging consumers and will give the Justice Department and the FCC  better tools to prosecute scammers who prey on unsuspecting--many  elderly--Americans. I am proud to be a cosponsor of the original Senate  bill. I pushed hard to move it forward. The Senate should now take  action on the amended and expanded robocall legislation from the House  and pass it before the year is out.   As we saw with the recent legislation to the democratic protests in  Hong Kong, when there is bipartisan consensus on an issue, we can move  swiftly to enact bipartisan legislation. These moments, unfortunately,  are far too rare under Leader McConnell, who has avoided the  consideration of legislation on the floor, even when it has bipartisan  support, but I hope as we enter the final few weeks of the year, Leader  McConnell will address the issue of robocalls and send this bipartisan  to the President's desk.   I yield the floor.
