 Madam Speaker, today marks the 26th day of  President Trump's irresponsible and destructive government shutdown.  Not only has the shutdown resulted in hundreds of thousands of  Americans being put on furlough, but it has also inflicted long-term  damage to our Nation's research and development enterprise.   During my 26 years on the Science Committee, I have witnessed the  consequences of our Federal science and technology agencies being  forced to shut their doors; namely, science suffers and U.S. innovation  falters. We fall behind and fail to compete globally as our competitors  strengthen their own investments in R&D.   Researchers who rely on regular funding from now-closed agencies are  struggling to keep their projects afloat as they miss important  deadlines and have crucial gaps in data. We are seeing contractors that  work in coordination with the Federal Government being furloughed, with  no promise of back pay when the President's temper tantrum is finally  over.   We hope to get back on course. If we want to remain a global leader  in innovation, we must end this shutdown.                            ____________________
