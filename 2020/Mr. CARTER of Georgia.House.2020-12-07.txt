 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor a very special person, Mr. Martin NeSmith.   Martin was a natural-born leader who dedicated his life to serving  others, including serving his country in the National Guard.   Following his graduation from Georgia Southern University, he began  his career in the automobile industry and became the youngest dealer,  at 24 years old, when he purchased a Chevrolet dealership in Claxton,  Georgia.   His kindness and selflessness extended to every area of his life,  including his business ventures. For example, in the early 1990s, he  revolutionized the car business with the ``No Hassle Buying'' concept  because he wanted every customer to be honored and treated with  respect. No hassle buying means customers get the best deal right away,  without the need to negotiate.   His dedication to the automobile industry earned him the highest  honor an automobile dealer can achieve: the Time Magazine Quality  Dealer Award. This award recognizes car dealers who exhibit exceptional  performance in their dealerships and perform distinguished community  service.   Martin was a wonderful philanthropist within his community and  beyond, and he led by example throughout his life.   He was also known as a man of integrity who kept his word in all he  did, and he never met a stranger.   I was deeply saddened to hear of the loss of such an incredible  person. My prayers go out to his family, friends, and community during  this most difficult time.                            ____________________
