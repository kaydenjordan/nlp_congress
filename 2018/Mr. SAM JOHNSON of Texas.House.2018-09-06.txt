 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  recognizing me, and I appreciate those comments.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, French Hill, for  arranging this Special Order to honor John.   Mr. Speaker, John was more than just a colleague in Congress. We were  friends, and that friendship was forged in the infamous Hanoi Hilton.  Not everyone knows that he and I shared a cell there together for a  time.   I can testify to the fact that John did everything he could to defend  freedom and honor our great Nation, not just in that hell on Earth, but  beyond those bleak years. This is most evident in his service in the  United States House and Senate.   John, we will remember your strength of spirit, your commitment to  our servicemembers and our democracy, and your love of country.   I would now like to tap a special message for John and his family,  who remain in my prayers. This tap code was used by the POWs to resist  our captors.   That is a G. That is a B. And that is a U. And that is what we all  used to use, ``God bless you.''   God bless you, partner. I salute you.
