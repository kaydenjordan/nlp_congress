 Madam Speaker, we cannot countenance the culture of hate  in our nation that leads to Asian and Pacific Islander Americans being  harassed, assaulted, and scapegoated for the COVID-19 pandemic.   Hateful rhetoric has deadly consequences. Xiaojie ``Emily'' Tan,  Daoyou Feng, Delaina Ashley Yaun Gonzalez, Paul Andre Michels, Yong Ae  Yue, Soon Chung ``Julie'' Park, Hyun Jung Grant, and Suncha Kim were  forever taken from their families on March 16 in a shooting fueled by  this racist hate.   These eight victims deserve swift justice for the heinous and  inexcusable act of gun violence that ended their lives.   But all Asian and Pacific Islander Americans deserve for this  Congress to stand up, condemn the violence, and commit to ending hatred  and bigotry. That is why I am a cosponsor of H. Res. 275.   On behalf of the majority Asian/Pacific Islander community I  represent, I join my colleagues in expressing our condolences to the  families of the victims of the Atlanta shooting.   And I join all those voting for H. Res. 275 in affirming that crimes  of hate against Asians, Pacific Islanders, or any racial or ethnic  group have no place in America.
