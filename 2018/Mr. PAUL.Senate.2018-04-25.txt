 Mr. President, I first visited America's Finest  Filters in 2015, after hearing about the incredible work this small  business was doing in serving the members of Louisville's community.  Founded by Michael White and now run by his daughter TaHondra Johnson,  America's Finest Filters believes in the power of second chances and  makes a conscious effort to employ ex-offenders, who currently make up  over half of their employees.   What America's Finest Filters understands is that breaking the cycle  of poverty, incarceration, and addiction can be done through providing  opportunities for meaningful work and taking responsibility. When I  visited with their employees, I listened to many stories of those who  turned their lives around because America's Finest Filters gave them  the tools to succeed.   April is also Second Chance Month, which is why I am proud to  recognize this business for giving second chances to those who so truly  deserve them. I am also recognizing this business in honor of late  founder Michael White, who sadly lost his battle with cancer in 2016.  He set a true example of what it means to be a role model and leader,  and his philanthropic achievements and impact on the community will  never be forgotten.                            ____________________
