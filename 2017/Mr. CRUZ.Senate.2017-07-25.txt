 Mr. President, today is an important step in a very long  journey. Some 7 years ago, ObamaCare passed into law, and in the 7  years that ObamaCare has been on the books, we have seen the results of  this catastrophic law. We have seen the devastation that has resulted.  ObamaCare is the biggest job killer in this country.   You and I and the Senators who have listened to their constituents  across the country have heard over and over again from small businesses  that have been hammered by ObamaCare. As I have listened to small  businesses in the State of Texas over and over again, they have  described ObamaCare as the single biggest challenge they face.   Indeed, thanks to ObamaCare, we have discovered two new categories of  people who have been hurt by the Federal Government--the so-called  49ers and the so-called 29ers. The 49ers are the millions of small  businesses that have 47, 48, 49 employees and yet do not grow to 50  because at 50, they would be subject to ObamaCare, and in being subject  to ObamaCare, they would go out of business. There are literally  millions of new jobs that are waiting to happen, waiting to grow, small  businesses ready to expand that ObamaCare penalizes so punitively that  they do not expand.   By the way, those jobs that would be the 50th and 51st and 52nd are  typically low-income jobs. They are jobs for people who are just  starting out in their careers. They are jobs for people who are  minorities, who are African Americans, who are Hispanics. They are jobs  for people like my father in 1957--washing dishes, making 50 cents an  hour, but he was glad to have freedom in this new country.   Then there are the 29ers, the people all across this country who are  forcibly put into part-time work at 28, 29 hours a week because  ObamaCare defines a ``full-time employee'' as 30 hours a week. People  all over the country are being hurt. Single moms who are trying to feed  their kids are being hurt because they have been forced into part-time  work so that they end up working two or three part-time jobs at 28, 29  hours a piece, and none of them provide healthcare. The burden on them  has been enormous.   It hasn't just been jobs, although that is a big part of it; it has  also been the millions of Americans who have had their health insurance  canceled because of ObamaCare. We all know President Obama looked at  the TV cameras and said: If you like your health insurance plan, you  can keep your health insurance plan, and if you like your doctor, you  can keep your doctor.   PolitiFact--that left-leaning news site--labeled Obama's promise as  2013's Lie of the Year, and it was. It was a deliberate lie, as  Jonathan Gruber, the architect of ObamaCare, said that they were  banking on what they called the stupidity of the American people-- selling it based on a lie.   Then there is the impact on premiums. President Obama promised the  American people that under ObamaCare the average family's premiums  would drop $2,500 a year. That wasn't just a little bit wrong; it was  wildly and dramatically wrong. In fact, the average family's premiums  have risen over $5,000 a year.   People are hurting because health insurance is unaffordable. I hear  from Texans over and over and over again: I cannot afford health  insurance anymore.   I will say that the harms from ObamaCare--the people suffering under  this failed law--have been mounting and mounting and mounting, and for  7 years, the Democrats have been content to do nothing. Barack Obama as  President and Democrats having majorities in the Senate did nothing for  the 49ers who could not get new jobs; nothing for the 29ers, the single  moms forced to work part time; nothing for the millions of people who  had the insurance plans that they liked canceled; nothing for the  millions of people who could not go see their own doctors anymore;  nothing for the millions of people whose premiums had skyrocketed.   After 7 years of stonewalling and blockading and saying ``We do not  hear you'' to the American people, now our friends on the Democratic  aisle are suddenly insisting that they want to do something. Today, we  had a vote to take the first step in doing something--in honoring the  promise every Republican made to repeal this disaster.   The bill before the Senate is not perfect. No one would expect it to  be perfect. Bismarck's comments about sausage-making are certainly true  in this process here today. Yet I will say that in the bill before the  Senate, which is not likely to pass tonight--but I believe, at the end  of the process, the contours within it are likely to be what we enact,  at least the general outlines--there are at least four positive  elements that are significant.   No. 1, it repeals the individual mandate.   The IRS fines about 6.5 million people a year because they do not  have enough money to buy insurance. Think about that for a second. You  are struggling to make ends meet, and you do not have the money to buy  health insurance. Not only do you not have insurance, but the IRS slaps  you with a fine--millions of dollars of fines. In the State of Texas,  there are roughly a million people who are getting fined by the IRS,  roughly half of whom make $25,000 a year or less and nearly 80 percent  of whom make $50,000 a year or less. The Democratic solution is, if you  do not have the money for healthcare, the IRS is going to fine you on  top of it, and you still do not get healthcare. That is a terrible  outcome.   This bill will repeal the individual mandate, repeal the IRS fines on  6.5 million Americans and the job-killing fines of the individual  mandate.   It also repeals the employer mandate, which is the driver of the  29ers and 49ers. For 7 years, the Democrats had no answer to the single  mom forced to work part time. Repealing the employer mandate provides  relief to everyone who finds himself in those camps.   No. 3, this bill has a major reform that allows people to use health  savings accounts--pretax money--to pay for insurance premiums. That  means, for millions of Americans, their effective premium rates  instantly drop 20 to 30 percent by using pretax money. That is a major  reform for empowering you, the consumer, to choose the healthcare for  your family.   No. 4, the bill before the Senate includes the consumer freedom  amendment--an amendment that I have introduced like the health savings  account amendment. It is an amendment that says you, the consumer,  should have the freedom to choose the healthcare that is best for your  family. You should have the freedom. You shouldn't have to buy what the  Federal Government mandates that you must buy; you should choose what  meets the needs for you and your family.   The consumer freedom amendment was designed to bring together and  serve as a compromise for those who support the mandates in title I.  The consumer freedom amendment says that insurance companies, if they  offer plans that meet those title I mandates--all the protections for  preexisting conditions--they can also sell any other plan that  consumers desire. So it takes away nothing. If you like your ObamaCare  plans, those are still there. It just adds new options and lets you  decide: Do you want the ObamaCare option or do you want something else  that is affordable? So rather than getting fined by the IRS, you can  actually purchase something you and your family can afford.   Now, our friends on the Democratic aisle have been unwilling to look  at any option expanding consumer freedom; they just say it won't work.  What we know won't work is ObamaCare. We know premiums have risen over  $5,000 a year. What happens with the consumer freedom amendment? And  this is critical. Over the past 2 weeks, the Department of Health and  Human Services conducted a study on the impact of the consumer freedom  amendment. They concluded, No. 1, it would expand insurance coverage by  2.2 million people. Our friends on the Democratic aisle are constantly  alleging that repealing ObamaCare will reduce coverage. Well, HHS found  the consumer freedom amendment expands it by 2.2 million people.  [[Page S4181]]    But what does it do to premiums? This is powerful. HHS found that it  will reduce premiums by over $7,000 a year. If you are a single mom, if  you are a school teacher, if you are a truckdriver, $7,000 a year is a  lot of money. It is the difference between making ends meet and not,  perhaps. HHS found specifically that for those choosing freedom plans-- the less expensive options--premiums would drop $7,260 a year.   But what about those on the exchanges? What about those purchasing  plans subject to all of the mandates? HHS found those plans would also  drop, they projected by $5,580 a year. So consumers benefit across the  board with lower premiums.   This has been a process. At the end of this process, it is not clear  what the Senate is going to pass, what is going to bring together and  unite the Republican conference because, sadly, the Democrats are not  willing to help us provide more consumer freedom, to help us lower  premiums, to help us provide relief to the 49ers and 29ers who have  been hammered by this bill. But I believe the key to getting this  done--and I believe we can and will get to yes. We are not likely to  get to yes tonight, but we can and will get to yes. I think the key to  it is the consumer freedom amendment, if we are lowering premiums. If  Texans, if Montanans, if people across this country are going home and  seeing premiums $5,000 a year cheaper with protections for preexisting  conditions or $7,000 cheaper if you want a catastrophic plan on a  freedom plan, that is a win for everyone. It is a win for  conservatives. It is a win for moderates. It should be a win for  Democrats. If Democrats were not engaged in this partisan fight,  Democrats ought to be saying that lowering premiums $5,000 or $7,000 is  a win for our citizens. That, I believe, will be the key to getting  this done.   Let me finally say that there is rhetoric about insurance companies.  Do you know who loves ObamaCare? It is insurance companies. Under  ObamaCare, the profits of the top 10 insurance companies have doubled.  When you have the IRS fining people to force them to purchase their  product and driving up premiums so they are unaffordable, ObamaCare  effectively sets up a cartel for the large insurance companies.   Consumer freedom puts you, the consumer, in charge of your choices.  Instead of the giant insurance companies, instead of the Federal  Government, it puts you in charge. Freedom is the key to unifying our  conference, and lowering premiums is the key, and I believe we can and  will get this done.   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    Mr. President, unfortunately, there is far too much  scaremongering that occurs in the political world. But as John Adams  famously said: ``Facts are stubborn things.''   My friend from Oregon just described the consumer freedom amendment  as ``a bomb going off in healthcare.'' That is interesting rhetoric,  but it is disconnected from the actual facts.   Let's talk about what my friend from Oregon neglected to mention or  respond to in any way, shape, or form. He said not a single word about  HHS finding that the consumer freedom amendment would expand insurance  coverage by 2.2 million people. He had not a word to say in response to  that. What he did say is that those who might choose freedom plans  would be choosing what he called junk insurance.   Well, it is very nice that ObamaCare mandates that every person must  buy a full-fledged Cadillac plan with all the coverage in the world.  The problem is, there are millions of people who can't afford it. Not  only can they not afford it, they get fined by the IRS because they  can't afford it. My friend from Oregon said not a word about the 6.5  million people being fined by the IRS, roughly 50 percent of whom make  $25,000 a year or less.   It is interesting that Democrats are advocating fining people who  make $25,000 a year or less because they can't afford insurance. And  what they say is: Look, we are going to fine you until you can afford  to buy the full Cadillac plan. Well, you know what, if you are a young  woman, you are 28 years old, you are just starting your career, you are  making $30,000 a year, you may not be able to afford the full Cadillac  plan, but you might like some coverage. You might like catastrophic  coverage. So if you get a cold, you break your arm, you cover that out  of your health savings account perhaps. But if, God forbid, you get  some terrible disease or hit by a truck, you would like to have an  insurance policy.   Sadly, our friends the Democrats say that you are out of luck. If you  can't pay for the full-fledged Cadillac, you get nothing. They think  your choices are junk insurance.   Remember when Barack Obama said that if you like your insurance plan,  you can keep it? Well, listen to how the Democrats have moved today. If  they don't like your insurance plan, you can't keep it. If they think  your plan is junk, you can't keep it, and they are going to fine you  through the IRS. I think you know better what your family wants.   The consumer freedom amendment doesn't take away a single choice. If  you like the ObamaCare plans, they are still on the market with all of  those mandates. But the Democrats are terrified of freedom. They are  terrified that if people actually had the choice, they might not choose  the full Cadillac; they might make a different choice.   But then in the world of scaremongering, my friend from Oregon also  said: Well, those on the ObamaCare exchanges would go into a death  spiral, would see their premiums spike.   Remember that John Adams quote about facts being stubborn things?  Here is something else my friend from Oregon ignored, said nothing  about. HHS found that for those on the exchanges, with all the title I  mandates, including preexisting conditions, their premiums would drop  by over $5,500 a year.   So the question is, Who is more trustworthy, the experts at HHS  analyzing what would occur with competition and choices in the  marketplace or the rhetoric and scaremongering that sadly is being  offered from the other side?   It would be one thing if they were confronting facts, if they were  actually addressing real facts; instead, it is nothing but angry  rhetoric.   My friend from Oregon described repealing ObamaCare and empowering  consumers and lowering premiums as ``wealth care.'' Well, there is an  irony in that; in that, No. 1, roughly half of the people paying the  IRS fines are making less than $25,000 a year. It is the Democrats who  are fining low-income people.   No. 2, do you know who agrees with the Democrats on this? The  insurance companies. Indeed, my friend from Oregon was reading from the  insurance companies. Why have the top 10 insurance companies had their  profits double? Because of the Democrats' mandate you have to buy their  products. Do you know where the Democrats and the insurance companies  agree? None of them want premiums to lower.   Of course, the insurance companies don't want more competition, more  options, and your premiums going down. They want to stick it to you as  much as they can. Sadly, I don't understand why, but the Democrats are  standing arm in arm with the insurance companies, saying their profits  need to increase even more. I don't know, maybe they cynically believe  eventually it will push it to single-payer socialized medicine. I don't  know why they do it, but what is wealth care is ObamaCare fattening the  insurance companies at the expense of working men and women.   Facts matter, and if our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle  want to raise accusations, they need to stay in the realm of reality  and deal with actual facts: You want lower premiums, you want more  choices, more options, more competition. You want higher premiums, you  want fewer choices, less options, less competition. That is what  ObamaCare does, and it is why millions of people are hurting and  frustrated. It is why today is an important day.   I yield back the remainder of my time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    Will the Senator from Oregon yield for a question?    Will the Senator from Oregon yield for a question?    Will the Senator from Oregon yield for a question?    Will the Senator from Oregon yield for a question?    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of applicable budget  resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections of that act and  applicable budget resolutions for purposes of amendment No. 270 and, if  adopted, for the provisions of the adopted amendment included in any  subsequent amendment to H.R. 1628 and any amendment between Houses or  conference report thereon, and I ask for the yeas and nays.
