 Madam President, I want to begin today with a  quotation:         Because this massive accumulation of debt was predicted,       because it was foreseeable, because it was unnecessary,       because it was the result of willful and reckless disregard       for the warnings that were given and for the fundamentals of       economic management, I am voting against the debt limit       increase.    Now, Madam President, that was then-Senator Joe Biden in March of  2006, right before every single Democratic Senator voted against  raising the debt limit and made a unified Republican government do it  alone.   Here is another quote:         Today's fiscal mess . . . is the inevitable outcome of       policies that consistently ignored evidence and experience.       My symbolic vote against raising the debt limit would have       been a protest of the policies that have brought us to this       point, and a demand that we change course.    Well, that same speaker, then-Senator Biden, 2 years earlier in 2004.   As Senate Republicans have made clear since last July and as I  reminded the President in a letter just this morning, his sentiments  then are our sentiments now. His sentiments then are our sentiments  now.   For the last few weeks, Washington Democrats tried to forget that  they lined up to oppose debt limit increases during unified Republican  government. They pretended these votes are always bipartisan. Well,  that was simply not true.   So now our colleagues have moved on to yet another new argument that  is equally flimsy. Now they claim they would be perfectly happy to  handle this responsibility with 51 votes done one way, but they would  rather risk the Nation's credit than doing it with 51 votes a slightly  different way--two different ways to achieve 51 votes. I am not  kidding. This is the position they are taking. The President said it  today.   The reconciliation procedure would be slightly more inconvenient,  they said--a few more days, a few more votes they would rather duck.  The Democratic leaders running America are saying with a straight face  that the entire U.S. economy should live or die based on the procedural  convenience--convenience--of Washington Democrats.   Now, they have got no problem using the party-line process over and  over and over to spend trillions and transform the country, but now,  for this purpose only, they suddenly and mysteriously find it  unappealing.   Democrats could not be more capable of handling this on their own.  Just months ago, the Democratic leader won new powers to reuse  reconciliation over and over. They don't even need our consent to set a  vote at 51 instead of 60. They need even less help raising the debt  limit than majorities needed in the past. So trust me, Madam  President--if Republicans were sitting on a hidden veto power to stop  reconciliation bills, you would have heard about it way back in the  springtime. The majority doesn't need our votes. They just want a  bipartisan shortcut around procedural hurdles that they can actually  clear on their own, and they want that shortcut so they can pivot right  back to partisan spending as fast as possible. They want a bipartisan  shortcut to get right back to more partisan hardball. And Republicans  have spent 2\1/2\ months--this is no surprise; 2\1/2\ months ago-- explaining that this is the way they needed to go forward on the debt  ceiling.   This unified Democratic government is having trouble governing. They  couldn't even pass the bipartisan infrastructure bill which the  President negotiated and the Speaker of the House promised would pass  last week.   The majority needs to stop sleepwalking toward yet another  preventable crisis. Democrats need to tackle the debt limit. We gave  them a roadmap and 3 months' notice. I suggest that our colleagues get  moving.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on an obviously related matter,  speaking of Democrats' reckless taxing and spending, this unified  government is behind closed doors brainstorming ways to make inflation  even more painful for American families. Their next reckless taxing- and-spending spree is packed with radical, leftwing policies and the  biggest tax hike on the American people in half a century.   So far, the bill is more than 2,400 pages long, but it can be  summarized in just four words: hurts families and helps China. Hurts  families and helps China.   Wasting trillions and trillions of dollars on socialism would be a  bad idea any day, but it is a uniquely bad idea at a time when American  families are already being hammered by inflation and soaring costs.   The government's own data continue to indicate that the historic and  painful inflation that began to take hold of our economy this spring  isn't going anywhere anytime soon. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve  acknowledged last week that rising prices have become an increasingly  broad and structural problem. Last week, the Commerce Department  reported that inflation has continued to rise faster than at any time  since 1991. The Democrats' inflation is so bad that even though the  average American worker has gotten a multiple-percentage-point pay  raise over the last year, their actual purchasing power has actually  been cut. Their paychecks have gone up, but their buying power has gone  down.   Wholesale inflation just marked the steepest 12-month jump on record.  Even dollar stores are having to raise their prices. Just ask any  American family about the last few trips to the supermarket, the gas  station, or the toy store. Heaven forbid if they have had to  participate in the housing market or the auto market anytime lately.  [[Page S6882]]  And the Democrats are uniting around yet another multitrillion-dollar  taxing-and-spending spree? I guess our colleagues think they can  inflate their way out of inflation. That is going to be an  extraordinarily painful experiment for the middle-class families of our  country.                            ____________________
