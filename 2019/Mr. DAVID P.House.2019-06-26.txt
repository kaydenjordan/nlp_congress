 ROE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute.)    ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, today our bipartisan  group led by Dr. Ruiz is introducing Protecting People from Surprise  Medical Bills Act.   This commonsense piece of legislation will give patients peace of  mind that an unexpected medical bill will not leave them in financial  ruin, while setting up a fair, neutral process to resolve billing  disputes between insurers and providers or hospitals.   For far too long, costly unexpected medical bills have caused  financial stress, negatively impacting patients and their families all  across the Nation. That is why our bill bans the practice of billing  patients for unanticipated out-of-network care. It is not fair.   The patients may be incapacitated in an emergency or may have  selected a facility that they believe is in network, to be met with a  costly medical bill, all because one provider was out of network.   Similarly, providers are between a rock and a hard place because a  Federal law called EMTALA requires them to provide care regardless of  their ability to pay. Our bill resolves this by setting up a baseball- style arbitration between the medical provider and the insurer to  compensate providers for care.   A similar New York State law has been proven successful with out-of- pocket billing records declining by 34 percent after 3 years.   It is time that all States have these protections. I urge support for  this approach.                            ____________________
