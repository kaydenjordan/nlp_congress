 Mr. Speaker, due to a long-standing family commitment, I  was unable to be recorded for votes today. Had I been present, I would  have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 208, ``nay`` on rollcall No. 209,  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 210, ``nay'' on rollcall No. 211 and ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 212.                            ____________________
