 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following  exchange of letters:           House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on             Intelligence,                                 Washington, DC, September 8, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, House Committee on Homeland Security, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: I understand H.R. 2453, 2468, and       2470 are slated for consideration on the suspension calendar       next week. All three bills amend the Homeland Security Act of       2002 to make certain improvements in the laws administered by       the Secretary of Homeland Security by requiring the       Secretary, acting through the Chief Intelligence Officer of       the Department, to perform specific intelligence-related       functions. All three  [[Page H7235]]       bills are virtually identical to specific provisions       contained in H.R. 2825, the House-passed ``Department of       Homeland Security Authorization Act of 2017'' for which I       wrote to you about on June 27, 2017. Accordingly, since H.R.       2453, 2468, and 2470 implicate National Intelligence Program       (NIP)-funded activities, I expect that they would be       sequentially referred to the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence (the Committee).        As discussed in previous correspondence regarding H.R.       2825, we signed a Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security and exchanged letters on       January 11, 2017 (January 2017 Exchange of Letter), to       clarify the Committee's exclusive jurisdiction over NIP-      funded elements of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).       The January 2017 Exchange of Letters affirmed that,       consistent with the Rules of the House of Representatives,       the Intelligence Authorization Act (IAA) is the vehicle that       through which Congress authorizes annual appropriations for       the NIP, including NIP-funded elements of the Department of       Homeland Security (DHS). Moreover, those letters made       explicit that the Committee on Homeland Security would not       report to the House any bill that authorizes any elements of       DHS funded through the NIP, and that if any such bill is       reported by the Committee on Homeland Security, this       Committee will request a sequential referral of the bill.        In order to expedite the House's consideration of H.R.       2453, 2468, and 2470, the Committee will forego consideration       of all three measures. This courtesy, is however, conditioned       on our mutual understanding and agreement that it will in no       way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee with       respect to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject       matter contained in these bills or any similar measure. It is       also conditioned on the Committee on Homeland Security's       adherence to the agreement embodied in the January 2017       Exchange of Letters.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding and would request that you include in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of all three       bills, a copy of this letter, your response, and the January       2017 Exchange of Letters, including the Memorandum. Thank you       for your cooperation in this matter.            Best Regards,                                                       Devin Nunes,                                                          Chairman.        Enclosure.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                   Washington, DC, January 11, 2017.      Hon. Devin Nunes,      Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence,      U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nunes: Thank you for your letter supporting       the Committee on Homeland Security's plans to conduct a       comprehensive reauthorization of the Department of Homeland       Security (``the Department'') in the 115th Congress, as       expressed in the 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of       the Department of Homeland Security.''        I appreciate your willingness to help ensure the Department       is fully authorized, and recognize that there may be areas of       jurisdictional interest to the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence (``Intelligence Committee'') in such an       authorization. Rule X(j)(3) of the House of Representatives       grants the Committee on Homeland Security jurisdiction over       the ``functions of the Department of Homeland Security,''       including those functions related to the ``integration,       analysis, and dissemination of homeland security       information,'' while Rule X(11)(b)(1) grants the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence jurisdiction over ``proposed       legislation . . . relating to . . . the National Intelligence       Program as defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security       Act'' and ``[a]uthorizations for appropriations, both direct       and indirect, for . . . the National Intelligence Program as       defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security Act;''        The Committee on Homeland Security does not intend to       authorize any elements of the Department that are funded       through the National Intelligence Program (``NIP'') as part       of the Department authorization bill it reports to the House       this Congress, although we both agree that the reported bill       may include Department-wide provisions that could affect       Department elements that happen to receive funding through       the NIP. Accordingly, I will oppose as nongermaine any       amendments which may be offered in my committee's markup       related to the NIP-funded elements of the Department. I       further agree to consult you before taking any action on       similar amendments which may be offered during consideration       of the bill by the full House.        In the interest of ensuring the most robust Department       authorization possible, we further agree that you may offer       an amendment during consideration of the bill in the full       House. That amendment will contain the text of any       legislative provisions related to the NIP-funded elements of       DHS previously reported by the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence. If the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence has not reported any provisions related to the       NIP-funded elements of DHS, you will not offer an amendment.       Understanding, however, that both of our committees have a       jurisdictional interest in the Department's Office of       Intelligence and Analysis, we agree to work together to       ensure that the Office receives the most effective       congressional guidance.        Finally, I reiterate my intention that nothing included in       the 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security'' alters the jurisdiction of       either the Committee on Homeland Security or the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence. The Committee on Homeland       Security appreciates the past success we have enjoyed working       with the Intelligence Committee. I am grateful for your       support and look forward to continuing to work together       toward our mutual goal of ensuring that the Department and       its components are authorized on a regular basis.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on             Intelligence,                                  Washington, DC, January 11, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: In accordance with paragraph 10 of       the January 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security,'' I write to confirm our       mutual understanding of the procedure through which the House       will authorize the elements of the Department of Homeland       Security (DHS) funded through the National Intelligence       Program (NIP).        I appreciate your dedication to producing a comprehensive       reauthorization of DHS that will improve congressional       oversight of the Department. As you know, Rule X(11)(b)(1) of       the House of Representatives grants the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence sole jurisdiction over ``proposed       legislation . . . relating to . . . the National Intelligence       Program as defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security       Act'' and ``[a]uthorizations for appropriations, both direct       and indirect, for . . . the National Intelligence Program as       defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security Act;'' and       Rule X (j)(3) of the House of Representatives grants the       Committee on Homeland Security jurisdiction over the       ``functions of the Department of Homeland Security,''       including those functions related to the ``integration,       analysis, and dissemination of homeland security       information.''        As you also know, the Intelligence Authorization Act (IAA)       is the annual vehicle through which Congress authorizes       appropriations for the NIP, including for elements of DHS       that receive funding through the NIP. The IAA includes a       classified schedule of authorizations, incorporated into the       statute by reference, and direction and recommendations in a       classified annex to the report of the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence. Nothing in the January 2017       ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the Department of       Homeland Security,'' shall be construed to grant the       Committee on Homeland Security jurisdiction over proposed       legislation relating to the NIP or authorizations for       appropriations for the NIP.        In keeping with these principles, the Committee on Homeland       Security will not report to the House any bill that       authorizes any elements of DHS funded through the NIP. If any       such bill is reported by the Committee on Homeland Security,       the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence will request a       sequential referral of the bill. Understanding, however, that       both of our committees have a jurisdictional interest in the       Department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis, we agree to       work together to ensure that the Office receives the most       effective congressional guidance.        We further agree that if the Committee on Homeland Security       reports a DHS-wide authorization bill to the House, I may       offer an amendment during consideration of the bill in the       full House. That amendment will contain the text of any       legislative provisions related to the NIP-funded elements of       DHS previously reported by the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence. If the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence has not reported any provisions related to the       NIP-funded elements of DHS, I will not offer an amendment,       and the DHS-wide authorization bill will not contain any       provisions related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS. We       further agree that you will oppose as nongermanc all       amendments related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS in       markup in the Committee on Homeland Security. If any       amendments related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS are       subsequently offered during consideration by the full House,       you agree to consult with me before taking action.        Finally, we agree that you will support the appointment of       the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence to any committee of conference on a       DHS-wide authorization bill that includes any provisions       related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS.        In accordance with Rule X(11)(b)(2) this understanding does       not preclude either the Committee on Homeland Security or the       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence from authorizing       other intelligence and intelligence-related activities of       DHS, including, but not limited to, the Homeland Security       Intelligence Program. In keeping with paragraph 5 of the       January 2017 `Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security,'' our committees will work       jointly to vet and clear any provisions of a DHS       authorization bill  [[Page H7236]]       related to these other intelligence and intelligence-related       activities of DHS. Furthermore, I hope the staff of our       committees can continue to closely and expeditiously to       conduct rigorous oversight of intelligence activities       throughout DHS.        The understanding detailed by this letter is limited to the       115th Congress, It shall not constitute an understanding       between our committees in any subsequent congress.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding. I look forward to working with you to       continue congressional oversight of DHS intelligence       activities, and I thank you in advance for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                       Devin Nunes,                                                          Chairman.

I appreciate your willingness to help ensure the Department       is fully authorized, and recognize that there may be areas of       jurisdictional interest to the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence (``Intelligence Committee'') in such an       authorization. Rule X(j)(3) of the House of Representatives       grants the Committee on Homeland Security jurisdiction over       the ``functions of the Department of Homeland Security,''       including those functions related to the ``integration,       analysis, and dissemination of homeland security       information,'' while Rule X(11)(b)(1) grants the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence jurisdiction over ``proposed       legislation . . . relating to . . . the National Intelligence       Program as defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security       Act'' and ``[a]uthorizations for appropriations, both direct       and indirect, for . . . the National Intelligence Program as       defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security Act;''        The Committee on Homeland Security does not intend to       authorize any elements of the Department that are funded       through the National Intelligence Program (``NIP'') as part       of the Department authorization bill it reports to the House       this Congress, although  [[Page H7240]]       we both agree that the reported bill may include Department-      wide provisions that could affect Department elements that       happen to receive funding through the NIP. Accordingly, I       will oppose as nongermane any amendments which may be offered       in my committee's markup related to the NIP-funded elements       of the Department. I further agree to consult you before       taking any action on similar amendments which may be offered       during consideration of the bill by the full House.        In the interest of ensuring the most robust Department       authorization possible, we further agree that you may offer       an amendment during consideration of the bill in the full       House. That amendment will contain the text of any       legislative provisions related to the NIP-funded elements of       DHS previously reported by the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence. If the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence has not reported any provisions related to the       NIP-funded elements of DHS, you will not offer an amendment,       Understanding, however, that both of our committees have a       jurisdictional interest in the Department's Office of       Intelligence and Analysis, we agree to work together to       ensure that the Office receives the most effective       congressional guidance.        Finally, I reiterate my intention that nothing included in       the 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security'' alters the jurisdiction of       either the Committee on Homeland Security or the Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence. The Committee on Homeland       Security appreciates the past success we have enjoyed working       with the Intelligence Committee. I am grateful for your       support and look forward to continuing to work together       toward our mutual goal of ensuring that the Department and       its components are authorized on a regular basis.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on             Intelligence,                                  Washington, DC, January 11, 2017.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: In accordance with paragraph 10 of       the January 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security,'' I write to confirm our       mutual understanding of the procedure through which the House       will authorize the elements of the Department of Homeland       Security (DHS) funded through the National Intelligence       Program (NIP).        I appreciate your dedication to producing a comprehensive       reauthorization of DHS that will improve congressional       oversight of the Department. As you know, Rule X(11)(b)(1) of       the House of Representatives grants the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence sole jurisdiction over ``proposed       legislation . . . relating to . . . the National Intelligence       Program as defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security       Act'' and [a]uthorizations for appropriations, both direct       and indirect, for . . . the National Intelligence Program as       defined in Section 3(6) of the National Security Act;'' and       Rule X(j)(3) of the House of Representatives grants the       Committee on Homeland Security jurisdiction over the       ``functions of the Department of Homeland Security,''       including those functions related to the ``integration,       analysis, and dissemination of homeland security       information.''        As you also know, the Intelligence Authorization Act (IAA)       is the annual vehicle through which Congress authorizes       appropriations for the NIP, including for elements of DHS       that receive funding through the NIP. The IAA includes a       classified schedule of authorizations, incorporated into the       statute by reference, and direction and recommendations in a       classified annex to the report of the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence. Nothing in the January 2017       ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the Department of       Homeland Security,'' shall be construed to grant the       Committee on Homeland Security jurisdiction over proposed       legislation relating to the NIP or authorizations for       appropriations for the NIP.        In keeping with these principles, the Committee on Homeland       Security will not report to the House any bill that       authorizes any elements of DHS funded through the NIP. If any       such bill is reported by the Committee on Homeland Security,       the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence will request a       sequential referral of the bill. Understanding, however, that       both of our committees have a jurisdictional interest in the       Department's Office of Intelligence and Analysis, we agree to       work together to ensure that the Office receives the most       effective congressional guidance.        We further agree that if the Committee on Homeland Security       reports a DHS-wide authorization bill to the House, I may       offer an amendment during consideration of the bill in the       full House. That amendment will contain the text of any       legislative provisions related to the NIP-funded elements of       DHS previously reported by the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence. If the Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence has not reported any provisions related to the       NIP-funded elements of DHS, I will not offer an amendment,       and the DHS-wide authorization bill will not contain any       provisions related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS. We       further agree that you will oppose as nongermane all       amendments related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS in       markup in the Committee on Homeland Security. If any       amendments related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS are       subsequently offered during consideration by the full House,       you agree to consult with me before taking action.        Finally, we agree that you will support the appointment of       the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence to any committee of conference on a       DHS-wide authorization bill that includes any provisions       related to the NIP-funded elements of DHS.        In accordance with Rule X(11)(b)(2) this understanding does       not preclude either the Committee on Homeland Security or the       Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence from authorizing       other intelligence and intelligence-related activities of       DHS, including, but not limited to, the Homeland Security       Intelligence Program. In keeping with paragraph 5 of the       January 2017 ``Memorandum Regarding Authorization of the       Department of Homeland Security,'' our committees will work       jointly to vet and clear any provisions of a DHS       authorization bill related to these other intelligence and       intelligence-related activities of DHS. Furthermore, I hope       the staff of our committees can continue to closely and       expeditiously to conduct rigorous oversight of intelligence       activities throughout DHS.        The understanding detailed by this letter is limited to the       115th Congress. It shall not constitute an understanding       between our committees in any subsequent congress.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding. I look forward to working with you to       continue congressional oversight of DHS intelligence       activities, and I thank you in advance for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                       Devin Nunes,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2468) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish a  homeland intelligence doctrine for the Department of Homeland Security,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2468         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Unifying DHS Intelligence       Enterprise Act''.       SEC. 2. HOMELAND INTELLIGENCE DOCTRINE.         (a) In General.--Subtitle A of title II of the Homeland       Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 121 et seq.) is amended by       adding at the end the following new section:       ``SEC. 210G. HOMELAND INTELLIGENCE DOCTRINE.         ``(a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date       of the enactment of this section, the Secretary, acting       through the Chief Intelligence Officer of the Department, in       coordination with intelligence components of the Department,       the Office of the General Counsel, the Privacy Office, and       the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, shall       develop and disseminate written Department-wide guidance for       the processing, analysis, production, and dissemination of       homeland security information (as such term is defined in       section 892) and terrorism information (as such term is       defined in section 1016 of the Intelligence Reform and       Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (6 U.S.C. 485)).        ``(b) Contents.--The guidance required under subsection (a)       shall, at a minimum, include the following:        ``(1) A description of guiding principles and purposes of       the Department's intelligence enterprise.        ``(2) A summary of the roles and responsibilities of each       intelligence component of the Department and programs of the       intelligence components of the Department in the processing,       analysis, production, or dissemination of homeland security       information and terrorism information, including relevant       authorities and restrictions applicable to each intelligence       component of the Department and programs of each such       intelligence component.        ``(3) Guidance for the processing, analysis, and production       of such information.        ``(4) Guidance for the dissemination of such information,       including within the Department, among and between Federal       departments and agencies, among and between State, local,       tribal, and territorial governments, including law       enforcement, and with foreign partners and the private       sector.        ``(5) An assessment and description of how the       dissemination to the intelligence community (as such term is       defined in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947       (50 U.S.C. 3003(4))) and Federal law enforcement of homeland       security information and terrorism information assists such       entities in carrying out their respective missions.        ``(c) Form.--The guidance required under subsection (a)       shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a       classified annex.        ``(d) Annual Review.--For each of the five fiscal years       beginning with the fiscal year that begins after the date of       the enactment of this section, the Secretary shall conduct a       review of the guidance required under subsection (a) and, as       appropriate, revise such guidance.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 210F the       following new item:  ``Sec. 210G. Homeland intelligence doctrine.''.       SEC. 3. ANALYSTS FOR THE CHIEF INTELLIGENCE OFFICER.         Paragraph (1) of section 201(e) of the Homeland Security       Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 121(e)) is amended by adding at the end       the following new sentence: ``The Secretary shall also       provide the Chief Intelligence Officer with a staff having       appropriate expertise and experience to assist the Chief       Intelligence Officer.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, 16 years ago, an unprecedented attack against the United  States revealed immense gaps in how the United States approached  domestic security and information sharing. As a result, the Department  of Homeland Security was established to consolidate 22 existing Federal  agencies and reshape the domestic intelligence and counterterrorism  structure in the United States.   Over the years, DHS has matured and refined its Intelligence  Enterprise, or what we know as DHS IE. Even now, however, the  Department has struggled to fully unify the various intelligence  offices within the component agencies. This has limited the value DHS  provides to the intelligence community and its State and local  partners. Disparate guidance for the intelligence components within DHS  undermines the Department's ability to fully utilize important data and  conduct analysis.   DHS needs to follow the model of many other members of the  intelligence community and produce an intelligence doctrine that  clearly articulates roles and priorities across the DHS Intelligence  Enterprise. The lack of this internal structure reflects a painful  legacy from the pre-9/11 era in which bureaucracies operated as silos  and were poorly coordinated.   H.R. 2468 empowers DHS to address this continued failure. By  requiring the Department to produce guidance to all its components on  the processing, analysis, production, and dissemination of information  and intelligence, this bill helps to professionalize the DHS  Intelligence Enterprise. Such a doctrine will guide how operational  information from across DHS is incorporated into a wider strategic  Homeland Security picture. This will increase the use of Department- specific information in its analytic products and processes.   H.R. 2468 also takes another step in strengthening the Department's  Intelligence Enterprise by formalizing the Department's existing  support for the DHS Chief Intelligence Officer, or the CINT. Though the  Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis, or the I&A, serves as  the Department's Chief Intelligence Officer, these two roles carry  different statutory authorities and distinct missions.   Therefore, Congress should support both functions by authorizing  staff support for the CINT. H.R. 2468 does not authorize new hiring  but, rather, reauthorizes the Department's existing staff assignment  and, most importantly, makes those assignments permanent.   It is now time to hold the Department accountable for developing a  common foundation among members of the Department's Intelligence  Enterprise. By requiring DHS to produce these guidelines and by  ensuring the Department's leadership is properly and reliably  supported, H.R. 2468 helps us to work to fulfill the promises made to  the American people 16 years ago: Never again.   I am very pleased the text of H.R. 2468 was included in the larger  DHS authorization bill, which passed this very House in July. I urge my  colleagues to support the standalone measure to improve the quality of  DHS' analytical  [[Page H7242]]  products and help the Department better serve the intelligence  community and its State and local partners.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2468, the Unifying DHS  Intelligence Enterprise Act of 2017, and I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this measure seeks to help safeguard our Nation's  homeland security information. Specifically, it requires the Department  of Homeland Security to develop and distribute Departmentwide guidance  on the proper procedures for handling and sharing information related  to homeland security and terrorism.   The 9/11 Commission Report found that the U.S. Government did not  fully share or pool intelligence information prior to the attacks. In  response, policies and procedures were reformed at all levels to ensure  that critical national security information is properly shared.   Intelligence sharing is critical to terrorism prevention, but it must  be carried out in a manner that ensures that sensitive information is  properly handled and distributed. H.R. 2468 seeks to do just that.   The bill requires the establishment of rules and regulations for the  dissemination of such information both within DHS and with homeland  security stakeholders at the State and local levels as well as in the  private sector.   I urge my House colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2468 has strong support on both sides of the aisle.  Effective security measures to improve our intelligence systems and  mechanisms are critical to the mission of protecting the homeland.   I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry) for his work on  this important legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to support  it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 2468, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2433) to direct the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for  Intelligence and Analysis to develop and disseminate a threat  assessment regarding terrorist use of virtual currency.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2433         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Security Assessment       of Terrorists Use of Virtual Currencies Act''.       SEC. 2. THREAT ASSESSMENT ON TERRORIST USE OF VIRTUAL                     CURRENCY.         (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary of Homeland       Security for Intelligence and Analysis, as authorized by       section 201(b)(1) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6       U.S.C. 121), shall, in coordination with appropriate Federal       partners, develop and disseminate a threat assessment       regarding the actual and potential threat posed by       individuals using virtual currency to carry out activities in       furtherance of an act of terrorism, including the provision       of material support or resources to a foreign terrorist       organization. Consistent with the protection of classified       and confidential unclassified information, the Under       Secretary shall share the threat assessment developed under       this section with State, local, and tribal law enforcement       officials, including officials that operate within State,       local, and regional fusion centers through the Department of       Homeland Security State, Local, and Regional Fusion Center       Initiative established in section 210A of the Homeland       Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 124h).        (b) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) The term ``foreign terrorist organization'' means an       organization designated as a foreign terrorist organization       under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8       U.S.C. 1189).        (2) The term ``virtual currency'' means a digital       representation of value that functions as a medium of       exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and  include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Homeland Security Assessment of Terrorists Use of  Virtual Currencies Act introduced by the gentlewoman from New York  (Miss Rice) is an important measure targeting new ways terrorists may  be raising or transferring funds through the use of virtual currencies.   The bill directs the DHS Under Secretary for Intelligence and  Analysis, in coordination with Federal partners, to develop and  disseminate a threat assessment regarding the actual and potential  threat posed by individuals using virtual currency to carry out  activities in furtherance of an act of terrorism, including the  provision of material support or resources to a foreign terrorist  organization. It also directs the Under Secretary to share this threat  assessment with State, local, and Tribal law enforcement officials  through the National Network of Fusion Centers.   As the threat of terrorism evolves, so do the methods to finance and  support the actors who plot to attack the United States. The Federal  Government must evolve as well to meet these novel and technologically- based challenges. This bill positions the Department to detect the new  digital-based methods in terrorist financing and support methods that  have already been utilized and to prepare for those that are soon to  follow.   This measure was considered by the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism  and Intelligence and included in the Committee on Homeland Security's  DHS authorization bill, which passed this very House in July.   I want to take time to thank the gentlewoman for her work and for her  diligence on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support her bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my legislation, H.R. 2433, the  Homeland Security Assessment of Terrorists Use of Virtual Currencies  Act.   Yesterday marked 16 years since the September 11 attacks when 19  terrorists hijacked four passenger planes, two of which struck the  World Trade Center towers in my home State of New York.   In the 16 years since the deadliest terrorist attack in American  history, the United States has led the global campaign to combat  terrorism, thwarting plots and preventing attacks on American soil,  identifying and disrupting terrorist networks around the world, hunting  down terrorists wherever they hide, and proving that they can and will  be brought to justice.   We know that the threat of terrorism is not the same as it was 16  years ago. It is a threat that constantly evolves, and we need to  evolve ahead of it. That is why I introduced H.R. 2433.   In recent years, we have seen instances in which members of some  terrorist groups have turned to virtual currencies to support  themselves and fund their operations. Last year, the Foundation for  Defense of Democracies investigated a terrorist funding campaign in  which a terrorist group in the Gaza Strip received donations to the  virtual currency bitcoin. Earlier this year, Indonesian authorities  reported that a Syria-based Indonesian with ties  [[Page H7243]]  to ISIL used virtual currency to fund attacks in Indonesia.   Virtual currencies offer high-speed and low-cost networks and access  to users all over the world, which creates significant potential appeal  to terrorists, particularly lone-wolf attackers because of the nominal  cost often associated with carrying out that type of attack.   Research suggests that terrorists' use of virtual currencies have so  far been limited to a handful of instances, two of which I have  mentioned. But with groups like ISIL becoming more technologically  sophisticated and virtual currencies becoming more widely accessible,  the table is set for this threat to grow significantly in a very short  time. That is why it is critical that we act now to assess and  understand this emerging threat.   My bill requires DHS' Office of Intelligence and Analysis to develop  and disseminate a threat assessment of the use of virtual currencies to  support terrorist activities. Further, to ensure that this information  is shared throughout the law enforcement community, my bill requires  the assessment to be shared with State, local, and Tribal law  enforcement, including those offices that operate within State, local,  and regional fusion centers.   Enacting this bill will give counterterrorism and law enforcement  officials at all levels the information they need to evolve ahead of  this threat and help keep Americans safe. I urge my House colleagues to  support my bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, my friend from New York has done an excellent  job in outlining, explaining, and articulating her legislation;  therefore, I have no other speakers. If the gentlewoman from New York  (Miss Rice), has no other speakers, I reserve the balance of my time to  close.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2433 is an important piece of legislation that  received overwhelming bipartisan support in the Committee on Homeland  Security. Enactment of H.R. 2433 will ensure that the Department of  Homeland Security closely monitors this evolving threat so that we are  prepared to prevent terrorists from using virtual currencies to finance  attacks on the U.S. and around the world. I encourage my colleagues to  support my legislation, H.R. 2433.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support a  good, well thought-out, meaningful, and useful bill, H.R. 2433.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
