 Mr. President, today I am proud to recognize in  the Record, Disabled American Veterans, DAV, executive director Garry  J. Augustine, who has a long record of service to our Nation's  veterans.   Mr. Augustine has not only dedicated his life to serving veterans, he  is a veteran himself. He served in the U.S. Army, enlisting after high  school graduation in 1969. Mr. Augustine served as a member of the  198th Infantry Brigade in South Vietnam, where he was seriously injured  by a land mine explosion. After spending 18 months at Walter Reed Army  Medical Center recovering from his injuries, Mr. Augustine was  medically discharged from the U.S. Army in 1972.   Mr. Augustine has been a member of DAV for 46 years, and he has  worked for DAV for the past 30 years. His first job with DAV was in  1988 as a hospital service coordinator for the Department of Ohio at  the Cleveland Wade Park U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, VA,  Hospital. Mr. Augustine has held numerous positions working on behalf  of veterans during his three decades with DAV. He has served as  executive director since 2013.   Under Mr. Augustine's leadership, DAV has been a partner with  Congress, including with the committee I have the honor of chairing,  the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, in accomplishing significant  reforms for veterans. This includes overhauling VA's system of  providing decisions to veterans on their disability claims appeals and  improving VA's ability to provide community care. The John S. McCain  III, Daniel K Akaka, and Samuel R. Johnson VA Maintaining Internal  Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks (MISSION) Act of  2018, enacted in June 2018, strengthened healthcare for veterans and  expanded VA's Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers  to include veterans of all eras. DAV's initiatives, led by Mr.  Augustine, have raised awareness for important issues such as caregiver  support, care and benefits specifically related to women veterans, and  advance appropriations for VA accounts.   Today, I pay tribute to Mr. Augustine for his service to our country  and his steadfast commitment to veterans throughout his career.  Congratulations to Mr. Augustine on his retirement and a career in  which he has left a lasting legacy of advocacy for veterans.   Mr. President, today I am proud and honored to  place in the Record well-deserved recognition and heartfelt  congratulations to Jerry Giovaniello on his retirement from  [[Page S6962]]  nearly four decades of work for the National Association of Realtors.   Jerry Giovaniello has spent the last 37 years of his career  tirelessly advocating on behalf of the Realtors and ends his  illustrious career as senior vice president and chief lobbyist for the  organization.   As a Realtor, I understand the important work the National  Association of Realtors conducts on behalf of its many members  nationwide who provide the needed service of helping prospective  homebuyers achieve the American dream of homeownership.   Jerry's distinguished career has resulted in positive steps for more  Americans by helping create and advocate for policies that have kept  the housing market affordable, helped it remain a good investment, and  kept it afloat during hard times.   Jerry has been named a top lobbyist multiple times by CEO Update, The  Hill, and others, and he has at least twice been identified as among  the most influential in real estate.   I close in congratulating Jerry Giovaniello on his success, and I  thank and applaud him for his hard work, which has made a difference to  countless Americans, helped our job market, and earned him a reputation  of success that will be difficult to match in the industry.   Jerry, I wish you nothing but the best in your retirement.                            ____________________
