 Madam President.    Madam President, I would like to thank my colleague from  New York for her work to move this issue forward. But once again, I  would object to the request for the reasons I have previously stated.   In addition, today the ranking member of the committee, Senator  Inhofe, released the written views of each member of the Joint Chiefs  of Staff, which he had requested on Senator Gillibrand's proposed  legislation.   I understand that some in our body might discount these views of  senior military leadership, and that is their prerogative. But I do  believe it is important that their voices be part of the public  discourse. They have dedicated their lives to the service of this  Nation. They have led troops in combat. They have experienced all of  the issues that face commanders and face subordinates. They have a  unique, I think, position within the system. In addition, the military  will have to implement whatever system Congress devises, and it will  require their expertise and skill.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record a letter from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to  Senator Inhofe   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                        Chairman of the Joint Chiefs                                                        of Staff,                                                     Washington, DC.      Hon. James M. Inhofe,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Inhofe: Thank you for your continued support       and sincere interest in assessing the impact of proposed       legislation on the Armed Forces. As I understand the scope of       the ``Military Justice Improvement and Increasing Prevention       Act of 2021,'' the draft bill would remove the commander from       decisions for all non-military offenses and felony cases       punishable by one year or more, including the following:       prohibited activities with military recruits or trainees by a       person in position of special trust: wrongful broadcast or       distribution of intimate visual images: murder; manslaughter:       death or injury of an unborn child; child endangerment; rape       and sexual assault; mails: deposit of obscene matter; rape       and sexual assault of a child; other sexual misconduct;       larceny and wrongful appropriation; fraudulent use or credit       cards, debit cards, and other access devices; false pretenses       to obtain services; robbery; frauds against the United       States; bribery; graft; kidnapping; arson, burning properly       with intent to defraud; extortion; aggravated assault;       assault with intent to commit murder, voluntary manslaughter,       rape, sexual assault, rape of a child, sexual assault of a       child, robbery, arson, burglary, or kidnapping; maiming;       domestic violence; stalking; perjury; subordination of       perjury; obstructing justice; misprision or serious offense;       wrongful refusal to testify; prevention or authorized seizure       of property; noncompliance with procedural rules; wrongful       interference with adverse administrative proceeding; and       retaliation,        The Uniform Code of Military Justice exists to provide       justice and to maintain good order and discipline, both of       which directly contribute to unit cohesion and U.S. military       effectiveness in combat. The military is unique in that       commanders must maintain good order and discipline in order       to successfully perform on the battlefield under the most       intense of circumstances. Commanders' orders must have the       force or law, and all within his or her unit must acknowledge       this authority. With this responsibility to enforce the rule       of law comes accountability.        It is my professional opinion that removing commanders from       prosecution decisions, process, and accountability may have       an adverse effect on readiness, mission accomplishment, good       order and discipline, justice, unit cohesion, trust, and       loyalty between commanders and those they lead. However, in       the specific and limited circumstance of sexual assault, I       remain open-minded to all solutions. This is a complex and       difficult issue. I urge caution to ensure any changes to       commander authority to enforce discipline be rigorously       analyzed, evidence-based, and narrow in scope, limited only       to sexual assault and related offenses.        As I am sure you are aware, the Secretary of Defense       established the Independent Review Commission on Sexual       Assault in the Military on February 26, 2021, chartered to       address the multiple aspects and factors of this issue. It is       my belief we have not made sufficient progress in recent       years to eliminate sexual assault, and we have consequently       lost the trust and confidence of many Soldiers, Sailors,       Airmen, Marines, and Guardians in the chain of command's       ability to adjudicate these serious crimes. I intend to       reserve judgement until I have an opportunity to review the       final recommendations of the Independent Review Commission to       determine the merits of any such recommendations vis-a-vis       proposed legislation currently in the Senate and House of       Representatives.        I remain committed to providing you my candid personal       views and will do so after I have reviewed the       recommendations of the Commission. I look forward to       providing you my personal assessment on this matter in the       near future.            Sincerely,                                                    Mark A. Milley,                                                General, U.S. Army.     Madam President, I won't quote from this letter at length  now, but I would just point out that the Chiefs are open-minded about  changing the way we prosecute sexual assault and harassment within the  ranks. So am I. In fact, I think that is something that I hope becomes  clear in our progress legislatively moving forward. But they  nevertheless stress the importance of ensuring that any change Congress  enacts must be carefully tailored to address the problems we are trying  to solve, and the critical problem we are trying to solve is sexual  assault, sexual harassment, any kind of crime dealing with sexual  misconduct.   In addition, adequate time and resources must be afforded for  implementing any of the changes that we propose. The nature and the  magnitude of change we are contemplating here is complex; we have to  make sure we do this right.   Further, we have heard over the past few years from the leadership of  the military service Judge Advocate Generals' Corps, who have uniformly  opposed these changes in nature and scope. These are the military  lawyers, the very military justice experts to whom this bill would  invest authority currently reserved to commanders. I believe we should  listen to them as well and move prudently and deliberately to address  the problem at hand.   So, as I have said a number of times already, I intend to include the  administration's recommendations that derive from the President's  Independent Review Commission in the markup of the Defense bill,  subject to amendment, not to move the bill on the floor without the  chance for my colleagues in the committee to have their voices heard.  These ladies and gentlemen have dedicated themselves to military policy  for many years. They are experts in different dimensions of this issue,  and they will add significantly to the debate.   To simply take a bill and send to it the floor without amendments I  think is not the way to proceed. I anticipate a bill that will be  strengthened through debate and discussion and deliberation by the  committee.  [[Page S4690]]    With that, I would reiterate my objection to Senator Gillibrand's  request.    Mr. President, for the Committee on Armed Services I report  favorably the following nomination lists which were printed in the  Records on the dates indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save the  expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that these nominations  lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of Senators.
