 Madam Speaker, last night, the temperature  in my hometown of Altoona, Pennsylvania, was 28 degrees Fahrenheit.   As a harsh winter arrives, the Biden administration has failed to  address the skyrocketing heating prices that are set to affect people  across the entirety of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   In the past year, the price of fuel oil has risen 86 percent. This is  the direct result of President Biden's decision to implement Green New  Deal initiatives instead of using the energy that is under the feet of  my constituents, the coal, the oil, the Marcellus shale, and the  natural gas that are in Pennsylvania and that can help drive down the  prices this winter.   It is time to enact commonsense permitting reforms. It is time to  return to American energy dominance, instead of using taxpayer dollars  to subsidize windmills and solar panels that fail to produce the  baseload power that Americans want and, right now, facing winter, that  Americans need.                            ____________________
