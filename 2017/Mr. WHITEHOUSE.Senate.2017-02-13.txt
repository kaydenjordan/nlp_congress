 Mr. President, I, too, will be voting no on the  candidacy of Mr. Mnuchin to become Secretary of the Treasury.   Rhode Island got hit so hard by the mortgage meltdown that Wall  Street created. Frankly, I can never forget the Rhode Islanders who  lost their homes in the course of that debacle. We were able to help  some of them in my office.   As the Presiding Officer knows, when you come to the Senate, you put  together a constituent office, and your constituent people work on  usual constituent business. In the ordinary course, constituent  business is dealing with Federal agencies. It is making sure Social  Security is fine, getting people replacement passports that they put  into the laundry by accident, dealing with veterans issues and getting  veterans their benefits, helping people with Medicare and Medicaid  confusion. It is all generally involving people who have gotten somehow  fouled up in the Federal programs of which they are beneficiaries.   In our case, we had to open a constituent wing for dealing with the  big banks because they were foreclosing so recklessly and in such a  mercenary fashion on Rhode Islanders. It was such torture for Rhode  Islanders, once the foreclosure process began, because they could never  get the same person twice on the phone; there was always a mismatch  between what they were being told on the phone and being told on paper.  It was a nightmare of bad information and bad practice by these big  banks.   What we would often be able to do is to say: Look, at least give this  person one person they can deal with, that they can call every time so  it is not ``Hi, I am John'' on one phone call and  [[Page S1107]]  ``Hi, I am Mary'' on the next phone call and ``Hi, I am Joseph'' on the  third phone call and nobody ever remembers the other phone calls,  nobody ever knew where they were in the process. You can't move the  process forward if the person on the other end of the line can't keep  track of the conversation. So we were able to get that done, and that  actually was able to help Rhode Islanders come to a deal with these big  banks and save their homes. But for all the ones we were able to help,  there were many, many we were not.   I simply cannot forgive somebody who took a look at that banking  crisis, who took a look at the pain Wall Street sent in a wave across  all of America, and thought: Oh, here is a great new way to make  money--foreclosing on people.   Done. I am out. Sorry, I can't vote for somebody like that.   What I hope, though, is that he will at least show some common sense  and some decency when it comes to other issues, and one of them is  climate change.   If you go to the financial sector, they are taking climate change  pretty seriously. Frankly, the financial sector is probably about as  big as the fossil fuel industry, so when the fossil fuel industry comes  around bullying and shoving and lying and going through all of its  usual climate denial nonsense, the financial guys really don't care.  They just do their thing. You are not going to intimidate Goldman. You  are not going to intimidate BlackRock. You are not going to intimidate  Bank of America. It just doesn't make any sense. So when you look at  what these guys are saying, they are being pretty straight up about it.   As long ago as 2013, Goldman Sachs issued a report that said: ``The  window for thermal coal investment is closing.'' That is the caption of  the report. ``Thermal coal's current position atop the fuel mix for  global power generation will be gradually eroded,'' it said. And sure  enough, it has been. There was no grief for coal in there; they were  just trying to predict the market. In 2015, Goldman Sachs did another  report about the low-carbon economy. It was ``Goldman Sachs equity  investor's guide to a low carbon world, 2015-25.'' So unless somebody  is going to say that Goldman Sachs is in on the hoax, they are taking  this pretty seriously. From 2015 to 2025, they expect a low-carbon  world.   And it is coming on fast and furious now. Just recently, a global  task force was set up by the G20 companies--the 20 biggest economies in  the world. They have a group called the Task Force on Climate-related  Financial Disclosures. They have asked that companies begin to come  clean on the climate risk they face.   The news report about this says:         Concerns among the financial community are growing that       assets are being mispriced because the full extent of climate       risk is not being factored in, threatening market stability.    The story continues:         According to Barclays--    Barclays is a significant international banking institution--       the fossil fuel industry could lose $34 trillion in revenues       by 2040 as a global deal to limit temperature rise to well       below 2 degrees Celsius reduces demand for oil, coal, and       gas, returning reserves into stranded assets.    If, in fact, this is an industry that could lose $34 trillion in  revenues by 2040, that explains a lot of their misbehavior around  Congress. Obviously, for that kind of money, there is very little  mischief these folks wouldn't get up to, and sure enough, they are  getting up to all of that mischief, and more, around here. But the  financial industry itself is pretty big, and it doesn't care. It is not  going to be pushed around and bullied.   This Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure is described  as having 32 members from large banks, insurance companies, asset  management companies, pension funds, credit rating agencies, and  accounting and consulting firms--32 members representing the 20 biggest  economies in the world, and they are saying: Here it comes. Let's get  ready.   So I hope colleagues will begin to listen to these folks in the  financial services industry and these major market economies about what  is going on and stop listening to the self-serving nonsense that the  fossil fuel industry insists on trying to jam into our ears around  here. It just is bogus. Bottom line: It is bogus.   Most recently, at the end of last year, September 2016, BlackRock,  which is one of the most significant investment firms in the world--I  think it has more than $1 trillion in assets under management--issued  this new report: ``Adapting Portfolios to Climate Change.'' OK. So  BlackRock, one of the smartest and biggest companies in the world, is  now talking about how we have to adapt to climate change and helping  investors plan for it. In this building, can we have a sensible  conversation about climate change? No, of course not, because the  fossil fuel industry won't even let some of us mention the words, but  in the real world, where real money and real decisions are being made  by very smart people, they are all over this. Here is BlackRock:  ``Adapting Portfolios to Climate Change.''   Sentence No. 1 in the report: ``Investors can no longer ignore  climate change.''   Investors can no longer ignore climate change. No, it takes Congress  to do that. Investors can no longer ignore climate change, but don't  worry, we will, as long as we are following the lead of our fossil fuel  industry friends, right over the climate cliff.   The report continues that we can expect more frequent and severe  weather events over the long term--something that actually we are  seeing already, not only in the United States but around the world.  They say that there is a market failure in this area--a market  failure--as current fossil fuel prices arguably do not reflect the true  costs of their extraction and use.   That is what we are fighting about here. The fossil fuel industry has  the best racket going in the world. They are able to pollute like  crazy, do immense damage in the world--damage that coastal homeowners  in Rhode Island, fishermen in Rhode Island, people who have breathing  difficulties and are trying to breathe on a hot summer day in Rhode  Island--they all have to pay the price.   Under real market theory, the harm of the product has to be in the  price of the product for the market to work. That is market 101. Well,  they don't want to play by those rules. They want to have everybody  else cover the harm in their product, and they just get to shove it out  into the marketplace with the biggest subsidy in creation.   The International Monetary Fund is not a bunch of stupid people, and  the International Monetary Fund, as far as I can tell, has no conflict  of interest with respect to fossil fuel, unlike the fossil fuel  companies, which are one massive example of a conflict of interest. The  International Monetary Fund says that the subsidy to the fossil fuel  industry every year--just in the United States of America--is $700  billion--billion with a ``b.'' Like I said, how much mischief would  they get up to for $700 billion? Oh, about $700 billion worth.   Is there a fix to this? Yes, continues the BlackRock report. ``The  most cost-effective way for governments to meet emissions reduction  targets: Policy frameworks that result in realistic carbon pricing.''  Market 101. Of course, they don't want market 101, they want fossil  fuels subsidies 101, and we go along with it because of the mischievous  way they behave in politics. But we should not go along with it. It is  not proper economics. It is not conservative. It is nothing except  traditional, old-fashioned, special interests, special pleading. It is  no different from any other polluter who wants to be able to dump their  waste into the river or onto their neighbor's yard or wherever it is  rather than having to pay for cleaning up the mess they made.   We go on through the report: ``The world is rapidly using up its  carbon budget,'' says BlackRock. ``The damage from climate change could  shave 5 to 20 percent off global GDP annually by 2100.'' Up to a fifth  of global GDP gone. That is a massive economic correction. That is  massive economic pain.   ``The economic impacts,'' it goes on to say, ``are not just in the  distant future. More frequent and more intense extreme weather events,  such as hurricanes, flooding, and droughts, are already affecting  assets and economies.''   For anybody just tuning in, this is not me making this stuff up, this  is BlackRock investments.   They talk about global fossil fuel subsidies--four times as large,  they say, as renewable energy support.  [[Page S1108]]    Here is an interesting thing: ``Scrapping energy subsidies could save  governments some $3 trillion a year, more than they collect from  corporate taxes,'' according to BlackRock.   So here we have the fossil fuel industry over there, and they are  getting the biggest subsidy in the world--by IMF calculations, $700  billion a year--and the party that says it wants a more efficient  government and that ordinarily would like to reduce corporate taxes is  defending that subsidy, even though that is taking money out of  government more than corporate taxes. It is quite astonishing. The  BlackRock report gives such a window into Congress by comparison,  frankly. They conclude here by giving some pretty dire warnings about  where this goes if people aren't preparing for climate change. They  say:         Risk for the long-term investor . . . could lead to a       permanent loss of capital. The effects of climate change need       to be part of that equation, we believe.        Yet even short-term investors would do well to integrate       climate factors into their portfolio.    So from Goldman Sachs on to BlackRock, some of the most powerful and  intelligent financial firms in the world are telling their investors:  Get ready for climate change.   The last page of the BlackRock report says:         [C]urrent market prices arguably do not yet reflect the       social costs of burning fossil fuels. . . . This externality       is at the core of the climate challenge.    The externality, of course, being that you take the harm that you  cause and instead of putting it in the price of your product, you make  everybody else around you pay for it by being a polluter.   Then they asked the question:         What is the correct price of carbon? It is hard to say. A       2015 U.S. government study estimated $36 of economic damages       for each metric ton of carbon emitted. Yet estimates are       rising: A 2015 Stanford University study points to $220 per       metric ton.    I believe that our U.S. social cost of carbon is running at about $45  per metric ton right now. And, by the way, it has been upheld twice--at  least twice--by Federal courts. In fact, one court rather insisted that  the social cost of carbon had to be baked into the underlying rule;  otherwise, the underlying rule couldn't pass the test of being logical  and fair and not arbitrary and capricious.   So there is the case from some of our leading financial institutions  about climate change. They have real money at stake. They have real  clients. They can't engage in the kind of nonsense that we engage in  around here about climate change not being real or not being important  or being something that there is still debate about or being something  that if we try to fix it, it is going to cost too much money. All of  that is total bunkum processed through all sorts of advertising-type  public relations firms by the fossil fuel industry and sold to a  gullible public as if it were true.   A few folks who aren't so gullible--all Republicans--have just come  out with a very interesting report. Three of them were Treasury  Secretaries. Republican Presidents trusted these folks with the conduct  of the U.S. economy: Jim Baker, Secretary of the Treasury under  President Reagan; Hank Paulson, Secretary of the Treasury under  President Bush; and George Shultz, Secretary of the Treasury under  President Nixon. These men have some pretty impressive credentials. Not  only was he Secretary of the Treasury, but James Baker was also the  Secretary of State. And not only was George Shultz Secretary of the  Treasury and Secretary of State, he was also Secretary of Labor.   These three former Treasury Secretaries have led a group of other  investors, including the former chairman of the board of Walmart, the  world's largest retailer and employer; Tom Stephenson, a Republican who  is a partner at Sequoia Capital, a very successful venture capital firm  out in Silicon Valley; and Greg Mankiw, who was Chairman of George W.  Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, so this is a very Republican  group. They have a lot of experience. None of them holds elective  office now, so they don't have to worry about the fossil fuel industry  threatening to crush them in a primary or spend millions of dollars  through phony-baloney front groups against them or any of the usual  stuff that politicians have to put up with from the fossil fuel  industry as it fights to protect that massive subsidy that we have  talked about already.   Let's go through this report by these very senior Republican  officials. The first sentence:         Mounting evidence of climate change is growing too strong       to ignore. . . . For too long, many Republicans have looked       the other way.    Indeed. They go on to propose a conservative climate solution--what  they call a carbon dividends plan--which aligns actually fairly well  with my American Opportunity Carbon Fee Act, which I have put forward  in the past and am going to put forward in this Congress as well. I  hope, given its alignment with this Republican leadership on climate,  that we might actually begin to get some conversations going here. We  may have to go hide out of State someplace so the fossil fuel folks  don't find who is participating in the conversation and start punishing  them for doing so, but we will see how that goes.   The recommendation basically is for a carbon tax that collects  revenue to offset the cost of pollution that is not in the price of the  product and then return it all to the American people through a big  dividend.   The report says: ``A carbon tax would send a powerful market signal  that encourages technological innovation and largescale substitution of  existing energy and transportation infrastructures, thereby stimulating  new investment.''   Furthermore, a well-designed carbon dividends plan, the second half,  the tax, would stimulate new investment and ``a well-designed carbon  dividends plan would further contribute to economic growth through its  dynamic effects on consumption and investment.''   They definitely want to protect that one-to-one relationship so that  all the money that comes in goes back out. That is the principle of my  bill, as well, and I am more than willing to live with it. But the  problems of failing to act also need attention.   Since two of these gentlemen were Secretaries of State, we should  take some interest when they say: ``Our reliance on fossil fuels  contributes to a less stable world, empowers rogue petro-states and  makes us vulnerable to a volatile world oil market.''   We have to address this issue for a lot of reasons, and I couldn't be  more satisfied that these two Republican Secretaries of State have  actually made the connection that Thomas Friedman has made and that the  Department of Defense has repeatedly made in its ``Quadrennial Defense  Review'' between our overreliance on carbon and between the harms of  climate change and a less stable world--a world in which climate change  is what the Defense Department has so often called a catalyst for  conflict.   They then reflect a little bit on what is going on with their party:  ``The opposition of many Republicans to meaningfully address climate  change reflects poor science and poor economics, and is at odds with  the party's own noble tradition of stewardship.''   You would never know it nowadays, but the Republican Party was once  the party of Teddy Roosevelt. They point out that ``64% of Americans  worry a great deal or a fair amount about climate change, while a clear  majority of Republicans acknowledge that climate change is occurring.''   They go on to point out ``that 67 percent of Americans''--two thirds  of Americans--``support a carbon tax with proceeds returned directly to  them.''   Two thirds ``of Americans support a carbon tax with proceeds returned  directly to them, including 54% of conservative Republicans.''   So let's not pretend that this is a partisan issue. It is not a  partisan issue. It is an issue in which a big special interest has  thrown incredible weight around to try to crush one side of the debate.  But clearly, if 67 percent of Americans supported anything and 54  percent of conservative Republicans supported that, we would probably  be having a sensible conversation in the Senate about whatever that  thing was. We just can't do it when that thing happens to be climate  change because we have the fossil fuel industry out there--powered up  by Citizens United, spending all that money--trying to protect that  huge, huge subsidy that they enjoy.   Finally, the report points out--and I see the pages lined up here  along the  [[Page S1109]]  side of the podium: ``Increasingly, climate change is becoming a  defining issue for this next generation of Americans, which the GOP  ignores at its own peril.''   If this party wants to write off the young generation as they follow  the fossil fuel industry off the climate cliff, there will be a very  grave price to be paid.   The report concludes: ``With the privilege of controlling all  branches of the government comes a responsibility to exercise wise  leadership on the defining challenges of our era, including global  climate change.''   I don't know where Mr. Mnuchin will lead on climate change at the  Treasury Department. There are a number of ways in which the Treasury  Department can be influential in this area. To my knowledge, he has  never said anything about it yet.   It was not too long ago--2009--that a full-page advertisement ran in  the New York Times, a full page advertisement that pointed out that the  science of climate change was already, by then, to use the word in the  advertisement, ``irrefutable.'' The science of climate change was  ``irrefutable,'' the advertisement said.   Then the advertisement went on to say that the consequences of  climate change would be ``catastrophic and irreversible.'' That is  another quote from the advertisement: The consequences of climate  change were to be ``catastrophic and irreversible.''   On the one hand, you have science that is irrefutable; on the other  hand, you have consequences of ignoring it that are catastrophic and  irreversible. Who signed that advertisement? None other than Donald J.  Trump--not only he, but his children, Donald Trump, Eric Trump, and  Ivanka Trump, also all signed it.   The year 2009 was not that long ago. It is possible that the Trump  family could refer to what they knew in 2009 and perhaps take advice  from a Treasury Secretary. I hope they take advice from three Treasury  Secretaries, but we will see how that goes.   Perhaps Mr. Mnuchin can be a voice to try to get the GOP out of the  fossil fuel hole it is in, aligned with the 67 percent of American  voters who want to see a revenue-neutral carbon tax, aligned with the  majority of Republican conservative voters who would support that, and  aligned with the irrefutable nature of the science, and addressing the  catastrophic and irreversible consequences in this strange new  administration in which the new normal is abnormal. It is perhaps hard  to expect much good to come, but let's hope and let's hope Mr. Mnuchin  makes himself a part of the solution rather than just a part of the  climate-denial problem that so infects us, particularly here in  Congress.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
