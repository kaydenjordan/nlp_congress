 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the second annual  National Day of Civility.   This day, July 12, was chosen to mark a verse in Matthew's Gospel,  chapter 7, verse 12: ``So in everything, do to others what you would  have them do to you.''   This, of course, is known as the Golden Rule. In fact, it was one of  my mother's favorite Bible verses. She had her hands full, I am sure,  raising 12 kids--I was number 10--and this was her favorite Bible verse  that she would quote to us, the idea that everyone deserves your  respect.   Each one of us in this Chamber has the opportunity to live this rule,  as do our constituents. We are privileged to live in the United States  of America, the greatest country in the history of the world, due in  large part to our system of government. It is really an experiment. It  is a system of government designed to encourage debate, respect, and  resolve differences and rely on citizen input.   Today, there is an alarming decline in our public discourse. People  can't even seem to talk to each other, can't come to the table, and  can't hear each other out. We urgently need to reverse this trend.   At the beginning of last year, members of the freshman class drafted  and signed a commitment to civility, laying out our effort to make the  government work more efficiently and effectively, help build consensus  and restore public trust, and serve as a positive influence on society  at large.   On this National Day of Civility, let's renew our commitment to  civility. Congress may not be able to change the state of public  discourse, but we certainly can and should serve as an example to the  American people.                            ____________________
