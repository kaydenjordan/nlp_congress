 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight a letter recently  sent to the administration from myself and my colleagues from Indiana  in support of the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen proposal.   I was proud to support in the 117th Congress the Bipartisan  Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which established this Regional  Clean Hydrogen Hubs funding opportunity.   Northwest Indiana and our Midwest region have robust and well- established agricultural, manufacturing, and transportation  infrastructure networks. We are a prime central location for the  development of new hydrogen technologies and the delivery of hydrogen  products.   I am grateful for the leadership of Senator Young, Senator Braun, and  my House colleagues for their vocal support. I look forward to  continuing to work with them and all the stakeholders to advance this  transformational proposal that will create new, good-paying job  opportunities for everyone in Northwest Indiana, the region, and the  Midwest.                            ____________________
