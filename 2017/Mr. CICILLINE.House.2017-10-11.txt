 Mr. Speaker, this week, the fourth round of NAFTA  renegotiations will begin. President Trump will have an opportunity to  deliver on his promise last year to get a better deal for American  workers. I hope he does.   Our current trade deals are rigged in favor of the largest  corporations in this country and against working people. In my home  State of Rhode Island, we have lost 41,000 manufacturing jobs since  NAFTA and the WTO took effect. That is more than half of the  manufacturing jobs in my State. The folks who kept their jobs have seen  their paychecks get smaller.   Rhode Islanders know, most importantly, that we need a trade deal  that is fair; but they know that trade deals that we have now help  powerful corporations, but they are killing American jobs, helping  corporations outsource jobs at the expense of working people.   This week I am asking President Trump to demand a new NAFTA agreement  that has strong labor and environmental protections, that end foreign  tribunals that allow corporations to sue the U.S. Government and force  taxpayers to pay the bill, that has better Buy American requirements,  that has strict protections against currency manipulation, that has  strong rules of origin on manufactured goods, and that has provisions  that bring down the cost of prescription drugs.   These are commonsense provisions that will empower American working  families, and they should be included in any new trade agreement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona for  yielding and for his leadership in organizing this Special Order hour.   There is no more sacred responsibility that we have than to ensure  that the children in this country have access to quality, affordable  healthcare. So I rise this evening to speak in support of the vital  Children's Health Insurance Program, also known as CHIP.   As you know, Mr. Speaker, CHIP authorization expired on September 30,  2017--this past September. This program assures that 9 million  children, including 27,000 children and pregnant women in my home State  of Rhode Island, are provided with low-cost health insurance, which  covers essential services such as routine checkups, immunizations,  doctor visits, prescriptions, dental and vision care, inpatient and  outpatient hospital care, laboratory and x-ray services, and emergency  services.   This historically bipartisan program has been successful in lowering  the percentage of children who are uninsured from nearly 14 percent  when it started in 1997 to 4.5 percent in 2015. Historic achievements.   If not extended by Congress soon, many States will no longer be able  to fund the program and will begin limiting coverage, some as early as  the end of this year.   In fact, the Kaiser Family Foundation recently concluded that,  without an extension of CHIP, ``States would face budget pressures,  children would lose coverage, and implementation of program changes  could result in increased costs and administrative burden for States as  well as confusion for families.''   If not extended by Congress soon, many States will no longer be able  to fund the program and will begin limiting coverage.   Congress must also act with urgency to extend and reauthorize the  other programs that were enacted in the Medicare Access and CHIP  Reauthorization Act of 2015, including extending funding for community  health centers; the Personal Responsibility Education Program; the  rural and Medicare-dependent hospitals program; Teaching Health  Centers; Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program;  and the Special Diabetes Program for type 1 diabetes and for Indians.   These critical programs, as well as CHIP, are vital to the American  healthcare system, and they support access to high-quality, affordable  care.   I want to again thank the gentleman from Arizona for providing this  Special Order. This is urgent and should be an urgent priority for the  Congress of the United States to reauthorize this critical program to  absolutely insist that children--as I said, 9 million children across  this country--have access to quality, affordable healthcare, including  27,000 children and pregnant women in my home State.   Democrats are urging our Republican colleagues to reauthorize this  bill immediately so that the families who are so anxious about whether  or not they will continue to have the ability to access quality,  affordable healthcare can rest comfortably and know that this work is  done.   I thank the gentleman again for his leadership and for yielding to me  on this very important issue.
