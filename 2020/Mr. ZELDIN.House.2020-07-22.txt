 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding. As  an original cosponsor of this legislation, I would also like to thank  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in both Chambers for helping  lead the charge to get this important victory across the finish line.   I represent the First Congressional District of New York. It is a  district almost completely surrounded by water on the east end of Long  Island. In my district alone, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has  provided funding for over 65 parks, and that is just one example of the  impact this program has made all across our great Nation. This supports  public access, fishing, hunting, recreation, and our environment.   After securing permanent authorization last year, it is an honor to  continue the fight today. I am not sure about everyone else, but being  cooped up over the course of these last few months has probably given  just about all of us more appreciation for the great outdoors.   This is an effective program that will go a long way in keeping our  magnificent outdoors great for generations to come.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
