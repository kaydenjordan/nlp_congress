 Madam Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I continue to  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, in closing, this bipartisan bill will  correct the FAA's unacceptably lax oversight of foreign aeronautical  repair stations that work on U.S. airline fleets and help increase the  safety of our global aviation system.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3482) to establish the National Center for the Advancement  of Aviation, as amended.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 3482, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today is bittersweet. I am glad that my bill is finally  being considered on the House floor after working on this bill for over  two sessions, but unfortunately, my partner on this bill is not here to  join me, Representative Don Young of Alaska, the former chairman of the  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, the former dean of this  House. Mr. Speaker, his work and support were invaluable in helping us  get this bill to the floor.  [[Page H8167]]    This National Center for the Advancement of Aviation Act is both  bipartisan and bicameral. I am pleased that so many members of our  Transportation and Infrastructure Committee are sponsors of the bill,  including Subcommittee on Aviation Chair Larsen, as well as my  colleagues in the other body, Senators Duckworth and Inhofe.   Our committee has worked for years to make American skies the safest  in the world and to strengthen the industry workforce to maintain the  highest standards of aviation excellence.   This bill supports and promotes collaboration among civil,  commercial, and military aviation sectors to address the demands and  challenges of ensuring a safe and vibrant national aviation system  through research, education, and training.   Too often in the past, Mr. Speaker, innovation and lessons learned in  various aviation sectors have not been shared in a collaborative or  even a timely manner, especially considering rapid developments in new  technology. My bill helps to break down these silos across commercial  aviation, general aviation, and military aviation sectors. This will  not only improve safety and best practices, Mr. Speaker, but it will  also expand opportunities for those interested in more diverse aviation  workforces.   For the young and not so young, from those just starting out to those  with experience who want to move into other types of aviation work, the  national center will focus on four key areas with an emphasis on  aviation workforce development.   Firstly, it will support education efforts and provide resources to  curriculum developers, so educators at all levels have the tools and  training to educate the next generation of aviation professionals.   Secondly, the national center will provide a forum to leverage and  share expertise amongst industry sectors, including the improvement of  existing high school curriculum to develop and deploy a workforce of  pilots, aerospace engineers, unmanned aircraft systems operators,  aviation maintenance technicians, or other aviation maintenance  professionals needed in the coming decades.   Finally, it will support symposiums and conferences to facilitate  collaboration across the industry and develop future advancements for  the aviation and aerospace community. This legislation will also allow  the FAA to focus on safety, certification, and air traffic operations.   Mr. Speaker, the aviation and aerospace industry supports over 11  million jobs and contributes more than $1.6 trillion per year to our  national economy.   Nearly 200 organizations, including schools, airports, airlines,  manufacturers, unions, and other entities involved in aviation and  aerospace, have expressed strong support for this wonderful  legislation. It will address the demands and challenges our aviation  and aerospace industry face today and tomorrow.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the National Center for  the Advancement of Aviation Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and             Infrastructure,                                 Washington DC, September 27, 2022.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chairwoman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Johnson: I write to you concerning H.R.       3482, the National Center for the Advancement of Aviation Act       of 2022, which was introduced on May 21, 2021, and solely       referred to the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure.        I appreciate you agreeing to withdraw your request for a       sequential referral of H.R. 3482 so that the bill may be       considered expeditiously. I acknowledge that forgoing your       referral claim now does not waive the right to jurisdictional       claims in the future on subject matter contained in this bill       or similar legislation. Further, I will appropriately consult       and involve the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology       as the bill moves forward on issues that fall within your       Rule X jurisdiction.        Finally, I will include a copy of our letter exchange in       the committee report and in the Congressional Record when the       bill is considered on the floor.        Thank you again for your cooperation.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,      Chair.                                   ____            House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space,             and Technology,                                Washington, DC, September 27, 2022.      Chairman Peter A. DeFazio,      Committee on Transportation and Infrastructur House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       3482, the ``National Center for the Advancement of Aviation       Act of 2022,'' which was referred to the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure. I requested a sequential       referral of this bill on July 23, 2022. However, in an effort       to expedite consideration of this measure, I agree to       withdraw my request for a sequential referral.        The Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 3482 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation. I also ask       to be appropriately consulted and involved as the bill or       similar legislation moves forward so that we may address any       remaining issues that fall within our Rule X jurisdiction.        I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming       this understanding and ask that a copy of our exchange of       letters on this matter be included in the bill report filed       by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, as       well as inserted in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration to memorialize our understanding. Thank you for       your cooperation on this legislation.            Sincerely,                                             Eddie Bernice Johnson.     Mr. Speaker, this bill will help to address the workforce  challenges facing U.S. aviation today and prepare our workforce for the  opportunities of the future.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bipartisan legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in  the Senate amendments to the bill (H.R. 5641) to amend the Robert T.  Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act to increase the  threshold for  [[Page H8168]]  eligibility for assistance under sections 403, 406, 407, and 502 of  such Act, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendments is as follows:   Senate amendments:       (1)On page 2, line 13, strike [``AND REPORT'' after       ``REVIEW''] and insert ``and Report'' after ``Review''.      (2)On page 3, after line 3, insert:       SEC. 3. AUDIT AND REVIEW.         Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland       Security shall conduct an audit, and submit to Congress a       report, on whether there has been waste and abuse as a result       of the amendment made under section 2(a)(1).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 5641.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5641. This legislation will  expedite the approval process for small projects applying for aid  through FEMA's public assistance program, a program that helps  communities remove debris, implement emergency protective measures, and  repair damage to public infrastructure.   The House has already passed this once with overwhelming support, and  the amendment we are considering today would solely add a reporting  requirement to the language we previously supported.   Also, in the time since we first passed this bill, the Biden  administration has updated the small project threshold to $1 million  via rulemaking. The $1 million threshold, Mr. Speaker, is currently  expediting the post-disaster recovery process, cutting unnecessary red  tape and helping communities get back on their feet.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, this legislation supports FEMA's  role and codifies that the qualifying small project threshold will be  $1 million.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 3662) to temporarily increase the cost share authority for  aqueous film forming foam input-based testing equipment, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.  [[Page H8169]]    The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3662         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Preventing PFAS Runoff at       Airports Act''.       SEC. 2. TEMPORARY INCREASED COST SHARE AUTHORITY FOR AQUEOUS                     FILM FORMING FOAM INPUT-BASED TESTING                     EQUIPMENT.         (a) In General.--Section 47109 of title 49, United States       Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new       subsection:        ``(g) Special Rule for Covered Equipment.--        ``(1) In general.--The Government's share of allowable       project costs for covered equipment and its installation       shall be 100 percent.        ``(2) Definition of covered equipment.--For purposes of       this subsection, the term `covered equipment' means aqueous       film forming foam input-based testing equipment that is       eligible for Airport Improvement Program funding based on       Federal Aviation Administration PGL 21-01, titled `Extension       of Eligibility for stand-alone acquisition of input-based       testing equipment and truck modification', dated October 5,       2021 (or any other successor program guidance letter).        ``(3) Sunset.--The higher cost share authority established       in this subsection shall terminate on the earlier of--        ``(A) 180 days after the date on which the eligibility of       covered equipment for Airport Improvement Program funding       under the authority described in paragraph (2) terminates or       is discontinued by the Administrator; or        ``(B) 5 years after the date of enactment of this       subsection.''.        (b) Outreach Efforts.--Not later than 90 days after the       date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the       Federal Aviation Administration shall conduct an outreach       effort to make airports aware of the higher cost share       authority established in section 47109(g) of title 49, United       States Code, as added by subsection (a).        (c) Forward-looking Airport Reimbursements.--Not later than       18 months after the date of enactment of this Act, the       Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration shall       provide a briefing to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and       Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure of the House of       Representatives that reviews--        (1) potential options for Congress to reimburse airports       that--        (A) are certificated under part 139 of title 14, Code of       Federal Regulations; and        (B) acquired covered equipment (as defined in section       47109(g) of title 49, United States Code) as added by       subsection (a)--        (i) with Federal funding but with a Government's share less       than 100 percent; or        (ii) without Federal funding;        (2) information relevant to estimating the potential cost       of providing such reimbursement;        (3) the status of the Federal Aviation Administration's       outreach efforts as required under subsection (b); and        (4) any additional information the Administrator of the       Federal Aviation Administration considers appropriate.        (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--The amendments made       by this Act shall apply to amounts that first become       available in fiscal year 2023 or thereafter.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on S. 3662, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3662, the Preventing PFAS Runoff  at Airports Act, sponsored by Senator Peters from Michigan.   Mr. Speaker, every day millions of Americans are exposed to highly  toxic fluorinated chemicals known as PFAS, through either their  drinking water, home appliances, retail packaging, or countless other  things they come into contact with each and every day.   These chemicals, known as ``forever chemicals'' due to their long- term persistence and inability to be easily broken down when released  into the environment, have been linked with numerous human health  risks, including increased risk of cancer, immune system impairment,  and impaired child development. And that is just what we know. There is  still plenty that we don't know about these hazardous materials and  chemicals.   Unfortunately, these chemicals are also likely to be found in and  around many of our Nation's airports. That is because airports have  been required by law to use and discharge firefighting foam containing  PFAS; not just during firefighting emergencies, but also to comply with  mandatory FAA testing requirements for firefighting equipment. These  discharges have tremendous health implications for the people who live  and work around airports, as well as growing liability concerns for the  airports themselves.   Fortunately, there has been significant progress on this front. For  instance, just last month, the EPA proposed designating two of the most  widely used PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances, which would create  more public transparencies around the release of these chemicals. And  the FAA is in the process of transitioning away from mandating the use  of airport firefighting foam containing PFAS--though the agency still  has to offer PFAS-free alternatives.   Furthermore, the FAA now allows for airports to sufficiently test  their firefighting equipment without discharging PFAS outside of the  vehicle. But while these efforts should be celebrated, more work must  be done.   That is why I support this bill, which would raise the Federal cost  share to 100 percent for airports that use Federal Airport Improvements  Program funds to acquire input-based testing equipment, which enables  airports to test firefighting equipment without emitting toxic PFAS  substances. While airports are already allowed to procure this  equipment, the cost of the equipment--which can be tens of thousands of  dollars--can often be prohibitive.   Through this higher Federal cost share, S. 3662 would incentivize the  broad adoption of this new technology to ensure airports are able to  limit or prevent the spread of PFAS contamination into local  communities.   In addition, the bill would require the FAA to provide Congress with  options for reimbursing airports that use AIP funds to require input- based testing equipment under a lower Federal cost share standard or  acquire this equipment without AIP funds.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, by making this small change to  the Federal AIP, this bill would make it much easier to protect the  health of our airport workers, first responders, and local communities,  as well as bolster our Nation's ability to continue fighting these  dangerous and insidious chemicals.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bipartisan legislation and I urge my  colleagues to do the same. I yield back the balance of my time.
