 Madam President, July 20 marks 50 years since Neil  Armstrong took ``one small step for man'' and, for the first time in  human history, walked on the Moon. The Apollo missions should be  remembered for generations to come as a triumph for innovation, for  hard work, and for the American spirit. As we commemorate the mission  to the moon that captured the world 50 years ago, we should look with  anticipation to the next ``giant leap for mankind,'' and thus work to  ensure that the United States remains at the forefront of innovation  and technology.   Madam President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, since it is getting close to shutting- down time, I ask unanimous consent to finish my entire remarks. I  promise the Presiding Officer I will not be too long.    Mr. President, I come to talk to my colleagues today  about the deeply flawed EB-5 green card program.   Several weeks ago, we learned that the Office of Management and  Budget at the White House had completed its review of the new rules to  update and reform the EB-5 Program. I have been an advocate for  reforming this program for a long, long period of time. Several times I  have even talked to the White  [[Page S4839]]  House about moving these regulations along.   Now that they have been reviewed by OMB, for the rule to come into  effect, it must now be published in the Federal Register. The rule was  first proposed in January 2017. We have been waiting for it to be  finished for 2\1/2\ years. I hope that President Trump now makes that  happen as soon as possible.   The proposed rule would raise the minimum investment amounts required  under the program. It also makes sure that investments are directed to  rural areas and truly high-unemployment areas, as Congress intended  when EB-5 was created in 1990.   Considering those points of where EB-5 ought to be concentrated and  now looking at how they have been diverted from the original intent of  Congress is the very best reason for these rules to be put in place--to  get us back to square one, the original intent of the law.   Since the 1990s, rampant and abusive gerrymandering of the EB-5  Program's targeted employment areas has undermined that congressional  intent, which was to direct it toward high-unemployment areas and rural  areas. Instead of channeling investment to rural and high-unemployment  areas, EB-5 has become a source of cheap foreign capital for big-city,  big-moneyed interests. The targeted employment area reforms in the  proposed rule would take a first step toward refocusing EB-5 investment  in the way that Congress originally intended in that 1990s legislation.   In addition to channeling investment away from the areas of our  country that need it the most, this is what has happened. The EB-5  Program has been plagued with other forms of fraud and abuse, and this  has been going on for years and years. There are examples of EB-5 fraud  from all over the country, and I am going to give just a few examples  as a reminder to the President why these rules need to be put into the  Federal Registry right away.   In Chicago, a businessman defrauded 290 investors of $150 million in  funds that were supposed to be used for construction of a hotel and  conference center near O'Hare Airport.   In Palm Beach, FL, a real estate developer and real estate attorney  teamed up to defraud 60 Chinese and Iranian EB-5 investors of $50  million. Instead of that money being used to fund the construction of a  proposed hotel, it was instead used to pay personal taxes and purchase  a 151-foot yacht.   In Wisconsin, a businessman used over half of the $7.6 million in  funds he had solicited from investors to pay for personal expenses,  including Green Bay Packers tickets and the purchase of a Cadillac  Escalade.   I could go on all day.   In May of 2017, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services conducted  an internal fraud assessment and found 19 cases of national security  concerns within the EB-5 Program. Those are national security concerns.  The No. 1 responsibility of the Federal Government is to protect the  American people, and that involves national security. These cases  related to terrorism, espionage, and information and technology  transfer.   Unfortunately, multiple bipartisan efforts in the Congress to modify  the EB-5 Program have been consistently stymied by powerful special  interest groups and big-moneyed interests. Because I have been in the  middle of those battles--and they are bipartisan battles--over the  years, I know exactly where these big-moneyed interests are coming from  and the special interest groups that keep this program from being  reformed.   Now we have an opportunity for one person--the President of the  United States--through regulation, to reform this program in a way that  would be very helpful. So that makes the publication of the EB-5 reform  rules even more important. I applaud President Trump and the  administration for getting the proposed rule to this point, but now it  is time for the President and his team to finish the process and make  sure the final rule goes into effect as soon as possible.   Iowans and all Americans who live in rural and high-unemployment  areas deserve to have the investment that Congress intended when the  EB-5 Program was created almost 30 years ago. President Trump and his  administration now have a chance to finally address some of the very  serious flaws in this program that have hurt rural America. We have  been waiting for these reforms for over 2 years. It is time for this  final rule to be published, and it needs to happen right now, if not  sooner.    First of all, I thank Senator Hoeven for leading this  discussion. It is a very important discussion because American farmers,  workers, and businesses stand to benefit greatly from the new United  States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.   This successor agreement to NAFTA will allow for more market access  for agriculture, new commitments in critical areas such as customs,  digital trade, intellectual property, labor, environment, currency, and  the lowering of nontariff barriers--all translating into higher wages,  greater productivity, and more jobs.   As a family farmer, I can say without a doubt that trade with Canada  and Mexico is critical to the prosperity of my State of Iowa, the  Midwest, and, for that matter, all of rural America. In 2019, a  Business Roundtable study found that trade with Mexico and Canada  supported 12 million U.S. jobs. The same study found that 130,000 Iowa  jobs were supported by trade with Canada and Mexico in 2017, and $6.6  billion in Iowa goods and services were exported to Canada and Mexico.  According to the National Association of Manufacturers, Canada and  Mexico purchase nearly half of Iowa's total global manufacturing  exports.   President Trump and Ambassador Lighthizer delivered a solid deal to  enhance this critical relationship with our good neighbors. Now,  Congress must act to implement the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. As  Ambassador Lighthizer said earlier this year, doing so will not only  help the economy of the three countries, but it will enhance the  credibility of America's global trade agenda. That is more important  than ever, as talks between the United States and China are back on  track.   I am looking forward to hearing concrete suggestions from House  Democrats sometime soon. I am glad Speaker Pelosi has formed working  groups to work with Ambassador Lighthizer to address Democrats'  concerns and that these meetings are underway.   About a month ago, I met for a half hour with Speaker Pelosi, and I  can assure you that she wants to get to ``yes,'' but she has a lot of  new Members. The House of Representatives has the largest number of new  Members in that body since 1974, and there is a lot that new Members  have to learn. As Speaker of the House of Representatives, she has to  make sure those new Members are comfortable with it. I am sure she  wants to get there.   Any additions to the USMCA that might come as a result of these  negotiations that can improve the outcome of American workers, I am  happy to consider.   It is important to remember that USMCA is better than NAFTA by nearly  every standard, including labor and environment. I hope discussions  between House Democrats and Ambassador Lighthizer are an exercise in  getting to the ``yes'' that I feel Speaker Pelosi wants to get to.   One particular area where everyone can agree is that enforcement  across the board is a key compromise that must be hammered out. Factors  outside of farmers' hands, such as an oversupply of grain in the global  market, an unusually wet spring across the Midwest, and natural  disasters, like flooding, have all contributed to increased uncertainty  and less profitability for farmers, leading to anxiety among those same  farmers. Passing the USMCA will help alleviate some of that uncertainty  and anxiety for the years ahead by providing a stable export market for  American corn, soybeans, pork, and dairy, to name just a few examples  of the benefits not only to farming but the rest of the agenda for  manufacturing and services.
