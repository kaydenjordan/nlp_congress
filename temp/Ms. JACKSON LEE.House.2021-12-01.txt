 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3531, the  ``Women Who Worked on the Home Front World War II Memorial Act.''   I would first like to thank my colleague, Delegate Eleanor Holmes  Norton, for introducing this important legislation to honor these  women.   This bill authorizes the Women Who Worked on the Home Front  Foundation to establish a commemorative work on federal land in the  District of Columbia in commemoration of the commitment and service  represented by women who worked on the home front during World War II.   This important legislation would authorize a memorial in honor of  these women and their service to our nation, right here in the Nation's  capital.   During World War II, over 18 million American women kept the home  front running in support of the country's overall war effort.   Not only did they give their sons, husbands, fathers, and brothers to  the war effort, they gave their time, energy, labor, and some even gave  their lives.   Beyond providing support for their children at home and men at war,  the committed women on the home front stepped forward to assume the  work and duties needed to keep the country running, most of these jobs  were not available to women before the war.   Between 1940 and 1945, the age of ``Rosie the Riveter,'' the  percentage of women in the U.S. workforce increased from 27 percent to  nearly 37 percent, and by 1945, nearly one out of every four married  women worked outside the home.   World War II opened the door for women to work in more types of jobs  than ever before.   These women were not only instrumental to the war effort, but they  showed the country and the world what women were capable of,  fundamentally changing the path for future generations of women.   Eisenhower himself said, ``The contribution of the women of America,  whether on the farm or in the factory or in uniform, to D-Day was a  sine qua non [or necessary for] . . . the invasion effort.''   These women were fundamental to our defeat of the Axis Powers, and I  fully support this legislation's passage to honor their valiant  efforts.    Madam Speaker, I rise in proud support of H.R. 4706,  ``The Blackwell School National Historic Site Act.''   I would like to thank Congressman Tony Gonzales for introducing this  bill.   This bill would establish Blackwell School National Historic Site as  a unit of the National Park System when the Secretary of the Interior  enters into a written agreement with the Marfa Unified School District  for donation or co-management of the site and acquires sufficient lands  within the boundaries of the national historic site to constitute a  manageable unit.   The NPS would be required to develop a management plan for the site  no later than 3 years after the date on which funds are first made  available for this purpose.   The bill also directs the Secretary of the Interior to enter into  cooperative agreements with the Blackwell School Alliance (and other  partners) for interpretive and educational programming, technical  assistance, and rehabilitation for the site.   The Blackwell School operated in Marfa, Texas, as a segregated school  for children of Mexican descent from 1909 until Marfa schools were  integrated in 1965.   Yet this is much more than just a local story.   The original historic school building, and grounds on which it  stands, provide an authentic setting to commemorate and interpret a  time when ``separate but equal'' dominated our culture in ways  currently unknown, and essential to understanding the American  experience.   The Blackwell School Alliance has been working 15 years to preserve  the stories, legacy, and buildings associated with the Blackwell  School.   We have partnered with many universities, state agencies, private  foundations, individuals, and the City of Marfa to document and promote  this important piece of Marfa history.   This park would not only have an emotional impact, but it would also  help preserve key history for the people of Marfa, Texas.    Madam Speaker, let me take this opportunity to do  one or two things. First, I acknowledge my colleague, Congresswoman  Slotkin and her district, to offer to her and the people of Michigan my  deepest concern and sympathy for the loss of those precious children.   No parent should ever expect to send their child to school and there  would be a loss of life. Murdered. And for too long we have had a roll  call of children being murdered. Students at Columbine High School,  those college students at Virginia Tech, high school students at  Parkland, high school students at Santa Fe, and of course, in  Connecticut, little babies. It brought a President to tears.   Tonight, my message is sometimes the Federal Government has to step  in.   For example, as it relates to this tragedy of gun violence, we are  long overdue for dealing with the appropriate reaction. Many of us have  discussed legislation that I had, some 20-plus years ago in Texas, that  sometimes--although I am a champion of parents, I am one--I want to see  parents front and center in their children's education, PTO meetings, I  know where to go to get action parents.   When a little one--and I will say a little one--gets a gun from a  parent that bought the gun a few days ago and winds up taking the lives  of three precious little ones and others now fighting for their lives  in hospitals, I would make the argument that something has to be done.  Something has to be done and the Federal Government needs to step in in  a tragedy like this.   We will all be working with our colleagues to do better. Before I  start this theme that I have, as a member of the Judiciary Committee  now for two decades, I have seen the success stories of making things  better. I remember the joy of the reauthorization of the Voting Rights  Act in 2007 and 2008 when we went as a bipartisan Congress--98 votes in  the United States Senate and 400 plus in the House, and the bill was  signed by George W. Bush. The Voting Rights bill, the one that is now  being held hostage.   That is something that the Federal Government does better--voting  rights. That is what I want to talk about tonight, what we need to do  better.   Just a moment, before I do that, let me deviate just for a moment and  let me do it because I am pained. I am hurt. This has not been directed  at me, but a sister Congresswoman.                                time  1900    This has not been directed at me, but a sister Congresswoman. And  when I say sister Congresswoman, I am looking at the landscape of women  because it has not been easy for women, Madam Speaker, to get to the  United States Congress. We have not been here long in large numbers. We  have been one or two. We can go back to the 1800s and beyond to know  that women did come into the United States Congress but very few-- certainly women of color, very few.   Then might I add something else, Madam Speaker, the wonderfulness of  the multiculturalism of faith, the different faiths that are in this  place. It is finally a recognition of America as the unusual  experiment, different languages and different cultures under one flag  that you sit directly in front of, Madam Speaker, the United States of  America. And then as I stand here right above your head, Madam Speaker,  it says, In God We Trust.   So whatever way you craft your faith, our Constitution says that you  are recognized and welcome under the First Amendment, freedom of  religion and freedom of access. That is one of the reasons that,  although imperfect, America has been able to go into faraway places and  find connection because they have citizens who are connected to those  places.   Then why would we have the trash of discourse?   Why would we disgrace our positions and the oath we take by  suggesting that a person of a different faith, who wears her own faith,  a hijab, is a terrorist?   Madam Speaker, there were times when I first began to wear braids  that I was looked at askance. I, frankly, believe there are  opportunities that I did not get because I wore braids. But it does not  in any way even equal to being called a terrorist or black heart, to be  made light of, to have a faith made light of, to not understand that  the words in this hallowed ground, this most powerful lawmaking body in  the world, is heard around the world.   As we speak today, someone is wondering what Americans are saying.  The easy way to do it is to tune in, as we may not think, to the floor  of the House; or the aftermath the words of a Member of Congress or a  Member of the United States Senate or the President carry great weight,  make a lot of noise, and are listened to. And the billions of Muslims  around the world should not be denigrated for tomfoolery.   But what about, as I have been told, our own Member, Ilhan Omar,  receiving deaths because of someone's ugly words?   It is time for the Federal Government to step in. Lives can be lost.  Or we used to have that old phrase, sticks and stones can break my  bones, but words will never hurt me. And that is the context of  yesteryear when the words were, in essence, light.   But, Madam Speaker, when you begin to play with the minds of those  who came on January 6, we just heard testimony that said: I came  because the former President called me to come.   Then who is safe when we say words?   This is not chatter. It is vile, and it can hurt people.   Can it hurt the innocent Muslim woman on a street in America, or  Muslim man, or Muslim family, or Muslim child going to school because  it has a megaphone?   Can it endanger our colleagues no matter who they are?   It is appropriate for the action of this House or the time for the  Federal Government to step in.   I offer my concern, love, and affection for my colleagues and my  sister Congresswomen. But I cannot and we should not tolerate dastardly  language and non-humorous insults and threats to people's lives.   How dare you?   As I said, I want to talk about the idea of when the Federal  Government should come into action.   Madam Speaker, let me ask you how much time do I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, the Federal Government is an umbrella  on a rainy day. So the context of my remarks today will be about  criminal justice issues and the unequal results that have come about  through State laws.   Let me say that the juries have spoken in two important cases. As a  trained lawyer I will say it again: The jury has spoken. But it does  not mean  [[Page H6852]]  that I have to accept in one instance the ultimate decision based upon  the context of that trial and all of the trappings: The judge, the  prosecutors, the defense, and the law.   So let me begin very briefly.   What is self-defense?   It is a legal justification for the otherwise illegal use of force.  You have killed someone in most instances. In the instance of self- defense that results in a death, although an unlawful killing did  occur, it is considered a justified killing.   Do you know how many lives are lost, particularly people of color, by  being defined as a justified killing?   To succeed on self-defense grounds, an unprovoked attack, the killer  was not the aggressor, the killer reasonably believed that they were in  imminent danger, the use of force was reasonable. This duty also  requires the individual claiming self-defense to retreat prior to using  deadly force.   In the wake of Kyle Rittenhouse's behavior, two men are dead, and  they have families. Joseph Rosenbaum, 36; Anthony Huber, 26. Their  families are hurting. And then one was drastically injured; Gaige  Grosskreutz was drastically injured. And yet we find the self-defense  law was used for the alleged interpretation of justifiable homicide.   Shameful. The law needs to be reviewed.   Someone said: Was he not even guilty of a traffic ticket?   Could you frame the case, Madam Speaker, in a young person who left  their home and secured an AK-47?   The representation is that I came to protect.   Then why wasn't the question asked to the young man: Did you not land  in the midst of protests?    Did you not head directly to where the police were?   Or did you surround yourself where protesters under the First  Amendment had a right in this instance to be angry and agitated but  nonviolent?   They were unarmed.   So if your reasoning was to go to protect, then go to the protectors.  That was not the case. This was a false narrative ill-conceived. And  although 17 or 18, he had the wherewithal and should have been held  accountable for not going to where he said he was going to go.   The prosecutor in the Ahmaud Arbery case had it right. You can't come  to provoke and then declare self-defense. That is what happened in the  Rittenhouse case. Tragedy of the killing--of the shooting of Jacob  Blake; those there were agitated, some might say rightly so. Some were  there to do other things.   But the real issue was: Did they deserve to die?   Was this gentleman anywhere near police?   No. He came to provoke and then claimed self-defense. I believe there  should be a Federal review of self-defense laws across America, and I  will share with you why: Because Anthony Huber is dead, because Joseph  Rosenbaum is dead, and because Gaige is severely injured.   But yet this is supposed to be the picture of someone who only came  to help. He didn't get to the party of police that were down the street  technically. He didn't make a beeline--as some of our parents would  say, make a beeline for home. He didn't make a beeline to get to right  where the police were and get instructions from the police. He was in  the midst of those who rightfully could be protesting with some dispute  as to what they might have been doing, but that was the charge of law  enforcement. To my knowledge, that night law enforcement did not kill  anyone, and ultimately the protesters left the area.   Self-defense laws across America need to be reviewed because too many  people are dying under this false premise that everybody can use self- defense.   What about the castle doctrine?   That is an expansion of self-defense both statutory and common law,  in which removes the duty to retreat for self-defense on individuals  inside their home. This principle has been codified and expanded by the  majority of State legislatures in a variety of ways. However, the  boyfriend of Breonna Taylor who was defending her and the home was  arrested, an African American.   These laws need to be reviewed. They are State laws, but they are  unequally applied. Enough is enough.   Stand your ground laws. Stand your ground laws are an extension of  the castle doctrine to areas outside of an individual's home such that  there is no duty to retreat for self-defense. The name is derived from  statutory language found in several States.   This results in the imbalance, if you will, of justice. Racial  disparities are much larger as White on Black homicides have  justifiable findings; 33 percentage points more often than Black on  White homicides. So as Whites--as the father and son thought that they  could kill Ahmaud Arbery, they were hoping for the odds that they would  be found not guilty because they killed a Black man and they claimed  self-defense.   Stand your ground laws appear to exacerbate those differences as  cases overall are significantly more likely to be ruled justified in  stand your ground States than non-stand your ground States. We will  talk about one of the most notorious cases.   With respect to race controlling for all other attributes, the odds a  White-on-Black homicide is found justified in 281 percent greater than  the odds of a White-on-White homicide is found justified. So if you  happen to be White and kill a Black person, 281 percent of the time you  are innocent. You are innocent. By contrast, a Black-on-White homicide  has barely half the odds of being ruled justifiable relative to White  on White homicides.   Let me be very clear. I want all lives to be saved. I want Black  lives to be noticed and known and matter. I want to make sure that the  justice system is fair. Justice should have no color. The scales of  justice, Lady Justice, that is what the Judiciary Committee has been  advocating and working for the decades that I have had the privilege of  serving.   Statistically Black-on-Black homicides have the same odds of being  ruled justifiable as White-on-White. White men are more likely to  successfully invoke the use of stand your ground laws for their defense  after shooting than Black Americans or women, especially Black women.   Nationally the likelihood of a homicide being ruled justified is 281  percent greater than when the defendant is White and the victim is  Black.   Need for Federal intervention and review. In contrast, the likelihood  of a homicide being ruled justified when the defendant is Black and the  victim is White is 49 percent lower compared to cases where both the  defendant and victim are White.   In 68 percent, according to the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, of  successful stand your ground law claims in Florida, the person was  unarmed.   Let me quickly move to these cases.                                time  1915    As I do so, let me add to my discussion, and that is the citizen's  arrest, the citizen's arrest law that was used by the defendants in the  Ahmaud Arbery case.   And let me offer my sympathy to those killed by Mr. Rittenhouse and  to the family of Mr. Arbery. Let me give sympathy to the families of  Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber because their loved ones are dead.   But in this case of, one has always said, a praying mother, a praying  family, the citizen's arrest law cited in Arbery's case dates back to  the Civil War. This case that was used, as the prosecutor indicated,  was a Civil War-era State law to justify the killing.   Since 1863, Georgia has allowed its residents to arrest one another  if they witnessed a crime and the police were not around. Similar laws  have existed in nearly every State.   The citizen's arrest laws in Georgia in 1863 were utilized on the  pretense of getting freed slaves. They were free. But by their color,  there were those who said: You are not free. I am arresting you. You  are violating the law. You escaped.   How horrible to have this kind of bounty.   I include in the Record an article from The New York Times, ``The  Citizen's Arrest Law Cited in Arbery's Killing Dates Back to the Civil  War.''                    [From New York Times, May 13, 2020]   The Citizen's Arrest Law Cited in Arbery's Killing Dates Back to the                                 Civil War         After Ahmaud Arbery was shot dead by two white men on a       quiet residential road in  [[Page H6853]]       coastal Georgia, a prosecutor cited a Civil War era state law       to justify the killing.        The same law was invoked last year in suburban Atlanta       after a white woman chased down a black man who left the       scene of a car accident and killed him after starting a       confrontation.        Since 1863, Georgia has allowed its residents to arrest one       another--if they have witnessed a crime and the police are       not around. Similar laws exist in nearly every state, and       have been raised in courtrooms over the decades to account       for actions in a range of criminal cases, including assaults       and murders.        But after Mr. Arbery's death, a growing chorus of critics       are calling for the laws to be repealed. They say the laws       are outdated, relics of the Wild West, and are ripe for abuse       by untrained civilians in an age in which 911 is widely       available and police response times are generally within       minutes.        Like ``stand your ground'' and ``castle doctrine'' laws       that allow people to use force to protect themselves or their       homes--as in the case of a neighborhood watch volunteer in       Florida who shot to death Trayvon Martin in 2012--citizen's       arrest statutes have generated considerable controversy and       cries of racism.        ``Namely, a member of the public doesn't know--and likely       cannot understand--the nuances of citizen's arrest,       particularly when it comes to the use of deadly force,'' Ira       P. Robbins, a law professor at American University who wrote       an academic paper on the issue, wrote in an email.        ``That's why it is so dangerous for people to take the law       into their own hands.''        Citizen's arrest laws date back to medieval times. Absent       an organized police force, in the late 1200s, King Edward I       needed help fighting crime. The legal concept carried over to       the United States, when in the country's modern infancy, it       could take days for a law enforcement agent to travel to a       crime scene.        The use of the law, while not altogether common, is       generally less problematic in its more frequent use by       shopkeepers detaining shoplifting suspects, for example, or       by trained security guards and police officers operating       outside their jurisdiction, Mr. Robbins wrote.        Supporters of the law point to instances in which people       who are committing crimes are thwarted and then held until       the police arrive, such as muggers or shoplifters. They are       relied upon by crime watch groups like the Guardian Angels to       anti-immigrant patrols on the U.S.-Mexico border.        Still, Dana Mulhauser, a former civil rights lawyer at the       Department of Justice who now runs the conviction integrity       unit in St. Louis County, said citizen's arrest laws had       outlived themselves.        ``These laws were created in a different time,'' she said.       ``We are not in a time where we are lacking in police       responsiveness in this country. You are asking for situations       that cause trouble.''        In the case in suburban Atlanta, Hannah R. Payne, 22, is       awaiting trial on murder charges for the shooting death of       Kenneth E. Herring, a 62-year-old mechanic who left the scene       of a fender bender last May. Ms. Payne, who was not involved       in the crash, chased Mr. Herring in her Jeep.        Witnesses told police in Clayton County, Ga., that Ms.       Payne blocked Mr. Herring's truck, approached the open       driver's-side window of his vehicle and punched him with her       left hand as she pointed a 9-millimeter firearm with her       right.        A 911 dispatcher told her to stand down, but the police       said the call recorded Ms. Payne's demands: ``Get out of the       car,'' she yelled, using a vulgarity. A single shot was       fired, and Mr. Herring stepped out of the truck and died.        Ms. Payne, described by her lawyer as an ``all-American       girl'' who ``thought she was helping out,'' is now facing a       long prison term for a killing that shares eerie similarities       to the shooting death of Mr. Arbery, who was killed in       February after a father and son told the authorities they       thought he was the suspect of a rash of recent break-ins in       their neighborhood.        ``When I saw that Arbery case, I thought, `Here we go       again,' '' Mr. Herring's widow, Christine Herring, said in an       interview.        To Ms. Herring, people like the young woman who killed her       husband feel empowered by the law to handle criminal matters       on their own.        A Georgia prosecutor, George E. Barnhill, cited the state's       citizen's arrest law as the reason Gregory McMichael, 64, and       his son, Travis McMichael, 34, should not be held responsible       for Mr. Arbery's death.        In a letter to the Glynn County Police Department, Mr.       Barnhill, who eventually recused himself from the case, wrote       that the men were in ``hot pursuit'' of Mr. Arbery, and that       they had ``solid first hand probable cause'' that he was a       ``burglary suspect.''        There is no evidence that Mr. Arbery had committed a       burglary, and he was not armed when he was chased down.        The McMichaels were arrested last week and charged with       aggravated assault and murder, more than two months after the       shooting death and after a different prosecutor asked the       Georgia Bureau of Investigation for assistance.        According to Mr. Robbins' research, some states do not       allow citizen's arrest of misdemeanors unless the misdemeanor       involves a ``breach of the peace.'' Others only allow       citizens to make the arrest if they witnessed the crime       themselves. The laws vary across the country regarding the       level of probable cause that is required, and how long a       person is allowed to detain someone.        In Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, an arrest is       allowed if a citizen personally witnesses a felony.       California allows a citizen's arrest of a misdemeanor even if       the person did not directly witness it.        Statutes also differ on how certain the citizen has to be       that the crime was committed, Mr. Robbins wrote. In Arkansas,       the citizen can be ``reasonably sure,'' but in New York, if       the felony was not actually committed, someone who wrongly       takes a person into custody can wind up liable for false       arrest.        In Gary, Ind., last fall, a city councilman who apprehended       a teenager he believed had stolen his car days earlier was       charged with kidnapping.        ``It can get messy,'' said Ronald L. Carlson, a law       professor at the University of Georgia. ``A citizen who is       being arrested is much less inclined to be cooperative if       it's not somebody with a blue uniform on.''        In Georgia, the law states that a private person may arrest       someone if a crime is committed in his presence or ``within       his immediate knowledge.''        But if it is a felony, the citizen can stop someone from       escaping if the citizen has ``reasonable and probable grounds       of suspicion.''        The current Georgia law is about a decade old, but versions       of a nearly identical statute have existed in the state since       1863.        In the Clayton County case, leaving the scene of an       accident with no injuries is a misdemeanor, so Georgia law       would not have authorized Ms. Payne to chase down Mr.       Herring.        Further, Mr. Herring initially stopped at the accident       scene, but he apparently was having a diabetic episode and       got back in his car and left, his wife said, so it was       unclear whether he would have been charged with any crime at       all.        Ms. Payne and her lawyer, Matt Tucker, did not respond to       requests for comment.        At her bond hearing last year, Mr. Tucker said his client       was ``not a menace to society as people want to portray       her.''        ``She's a young individual that got on the phone with 911       and thought she was helping out,'' the Clayton News Daily       quoted him saying. ``At her age, she learned a very valuable       lesson.''        In the killing of Mr. Arbery, someone called 911 beforehand       to say that a man was inside a house under construction. If       that man was Mr. Arbery, and he was there without permission       but stole nothing, then he could have been charged with       trespassing, a misdemeanor, said Lawrence J. Zimmerman, the       president of the Georgia Association of Criminal Defense       Lawyers. That means, Mr. Zimmerman said, the men who went       after him would not have been authorized to give chase.        Force can only be used to prevent a violent felony, Mr.       Zimmerman said, adding, ``What is not lawful is, you can't       detain somebody and then use force.''        But a person making a citizen's arrest who is then attacked       could try to claim self-defense, he said, as the McMichaels       have claimed--although it would not necessarily be       successful.        On Tuesday, Georgia lawmakers said they would move forward       with proposals to strip that protection from state law.        ``The citizen's arrest has to be abolished in this state,''       State Representative James Beverly, a Democrat, said at a       news conference in Brunswick on Tuesday. ``We can't have this       happen again in this country and certainly not in the state       of Georgia.''        Ms. Herring said she would love to see the law abolished.       ``The law is protecting them for some reason,'' she said of       those who had cited it as a defense. And of the woman accused       of killing her husband, she added, ``What gives her the       right? Let me tell you, she is not the police.''     So the citizen's arrest laws should be very clear.  The defendants were wrong. The case resulted in a conviction because  the case says that you have to witness the crime, and they did not.   I include in the Record an article titled ``Ahmaud Arbery and the  case for getting rid of citizen's arrests.''                       [From the Vox, Nov. 10, 2021]      Ahmaud Arbery and the Case for Getting Rid of Citizen's Arrests         Nearly two years after Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black       man, was shot and killed in a suburban Georgia town while       jogging, the three white suspects accused of the slaying--      Greg McMichael, his son Travis McMichael, and their neighbor,       William ``Roddie'' Bryan--are now on trial. They face charges       on a total of nine counts, including malice murder, felony       murder, aggravated assault, and false imprisonment.        Arbery's killing in February 2020 ignited national outrage.       When a video Bryan recorded from his vehicle while following       Arbery went viral online, viewers called it an unequivocal       lynching. The graphic footage shows the McMichaels, both       carrying guns, pursuing Arbery in a truck after he ran down       their street in the mostly white Satilla Shores neighborhood       near Brunswick. Following a short chase, the men corner       Arbery, and a confrontation between Arbery and Travis       McMichael ensues. During the struggle, Arbery is shot three       times, twice in the chest, after which he slumps to the       ground. It took 74 days after Arbery's death for the men to       be arrested and charged.        Defense attorneys will likely argue that the men's actions       were protected by Georgia's citizen's arrest law, which at       the time  [[Page H6854]]       allowed a person to detain someone whom they believe just       committed a crime. The attorneys may claim the men acted in       self-defense while attempting to carry out a legitimate       citizen's arrest of Arbery, whom they suspected of burglary.        Georgia's outdated and dangerous citizen's arrest law--one       that was created in an era of slavery and emboldened citizens       to act on their worst biases--has since been repealed. The       law was replaced with a bill that limits who can detain       citizens and when (business owners and workers who witness       someone shoplifting or dining and dashing, for example.) But       most states still have a version of these laws on the books,       and as long as they endure, advocates say they could       ultimately have tragic consequences.             Citizen's arrest laws are ubiquitous, with old roots         Georgia's citizen's arrest statute had its origins in the       Civil War era. Passed in 1863, when slavery was still       considered legal by Southerners despite the Emancipation       Proclamation, the law stated that a private person could       ``arrest an offender if the offense is committed in his       presence or within his immediate knowledge.''        ``It was a slave-catching law for slaves that attempted to       flee,'' Joe Margulies, an attorney and professor of law and       government at Cornell Law School, told Vox. ``It gave       citizens the power to grab them. [The law] derives from a       racist past.''        Every state has some version of a citizen's arrest law,       though they vary based on the type of crime and whether the       citizen must witness the crime directly or just be aware that       it happened. In many states, the laws are unclear about how       long a citizen is permitted to detain someone, how much       probable cause is necessary, and how much force can be used,       said Ira P. Robbins, professor of law and justice at American       University and the author of an article on citizen's arrest       laws for the Cornell Journal of Law and Public Policy. Many       of the laws also don't specify what it means to carry out a       citizen's arrest or to detain someone while making one.        The laws, according to Robbins, date back to medieval       England, where citizens helped the king maintain order by       enforcing the laws. The common law doctrine of citizen's       arrest was further developed in the early 19th century, and       such statutes have remained on the books even as states laid       out more modern systems of law enforcement.        In Alabama, for example, a private person can make a       citizen's arrest ``where a felony has committed''--even if       they didn't witness it--and when they have ``reasonable cause       to believe that the person arrested committed it.'' The law       specifies that the arrest can be made ``on any day and at any       time,'' outlines the steps that must be taken for a legal       arrest, and gives citizens permission to break open doors or       windows to capture the alleged offender.        California allows citizen's arrests if the citizen       witnesses a perpetrator committing a misdemeanor, or when a       felony ``has been in fact committed, and he has reasonable       cause for believing the person arrested to have committed       it,'' according to the state's penal code.        In New York, a citizen can arrest another person if they       believe the suspect committed a felony such as murder, first-      degree manslaughter, or rape. It also lays out the       circumstances where deadly physical force may be justified:       when the citizen believes it is necessary to defend       themselves or a third person against physical force in the       course of the crime. (They may not if they know that they       ``may avoid the necessity of so doing by retreating.'')        ``I thought that the uproar over Arbery's murder would lead       other states to revisit their statues, but there has not been       much [movement],'' Margulies said. ``It certainly has not       prompted a wholesale reexamination of citizen's arrest       laws.''                   Citizen's arrests can go horribly wrong         Arbery's killing isn't the first involving Georgia's       citizen's arrest law. In 2019, Kenneth Herring, a 62-year-old       Black man, was killed by Hannah Payne, a 21-year-old white       woman, after he left the scene of a car crash because he was       experiencing a diabetic emergency. Payne pursued Herring in       her vehicle and ordered him out of his car. It's unclear what       happened immediately after that, but Payne shot and killed       him. She was indicted on charges of felony murder and malice       murder, among others, and is still awaiting trial. Critics       say she racially profiled Herring.        ``Given what we know about implicit and explicit bias,       allowing people to chase after someone and seize them based       on what they believe was a felony is a recipe for some       predictable number of cases just like this,'' Margulies said.       ``With the automatic association between blackness and crime,       seeing a Black man run by or drive away will lead to some       predictable number of cases of folks concluding he's       committing a felony. That's the real problem.''        In 2012, neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, a       mixed-race Hispanic man, fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon       Martin in Florida after calling 911 and reporting ``a       suspicious person''; the police dispatcher instructed him not       to approach Martin. Zimmerman, who was later acquitted of       second-degree manslaughter, said he acted in self-defense.        ``When you look at these cases, it's about people trying to       protect an area--not protecting it from a crime, but       protecting it from certain types of people,'' Rashawn Ray, a       sociology professor at the University of Maryland and a       senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told Vox.        Citizen's arrest laws can also go wrong in other ways--as       in 2014, when a man in Virginia burst into a lecture hall at       George Mason University Law School carrying handcuffs, pepper       spray, and a Taser-like device in order to execute a       citizen's arrest of a professor whom he said had controlled       his mind and sexually harassed him. In May 2020, a 22-year-      old man in Arizona was shot and killed after he witnessed a       hit-and-run and chased five people who ran from the scene in       an attempt to detain them.        But in cases with a racial element, the laws are part of       the pernicious way that ``place, space, and race'' intersect,       Ray said.        Also factoring into the Arbery trial are Georgia's open       carry law (which makes it legal to openly carry firearms in       the state with the proper permits) and ``stand your ground''       law (which allows for the use of deadly force if a person       reasonably believes it is necessary to prevent death or       severe bodily injury).        ``We will likely hear from the defense attorneys a series       of dog whistles about protecting people in that particular       community from people who look like Ahmaud Arbery,'' Ray       said. ``With laws like the castle doctrine, people will       probably believe that good Samaritans have a right to also       defend their neighbors' property and that the McMichaels were       coming to the defense of others. The defense will try to       indicate to jurors that [a burglary] could have happened to       them.''        The trial judge will instruct the jury on the citizen's       arrest law as it existed at the time of the killing, though       Georgia has since repealed and replaced the law.        The protests surrounding Arbery's death--which preceded       those for Breanna Taylor and George Floyd, arguably setting       the stage for what was to come in the summer of 2020--and the       nearly two years that have elapsed since then have not       inspired a large movement to rethink citizen's arrest laws.        After the video of Arbery's killing went viral, South       Carolina state Rep. Justin Bamberg introduced legislation to       repeal the state's 1866 citizen's arrest law. Bamberg said on       Twitter that the law was no longer necessary in America's       police state.        In an effort to honor Arbery, New York lawmakers moved to       revise the language in the state's citizen's arrest statute,       calling the law a ``dangerous and historically abused       practice'' that has been ``used by racists to advance their       bigoted goals.'' The bill never advanced.        No matter the verdict, the Arbery trial could draw more       attention to the anachronistic rules of citizen's arrest       laws.        ``All of these citizen's arrest cases with a racial element       are on the same continuum,'' said Ray, of the University of       Maryland and Brookings Institution. ``They end up in the       exact same way. They end up with someone being killed.''     Let me quickly say that we have the castle law, the  stand your ground self-defense, and citizen's arrest. I believe all of  these should be put into the mix of review, and there should be Federal  law that governs how these State laws are done. Someone is going to  argue the 10th Amendment and States' rights, but if you have these  numbers of inequity in killing and justifiable homicides, and race is a  factor, it needs to stop.   I know Trayvon Martin's mother and father. They have worked without  ceasing. This is the saddest and most horrific and heinous results of  stand your ground self-defense. This young man was just walking with  Skittles, walking with an iced tea.   I heard the description of a young man being confronted by a grownup  and fearing for his life, tumbling to the ground with the grownup and  was shot point-blank. The grownup was acquitted because of the stand  your ground self-defense.   The Federal Government needs to intervene. Ahmaud Arbery, with a  praying mother, Georgia law requires the witnessing of a crime. I see a  man running for his life, a man of dignity running for his life. But  yet, it took three prosecutors to get to the point of acknowledging the  human dignity, the humanity of this young man.   We have yet to get justice for this mother's child that is Trayvon  Martin and many others who have fallen unnoticed under the arm of stand  your ground self-defense, citizen's arrest, and the castle law.   I think we should be very clear. I am not looking to take away the  rights of homeowners legitimately protecting themselves or self-defense  when there is no other option. But we have allowed gun violence to take  hold of the psyche and the behavior of America.   As the Giffords Law Center said, there was a 32 percent increase in  rates of firearm homicide, a 24 percent increase in rates of homicide  overall, and a 45 percent increase in firearm homicides among  adolescents. With the extreme amount of gun violence, we need to  determine whether or not every  [[Page H6855]]  State self-defense law should be defined specifically, and there should  be a requirement of retreating where you can.   We should determine that if there are States with citizen's arrest,  that the onus is on the individual seeing the crime to call official  law enforcement. We hope those law enforcement are trained to not take  action into their own hands, to not allow your judgment to supersede  those who are trained and wear the uniform.   The castle law, stand your ground, when you have other options than  to shoot point-blank and to kill people, and if you are a 17-year-old  with an AR-15 and you can go into court, and there is not one aspect of  your behavior that is illegal, then there needs to be a Federal review  of the State law.   There was nothing to attribute to this individual that they had  broken the law coming across State lines, that they provoked the  incident. Yet, they were able to use, unfortunately, the stand your  ground self-defense law. Gun violence continues to be a disease in this  country.   I would just like to, for a moment, talk more about the citizen's  arrest. For example, the Georgia citizen's arrest law that was at issue  in the Arbery trial was codified in section 17-4-60, Grounds for  arrest: ``A private person may arrest an offender if the offense is  committed in his presence or within his immediate knowledge. If the  offense is a felony and the offender is escaping or attempting to  escape . . . `'   None of that occurred with Mr. Arbery. It wasn't in their knowledge.  They didn't see it. The offense wasn't a felony. It might have been  trespass if it even existed. The defendant was not escaping or  attempting to escape. He was on a Sunday jog, which you, as a free  person in the United States, should be allowed to do.   ``A private person may arrest him upon reasonable and probable  grounds of suspicion,'' codified from the Civil War in order for  citizens to really illegally detain runaway slaves. Other Southern  States enacted similar laws for similar reasons during this period,  nothing but a figment or an action of Jim Crow laws. It is time for the  Federal Government to step in.   I question, with so many guns in America, whether it is safe to  continue a relic like citizen's arrest. There are 18,000 police  departments in the United States of America with the right kind of  training. There is no reason why any individual could not retreat to  call law enforcement or to call law enforcement appropriately.   Tonight, I came to honor those whose lives were lost and there was no  response, none whatsoever. Trayvon Martin becomes singularly that  symbol, even Tamir Rice or Breonna Taylor or maybe even Eric Garner.   These cases must be addressed, and I look forward to addressing these  for the Nation and working to secure hearings and witnesses on how  wrong these laws are, how unequal they are, how scattered they are, and  how undefined they are.   As I close, we must recognize the value of our constitutional  principles and that little book that is the Bill of Rights that  guarantees us the freedom of access, due process, the right to vote, a  constitutional presence in this Nation. These laws under a criminal  unjust system have to be changed.   America needs to know that the killing of individuals with no  adjusting and accountability is unacceptable. I am on the floor this  evening to indicate that enough is enough and that we must proceed with  the review of laws that can kill without accountability. In the names  of those and the loved ones who suffer because they are gone, I commit  myself to addressing with my colleagues the injustices that exist  today. No more. No more. I am grateful for Ahmaud Arbery, but no more  will we stand for this inequity.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary,  and the author of several key legislative provisions, of H.R. 1280, the  George Floyd Justice In Policing Act of 2021, I am pleased to anchor  this Special Order on the importance and urgent need for reforms in the  criminal justice system to several legal or judicial doctrines that  that disproportionately, adversely, and unfairly affect black persons,  particularly black males aged 18-35.   Specifically, the legal and judicial doctrines I will discuss this  evening are: (1) self-defense; (2) stand-your-ground laws; and (3) laws  empowering private citizens to make arrests.   Let me say at the outset, Madam Speaker, any questions that there  continues to exist today racial double-standards, disparities, and  systemic racism in policing and the administration of justice were  conclusively laid to rest by what social scientists would regard as a  ``natural experiment'' that took place in Washington, D.C. beginning in  the summer and culminating with the January 6, 2021 insurrection and  siege of the U.S. Capitol by Trump seditionists incited by the 45th  President of the United States.   Mass protests and political rallies that took place in Washington  D.C. started May 29, 2020, four days after George Floyd died in  Minnesota, after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for  more than'' eight minutes.   By the millions, Americans took to the streets in protest to affirm  that no longer will the people of this country tolerate or acquiesce in  horrible policing practices that include excessive and unnecessary uses  of lethal force that has diminished community trust of policing  practices across the country and has angered and terrified communities  of color who are overwhelmingly and disproportionately its innocent  victims.   Within days of the demonstrations, U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr  announced that multiple law enforcement agencies, including the  National Guard, Secret Service and Federal Bureau of Investigation,  would ``flood the zone'' in D.C.   Thousands of law enforcement officials, armed with tear gas, rubber  bullets and firearms were deployed to protect the city.   Hundreds of people were arrested, D.C. police records show.   More than 300 were arrested on June 1, 2020, the day Attorney General  Barr ordered law enforcement to forcefully clear peaceful protesters  from a perimeter near the White House, making room for President Trump  to pose for cameras while waving a Bible in front of St. John's  Episcopal Church.   It was the largest number of arrests recorded for any day during the  summer of events.   Across the nation, law enforcement made an estimated 14,000 arrests  in 49 U.S. cities during anti-racism protests in the summer of 2020,  according to the Washington Post.   Following the November 3, 2020 election of Joe Biden and running mate  Kamala Harris, large groups of Trump supporters held rallies in the  city, where they clashed with counter-protesters.   Police made 20 arrests during the so-called Million MAGA March on  November 14, 2020, an event in which Trump-supporters, including white  nationalists, far-right extremist groups, and conservative politicians  gathered in D.C. to protest the election results.   And, incredibly, only 61 arrests were made of rioters, who were  overwhelming white and who used violence, that stormed the Capitol on  January 6, an attack that claimed the lives of at least six persons,  injured hundreds of others, caused horrific damage to property and  national treasures, and inflicted emotional scars that will not heal  for generations.   But most of these arrests are related to charges involving curfew  violations--D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser announced a 6 p.m. curfew, though  mobs had broken into the Capitol hours earlier, around 1:30 p.m.   There were only four non-curfew-related arrests, compared to 40 non- curfew-related arrests during Black Lives Matter protests on June 1,  2020.   Madam Speaker, the horrifying killing of George Floyd on May 25, 2020  by a Minneapolis police office shocked and awakened the moral  consciousness of the nation.   Untold millions saw the terrifying last 8:46 of life drained from a  black man, George Floyd, taking his last breaths face down in the  street with his neck under the knee of a police officer who, along with  his three cohorts, was indifferent to his cries for help and pleas that  he ``can't breathe.''   The civil disobedience witnessed nightly in the streets of America in  response to the killing of George Floyd were also in memory of  countless acts of the inequality and cruelty visited upon young African  American men and women no longer with us in body but forever with us in  memory.   Beloved souls like Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky; Stephon  Clark in Sacramento, California; Eric Garner and Sean Bell in New York  City; Sandra Bland in Waller County, Texas; Jordan Baker in Houston,  Texas; 12-year old Tamir Rice in Cleveland; and Michael Brown in  Ferguson, Missouri.   They remember as well the senseless killings of Ahmaud Arbery and  Trayvon Martin by self-appointed vigilantes.   And the continuing need for their activism was reflected in the  outrageous and senseless slaughter of Rayshard Brooks, who was simply  sleeping in his car at a local Wendy's restaurant, by a uniformed  officer of the Atlanta Police Department.   It was reflected again on August 23, 2020, when a Kenosha Police  Department officer  [[Page H6856]]  shot Jacob S. Blake, a 29-year-old black man, in the back seven times-- yes, seven--as he attempted to enter his SUV where three of his young  sons were in the back seat.   Indeed, the history goes back much further, past Amidon Diallo in New  York City, past the Central Park Five, past Emmitt Till, past the  racist abuse of law enforcement power during the struggle for civil  rights and equal treatment.   Madam Speaker, the times we are in demand that action be taken and  that is precisely what my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus,  on the Judiciary Committee, and Congressional Democrats did in  introducing and steering to passage in the House of H.R. 1280, the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.   I support this bold legislation not just as a senior member of the  House Judiciary Committee who also served on the House Working Group on  Police Strategies, but also a mother of a young African American male  who knows the anxiety that African American mothers feel until they can  hug their sons and daughters who return home safely, and on behalf of  all those relatives and friends who grieve over the loss a loved one  whose life and future was wrongly and cruelly interrupted or ended by  mistreatment at the hands of the police.   The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021 is designed to  destroy the pillars of systemic racism in policing practices that has  victimized communities of color, and especially African Americans for  decades, is overdue, too long overdue.   This legislation puts the Congress of the United States goes on  record against racial profiling in policing and against the excessive,  unjustified, and discriminatory use of lethal and force by law  enforcement officers against persons of color.   The legislation means no longer will employment of practices that  encourage systemic mistreatment of persons because of their race be  ignored or tolerated.   When the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is finally signed into  law, the government of the United States will be declaring firmly,  forcefully, and unequivocally that Black Lives Matter.   It is true all lives matter, they always have.   But that Black lives matter too, and in so many other areas of civic  life, this nation has not always lived up to its promise but that the  promise is worthy of fulfilling.   In general, self-defense is a legal justification for the otherwise  illegal use of force.   In the instance of self-defense that results in a death, although an  unlawful killing did occur, it is considered a justified killing.   Typically, to succeed on self-defense grounds requires: (1) an  unprovoked attack (i.e. the killer was not the aggressor), (2) the  killer reasonably believed that they were in imminent danger of death  or serious bodily injury, and (3) the use of force was reasonable to  the perceived threat.   Additionally, self-defense laws traditionally place a duty to retreat  on the killer, requiring retreat prior to using deadly force, but only  if retreat is reasonably possible and will not place the individual in  continued danger.   The ``castle doctrine'' is an expansion of self-defense laws--both  statutory and at common law--in which removes the duty to retreat for  self-defense on individuals inside their own home.   This principle has been codified and expanded by the majority of  state legislatures in a variety of ways, including through so-called  ``stand-your-ground laws.''   Stand-your-ground laws are an extension of the Castle Doctrine to  areas outside of an individual's home such that there is no duty to  retreat for self-defense justification.   The name is derived from statutory language found in several of state  laws that states that an individual may ``stand his or her ground.''   Laws in at least 25 states do not require the retreat from an  attacker in any place in which one is lawfully present: Alabama,  Alaska, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky,  Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New  Hampshire, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,  South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.   Additionally, seven states have expanded castle doctrine to motor  vehicles or the workplace: Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Nebraska,  North Dakota, Ohio, and Wisconsin.   Stand-your-ground laws came under national scrutiny during the trial  of George Zimmerman, who was acquitted in the 2012 shooting death of  Trayvon Martin.   In that case, Martin, 17, was walking home after buying Skittles from  a nearby convenience store.   At the time, Zimmerman was a neighborhood watch volunteer who called  police after spotting Martin.   Despite being told by the 911 operator to remain in his car until  officers arrived, Zimmerman instead confronted Martin.   It remains unclear whether a fight ensued, who was the aggressor and  whether Zimmerman had injuries consistent with his claims of being  beaten up by Martin.   Zimmerman was the sole survivor; Martin, who was unarmed, died from a  gunshot wound.   Florida's stand-your-ground law is codified in Florida Code 776.012  (2): A person is justified in using or threatening to use deadly force  if he or she reasonably believes that using or threatening to use such  force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to  himself or herself or another or to prevent the imminent commission of  a forcible felony. A person who uses or threatens to use deadly force  in accordance with this subsection does not have a duty to retreat and  has the right to stand his or her ground if the person using or  threatening to use the deadly force is not engaged in a criminal  activity and is in a place where he or she has a right to be.   According to the Urban Institute Report, the rate of justifiable  homicides is almost six times higher in case with attributes that match  the Trayvon Martin case.   Racial disparities are much larger, as white-on-black homicides have  justifiable findings 33 percentage points more often than black-on- white homicides.   Stand Your Ground laws appear to exacerbate those differences, as  cases overall are significantly more likely to be ruled justified in  SYG states than in non-SYG states.   With respect to race, controlling for all other case attributes, the  odds a white-on-black homicide is found justified is 281 percent  greater than the odds a white-on-white homicide is found justified.   By contrast, a black-on-white homicide has barely half the odds of  being ruled justifiable relative to white-on-white homicides   Statistically, black-on-black homicides have the same odds of ( being  ruled justifiable as white-on-white homicides.   White men are more likely to successfully invoke the use of stand  your ground laws for their defense after a shooting than Black  Americans or women, especially Black women.   Nationally, the likelihood of a homicide being ruled justified is 281  percent greater when the defendant is white and the victim is Black  when compared to cases where both the defendant and victim are white.   In contrast, the likelihood of a homicide being ruled justified when  the defendant is Black and the victim white is 49 percent lower  compared to cases where both the defendant and victim are white   States with stand your ground laws specifically are linked to a 65  percent increase in the odds of a homicide being ruled justified,  driven primarily by cases where the defendant is white.    When a white person shoots a Black person in a stand your ground  state, the odds that the homicide will be ruled justified increase by  seven percentage points.   According to the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, in 68 percent of  successful stand your ground law claims in Florida, the person killed  was unarmed.   One study of cases in which stand your ground was used as a defense  in Florida from 2005 through 2012 found that in 79 percent of the cases  where such claims succeeded, the defendant could have retreated to  avoid the confrontation.   States have deemed justified killings of victims who were facing  away, retreating or even lying on the ground when they were shot.   One in three stand your ground defendants in Florida had a documented  history of illegally carrying a gun or threatening others with a gun.   In nearly a third of Florida's stand your ground self-defense claims,  the defendant initiated the conflict.   A number of studies examining homicide and violent crime rates  consistently show that the passage of stand your ground laws increase  homicides and gun injuries.   One study analyzed ten years (2000-2010) of FBI data in 21 states  that passed stand your ground laws during the study period.   The authors found that there was no evidence that these laws reduce  burglary, robbery, or aggravated assault.   On the contrary, this study found that the passage of stand your  ground laws was linked to an 8 percent increase in the number of  homicides, translating to an additional 600 homicides annually across  states that adopted such laws.   A subsequent paper that examined vital statistics reported by the CDC  found a similar increase of 7.5 percent in the overall firearm homicide  rate as a result of stand your ground laws.   This study also found that stand your ground laws increase emergency  room visits for nonfatal firearm injuries using data from State  Emergency Department Databases.   Finally, according to Gifford's Law Center, lead to:   A 32 percent increase in rates of firearm homicide and a 24 percent  increase in rates of homicide overall;   A 45 percent increase in firearm homicides among adolescents.  [[Page H6857]]    The law of citizen's arrest dates to 13th century England--a time  when modern-day cops would be unrecognizable.   The practice immigrated to the American colonies and quickly became a  convenient legal pretext for the persecution of the enslaved  population.   Today, killings under citizen arrest speak to a key social  psychological concept: subjective uncertainty, which states that when  there is minimal information, people rely on stereotypes to  discriminate.   The nation saw this clearly in the case of Ahmaud Arbery, whose only  crime was being Black at the wrong place and wrong time, that  discrimination resulted in homicide.   Beginning in the mid-1600s, enforcing the subjugation of Black  Americans was a public responsibility: volunteer militias gave way to  formal slave patrols, which wielded citizen's arrest statutes to  brazenly and legally intimidate the Black population.   In the British colonies and the new United States, citizen's arrest  melded with efforts to prevent slave escapes with the formation of  slave patrols and fugitive slave ads that offered bounties for the  return of freedom-seekers who, if caught, were frequently brutally  punished.   Fugitive slave vigilantism was even incorporated into the United  States Constitution with the agreement that all states would return  captured slaves to bondage.   Following the passage of the 13th Amendment and the creation of the  Ku Klux Klan, armed white vigilantes, under the cover of citizen's  arrest laws, were able to terrorize Black Americans into a new form of  subservience.   Through the 19th and 20th centuries, some state courts explicitly  codified citizen's arrests laws; other states still rely on common law  precedents. These pro-vigilante laws are in 49 of America's 50 states  in one form or another.   Some might argue that the intent of citizen's arrests can be  separated from its racist applications, but such a separation is  impossible when the letter of the law is actively racist.   Georgia's laws were formally codified in 1861 by Thomas Cobb, a  lawyer and slaveholder.   In the original code, African Americans were assumed to be enslaved  unless they could prove free status.   Georgia's Citizen's Arrest statues were first entered into the Law  Code of Georgia in 1863.   In 1863, Georgia law enforcement was in serious disarray-- confederates were deserting, the Union army was preparing to invade the  state, and enslaved people were fleeing plantations to join Union  forces.   With its criminal justice system in a state of collapse, the 1863  code revision empowered white Georgians to replace law enforcement and  slave patrols to keep the enslaved Black population under control.  After the Civil War, citizen's arrest supported Ku Klux Klan violence  against Black Georgians.   On January 22, 1912, four African Americans in Hamilton--three men  and a woman--were citizen's arrested and lynched, accused of killing a  white planter who was sexually abusing Black girls and women.   On July 25, 1946, two African American couples were dragged from  their car at Moore's Ford in Walton County and shot about sixty times  by a mob of white men making a ``citizen's arrest.''   No one was ever charged with their murders.   Every African American parent, and every African America child, knows  all too well `The Talk' and the importance of abiding by the rules for  surviving interactions with the police and vigilantees.   As I have stated many times, direct action is vitally important but  to be effective it must be accompanied by political, legislative, and  governmental action, which is necessary because the strength and  foundation of democratic government rests upon the consent and  confidence of the governed.   Effective enforcement of the law and administration of justice  requires the confidence of the community that the law will be enforced  impartially and that all persons are treated equally without regard to  race or ethnicity or religion or national origin.   As the great jurist Judge Learned Hand said: ``If we are to keep our  democracy, there must be one commandment: thou shalt not ration  justice.''   Equal justice is the proud promise America makes to all persons; the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021 will help make that  promise a lived reality for African Americans, who have not ever known  it to be true in the area of community-police relations.   And when Black Lives Matter, then and only then can it truthfully be  said that all lives matter.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
