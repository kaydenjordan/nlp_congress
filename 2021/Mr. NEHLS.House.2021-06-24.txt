 Madam Speaker, after months of record taxpayer spending,  the Biden administration has underperformed job growth expectations in  back-to-back months. Inflation is higher than any point in more than a  decade, and people across our country are still being paid to sit home  and not work.   When you pay people not to work and pump untold amounts of money into  liberal special interests, you get a unique recipe for disaster.   The Biden economic model is failing, and now the administration is  fighting crises on two fronts, border and economic. The American people  and small businesses across our country need real leadership that puts  the American people first.   We will not spend our way out of this Biden-made economic crisis. We  will get out of it if we reduce regulations, lower taxes, and increase  economic freedom. This model did work under President Trump, and it  will work again if only the Biden administration and Democrats would  put the American people first and not special interests.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it is time to get the American people back to  work. The vaccine has been available for all Americans for weeks. Cases  across the country are drastically decreased, and businesses are  opening back up. Thank God.   Why, then, is the Federal Government still paying people not to work?   Why, then, are we still considering multitrillion-dollar proposals  when there is billions upon billions of previously appropriated COVID  relief money that hasn't been touched?   Inflation is higher than at any point in over a decade. Americans are  paying more for goods they need to survive. Businesses that are open  and want to expand their workforce can't find the employees willing to  come to work because the government is paying them to stay home.   And amidst all of this, the Biden administration is proposing tax  increases on job creators. It doesn't take an economics Ph.D. to  conclude that raising taxes on job creators amid record levels of  inflation and this underperforming economy will lead to economic  disaster.   Small business owners in this country are trying to rebuild and get  people back to work. Raising taxes on them will only hurt them and the  Americans they want to hire.   The Biden tax-and-spend model is failing our country. We need to get  back to the free-market approach that we had under President Trump:  Slashing regulation, reducing taxes, and increasing economic freedom.   That is the light at the end of the Biden economic crisis tunnel. But  to get there, we need Democrats to stop playing politics with the  future of our country and work with the Republicans.
