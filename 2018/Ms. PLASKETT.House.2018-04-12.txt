 Mr. Speaker, the rebuilding efforts of the U.S. Virgin  Islands will require an extraordinary level of coordination and  cooperation between the local government and the Federal Government. We  have, in this moment, both the opportunity and the responsibility to  ensure that the greatest good emerges from the calamity to our Virgin  Islands.  [[Page H3161]]    Yesterday, HUD awarded $1.6 billion to help the Virgin Islands to  recover after the hurricanes. These recovery funds awarded were  provided through HUD's Community Development Block Grant Disaster  Recovery Program and are a part of the hard-fought battle here in  Congress to appropriate funding, specifically to the territories.   The Virgin Islands normally receives a mere $1 million from this  fund. This crucial funding will help us to address the disaster-related  deficiencies in housing, public service, and infrastructure as  determined by local officials with citizen input.   I am imploring our local government to engage the community and have  strategic plans in this. Building more resilient infrastructure in the  Virgin Islands is critical to future economic stability. We must  rebuild the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico the right way.   Our children are presently in schools in the Virgin Islands 4 hours  per day as they share space because of the tremendous loss of  infrastructure. The negligence leading to inadequate care and oversight  of our loved ones is unacceptable. The stress of hurricanes does not  need to be exacerbated by inefficient evacuation protocols and lack of  transparency.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Congress and others to do what is necessary, to  support the Virgin Islands and others in rebuilding.                            ____________________
