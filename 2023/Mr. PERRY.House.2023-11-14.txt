 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment halves the funding for the  taxpayer-funded activists at the National Labor Relations Board.   The National Labor Relations Board is supposed to act to prevent and  remedy unfair labor practices committed by private-sector employers and  unions. Unfortunately, under the Biden administration, the NLRB has  been filled with labor activists who seek only to empower union bosses  at the expense of employees, employers, and consumers.   Moreover, their recent actions represent substantial executive  overreach to implement a radical agenda so toxic that it could not be  achieved by this administration when they had both Chambers of Congress  or by the Obama administration with a filibuster-proof majority.   The fact that this agenda is so radical and out of touch with the  American people that it has been routinely rejected by the people's  Representatives should be the end of this conversation, but it is not.  Instead, the Biden administration seeks, through executive fiat, to  impose the PRO Act that failed to pass legislatively.                                time  1800    Just this year, the Biden NLRB has issued the following PRO Act  provision by fiat: Joint employers standard, which destroys the  franchise model and eliminates independent contractors; ambush  elections, which shortens the timelines for elections to prevent  employees from making fully informed decisions about whether to  unionize or not; and card check, which eliminates secret ballot  elections and ensures union bosses can intimidate and lie their way  into certification.   Immediately after taking office, President Biden fired the NLRB  General Counsel Peter Robb, even though he had 10 months remaining in  his term and he was replaced with an Acting General Counsel, an end- around to the constitutional advice and consent process.   This radical acting official rescinded pro-employee memos that:  protected employee's rights not to fund union activity; provided  injured workers with remedies when they were injured due to union  malfeasance; and challenged neutrality agreements as improper efforts  by employers to support a union and eliminate the right of its  employees to decide whether or not to organize.   These actions laid bare the truth that the NLRB is not living up to  its mission, nor is it looking out for the interests of its workers.  Instead, it is implementing a radical, deeply unpopular agenda through  extraconstitutional means at the behest of leftist special interests.  Stand up for the American people and stop this madness.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I do applaud the chairman of this committee  for making the cuts to the NLRB that he has made. They should be made.  Obviously, the NLRB is running amuck. They must have too much time on  their hands or too many resources.   Did my colleague on the other side not hear the list of infractions?   It would be absolutely fine if the NLRB focused on unfair labor  practices and dealt with that. That is their mission, but that is not  their focus.   Their focus is expanding the force of big labor everywhere that they  can and shutting out the little guy and removing the choice of average  citizens of how they want to work and how they want to be represented,  which is why they need to be hemmed in. That is just the simple fact of  it, and if it takes it back to the point where they are only focusing  on unfair labor practices, then I think we will have done our job well.   This amendment actually strengthens the chairman's position in  negotiations with the Senate when this bill comes to that negotiation.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to vote in favor, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman. Just because we could  increase the funding and there was an agreement to increase funding  across the board to some level doesn't mean we have to. I know it is a  news flash to everybody in this town, but next month in December we are  going to be $34 trillion in debt. We simply can't afford it.   I don't mean to be pejorative about the NLRB, if my colleague on the  other side thinks this is pejorative. These are just the facts. These  are things they have done. If the gentlewoman doesn't like them, don't  blame me. I am pointing out what they did, which is why we need to take  action here and rein this out-of-control agency in.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment prohibits the use of funds  for the Mine Safety and Health Administration to finalize, implement,  or enforce its proposed silica rule.   The Mine Safety and Health Administration's proposed silica rule is  overly broad and fails to account for the differences among facilities  that fall within MSHA's jurisdiction. It is the old one size does all,  fits all, whether you like it or not.   While this silica rule may make sense for certain types of mines, the  across-the-board application of this proposed rule threatens to impose  significant regulatory burdens on an industry that is vital to our  Nation's economic health.   Companies throughout the industry have worked proactively to address  these issues through various measures that ensure employee safety while  limiting the cost to producers. Unfortunately, the one-size-fits-all  approach taken by MSHA fails to include an applicability threshold,  which would ensure it only applies where it is necessary to improve  safety. It fails to ensure that the medical surveillance provisions are  employed on a risk-based basis.   These drafting failures by MSHA ensure maximum regulatory burdens  while minimizing the safety impact of the rule, something one would  expect from an administration that is hell-bent on ending mining in  America.   Let's leave no doubt among anybody who is listening or viewing: That  is exactly what the administration wants to do.   We call them rare earth minerals. Mr. Chairman, they are not rare.  They are from the earth, but they are not rare. We are just not allowed  to go get them in America. We have to import them from China or let  China use slave labor in the Congo to bring them to the United States  of America because we won't get them ourselves. We are then bound by  China.   Most concerning, MSHA's reported economic analysis falsely claims  that it will not have a significant economic impact--as usual, the  normal lies from the Federal Government.   The cost estimate so vastly understates or underestimates the cost to  operators that it calls into question the abilities and motives of  those doing MSHA's economic analysis.   According to the National Sandstone and Gravel Association, MSHA's  estimates of exposure control costs in particular are vastly  inaccurate. Significantly, one member company's 2023 budget for  exposure controls is approximately equal to the MSHA annual estimate  for all metal/nonmetal operators. Based on communications with 13  member companies, costs for exposure controls will vary widely but on  average are $920,000 annually, with a median of $225,000.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I talked to you about the true cost of the  rule. Given the true cost of the proposed rule, it will put mines out  of business, which is really the intent of this rulemaking by the MSHA.   The absurdity of this cost estimate necessitates that MSHA stop its  rulemaking process until it gets it right. This amendment would do this  and prevent MSHA's assault on American mining.   The gentlewoman, my colleague, says it is about workers' lives. It is  also about their livelihoods, which are going to be taken from them.   People in America have the right to make a choice. They have a right  to  [[Page H5842]]  make a choice, and when faced with the facts, the fact is that this  rulemaking underestimates the cost vastly and is intended to put mines  out of business--put mines out of business. We don't mine much coal in  America anymore.   I come from Pennsylvania. It used to be a great coal mining State,  but not only is that happening, the opposition--my friends on the other  side of the aisle--is demanding everybody electrify their lives,  electric vehicles only. That is what is coming. They are shutting down  copper mines in the United States of America.   When was the last time a new mine opened up? They are not going to  allow it, Mr. Chairman. They are not going to allow it, which is why  this amendment is necessary.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, my friend from the other side would like you  to believe that mining companies want to kill all their employees. I  assure you they do not. I also assure you that we won't go to a  position where there will be no regulations. We will have appropriate  regulations with the appropriate costs assigned to them. That is why  this amendment is necessary. That is why it is needed.   I urge Members to vote in favor of this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment prohibits the use of funds  for the National Labor Relations Board to implement, administer, or  enforce its representation case procedures rule, which imposes ambush  elections for unionization.   This rule imposes ambush elections, which significantly shorten the  times between the filing of a petition for a union election and the  election itself.   This limits the ability of the employer to spread the truth about  what unionization truly means and prevents employees from going into  the election with enough time to truly consider their vote.   This rule was attempted by the NLRB in 2014 under the Obama  administration, which was litigated for years before being remedied by  the Trump administration in 2019.   This rule seeks to return to the 2014 election schedule along with  other concerning provisions. Among the concerning provisions that would  return is a requirement that within 2 days of the issuance of a  direction of election, employers provide personal contact information  of prospective voters to the unions.   This requirement that employers provide employee information to the  union subjects the employees and their families to intimidation,  coercion, and threats. What if the employees don't want their  information given out? Well, too bad. The unions are going to get it.  They will be visiting your home.   These provisions were also included in the PRO Act, a bill that  failed legislatively when Democrats had the White House and control of  both Chambers, and like the Obama administration, this administration  seeks an end around, to end around the legislative branch and impose an  agenda too unpopular to become law. They want to just do it by  executive fiat. We don't have a king in this country. That is why we  have a legislature.   More fundamentally, this is yet another example and a disturbing  trend of the NLRB--the activist, the leftwing, radical activist NLRB-- trying to remove the rights of employees to determine their own fate by  rigging the game in favor of leftist Democrat special interests.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, as I said, the ambush election simply  shortens the time between the filing of a petition for a union election  and the election itself.   Nobody on this side of the aisle has any issue or problem with  collective bargaining or the ability to unionize, but unfortunately, my  friends on the other side of the aisle just want to move more quickly.  I would characterize it this way: You have to vote for it to find out  what is in it. We are used to that from my friends on the other side.   We want people to understand and have the time to understand and to  know what the election is about. There is no reason to rush into it.  There is no reason.   What is the reason to rush into it? Learn the facts, and then decide  what is best for yourself. The people should decide, not the union  bosses, and certainly not this place jamming it down their throat.   Unions are associated with creating the middle class, and they have  done a great job at doing that. Unfortunately, in some cases, the NLRB  has outlived its usefulness, and this is one of them. This is one of  them. People have every right in the United States of America  [[Page H5843]]  to unionize. They don't have to do it in 2 days, though, and that is  what my friends on the other side of the aisle wish they could force  and impose upon us. We are Americans. We can figure it out.   We are Americans. We can figure it out. We are not dummies. We don't  need to vote for it to find out what is in it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2310     Mr. Chair, maybe, just maybe, I don't know--this might be  a foreign concept to my friends on the other side of the aisle, but  maybe employees are pretty darn happy with the work environment they  are in. If they are not, they have a choice to go somewhere else and be  treated better. Maybe the market is working, and maybe that is why  unionization is at one of the lowest levels in history.   But because they want those union dues--let's get right down to it.  Because my friends on the other side of the aisle want those union dues  so they can funnel them into campaigns for elections, they are going to  try and force these elections, these ambush elections, on our employers  to increase union participation where it is not needed, it is not  wanted, and it is not helping anything.   Mr. Chair, it is an easy vote to vote ``yes'' for this, and I yield  back the balance of my time.     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this amendment prohibits the use of funds for  the National Labor Relations Board to implement or enforce the Cemex  decision, which imposes a backdoor card-check scheme. This ruling  threatens to take away secret ballot elections for unionization,  including requiring an employer to recognize a union if the NLRB  alleges unfair labor practices in the lead-up to the election.   Just think about that, because I am sure there are a bunch of  antiunion people working at the NLRB. Card check allows for a union to  be certified once a certain number of employees sign cards in favor of  petitioning for a union election.   Rarely do unions garner as much support in secret ballot elections as  they do with signature cards. Part of the difference in support is that  the employers hear competing arguments about the merits of  unionization. More concerning, the signature card process exposes  workers to mob-like tactics to pressure employees into signing  unionization cards.   During an organization drive at the Volkswagen plant in Chattanooga,  Tennessee, employees alleged that the UAW used misrepresentation,  coercion, threats, and promises to get card signatures. Say it isn't  so. It never happens, of course not, because there is no money  involved.   Secret ballots insulate employees from these despicable tactics and  allow them to express their true desire regarding the union question  without concerns for the safety of themselves and their families.   Fundamentally, we all understand the importance of secret ballots and  protecting elections from coercion, threats, and corruption. That is  why we hold secret ballot elections for public office. For whatever  reason, the minority feels it is important to exempt their special  interests in the unions from this fundamental truth to rig the game in  their favor to make up for plummeting unionization rates around the  country.   Moreover, this move by the NLRB is a usurpation of legislative power  under both the Obama administration and the Biden administration.  Democrats have attempted and failed to pursue card check legislatively  because they can't win it.   Rejected by the elected representatives, the unions and their lackeys  on the NLRB are attempting to pursue this by executive fiat. Again, we  don't have a king in this country.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, allowing for secret ballot union elections free  of coercion, intimidation, and threats should be a pretty easy concept  to support, regardless of your party or union status.   Now, my good friend from the other side says blocking enforcement  will equal uncertainty. No, it will not equal uncertainty. We will keep  going just like we are going right now. Unions are sometimes being  elected in businesses and sometimes are not. That is what is occurring  right now.   What won't be happening is that there won't be the coercion and the  intimidation and the showing up at the home and the showing up when you  pull into the place of business demanding that you fill out the card  because they know who you are and they just demand you do it by card as  opposed to secret ballot.   Americans understand secret ballot, because it preserves the  anonymity and  [[Page H5844]]  saves them from the coercive tactics that we saw in the unions back in  the 1970s. I remember it. I remember watching it on TV, the murders and  the coercion. I watched it and so did she.   There is no reason that we can't use a secret ballot. It has worked  for this long. It continues to work well, and that is what we should  stick with.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2320     Mr. Chair, the chairwoman talks about the violence against  workers from trying to form unions. Of course, we know the labor  history, but this isn't the 1800s. It is not 1910. It is not the  Pinkertons and the Vanderbilts and the Carnegies. It is 2023.   Mr. Chairman, for goodness' sake, do all the States that have right- to-work laws--are all those people so miserable that they are leaving  those States for States that force almost unionization unilaterally?   No, it is the other way around. Oh, by the way, if you know labor  law, you know that labor unions are actually allowed to break the law  with impunity. That is the reality. That is the truth. Read the law.  They are allowed to do it.   There is no reason that we can't have a secret ballot to unionize.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time.
