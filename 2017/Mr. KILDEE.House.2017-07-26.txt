 Mr. Speaker, while the Senate is moving forward this week  on their deeply flawed and really unpopular healthcare bill, millions  of Americans know that they will lose healthcare under TrumpCare. They  will face skyrocketing costs, premiums will go up, prescription drug  prices will go up.   Republicans need to drop this obsession with repeal and work with  Democrats to fix the problems that we know exist in the Affordable Care  Act. No law is perfect. At least no law that has ever been written here  is perfect.   And the American people, at least the folks I talk to back home, they  are exhausted. They are sick of this partisanship. We have some ideas  that you might like. You have some ideas that maybe we could accept. We  ought to get together and figure out a way to make healthcare work for  every American and not obsess about the notion that anything signed by  the previous President, by definition, is bad law.   Let us do what the American people sent us here to do.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 317, calling for the  unconditional release of United States citizens held by Iran.   Unfortunately, I am all too familiar with this issue. My constituent,  and now my good friend, Amir Hekmati, a Marine veteran, was held by the  Iranian regime in Evin Prison for 4\1/2\ brutal years.   Thankfully, after a long struggle with the help of many voices across  the country and across the world, including my friends, the ranking  member and the chairman of this committee, who both used their good  offices to advance the interests of Mr. Hekmati, ultimately he was  freed. On January 16, 2016, he came home.   But it is long past time for Iran to release those Americans that  they are holding, particularly Mr. Levinson, with whom I became quite  familiar and whose family I came to know during the period of time that  I sought freedom for Mr. Hekmati. Mr. Levinson's family has endured 10  unspeakable years of anguish trying to bring their father and husband  home.   If Iran ever wants to be taken seriously in the global community, it  has to stop this practice of taking innocent people as political  prisoners, people like Amir Hekmati, people like Mr. Levinson, and  those other Americans being held today.   It is also important to note, both for us here in this body, across  the country, particularly for those watching in other parts of the  world, including Iran, that there are times when we have divisions in  this country. There are times when we have divisions in our government,  even on the floor of this House of Representatives. This is not one of  them. We stand absolutely united as Democrats, as Republicans, as  Independents, as Americans, saying to the Iranian Government and  speaking through the Iranian people to their government: You cannot  take political prisoners and hold them and expect to be taken seriously  as a member of the global community.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues, Democrats and  Republicans, to send that strong message, to pass this resolution. I  thank the sponsors of this resolution. I thank the chair and ranking  member for their leadership on this issue now, and particularly at a  time when my constituent most needed it, and I pray for the same  success for those Americans that are being held now.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 163, line 25, after the dollar amount insert the       following: ``(increased by $250,000)''.        Page 167, line 3, after the dollar amount insert the       following: ``(increased by $250,000)''.        Page 167, line 14, after the dollar amount insert the       following: ``(increased by $250,000)''.        Page 176, line 18, after the dollar amount insert the       following: ``(reduced by $250,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is actually quite simple. It  would expand the House Wounded Warrior Fellowship Program to ensure  that even more wounded veterans have the opportunity to work here in  Congress and contribute their talents to our work here.   We need more veterans in public service. This amendment would provide  additional opportunities for veterans to continue to serve their  country here in the House of Representatives as legislative fellows.   I think we know that these veterans bring a particular perspective  and a particular set of experiences unlike anything else we hear, and  this perspective should inform the conversations, the discussions, and  the deliberations we have on all subjects, but particularly on subjects  related to their  [[Page H6411]]  experience and their particular perspective. We need these voices  especially now more than ever.   We do talk a lot about ways to help veterans transition from their  service to the world of work following their time in the military. This  would increase the number of veterans that are given the opportunity  to, right here, work alongside us and to provide us with their  perspective.   This amendment is budget neutral and provides additional  opportunities for veterans to help us in our work. I think it is the  right thing. I urge my colleagues to support it.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan), the ranking  member of the subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I would just like to express my  appreciation to Chairman Yoder for his support and for Ranking Member  Ryan for their bipartisan support of this effort. It is the right thing  to do. It will make a difference in the work that we do and especially  will make a difference for those returning wounded warriors to give  them a chance to start a career perhaps.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee).   The amendment was agreed to.                     Amendment No. 4 offered by Mr. Perry    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4  printed in House Report 115-259.
