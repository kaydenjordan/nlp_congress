 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and legacy of Jim Brown, one of the greatest football players of all  time and considered by many to be the greatest lacrosse player of all  time.   Born on St. Simons Island, Georgia, Mr. Brown was a powerhouse both  on and off the field, bringing the Cleveland Browns three league  championship games while also advocating for civil rights.   He spoke out against violence, encouraged young African Americans to  get involved in community work, founded the Amer-I-Can Foundation for  Social Change to help inner-city youth, and promoted economic  opportunities for minority-owned businesses.   In his professional career, Mr. Brown was a Pro Bowl invitee every  single season he played and the NFL's most valuable player three times.  He carried the ball over 2,000 times for over 12,000 rushing yards,  scoring 106 touchdowns. At the time of his retirement, those were all  records. To date, he is still the only NFL player in history to average  over 100 rushing yards each game he played in.   Mr. Brown's tenacity and dedication throughout all that he did on and  off the field should serve as an example for all of us. We mourn the  loss of Jim Brown, and I offer my sincere thoughts and prayers to his  family.  [[Page H2734]]                                ____________________
