 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, a free, independent press is vital to our  democracy, and it is vital to communities from Kansas to Ohio and  across this country.   Reporters are not enemies of the people. They do vital work not just  in Washington but around the country. I want to continue my, more or  less, weekly honoring of local reporters who are doing their jobs, who  understand that a free press is crucial to a free country and a free  people.   This past week, I have been all over Ohio, from talking about  investing in national security jobs in Dayton to meeting with local  leaders tackling the opioid epidemic in Findlay, to promoting auto jobs  in Lima, Toledo, and Cleveland. At every one of these stops, I talk  with Ohio reporters who are out there doing their jobs, covering the  important stories in their communities. Local journalists do that kind  of reporting in every community in Ohio, in Kansas, and across this  country.   Earlier this month, the Circleville Herald--a town 25, 30 miles south  of Columbus, straight down U.S. 23--ran a story on the upcoming  Veterans' Benefits Day in Pickaway County on August 25, reported by  local reporter Heather Barr. The reporter talked with the executive  director of the Pickaway County Veterans' Services Office, who said  that veterans don't realize there is someone in their county to help  them.  [[Page S5610]]  That is why they set up this event, to show veterans all the services  available through the local county Veterans' Services Office and the  Chillicothe Veterans' Administration Medical Center. I would add, Ohio  is one of the lucky States in the country. Not nearly every State does  this. Every single county has a Veterans' Service Office whose only  function is to serve veterans.   Through its work, the Circleville Herald and local reporters like Ms.  Barr are informing their community about ways veterans can get  assistance with the benefits they have earned--everything from help  applying for benefits to transportation to the Chillicothe VA or the  Dayton VA or wherever, to VA appointments in local community-based  outpatient clinics. That is the kind of work Ms. Barr does. That is the  kind of work local communities' journalists do all over this country.  This kind of reporting is what journalists do every day in my State. So  when I hear the President of the United States call journalists enemies  of the people, I think of Heather Barr; I think of reporters in  Cleveland and Akron and smaller cities like Mansfield and smaller towns  yet like Van Wert and Wapakoneta. They serve their readers. They serve  their viewers. They serve their communities. They deserve our respect,  not the venom of the President of the United States.                                Auto Industry    Mr. President, over the past week, I have traveled my State visiting  communities that rely on the American auto industry--Ford in Lima, Jeep  in Toledo, the Ford engine plant in Cleveland. This Monday, I will go  to Youngstown, which relies on GM, and Lordstown. I can personally  attest to how great these cars are.   A number of members of my family, including my wife and me, for years  drove a Chevy Cruz made by union workers in Lordstown, near Youngstown,  OH. A couple years ago, my wife and I each bought Jeep Cherokees made  by union labor in Toledo. I can speak to how great these cars are  because in October of 2016, a young man ran a stop sign--I was in the  passenger seat--hit the Jeep right where I sat and knocked this Jeep  30, 40 feet off the road. Neither I nor the gentleman driving, Will  Young, were injured because of American-made steel, the American-made  Jeep itself made in Toledo, and because of the U.S. Government, with  airbags and seatbelts and all the kinds of rules they have set for auto  safety.   We know American cars, made by American workers with American steel,  are the best in the world. Too often, though, American workers and  American suppliers aren't competing on a level playing field. Last  fall, in the tax giveaway to corporations, Republicans in Congress  created--believe it or not, they didn't close loopholes that encouraged  companies to move overseas; they created a big, new incentive to send  jobs overseas. They allow companies to pay 10.5 percent in taxes on  their overseas profits while in the United States they pay a 23-percent  corporate tax rate.   What it says to a company in Mansfield, OH, or Ravenna, OH, or  Zanesville, OH, that shuts down and thinks about moving overseas: You  have a 21-percent corporate rate if you are in Youngstown, but if you  move to Reynosa, Mexico, you have a 10.5-percent rate. So what the  Republican leadership said when they passed this tax bill was--it was  like handing out a 50-percent-off coupon to companies that send jobs  overseas. Why would we do that? We see the consequences of bad trade  policy, bad tax policy at plants across Ohio and in communities in my  State.   Earlier this summer--pretty unbelievable--on the very same day  General Motors laid off the entire second shift, more than 1,000  workers--the same day General Motors laid off more than 1,000 workers  in Lordstown, OH, a 50-year-old plant there, and it is a historic  plant, we got word the same day that GM plans to build its new Chevy  Blazer in Mexico. The company is laying off their Ohio plant. They  could have retooled. They got billions of dollars in tax cuts under the  Republican tax bill. They could have used some of that money to retool  in Lordstown with a trained workforce. Instead, they are bypassing  American workers. They are setting up the plant in Mexico. They are  sending more jobs to Mexico. Announcements like GM's are proof we need  to do more to keep auto jobs in the United States. Stop rewarding  companies that send jobs overseas.   A moment ago, I said it is like giving them a 50-percent-off coupon  on their tax bills. That is why, this month, I introduced legislation  to help us level the playing field with foreign competition by making  it more affordable to American-made cars and trucks and revoking-- revoking--that special GOP tax cut for auto companies that send jobs  overseas.   The American Cars, American Jobs Act, two simple parts. First,  customers who buy cars made in the United States get $3,500 off. If you  by a new car made by American workers with principally American  components, you get $3,500 off. The discount would apply to some 100  cars, trucks, and SUVs, including all passenger vehicles assembled in  Ohio.   Second, companies that cut the number of American jobs they had on  the day the GOP tax bill passed and add those jobs overseas lose a tax  break they get on some of those overseas profits. It says that when an  auto company chooses to send jobs overseas, they lose that 50-percent- off coupon. They pay the full 21 percent.   So, again, GM in Lordstown pays a 21-percent corporate tax rate, but  thanks to the President and the Republican Congress, if they move to  Mexico, they pay a 10.5-percent corporate tax rate. How morally  bankrupt is that and how stupid is that economic policy? So 21 percent  if they are in the United States, 10.5 percent--half off--if they go to  Mexico.   I heard from Ohioans this past week about what our legislation would  mean to their plant. Mike Copeland, president of UAW Local 1219 in  Lima, said:         We need a level playing field to compete with foreign       manufacturers. . . . The U.S. auto industry has made a       magnificent recovery on the backs of hard working people       across the country.    I would count in that list of hard-working people certainly the  autoworkers at the assembly plant, certainly the workers--union and  nonunion--in the supply chain for that plant but also American  taxpayers who helped to bail out the auto industry. We all got our  money back as taxpayers from the auto industry, but, nonetheless, they  helped in a big way.   He goes on to say:         We are in the fight of our lives for every job, every day;       the American Cars, American Jobs Act will help us fight for       those jobs.    Jeep worker Mario Duran, in Toledo, said:         It's important to my family, it's important to the whole       community here that we keep selling our American-made       product. If we don't have people buying our cars, we lose       jobs.    It is not just workers. I heard from mayors and chambers of commerce  that back this bill. The mayor of Lima, Mayor Berger, came to the union  hall in Lima, joining the president of the chamber of commerce, and  spoke up for this bill. Jed Metzger, the president of the Lima Chamber  of Commerce, told me our bill ``would make our American companies more  competitive with foreign auto workers and make it more costly for  companies to choose to offshore their production overseas.'' So we are  incentivizing people to produce here, and we are penalizing them if  they shut down production and move overseas.   The Toledo Blade editorial board agrees. They called our bill ``a  solid proposal to support the U.S. auto industry.'' It rewards  consumers who support American manufacturing in this country and who  believe it is patriotic and good public policy.   The world was reminded 8 years ago to never bet against the American  auto industry and the workers who are the engine behind it. We invested  in saving this industry. Yet we continue to have a trade and tax policy  that undermines it. In fact, it is worse. It is worse than it was 2  years ago because of this break. Again, if you are in Youngstown, you  pay a 21-percent tax rate; if you move to Mexico, you pay a 10.5-tax  rate.   That 50-percent-off tax coupon given to companies that go overseas  just makes no sense. Let's come together in this legislation to change  that. Let's level the playing field for American cars and for American  workers.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion
