 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Women's  History Month and to honor Carol McBride Pirsch, who served 18 years in  the Nebraska State legislature, and 8 years on the Douglas County Board  of  [[Page H1213]]  Commissioners. Through her various roles in Omaha, she has dedicated  her time and service to bettering our community.   As an Omaha native, she attended Beals Grade School, Central High  School, and the University of Nebraska at Omaha.   One of only three women in the 49 member Nebraska Unicameral, Carol's  most notable accomplishments include protecting and informing victims  of crime by providing guidance and support to pass the Crime Victims  Bill of Rights and the Truth in Sentencing bills.   In 1984 she was the first president of the Nebraska Coalition for  Victims of Crime, an organization that established an ongoing statewide  coalition for victims of crime, and a fund to establish victim/witness  centers in Nebraska.   She also worked to protect homeowners with legislation that  prohibited a lien from being placed on a home if contractors failed to  pay sub-contractors for their work.   Carol valued the relationships she made while in office and believed  most representatives were accessible, respectful, and willing to  discuss issues. In the nonpartisan Nebraska Unicameral, she worked  together to find solutions and pass bills that would benefit Nebraska  statewide.   Active in her community, she was a member of the Omaha Community  Committee, the Juvenile Court Nominating Commission, the Mayor's  Commission of the Status of Women, Omaha Jaycees, several parent- teacher associations, many women's civic organizations, and the Centris  Federal Credit Union Board. She was also involved in the Order of Women  Legislators, the Omaha Area Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse, the  YWCA, the Omaha Library Board, the Developmental Disabilities Council,  the Women in Management Association, and the Nebraska Coalition for  Victims of Crime. She did it all.   Although retired, Carol has encouraged many to get involved and feels  that even if you have retired or are not in public service there are  many roles and ways to serve our community.   But above all else, Carol believes her greatest accomplishment is  raising her six children alongside her husband Allen, whom she married  in 1954. They all earned bachelor's degrees and have additional  education certifications and degrees because of the importance placed  on education in their family.   Mr. Speaker, I cherish Carol's friendship and I treasure the wisdom  she has shared with me and others. I admire this wonderful lady, this  great American patriot.                            ____________________
