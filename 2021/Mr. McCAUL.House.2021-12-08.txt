 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking Chairman Meeks and Chairman  McGovern for bringing this important human rights legislation to this  floor. It is high time.   I want to start this debate with the simple truth that we cannot  afford to forget. Truly, free trade cannot involve slave labor.   Today, the Chinese Communist Party is using the forced labor of the  Uyghurs and other minorities to help bankroll its genocide against  these very same groups.                                time  1330    The repression taking place right now in Xinjiang is breathtaking in  its scope and its brutality. It involves the detention of more than 1  million people in concentration camps. It also involves surveillance  and intensive brainwashing on a massive scale. It involves breaking up  families and taking children from their parents. And it involves forced  sterilization and forced abortions.   This should be a terrifying warning not only to China's neighbors and  to the American people but also to the world. The Chinese Communist  Party is fundamentally focused on expanding its power and its  authoritarian style of government. It views things that it does not  control, like religion, cultural identity, and the yearning of all  people for freedom, as threats that must be destroyed. Because we have  drawn the CCP into many of our most critical supply chains, it has the  ability to hold our national security hostage while it uses U.S.  consumers to subsidize its atrocities.   As many as one in five cotton garments globally are potentially  tainted with Uyghur slave labor. Last year alone, U.S. Customs and  Border Protection seized a 13-ton shipment of human hair that  originated in Xinjiang's forced labor system. It is brazen, and it is  sickening.   We must refuse to be complicit in the CCP's genocide against the  Uyghurs, and for that reason, I support the measure before us today.   I wish we could have taken this up earlier. After sending a letter to  the Speaker, we are finally at the day where we are now. Last Congress,  this legislation went straight to the floor. Two weeks ago, 10 members  of the Foreign Affairs Committee joined me in a letter urging the  Speaker to move this bill. I am grateful that our message was received.  But we could send this legislation to the President's desk today by  taking up the Senate version. Instead, we are setting this bill up for  further legislative gridlock by passing a conflicting version, although  I do applaud Chairman McGovern's efforts in this issue.   Mr. Speaker, going forward, I hope the majority in both Chambers will  move this to final passage regardless of pressure from the  administration to not advance the American values we all share.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Smith), the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs  Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, and Global Human Rights. He also  is the co-chair of the China Commission and has been a champion for  human rights in China for three decades.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Burchett), a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Rice), a member of the Committee on Ways and Means.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I know there is another bill by Senator Rubio. I hope  this bill, when it passes, can be worked out in the Senate, and I hope  the administration will not slow-roll this important measure, as has  been reported.   Out of this region we have batteries and solar panels. When Secretary  John Kerry testified, he admitted that Xinjiang's solar panel  production presents a problem for U.S. climate strategy, and I agree  with him.   In recent years, the world has stood by as the Chinese Communist  Party has detained more than 1 million ethnic minorities in  concentration camps where they are tortured, brainwashed, and put into  forced labor. This is all a  [[Page H7503]]  part of a deliberate program by the CCP to wipe out their ethnic  identity, their religion, and their culture, anything that might  compete with the Communist Party for their loyalties and affection.    We have a moral duty to speak out against these horrifying crimes;  but we have an even greater duty to avoid funding this genocide by  paying for slave labor in Xinjiang.   Many American companies have built their businesses on values that  include respect for basic human rights. The United States must continue  to lead the world in setting corporate responsibility standards. There  can no longer be business as usual with China. China is watching and  the world is watching.   I support this bill, Mr. Speaker, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Waltz), a member of the Committee on Armed  Services and ranking member of the  [[Page H7506]]  Science, Space, and Technology Committee's Subcommittee on Research and  Technology and also the Republican coauthor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, when international institutions become unaccountable to  the democratic world and are co-opted by dictators, they undermine  American interests and values. That has become even clearer over the  last few years.   When the COVID-19 outbreak began in Wuhan, the World Health  Organization's complicity and the CCP's coverup helped turn what could  have been a local outbreak into a global pandemic. We are still feeling  the effects of the WHO repeating the CCP's lies without scrutiny, with  them covering for Xi Jinping and with them legitimizing sham  investigations into the origination of the virus.   The International Olympic Committee has a similar track record toward  the CCP's human rights abuses. No human rights conditions were ever  imposed by the IOC as a condition for China to host the 2008 Summer  Olympics, and the CCP used it as propaganda to whitewash their brutal  oppression. They allowed Beijing to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, once  again turning a blind eye to the gross human rights violations and  genocide currently being committed.   Over the last several weeks, we have seen the IOC change from  passively validating the CCP's abuses to actively enabling them. The  most troubling example is the ongoing abuse of Chinese Olympian Peng  Shuai. She was disappeared by the CCP after coming forward with serious  sexual abuse allegations against a senior party member.   After the world began speaking up for Peng, the CCP propaganda  machine published false statements in her name. Rather than standing up  for her, the IOC immediately issued public statements to validate this  obvious disinformation and propaganda.   Even more shocking, IOC president, Thomas Bach, participated in and  publicized a staged conversation with Peng  [[Page H7507]]  that was supervised by a senior CCP member.   Mr. Speaker, it is clear that Peng is neither free nor safe. Since  the 2008 games, the Chinese Communist Party has become more repressive  at home, more aggressive abroad, and has begun a genocide against  China's most vulnerable minorities.   When Olympians from all over the world travel to Beijing in February,  they are trusting the IOC to keep them safe, but the IOC's recent  actions have shown that they are not worthy of this trust. I commend  this resolution for holding them accountable.   In closing, I want to offer a heartfelt thanks to the Women's Tennis  Association and its chairman, Steve Simon. Mr. Simon and the WTA have  fought for Peng bravely in an inspiring display of moral clarity and  support for our democratic values. Unfortunately, this is all too rare  among those with financial ties to the CCP.   Mr. Speaker, I support this measure, and I yield back the balance of  my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me thank the chairman for bringing this measure with me here  today. I also want to thank him for his passion on this issue. We talk  about human rights, whether it was the African Americans who were  enslaved in this Nation to the Native-American Indians who were  mistreated by this Nation to the victims of the Holocaust where the  Geneva Convention came out with the prevention and punishment of the  crime of genocide and defined what genocide is after the atrocities of  the concentration camps that were perpetrated by the Nazis--a war that  my father fought in and bombed Nazi Germany, and I am proud for his  service and the entire Greatest Generation.   And it is clear, the language, it says: ``targeting members of an  ethnic or religious minority group for death or serious bodily and  mental harm or taking steps designed to destroy such a group  constitutes genocide.'' That is precisely what the Chinese Communist  Party has been doing.   Since 2017, they have interned more than one million Uyghurs and  members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in an effort to  wipe out their culture, to wipe out their ability to carry down to  other generations by sterilizing them.   During their unjustified detainment, Uyghurs and ethnic Kazakhs and  Kyrgyz and members of religious minority groups are forced to work in  horrific conditions, they are deprived of food, and they are beaten.  Their religious practices are suppressed. There are reports of families  being separated and of sexual abuse, of forced sterilization, forced  abortions, and even reports of killing to wipe them, quite simply, off  the face of the Earth.   It is horrific to imagine that this is happening in this day and  time, in this time that we speak, in this age. Mr. Speaker, it is  clearly a genocide under the Geneva Convention.    These crimes are the moral test of our time and our generation. The  world and certainly the Chinese Communist Party is watching. And that  is why it is vital that we speak in a united voice with the current and  prior administrations by calling these ongoing atrocities what they  are, and that is genocide.   Genocide is not to be taken lightly. It is a term we reserve for  history's most serious crimes against humanity. It is essential we get  our response right, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans,  as freedom-loving Americans who stand up for human rights and against  genocide. Because we have faced this test before, and we have not  always passed.   Our response to the Uyghur genocide should be an example of our  character in this Congress, rather than a stain on our history.   This humanitarian crisis is about more than just U.S. foreign policy  toward the People's Republic of China. It is about the legitimacy of  the post-World War system designed to stop these atrocities whenever  and wherever they are being committed.   And it is about how we stop the CCP from contaminating consumer  supply chains with slave labor. It is about how we stop using cotton  sourced by the Uyghur homeland and picked by those without a voice. It  is about stopping shipments of hair. It is about how we convince our  private sector to act morally, consistent with our American values.   So let me just say, I, again, thank the chairman. This is probably  one of the most important bills to come out of the committee this year.  I am proud to have introduced it, and I am so proud to have the  chairman's support. I thank him for cosponsoring this resolution and  all of our colleagues on the committee who support our efforts to  condemn these atrocities.   I urge the entire House of Representatives on this vote, because  China is watching and the Uyghur Muslims are watching, to join us as we  speak in a united voice and condemn this genocide by supporting this  measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me say in closing, I again thank Chairman Meeks, my  friend, who has been in strong support of this legislation. We pride  our committee in doing what is right by the country. We try to take the  politics out of it as much as we can. And as Eliot Engel often said, it  stops at the water's edge, and this is no exception.   Mr. Speaker, this is a historic day. Congress is rarely in vote or  declared genocide on another people, but it is very appropriate today  to do so. And the international community is watching, and China is  watching this right now. They are watching this on C-SPAN, and the  world knows that the United States stands for higher moral values, and  we stand for human rights.   And that is why this bill was introduced, and the lives of over a  million people depend on it. Think about that. A million people in  internment camps, concentration camps, being exterminated, depend on  this legislation. We pass a lot of things in this Congress but it is  very rare you can pass something like this that condemns this kind of  moral atrocity and call it to the world so the entire world can see it  for themselves what is, in fact, happening. And when Congress speaks,  the world does listen. And when we speak as Americans in this Chamber,  not as partisan politicians, they listen. And I know they are listening  today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 430 and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 434.
