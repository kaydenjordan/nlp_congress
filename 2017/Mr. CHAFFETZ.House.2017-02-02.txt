 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 74, I call up  the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 37) disapproving the rule submitted by  the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration relating to the Federal  Acquisition Regulation, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 74, the joint  resolution is considered read.   The text of the joint resolution is as follows:                                H.J. Res. 37         Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the       United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress       disapproves the rule submitted by the Department of Defense,       the General Services Administration, and the National       Aeronautics and Space Administration relating to the Federal       Acquisition Regulation (published at 81 Fed. Reg. 58562       (August 25, 2016)), and such rule shall have no force or       effect.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and  the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) each will control 30  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 37.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 37.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the resolution.   During the past 8 years, the number of newly issued regulations and  the costs of those regulations have surged. By the prior  administration's own estimates, Federal regulations promulgated over  the last 10 years alone have imposed a cost of more than $100 billion  annually on American taxpayers.   H.J. Res. 37, which we are considering today under the Congressional  Review Act procedures, represents an important step toward rolling back  this tsunami of rules. Once a CRA resolution of disapproval for a rule  is enacted, agencies cannot reissue the rule or any substantially  similar rules in the future.   H.J. Res. 37 revokes the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces rule, otherwise  known as the blacklisting rule.   I want to thank Chairwoman Foxx for her leadership on this resolution  of  [[Page H908]]  disapproval. I also want to recognize my fellow original cosponsors,  Mr. Chabot and Mr. Mitchell, for their leadership on this issue as  well.   I want to highlight the impact of this rule on the Federal  acquisition system as well as contractors. This rule requires Federal  contractors to report violations and alleged violations of 14 Federal  labor laws and undefined equivalent State labor laws for the previous 3  years. Contractors must collect and report this information every time  they submit a proposal for a contract and then every 6 months during  the contract performance. Then Federal contract officers consult with  their agency's newly created agency labor compliance adviser before  determining if a contractor is eligible for a contract award.   There are a number of reasons this rule should be revoked. The  Federal acquisition system is already a very complex, inefficient  system. This contractor blacklisting rule is exactly the type of  requirement an already complex Federal acquisition system does not  need. The rule adds another contractor clause to an increasingly long  list of clauses in every Federal contract. It slows down a process that  already has trouble delivering goods and services in a timely manner.  It increases the burden on Federal contract officers who have to review  and assess the significant volume of information and take on the role  of labor law experts.   The rule imposes significant costs on contractors, which means the  government, which ultimately means the taxpayers. The rule itself is  estimated to cost contractors and subcontractors more than $458 million  in the first year and $413 million in the second year of its  implementation. Some experts believe the government underestimated  these costs.   The cost to establish a new information collection, reporting, and  assessment system to comply with the rule would be prohibitively  expensive for most contractors, especially the small contractors. Mr.  Speaker, this is where the rubber meets the road. It is these small  contractors.   In fiscal year 2016, the Federal Government spent more than $470  billion contracting for goods and services. We need to be looking for  ways to reduce, not increase, spending in this area.   The rule discourages competition and reduces access to innovation.  The last thing we need to do for the Federal acquisition system is to  discourage competition and innovation, particularly for first time  participants who want to join the Federal marketplace. There are  already so many barriers to entry, particularly for these small  businesses. So think about the small business at home. They want to  compete for these Federal contractors. They may be a very small  organization.   Even after we pass the resolution of disapproval, there are still  rules, there are still laws, and there are still a lot of burdens that  they have to deal with. But I want to cite some Bloomberg data about  the number of first time Federal vendors. We have fallen to a 10-year  low--down 24 percent in 2007 to only 13 percent in 2016.   What that means is the big are probably getting bigger, but the small  guy, the mom, the pop, and the woman who is starting a new business and  wants to compete for these Federal contracts don't have a fighting  chance. For the Federal Government to put more burdens on there,  especially things that haven't been substantiated, is just not fair,  and it is just not right.                                time  1445    The rule duplicates existing labor enforcement mechanisms to hold  contractors accountable and, therefore, I believe, is not necessary.   Revoking this rule will not leave Federal contractors free to violate  labor laws. To the contrary, the Department of Labor has significant  oversight and investigation resources to enforce the Federal labor law.   Further, if there is a bad-apple contractor not complying with the  law, contract officers already have the authority to refer contractors  for suspension and disbarment.   This rule raises due process and First Amendment concerns. One of the  most disturbing parts of the rule is that contractors would be required  to report alleged violations--not confirmed--just the alleged  violations of the 14 Federal labor laws, and the undefined equivalent  of State labor laws.   It deprives contractors of their legal rights to challenge such  allegations. The reporting requirement covers non-final administrative  merits determinations without regard to the severity of the alleged  violation.   Contractors would have to disclose National Labor Relations Board  complaints, OSHA citations, EEOC non-final letters of determination,  even though these cases have not been adjudicated and the record is  incomplete.   Contractors challenged this rule in Federal Court, and the judge, in  granting a preliminary injunction for the rule, found this reporting  requirement could also impact contractors' First Amendment rights. The  judge said that the rule could result in compelled speech by requiring  contractors to report allegations that would cause a reputational harm,  particularly if after adjudication the allegation is found to be  without merit.   This rule increases costs, complexity, and reduces competition in the  Federal acquisition system. We are having trouble getting new entrants  in to compete as contractors, and, therefore, I urge the support of the  passage of H.J. Res. 37.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the lead sponsor of the  joint resolution and the chair of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) be permitted to control the  remainder of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.
