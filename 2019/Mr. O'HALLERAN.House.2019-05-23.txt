 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a  selfless hero and warrior, Mr. Fleming Begaye, Sr., a Navajo code  talker. He served our Nation during World War II and passed away last  week in Chinle, Arizona.   He served with his fellow marines from 1943 to 1945 in the Battle of  Tarawa and the Battle of Tinian, some of the bloodiest battles in the  Pacific theater. He was wounded serving our Nation.   Mr. Begaye returned home and became a businessman and farmer in  Chinle, where he raised his family.   We must never forget the service of these brave code talkers. They  sacrificed so much for our Nation.   My prayers are with Mr. Begaye's family, and I know he has been  reunited with his sweetheart, Helen.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today, I join my colleagues to remember  and honor a true patriot and someone I was honored to know and call a  dear friend, Jerry Emmett.   Jerry lived a long, full life beyond reproach. She was dedicated to  serving Arizona. She was a teacher for more than four decades. She was  a passionate advocate for the rights of women and underrepresented  groups. I mourned with our State when she passed away last month at the  age of 104.   Jerry inspired people from every corner of Arizona and across the  Nation, and that will be her lasting legacy.   I am in awe of what she has seen and what she has accomplished in her  lifetime. She witnessed history unfold, from the suffrage movement to  the nomination of the first female President candidate.   At the national convention, the world saw Jerry as we all in Arizona  knew her, full of life and zeal, and she proudly represented Arizona  for such a historic moment.   I will never forget the wisdom she shared with me over the years. She  was truly an inspiration to all of us, and I never left her side  without learning something important.   We come together today to mourn her passing but also to remember all  she has done for our State. My prayers are with her family and with all  the admirers and students she shaped and inspired over the years.   I will leave you all with a lesson she shared with her son Jim: No  matter what is going on at the time, as long as you keep hope and you  keep believing things will change and you are doing your best to help  change, it will change.
