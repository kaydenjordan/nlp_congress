 Mr. President, very briefly, first of all, I want to  compliment Senator Hawley for pursuing this route.   There isn't a person in this room, there isn't a person in America  who doesn't want to see that every dollar spent for the taxpayers is  looked after. In this particular instance, I am going to oppose this  simply because there are already 64 ongoing or planned audits and  reports on U.S. assistance to Ukraine.   This piece of legislation would require a quarterly schedule, and  that actually reduces the number. For instance, USAID direct budgetary  support comes every 2 months.   So this is being looked after, unlike Iraq and Afghanistan, where we  are talking about enormous amounts of money--not that this isn't a  large amount, but those were enormous, and the work in auditing was not  very good. In this case, it is very good. We have been looking at it in  the Intelligence Committee, and we have been looking at it in the  Foreign Relations Committee and have found zero siphoning of U.S.  dollars. So this really is an expenditure that is not necessary because  it is being looked after already.   I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.
