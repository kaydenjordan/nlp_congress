 Madam Speaker, I rise today with what little voice I have  to honor the San Diego Voice & Viewpoint Newspaper in recognition of  their 60th anniversary.   San Diego's Voice & Viewpoint is the largest African American  newspaper in San Diego and is a core piece of our community. This  newspaper's success was the result of a dedicated couple's hard work.   Though the newspaper began in the 1960s, John Warren and his wife,  Gerri Warren, took over the publication in 1987. The couple was deeply  involved in the African American community and showed their leadership  skills in publishing. Their efforts have resulted in a nationally  award-winning publication.   The newspaper has highlighted the perspectives of the San Diego  African American community and provided a great service to the city. In  fact, the publication is in all the zip codes of San Diego and has a  readership of over 60,000.   I would like to honor the San Diego Voice & Viewpoint for its  dedication and lifelong commitment to the African American community  and the San Diego community.                            ____________________
