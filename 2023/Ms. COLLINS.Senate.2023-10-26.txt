 Mr. President, before I address the amendment offered by  Senator Braun, let me thank the Senator from Washington State for her  very kind comments expressing condolences to the people of Maine.   Our hearts are so heavy today. This heinous attack, which has robbed  the lives of at least 18 Mainers and injured so many more, is the worst  mass shooting that we could ever imagine in our State. This is a dark  day for our State.   I am grateful for the expressions of support and offers of help and  condolences that I have received from my colleagues and friends across  the Nation as well as from the administration.   I have had conversations both last night throughout the night and  early  [[Page S5206]]  this morning with President Biden, Secretary Mayorkas, Attorney General  Merrick Garland, and special advisor to the President Tom Perez, who  has been particularly helpful in mobilizing resources for the State of  Maine so that this killer can be captured.                                 S.J. Res. 44    It is hard to transition from the terrible attack in Maine to talk  about the Braun amendment, but that is what I must do.   First, let me make a very important point. What we are talking about  is whether the legislative branch of government should make decisions  about government spending or whether that decisionmaking should be  given entirely to the executive branch when it comes to specific  projects.   We are not talking about adding more money; we are talking about who  makes the decision. And, indeed, in our Senate appropriations bills,  less than one-half of 1 percent of the funding is allocated to  congressionally directed spending projects.   This process has provided opportunities for Members of Congress from  both parties who understand the needs of their constituents far better  than every Federal Agency to advocate for specific investments in their  local communities.   As Chair Murray has said, we have included safeguards to promote  transparency and accountability. First, we prohibit for-profit entities  from eligibility. Second, we require public disclosure to ensure that  spending decisions are made in the light of day. For the appropriation  measures before us today, each Member's CDS request has been posted  online since April. There is no secrecy here. They also include a  certification that neither the Member of Congress nor members of their  immediate family have any financial interest in the CDS items that they  have requested.   Further, the disclosure tables for each bill list each Member who  submitted a request for a particular project that was funded. These  tables have been available online since this past summer when the bills  were considered and approved in committee.   The directed investments of these three bills that we are considering  will make a difference to our constituents. They include funding to  support agricultural research, local transportation and community  development projects, as well as military construction projects that  are on the service's unfunded priorities list.   So I urge my colleagues to protect our constitutional power of the  purse and support the Senate's ability to make substantive, tangible  investments in our communities. I urge a ``no'' vote on Senator Braun's  amendment.
