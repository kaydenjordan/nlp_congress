 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Bucks County  Community College men's golf team for their strong performance this  season, their first year competing as a Division II athletic program.   While golf season for most Americans is just underway, the Bucks  County Community College men's golf team has been playing since March.  Earlier this month, the team secured a bid to the 2019 NJCAA Division  II Men's National Golf Championship after winning their regional golf  championship at Cumberland Country Club in Maryland with a combined  team score of 320.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to particularly recognize golfer Chris  Benvenuto and Coach Scott Bradshaw for their work in guiding this team  to such success. We wish them and all Bucks County golfers all the best  of luck as they move on to compete in Indiana and beyond. Our entire  Bucks County community is incredibly proud of each and every one of  these team members and Bucks County Community College.                          Teacher Appreciation Week     Mr. Speaker, this week is Teacher Appreciation Week,  and I rise to recognize an outstanding school faculty member from Bucks  County, Pennsylvania.   Jeff Klein, a guidance counselor at Tamanend Middle School in  Warrington, was recently named the winner of the Unsung Heroes Award,  sponsored by the Pennsylvania State Education Association and the  Council for the Advancement of Public Schools. In addition to his work  counseling students, Jeff serves as a coach and works to give students  additional learning opportunities both inside and outside of the  traditional classroom.   With this prestigious honor comes a $2,000 grant, which Jeff says  will be put toward the painting of a mural in the Tamanend gym that  honors the basketball tournament he conducts to fundraise for the Kelly  Anne Dolan Memorial Fund, a nonprofit organization in Montgomery County  that assists families raising children with disabilities.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to honor Jeff, and I thank him for his  service to our community.   I would also like to thank the Kelly Anne Dolan Memorial Fund, PSEA,  and Tamanend Middle School and their principal, Dr. Brian Caughie, for  all they do to educate our youth and to serve all those in need in our  community.                          Teacher Appreciation Week     Mr. Speaker, this week is Teacher Appreciation Week,  and I rise today to recognize a dedicated educator from Bucks County,  Pennsylvania.   Andrea Mangold, a teacher at the Holland Elementary School, was  recently named an Outstanding Earth Science Teacher for the State of  Pennsylvania by the National Association of Geoscience Teachers. These  awards are given to educators who contribute greatly to students'  interest in earth science at the precollege level. In June, Andrea will  be recognized by her peers at the National Association of Geoscience  Teachers' Eastern Section Meeting.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for Andrea's work and appreciate her  dedication for instilling a passion for science and learning in our  community's youth.   I would also like to recognize Holland Elementary School Principal  Joe MacClay and the National Association of Geoscience Teachers for all  they do to educate and inspire our next generation of leaders.                            ____________________
