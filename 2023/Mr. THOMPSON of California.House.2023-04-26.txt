 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition  to the default on America act.   Mr. Speaker, we need to raise the debt ceiling not because of money  we want to spend in the future but because of money that we have  already spent.   Both parties have contributed to our current debt, including over $2  trillion of debt caused by the 2017 Republican tax bill and hundreds of  billions in COVID relief spending voted for by both parties and signed  into law by a Republican President.   One-quarter of our Nation's debt was racked up during the previous  administration, and now Republicans are trying to use our obligation to  pay our debts as a leverage point to kick millions of people off  of healthcare insurance, to defund the biggest investment in climate  change in our country's history, and to make it harder for the neediest  among us to feed themselves.    Let's be clear. If we default on our debt, the consequences will be  felt by every American.   We have repeatedly passed a clean debt ceiling bill, and we need to  do that today. It is time to stop playing games with our debt and end  this attack on the stability of the American economy.
