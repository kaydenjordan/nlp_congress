There is 1 minute remaining.                                time  2320    Messrs. THOMAS J. ROONEY of Florida, KATKO, HIGGINS of Louisiana,  JENKINS of West Virginia, and MOONEY of West Virginia changed their  vote from ``no'' to ``aye.''   So the amendment was agreed to.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.                 Amendment No. 57 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee    The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Walker). It is now in order to consider  amendment No. 57 printed in House Report 115-259.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division D, before the short title, insert       the following:        Sec. __.  The amounts otherwise provided by this Act are       revised by reducing the amount made available for ``Corps of       Engineers-Civil--Construction'', and increasing  [[Page H6455]]       the amount made available for the same account, by       $100,000,000.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I again thank the chairman and the  ranking member of the subcommittee for this very critical work.   My amendment speaks to the need for robust funding for the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers' construction account by redirecting $100 million  for increased funding for critical construction projects like those  projects that are current and future projects throughout the Nation.   As a Federal agency that collects and studies basic information  pertaining to river and harbor, and flood and storm damage reduction,  it is important that the Army Corps of Engineers and the construction  unit have the funding to focus its resources around the Nation again.   The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers plays a critical role in the  building, maintaining, and expanding of the most critical of the  Nation's infrastructures.   The Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee  has an important responsibility, and it is to ensure the safety of the  Nation's waterways.   Some of these waterways are in and around many of our States,  particularly in the State of Texas. Not only do we have a concept of  bayous, but, for example, we are surrounded in many parts by the Gulf.  We have an enormous amount of water in rivers, and the Army Corps of  Engineers is particularly important as it relates to flooding.   But we have seen flooding across America. So this particular  amendment is to ensure that resources are there as Americans face  unusual flooding that has been occurring over the last decades.   I will give you an example. During May 2015, in the Houston flood,  3,015 homes were flooded and eight people died. During the April 2016  Houston flood, 5,400 homes were flooded and eight deaths were recorded.  The economic damage caused by the 2015 Houston flood is estimated at $3  billion.   I want my colleagues to know that this amendment is not for a region  or an area. It is really to help the Nation.   Mr. Chairman, I would like to conclude by simply thanking the  committee and staff and, again, reminding individuals that we can save  lives through the work of the Army Corps of Engineers in stopping  flooding that impacts not only my region of the country, but really  across the country.   I conclude with one final statement: We in our community are entering  hurricane season. This will be a very important amendment as we enter  hurricane season all over the Nation.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur  for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their commitment  to preserving America's great natural environment and resources so that  they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come.   My amendment speaks to the need for robust funding for the U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers ``Construction'' account by redirecting $100 million  for increased funding for critical construction projects, like those  current and future projects proposed for the Houston/Harris County  metropolitan area.   As the federal agency that collects and studies basic information  pertaining to river and harbor, flood and storm damage reduction, shore  protection, aquatic ecosystem restoration, and conducts detailed  studies, plans, and specifications for river and harbor, and flood and  storm damage reduction, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer plays a  critical role in the building, maintaining, and expanding the most  critical of the nation's infrastructure.    We understand this very well in my home state of Texas and the  Eighteenth Congressional District that I represent.   The Army Corps of Engineers has been working with the Harris County  Flood Control District since 1937 to reduce the risk of flooding within  Harris County.   Current projects include 6 federal flood risk management projects:   1. Sims Bayou   2. Greens Bayou   3. Brays Bayou   4. White Oak Bayou   5. Hunting Bayou, and   6. Clear Creek.   In addition to these ongoing projects, the Army Corps of Engineers  operates and maintains the Addicks and Barker (A&B) Detention Dams in  northwest Harris County.   Such a study is certainly needed given the frequency and severity of  historic-level flood events in recent years in and around the Houston  metropolitan area, it is clear that much more needs to be done to  minimize the vulnerability of the nation's 4th largest metropolitan  area and economic engine from the flood damage.   On April 15, 2016, an estimated 240 billion gallons of water fell in  the Houston area over a 12 hour period, which resulted in several areas  exceeding the 100 to 500 year flood event record.   The areas that experienced these historic rain falls were west of I- 45, north of I-10, and Greens Bayou.   Additionally, an estimated 140 billion gallons of water fell over the  Cypress Creek, Spring Creek, and Addicks watershed in just 14 hours.   Mr. Chair, during the May 2015 Houston flood, 3,015 homes were  flooded and 8 persons died; during the April 2016 Houston flood, 5,400  homes were flooded and 8 deaths recorded.   The economic damage caused by the 2015 Houston flood is estimated at  $3 billion; the 2016 estimate is being compiled and is estimated to be  well above $2 billion.   Mr. Chair, minimizing the risk of flood damage to the Houston and  Harris County metropolitan area, the nation's 4th largest, is a matter  of national significance because the region is one of the nation's  major technology, energy, finance, export and medical centers:   1. Port of Houston is the largest bulk port in the world;   2. Texas Medical Center is a world renowned teaching, research and  treatment center;   3. Houston is home to the largest conglomeration of foreign bank  representation and second only to New York City as home to the most  Fortune 500 companies; and   4. The Houston Watershed Assessment study area sits within major  Hurricane Evacuation arteries for the larger Galveston Gulf Coast  region.   I ask my colleagues to join me and support Jackson Lee Amendment No.  57.   I thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur for their work in  shepherding this bill to the floor.   Mr. Chairman, I ask support for the Jackson Lee amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   The amendment was agreed to.                 Amendment No. 58 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 58  printed in House Report 115-259.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division D (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act for       ``Department of Energy--Energy Programs--Science'' may be       used in contravention of the Department of Energy       Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a very simple  amendment that promotes STEM education, which is really a vital part of  the future of this Nation.   In particular, my amendment says: ``None of the funds made available  by this act for `Department of Energy--Energy Programs--Science' may be  used in contravention of the Department of Energy Organization Act.''   This amendment was approved and adopted just in the last session.  Twenty years ago, on February 11, we were directed to identify and  address the disproportionately high and adverse human health or  environmental effects of their actions on minority and low-income  populations.   The Department of Energy ceased to provide equal access in these  opportunities for underrepresented groups in STEM, including  minorities, Native Americans, and women.   Mr. Chairman, women and minorities make up 70 percent of college  students, but only 45 percent of undergraduates  [[Page H6456]]  are STEM degree holders. This large pool of untapped talent is a great  potential source of STEM professional, but it also deprives the United  States of its best minds to be able to help it in the 21st century.   As the Nation's demographics are shifting and now more children under  the age of 1 are minorities, it is critical that we close the gap in  the number of minorities who seek system opportunities.   Mr. Chairman, there are still a great many scientific riddles left to  be solved. And perhaps one of these days, a minority engineer or  biologist will come up with some of the solutions.   As many have done in the past, the larger point is that we need more  STEM educators and more minorities to qualify them. My amendment turns  our importance to the importance of energy and science education  programs, funded in part by this bill, and will help to ensure that  members of unrepresented communities are not placed at a disadvantage  when it comes to environmental sustainability, preservation, and  health.                                time  2330    Mr. Chairman, in closing, let me take note of some of the colleagues  that I have had the privilege of being neighbors to. NASA's Johnson  Space Center is, if I might say, one of the neighbors of my community,  great respect for the astronauts; Major Bolden, who serves as head of  NASA; and Mae Jemison is my neighbor, the first African-American woman  who went into space. I want more of those individuals coming from our  Nation's schools, and I ask my colleagues to support this amendment  that will encourage those in low-income communities and minorities,  Native Americans, and others to join in and support the opportunities  for STEM education.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Simpson and Ranking Member Kaptur  for shepherding this legislation to the floor and for their commitment  to preserving America's great natural environment and resources so that  they can serve and be enjoyed by generations to come.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 58 simply provides that:   ``None of the funds made available by this Act for `Department of  Energy--Energy Programs--Science' be used in contravention of the  Department of Energy Organization Act (42 U.S.C. 7101 et seq.).''   This amendment was approved and adopted in identical form on April  29, 2015, during the 114th Congress as an amendment to H.R. 2028, the  Energy and Water Resources Appropriations Act of 2016.   Mr. Chair, twenty years ago, on February 11, 1994, President Clinton  issued Executive Order 12898, directing federal agencies to identify  and address the disproportionately high and adverse human health or  environmental effects of their actions on minority and low-income  populations.   The Department of Energy seeks to provide equal access in these  opportunities for underrepresented groups in STEM, including  minorities, Native Americans, and women.   Mr. Chair, women and minorities make up 70 percent of college  students, but only 45 percent of undergraduate STEM degree holders.   This large pool of untapped talent is a great potential source of  STEM professionals.   As the nation's demographics are shifting and now most children under  the age of one are minorities, it is critical that we close the gap in  the number of minorities who seek STEM opportunities.   I encourage Energy Secretary Perry to surpass the commitment of his  predecessors' toward increasing the nation's economic competitiveness  and enabling more of our people to realize their full potential.   Mr. Chair, there are still a great many scientific riddles left to be  solved--and perhaps one of these days a minority engineer or biologist  will come-up with some of the solutions.   The larger point is that we need more STEM educators and more  minorities to qualify for them.   The energy and science education programs funded in part by this bill  will help ensure that members of underrepresented communities are not  placed at a disadvantage when it comes to the environmental  sustainability, preservation, and health.   Through education about the importance of environmental  sustainability, we can promote a broader understanding of science and  how citizens can improve their surroundings.   Through community education efforts, teachers and students have also  benefitted by learning about radiation, radioactive waste management,  and other related subjects.   The Department of Energy places interns and volunteers from minority  institutions into energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.   The DOE also works to increase low income and minority access to STEM  fields and help students attain graduate degrees as well as find  employment.   With the continuation of this kind of funding, we can increase  diversity, provide clean energy options to our most underserved  communities, and help improve their environments, which will yield  better health outcomes and greater public awareness.   But most importantly businesses will have more consumers to whom they  may engage in related commercial activities.   My amendment will help ensure that underrepresented communities are  able to participate and contribute equitably in the energy and  scientific future.   I ask my colleagues to join me and support Jackson Lee Amendment No.  58.   Mr. Chairman, I ask for support of the Jackson Lee amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   The amendment was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 59 Offered by Mr. Gosar    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 59  printed in House Report 115-259.
