 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Blair  Nelson, a friend and dedicated public servant who unexpectedly passed  away on May 30.   Those of us who knew Blair knew him for his devotion to his family  and his selfless commitment to serving others.   In 2010, Blair was elected to the Waseca County Board of  Commissioners, where he found his true calling in public service.  During his nearly 13 years as county commissioner, Blair paved the way  for many projects, but he was especially proud to bring the Waseca  County Veterans Memorial to completion.   Blair served on the executive board of directors for the Association  of Minnesota Counties. Just 3 months ago, I was fortunate enough to  give Blair and his colleagues a tour of our U.S. Capitol, something I  will always remember when I think of him.   Blair's big personality, sense of humor, and positive spirit made him  a friend to many across southern Minnesota. He was a proud husband,  father, grandfather, coach, mentor, and friend. He will truly be  missed.                            ____________________
