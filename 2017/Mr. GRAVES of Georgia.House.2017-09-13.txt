The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Graves) and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Quigley)  each will control 10 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   From the beginning here, let me just thank the ranking member, Mr.  Quigley, for his good work over the last several months as we have  worked together as a team to try to come up with a product that  everyone would be pleased with, and also Mrs. Lowey, the ranking  member, as well.   But I have to give credit to our leadership. They have decided to go  big this year. They have had faith in Chairman Frelinghuysen and our  committee members just to get the job done. By the end of this week,  this House will be the first Republican majority since 2004 to pass all  12 appropriations bills on time.   Now, this bill is certainly true to its name and it is also true to  our principles. We make America safe by funding our military and  securing our borders. We are making America prosperous by restoring  financial freedom so all Americans can earn a living and achieve their  own dreams.   Now I will say something obvious, Mr. Chairman. America entrusted our  party with the White House and both Houses of Congress in this last  election. Take a look at this package. These are policies that we have  been elected to pass. This is the U.S. House saying: We hear you, and  we are with you, and we are going to get the job done.   So I want to thank Chairman Frelinghuysen and the subcommittee  chairs--all have worked hard over the last several months--and their  committee staff for going big and getting this package to the floor as  we finish it up here this evening.   It is also important to thank my subcommittee and their personal  staff as well. I want to thank them for the many hours of work, the  weekends, the late nights and the holidays that have  [[Page H7339]]  brought us to this moment. I want to thank our clerk, Dena Baron; and  Marybeth and Ariana; Brad Allen, who is in our Financial Services  Office; and until a few days ago, when a great opportunity took her  away from us, Kelly Hitchcock, who has been in our office as well.   And then, of course, my personal office, we have John Donnelly, Jason  Murphy, and Sam Mahler, who have worked very diligently, Mr. Chairman,  to bring us to this point on this evening.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Denham), who has worked hard on this  amendment and has a portion of the amendment he would like to discuss.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Denham), who has worked hard on this  amendment and has a portion of the amendment he would like to discuss.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff), who has been leading the fight against  opioid and drug abuse.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered  by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Graves).   The en bloc amendments were agreed to.                   Amendment No. 190 Offered by Mr. Roskam    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 190  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Palmer) for his  [[Page H7344]]  fierce support and defense of our First Amendment rights and religious  freedoms. Faith-based and pro-life organizations should be free to  serve according to their deeply held beliefs. So the vote on this  amendment today is one on which you should be voting ``yes'' for the  First Amendment and ``yes'' for religious freedom.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I have the greatest respect for  Ms. Norton, and I appreciate her passion and zeal for the District. She  advocates well for them.   I hear my friends across the aisle speak about disregard for local  law. Let me assure you, Mr. Chairman, this is truly not the case.   Article I, section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power  ``to exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever'' over the  seat of government of the United States, which is the District of  Columbia.   The District of Columbia is neither a State nor a municipality; in  fact, it is a District. Therefore, D.C. derives all of its powers not  from the sovereignty of statehood but from the delegation that is given  to them by Congress.   By the way, the Home Rule Act in 1973 has allowed D.C. to assume more  and more responsibility over time.   This bill before you continues to appropriate D.C. funds, as it has  for the last 44 years. That is 44 years of Republican majorities and  Democratic majorities. This changes nothing from that. It was under  various administrations as well.   This bill does not change the special and unique relationship between  D.C. and the Federal Government, because the D.C. Budget Autonomy Act  did not change that special, unique relationship between the District  and the Federal Government whatsoever.   The D.C. Budget Autonomy Act only amended the Home Rule Act as  adopted by the D.C. Code. So no State, county, city, or hybrid like the  District of Columbia can override the supremacy of the Constitution.   Mr. Chairman, as we debate this each and every time, let me assure  the body here that the District of Columbia has plenty of autonomy, but  when it comes to spending, that is the role of Congress as given to us  through the U.S. Constitution.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The question is on  the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia  (Ms. Norton).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the work here by  the gentleman making a great case on why this amendment is harmful to  the American people and to the financial prosperity, and so I join them  in my opposition, and their opposition as well, to this amendment and  urge the House to defeat it.    Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Barr for his work on  this. I mean, the language that the author of this amendment is trying  to strip is actually language that improves the quality and  affordability of housing for millions of Americans. So I appreciate Mr.  Barr for trying to save Americans from the limited access to resources  out there.   Unfortunately, new regulations by the CFPB have limited access to  financing options for manufacturing homes as well as many other things.                                time  1530    And, as a result, many lenders now today are no longer able to offer  small balance loans, which are often used for the purchase of  affordable housing, such as manufactured housing. We should be  supporting and encouraging more access to financing. After all, we are  talking about the American Dream, the ownership of your home. Don't  take that away.   I thank the gentleman for his work, and I urge a ``no'' vote on this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I join this team here in  opposition to the amendment.   I want us just to think about what we have heard over the last  several minutes of debate here of various amendments.   First, we heard an amendment offered to take away the American Dream  so that consumers couldn't buy a home at an affordable cost. Next, we  are hearing that the other side of the aisle wants to take away the  ability of small loans from individuals and consumers across the  country. But even prior to that, they did not want the very agency that  is causing this damage to have any oversight by Congress. This is  maddening. This is amazing.   I appreciate the good work that has been done by the Financial  Services Committee. I am glad we have been able to incorporate a lot of  the great work into this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I join these gentlemen in opposition to the amendment  because this is about making America prosperous again, and that is what  this bill does.    Mr. Chairman, I know Mr. Quigley and our team  have worked hard on this bill, and there are a lot of tough decisions,  no doubt about that. We have made some tremendously difficult  decisions.   I know Mr. Mitchell was sitting here with a mission from his  constituency, and that was to produce savings, to find savings and to  reduce the debt and the deficit. Mr. Chairman, I applaud his efforts. I  know he has sharpened his pencil and he has done a lot of work, and I  appreciate him bringing this concept before the House.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's  thoughts and advocacy for communities and developing them, and  certainly our thoughts and prayers go to her and her constituencies  that have been impacted through the recent hurricanes, as we do with  Florida and the other Southeastern States.   This is just one of those tough decisions that there are only limited  resources that we had to work with, so we had to make some tough  decisions. In fact, there are many areas in this bill that I wish we  could provide additional resources for.   But I am glad that we could take this from what was given to us  originally, as zeroed out by the President in his recommendation, and  we were able to begin backfilling it for these needed loans for  communities to allow for some of the development to occur and small  businesses to be able to thrive.   So I know that, working with Ranking Member Quigley, we did what we  could, and we both wish we could have done more. And I know, as we move  forward through the process, we will continue looking at this.   But, again, let me close by saying that I certainly understand the  gentlewoman's thoughts on this, and I know that all of the committee  supports her sentiment in this case. But because of the reasons I  stated, the limited resources, and the tough decisions we had to make,  I have to oppose this amendment and urge everyone to vote ``no.''   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. While, I am clearly disappointed in the response, I  am glad that I offered this amendment. I think the position is wrong as  it relates to the needs to help individuals who have already suffered  an enormous blow.   In particular, financial literacy is an aspect that is certainly  needed in low-income communities, and we can see the impact of not  having the understanding of various financial opportunities. And the  CDFI has done that, and particularly supporting Native Americans among  many others.   So I would ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment  because it is not a lot and it would add to this aspect of financial  literacy, which we need.   There are a lot of products that are out there, and I guess I might  say that, as much as we have tried, with the Community Reinvestment  Act, to assist or to encourage or to push our financial institutions to  lend to our many diverse groups, low-income groups and minority  populations, it is still a problem in getting access to funds by low- income communities.   So the CDFI and the focused addition that I would add would, in fact,  make a major difference, and I would ask my colleagues to support the  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will close with this. The  gentlewoman won't be the first to ever be disappointed in my response,  I can assure you that.   But let me just point out for the House here, she is asking for a  half-a-million-dollar increase in this fund when, in fact, we increased  it by $176 million over the President's request. So I think that is  moving far away from where we started, and to a better spot. And while  I wish we could provide a little bit more, we can't.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.   The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Franks of Arizona). The question is on the  amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   The amendment was rejected.                  Amendment No. 207 Offered by Mr. Huizenga    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 207  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chair, it is anti-coal policies such as  this that result in a market loss for American coal and clean coal  technology and cut off, really, quite frankly, an affordable, reliable  source of energy that is critical to economic development in struggling  regions of the world.   This section 133 does not mandate coal-fired generation for U.S.- funded international development projects. It  [[Page H7360]]  just simply ensures that coal can continue to be a part of our  country's longstanding energy strategy.   Abandoning support for fossil fuels hurts American jobs, and it slows  American innovation.   It is for those reasons, Mr. Chairman, I would urge a ``no'' vote on  this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, as we come to the last amendment  on the last bill of this appropriations season, I was hoping we could  end it on a positive note. Unfortunately, I have to oppose this  amendment. I respect the gentlewoman's thoughts on this. It is a  compelling story that she shared with us, and a lot of families have  been impacted by identity theft. It is certainly something that  concerns me and our entire committee.   We have worked through this. In fact, in May of this year, I held an  oversight hearing and questioned top officials about this and their  efforts to reduce identity theft. Additionally, the Financial Services  bill that we are speaking of here includes targeted funds to combat  identity theft as well as additional reporting requirements to monitor  the IRS's progress in this area.   In fact, overall identity theft referrals from the Taxpayer Advocate  are down. They are down right now. It is not perfect. They are not at  zero, but they are moving in the right direction, as are inventory  receipts in the IRS Identity Theft Victim Assistance office.   Our committee--myself, along with Mr. Quigley and the entire  committee--have had to make a lot of tough funding choices throughout  this season. It has not been easy. There are a lot of very worthy  programs that we wish we can fund more. Unfortunately, we just can't do  all that has been requested by all the Members who have a lot of great  and creative ideas to help taxpayers and our constituents.   But in this case with this line item, we didn't cut anything. In  fact, it has been flat-funded. It is at the same level that was funded  last year, and that comes in a portion of our appropriations budget  here that we are talking about. It is being cut, on average, 6-plus  percent overall. This one line item, though, remains static, and that  should speak a lot to our committee and their work to find ways in  which to provide additional resources to combat identity theft.   Mr. Chairman, as we wrap this up, I want to thank you and everyone  else for their patience today over the last many weeks. I thank the  Committee on Appropriations Chairman Frelinghuysen and all the great  work by the House of Representatives as we wrap up this final amendment  with my opposition to the amendment. I urge the House to vote ``no.''   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. How much time is remaining, Mr. Chairman.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 1 minute remaining.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, last time I was on the floor, I  mentioned that I was disappointed, and my friend on the other side made  a remark that we all come here disappointed. I am saddened by the  comment that he made earlier, and I am saddened by his response now  because this is simply asking for a dedicated person, the offset is the  operations account. It doesn't matter what conversations and what we  have done. It is a simple direct response to the pain of people.   This is a mountain if it happens to you. It is not whether we are  coming down or we have had conversations; it is a mountain.   So I would simply say, according to the San Francisco Chronicle,  identity thieves have stolen tax refunds of more than 490,000 dead  persons. This Death Master List continues. The IRS initiated  approximately 900 identity theft-related criminal investigations out of  490,000.  [[Page H7362]]    So what if you are this parent of a dead child?   I just would have a person dedicated to taking your calls. That is  all I am asking in this amendment with a slight offset.   It doesn't make any sense. Alexis' parents did not discover the crime  until they filed their taxes.   How many others have not?   So I ask my colleagues, out of the goodness of their heart--this is  the last amendment, and I don't think any manner of conversation about  what I did yesterday and what I did last year is going to be helpful.  Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment  to help the parents of deceased children.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Texas will  be postponed.    Vacating Demand for Recorded Vote on Amendment No. 149 Offered by Mr.                                   Flores
