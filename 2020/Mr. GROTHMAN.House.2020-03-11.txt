 Madam Speaker, I think one more time we have to address  what I feel 10 years from today will be viewed as the most significant  issue that our Congress has to deal with, and that is immigration.   Madam Speaker, I want to mention the issue one more time, because a  couple of weeks ago, I again went to the Arizona border to see what is  going on, and I have since talked to a leader of the union of the  Border Patrol agents.   I say this is the most important issue because our immigrants are  going to determine where America is or what America is like 10 or 20  years from now. Donald Trump has made a lot of progress on the border,  but we have to remember all of this progress--or almost all of this  progress--is solely caused by our President.   First of all, let's recount the progress. He has begun to build the  wall. When I was down in Arizona, I saw 12 miles of the wall along the  Arizona border. While it is possible to get over the wall, it is very  difficult.   The wall is 30-feet high. It is very difficult, and people, I think,  only in the best of physical shape can get 30 feet up. There is  sometimes concertina wire at the top, which causes some people, at  least in Nogales, to get stuck at the top, and it is very difficult to  get back down. So that is some progress.   We also have made progress, and we have reached agreement with  Mexico, saying ``if you are coming here for asylum, you have to be held  on the Mexican side of the border pending a hearing.'' Not only does  this cause people not to be able to come across immediately but  discourages people from Central America or Africa or South America from  coming here in the first place. Because prior to President Trump  becoming President or reaching an agreement with the Mexican  Government, people would come here, say they were seeking asylum, and  they would be placed somewhere in the United States and never show up  at the hearing anyway. Therefore, this is the way we have many people  who are going to wind up living in America.   And the third thing President Trump has done, is he has put in a  public charge rule covering people coming here legally, saying, ``we do  not want you in this country if you are going to wind up taking  advantage of our public benefits.'' It is not too strict of a law. He  allows people to stay for 1 or 2 months, if they are on food stamps  during that period of time--but, obviously, given that we can pick  whoever we want around the world, we do not--our country right now,  which is running a trillion-dollar deficit--want to take more people  who are taking money out of this system rather than putting money in  this system.   So the question is: What should Congress do now that we have kind of  begun to take control of our borders?   The first thing we have to do is we have to permanently change our  asylum laws so that in the future when people come here, we know we are  dealing with people who genuinely have to seek asylum. We should not be  taking--per President Trump--people who have to cross several countries  to get here.   If you are in Venezuela, and you are genuinely at risk for your life,  what would you do? You would move to Colombia. You would move to  Panama. You would move to Costa Rica. You won't go through six or seven  countries to get to the United States.   Secondly, we have to hire more people at the border. As we put up our  wall, and as we hold people south of the border who are seeking asylum,  more people will try to sneak in the country. As more people try to  sneak in the country, it is more important that we have border patrol  agents.   Over time, the drug cartels, which run the southern border, become  more and more sophisticated. They have spotters along the border. And,  quite frankly, they have equipment that is superior sometimes to the  equipment our own Border Patrol has.   As long as we continue to allow this to happen, the cartels south of  the border break up families. And they break up families by using  minors, 16-, 15-, 14-year-olds to smuggle drugs across the border. They  use these young people as spotters, knowing full well that if they are  caught, they will not wind up in American jails but just turned around  and sent back south of the border again.   Another thing that we have to look at is we should pass a bill, which  I have introduced in the past, saying no public benefits for people who  are not American citizens. Historically, in this country, when people  come here, many return to their country of origin. The reason they  return to their country of origin is they are not able to find work  here.   We ought to across-the-board say, ``no public benefits for people who  are  [[Page H1659]]  not citizens.'' As far as the few situations in which help is needed,  that can always be handled by the many generous Americans who do feel  these people should stay in the country, but it should not be a  guaranteed right.   The next thing we have to do--as long as people are coming into our  country--is get rid of the rule, which is the birthright citizenship  rule. Among westernized countries, United States and Canada are the  only two countries who allow someone to become a citizen if you are  born in the country. There is a reason other nations don't do this.   We want to properly vet the new families that are coming here. If we  say that anybody who has a child in the United States becomes a  citizen, the parents will follow, and our new generations will not be  picked by appropriately vetting the future immigrants. They will be  picked by whoever happens to come here.   Our intent has never been that if you get a green card, that if you  are here on a student visa--much less sneak into the country  illegally--that your children become citizens.   I think it is important that we deal with these issues promptly. And  I say that because we will go back to the days of 140,000 people being  apprehended at the border if we have a President who doesn't go ahead  with these three commonsense measures that President Trump has taken  time to deal with.   I implore the press to report any progress on these issues, and to  summarize again and again for the American public the progress that is  made by President Trump and what would happen if President Trump would  leave. It would result in a permanent change of America.   Again, we want immigrants. President Trump has increased the number  of people being legally sworn in this country over the last few years,  but we have to pick our immigrants. And if we do not pick our  immigrants, we are going to wind up permanently changing an America in  which we do not like.                            ____________________
