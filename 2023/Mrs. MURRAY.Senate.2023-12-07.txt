 Mr. President, I rise today to honor and congratulate  Ms. Debora Juarez on her retirement following nearly 35 years of public  service and 8 years in elected office. Debora retires from the Seattle  City Council. where she was the first representative of Seattle's  District 5 (D5) and was elected by her peers to be council president.  She also served as a King County Superior Court judge. A proud member  of the Blackfoot Nation, she was the first Native American to serve in  any of these roles.   In her many years of service to the Tribes, the State, and to  Seattle, she has been guided by a simple mantra shared with her by her  Uncle Billy Frank Jr.: ``lead to leave''--a mantra that has brought  clarity of purpose to her work and she expanded upon by saying ``leave  a legacy.'' Whether it was her legal work to save the historical  village of Tse-whit-zen, doubling Seattle's 2016 housing levy to build  more affordable housing, or her forceful advocacy for the 130th Street  light rail station for the people of District 5 as a Sound Transit  board member, Debora leaves behind a worthy legacy.   As the chair of the civic development, public assets, and Native  communities committee, she oversaw the exciting reimagining of major  projects in Seattle: saving the aging Seattle Coliseum from the 1962  World's Fair and turning it into a state-of-art arena without taxpayer  dollars, revitalizing the Seattle Waterfront with a new park and  boulevard, and dramatically expanding the Seattle Aquarium. Known to  many as a bridge builder--both literally and figuratively--she  shepherded the effort to add a bridge to reconnect the waterfront to  Pike Place Market and helped build the John Lewis Memorial Bridge that  connects light rail to North Seattle College and the University of  Washington's Northwest Hospital. She also led the effort to revitalize  Northgate Mall, considered to be the first indoor shopping mall in  America, which is transforming around the new Kraken Community Iceplex  to create a vibrant place for the community. In addition to three  sheets of ice and light rail, Northgate will soon have hundreds of  units of affordable housing and opportunity for more jobs and economic  development, thanks to her strong vision.   As the council's first and only Native American councilmember in its  154-year history, Debora leaves an important Indigenous legacy. She  worked with myself and my office to address the crisis of Missing and  Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls--MMIWG--with the passage of  Savanna's Act and on the Violence Against Women Act Reauthorization of  2022 to increase protections for women on Tribal lands. Knowing that  Seattle has one of the highest numbers of MMIWG cases among U.S.  cities, she passed first-of-its-kind local legislation to respond to  the crisis and funded a data specialist position within the Seattle  Police Department to review these cases. To improve access to  healthcare and culturally appropriate medical services. Debora  initiated a partnership between Seattle Indian Health Board and North  Helpline to open a medical clinic in 2022 in Lake City. She created an  Indigenous advisory council for the city and organized the first ever  Tribal Nations summit to further the government-to-government  relationship between Seattle and Tribes. One hundred and sixty-eight  years after the signing of the Treaty of Point Elliot, Debora brought  11 Tribal Nations and six urban Indian organizations to meet directly  with the mayor, city departments, and other city officials in a  historic gathering.   While we have different taste in shoes, with Debora often rocking the  highest heels imaginable, she has also been known to pull on her  signature red tennis shoes when it is time to get to work, and like me,  Debora has spent much of her life fighting for equal rights and greater  opportunities for women. A champion for women's sports, Debora  facilitated bringing the Seattle Storm Center for Basketball  Performance to Interbay and successfully advocated for the NHL to  include space for girl's hockey. Earlier in her career, as a mother to  two young daughters, she breastfed and traveled between Olympia and  Seattle every day to care for her family and serve as an adviser to two  Governors.   Working with Debora over the years has been an immense privilege, and  it is my honor to thank her for her lifetime of dedicated service. I  wish her the very best during her well-earned retirement and know that  she is looking forward to spending more time with her daughters, Raven  and Memphis, and her grandbabies, Yvie and Cyrus.                            ____________________
