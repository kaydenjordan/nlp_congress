 Madam President, we are all indebted to the special  teachers we encountered during our formal education: those who made a  subject come alive for us--perhaps for the very first time--and sparked  a lifelong interest in a subject or in a field of study. Today, I want  to recognize a Kentucky teacher who is doing just that: bringing  history and civics education to life for students at Franklin-Simpson  Middle School in Franklin, KY.   How many students are truly interested in history and civics in the  seventh or eighth grade? But motivating his students to move beyond  memorizing facts and dates is exactly what Justin Mitchell is known  for. Ask his colleagues--or visit his social media sites--and you will  find that he is wildly creative in his mission to make social studies  education interesting, challenging, and relevant.   Justin Mitchell earned degrees in social studies and history at  Western Kentucky University--in my hometown of Bowling Green--and is  now a doctoral candidate there. He is a McConnell scholar who regularly  participates in the McConnell Center's Civics Education Program, and he  deploys his leadership skills outside of the classroom by mentoring  students at his church.   While his fellow teachers, students, and their families have known  for years that Justin is an exceptional teacher, this year, he was  recognized by the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History as  Kentucky's History Teacher of the Year. I am pleased to congratulate  Justin on this accomplishment, to thank him for the impact that he is  making on his students, and to create this permanent tribute to him in  the Congressional Record of the U.S. Senate.                            ____________________
