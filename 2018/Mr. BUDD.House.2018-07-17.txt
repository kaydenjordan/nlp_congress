 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this bipartisan JOBS  and Investor Confidence Act, and I appreciate Chairman Hensarling for  his leadership on this capital formation package.   I want to highlight my own bill included in this package, H.R. 3903,  the Encouraging Public Offerings Act, which allows issuers to submit to  the SEC for confidential review, before publicly filing, draft  registration statements for IPOs.   H.R. 3903 will reduce the risk to companies that are contemplating  going public in order to make listing on exchanges more attractive,  which, in the end, will only strengthen America's financial markets.   Mr. Speaker, the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act will make it easier  for startups and small businesses in my district to attract the  investments they need to go public, to grow, and to create more jobs. I  am proud to support it.
