 Madam Speaker, by the direction of the  Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United  States Capitol, I call up the report (H. Rept. 117-152) and  accompanying resolution recommending that the House of Representatives  find Stephen K. Bannon in contempt of Congress for refusal to comply  with a subpoena duly issued by the Select Committee to Investigate the  January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol.   The Clerk read the title of the report.    Madam Speaker, by direction of the  Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United  States Capitol, I call up the resolution (H. Res. 730) recommending  that the House of Representatives find Stephen K. Bannon in contempt of  Congress for refusal to comply with a subpoena duly issued by the  Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United  States Capitol, and ask for its immediate consideration   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on this measure.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, since Speaker Pelosi asked me to chair the January 6th  Select Committee, I have spent a lot of time thinking about the  importance of what we are doing, the weight of it, the urgency. We need  to give the American people answers about what happened. There needs to  be swift accountability. But there are longer-term considerations, too.   Madam Speaker, I am a grandfather, and when I talk to my grandkids  about that horrific attack on our democracy on January 6, my mind jumps  ahead to the future in store for them--questions about whether American  democracy, as we know it now, will remain strong, whether it will  withstand future tests.   That has to be the legacy of this committee's work. To be sure, we  are going to answer questions about what happened on that day. But we  also need to draw a roadmap for making sure our democracy remains  strong tomorrow.   We will look backward at what happened and try to explain how and why  the insurrection came about. But we will also look forward and generate  recommendations for legislative policy and process changes that will  help ensure that nothing like this ever happens again.   When we get to the end of this process and look back, we are going to  ask ourselves: Did we do everything in our power to uncover every fact?  Did we use the tools at our disposal to get a full accounting, or did  we let someone stand in our way without facing consequences? Did we  learn what we needed to know for Congress to forge legislation to help  ensure we never experience another January 6 again?   That is why we are taking up this resolution today, citing Steve  Bannon with criminal contempt and referring him for prosecution by the  Justice Department.   We didn't choose to be here. This isn't about punishing Steve Bannon.  The select committee would prefer and, frankly, expect all witnesses to  fully cooperate. But Steve Bannon has led us down this path by refusing  to cooperate in any way with our investigation.   We believe Mr. Bannon has information valuable to our probe. He was  deeply involved in the so-called stop the steal campaign. He was  reportedly in a war room meeting the day before the riot and had been  pressuring the former President to try to stop the counting of the  electoral college ballots.   He himself warned that ``all hell'' would break loose on January 6.  We believe he can help inform our inquiry as to how the riot came  together and what it was intended to achieve. He is clearly an  important witness.   We subpoenaed him. And unlike other witnesses who have engaged and  worked with our team to find a way to cooperate, Mr. Bannon told us he  wouldn't comply because the former President told him not to. He hid  behind vague and baseless claims of privilege. That is just not  acceptable.   The select committee told Mr. Bannon several times that he would face  the consequences if he didn't change course. Well, he didn't change  course, and his actions have brought us to this point.   Madam Speaker, we need to make it clear that no person is above the  law. We need to take a stand for the integrity of the select  committee's investigation and for the integrity of this body.   What sort of precedent would it set for the House of Representatives  if we allow a witness to ignore us flat out without facing any kind of  consequences? What message would it send to other witnesses in our  investigation?   I am not willing to find out. I am not willing to get to the end of  the select committee's work and look back wishing we had done more to  uncover all the facts, not when we know what is on the line, when we  know that our democracy isn't yet out of danger, when we know that the  forces that tried to overturn the election persist in their assault on  the rule of law.   Our investigation is going forward. We are hearing from witnesses,  reviewing documents, and analyzing data. Mr. Bannon stands alone in his  defiance, and we will not stand for it. We will not allow anyone to  derail our work because our work is too important: helping ensure that  the future of American democracy is strong and secure.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I heard the gentleman  opposing this resolution. We are not actually seeking information from  Mr. Bannon because of his opinions. We issued the subpoena because we  believe he has knowledge of relevant facts that we need to discover. We  are not violating anything and, certainly, not Mr. Bannon's First  Amendment rights. The only violation we can talk about is the violation  of this building on January 6, and Mr. Bannon's claim that the election  was stolen helped foment that attack. Investigating that is also part  of our charter.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, in response to the gentleman from Illinois' statement,  the first hearing of the select committee that we actually held  interviewed four officers who put their lives on the line defending all  of us who work here in this body. So I assure you, my directions to the  committee have always been, we will look at all of the facts and  circumstances surrounding what occurred.   We are genuinely interested in getting to the facts. We are working  to get the answers. And that is why we are on the floor today, to get  answers from Steve Bannon about what he knew, what he did leading up to  January 6.   Also, to the gentleman from Indiana, I am glad he finally agrees that  the select committee has a legitimate legislative purpose and that is  why we are here today, pursuing that legislative purpose. So I am happy  that the Record will reflect his comments.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida  (Mrs. Murphy), a valiant member of the select committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger), an Iraq and Afghanistan Air  Force veteran and a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard.    Madam Speaker, just for the record,  again, the gentleman from Indiana referenced the whistleblower. We have  not talked to the whistleblower, but we have talked to the  whistleblower's lawyer. We are doing our work. So, clearly, since he is  quoting Politico, I want him to just get the record straight.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Luria), who served two decades in the Navy and was among  the first women to serve in the Navy's nuclear power program.    Madam Chair, the vice chair of the  committee put in the Record the fact that the FBI and Department of  Justice declared no such thing in terms of January 6, so the assertion  that somehow they have conducted an investigation is just not true.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Schiff), the distinguished chairman of the House Intelligence  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time to close.   Over the last hour, we have heard a lot about what we are not  debating today. The select committee is charged with investigating a  deadly attack on the seat of our democracy and making recommendations  to ensure it never happens again. I can't think of anything more  serious, but many of our colleagues would rather talk about anything  else.   I think I know why. I think they are performing for an audience of  one.   I do, however, want to commend my colleagues on the select committee  for laying out clearly why the House must cite Mr. Bannon for contempt.  If our investigation is to succeed, if the House's constitutional  authority to investigate and legislate is to remain robust, then we  cannot let this man flout the laws with impunity.   The select committee is made up of people of character, of profound  commitment to public service and our Constitution. They all elevate the  committee's work.   I especially want to thank and acknowledge our vice chair, the  gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney), for her leadership and  partnership. There is no doubt in my mind that history will record her  courage in stark relief.   History will record all of what we do here today. We can be on the  right side or the wrong side. I urge all my colleagues to remember that  as we cast this vote.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, today the House has been  deliberating on the criminal contempt of Congress citation of Steven K.  Bannon reported from the Select Committee to Investigate the January  6th Attack on the United States Capitol on Tuesday, October 19, 2021.  This is a grave matter and not one the House takes lightly.   As I have said on many occasions, the Select Committee would prefer  not to be in this position. We expect--and the law (2 U.S.C. Sec. 192)  demands--witnesses comply with duly issued, lawful subpoenas of  Congress. We lay out the factual record of Mr. Bannon's willful  defiance of the Select Committee's September 23, 2021, subpoena in  House Report 117-152.   There have been developments since the Report was written and  adopted, and I memorialized some of those at the Select Committee's  business meeting. To perfect the factual record in this case, I now  include in the Congressional Record correspondence between myself and  Mr. Bannon's attorney, Robert J. Costello, and further correspondence  between the Office of White House Counsel and Mr. Costello, which  states President Biden's position on issues relating to the subpoena to  Mr. Bannon.  [[Page H5766]]    First, on Friday, October 15, 2021, I wrote Mr. Costello to reiterate  to him and his client that the Select Committee would view Mr. Bannon's  decision not to appear for his deposition as willful defiance that  would lead to a business meeting of the Select Committee to consider a  contempt report. I include that letter in the Record.           Select Committee To Investigate the January 6th Attack on             the United States Capitol,                                                  October 15, 2021.      Mr. Robert J. Costello,      Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP,      * * *        Dear Mr. Costello: The Select Committee to Investigate the       January 6th Attack (``Select Committee'') is in receipt of       your October 13, 2021 letter (the ``October 13 letter''), in       which you reassert that your client, Stephen Bannon, will not       comply with the September 23, 2021 Subpoena to him for       documents and deposition testimony (the ``Subpoena''). As you       know, the Subpoena demanded that Mr. Bannon produce documents       by October 7, 2021 and appear on October 14, 2021 before the       Select Committee to provide deposition testimony on a wide       range of issues relating to the January 6, 2021 attack on the       United States Capitol, as well as plans to interfere with the       count of the 2020 Electoral College results. Mr. Bannon has       now willfully failed to both produce a single document and to       appear for his scheduled deposition. The Select Committee       believes that this willful refusal to comply with the       Subpoena constitutes a violation of federal law.        As justification for Mr. Bannon's complete failure to       comply with any portion of the Subpoena, you continue to rely       on ex-President Trump's stated intention to invoke executive       privilege with respect to Mr. Bannon, and Mr. Trump's       purported request that Mr. Bannon not produce documents to or       testify before the Select Committee. As was explained in the       Select Committee's October 8, 2021 letter (attached), the       former President has not communicated any such assertion of       privilege, whether formally or informally, to the Select       Committee. Moreover, we believe that any such assertion of       privilege--should it be made by the former President--will       not prevent the Select Committee from lawfully obtaining the       information it seeks.        Further, your letter makes no attempt to justify Mr.       Bannon's failure to comply with the Subpoena's demand for       documents and testimony on a range of subjects that do not       involve communications with the former President. As is clear       from the Subpoena and accompanying letter, and as underscored       in the Select Committee's October 8, 2021 response letter,       the Select Committee seeks documents and testimony on       numerous other matters, including Mr. Bannon's communications       with Members of Congress, presidential campaign       representatives, and other private parties concerning the       events of January 6, 2021, that could not conceivably be       barred by a privilege claim.        Moreover, even if the Select Committee were inclined to       accept the unsupported premise that executive privilege       reaches communications that the Select Committee seeks to       examine between President Trump and Mr. Bannon, Mr. Bannon       does not enjoy any form of absolute immunity from testifying       or producing documents in response to a Congressional       subpoena. Your citation to Committee on Judiciary v. McGahn,       415 F. Supp. 3d 148 (D.D.C. 2019) actually supports the       Select Committee, not your client. In McGahn, the district       court unequivocally held that even senior White House aides       are not entitled to absolute immunity from testifying in       response to a Congressional subpoena. Id. at 214 (``To make       the point as plain as possible, it is clear to this Court . .       . that, with respect to senior-level presidential aides,       absolute immunity from compelled congressional process simply       does not exist.''). Indeed, the footnote in McGahn that you       selectively quote makes clear that a President lacks legal       authority to order an aide not to appear before Congress       based on a claim of executive privilege. See Id. at 213, n.       34 (``But the invocation of the privilege by a testifying       aide is an order of magnitude different than DOJ's current       claim that the President essentially owns the entirety of a       senior-level aide's testimony such that the White House can       order the individual not to appear before Congress at all.''       (Emphasis in original)).        Accordingly, the Select Committee views Mr. Bannon's       failure to produce documents by the October 7, 2021 deadline       as willful non-compliance with the Subpoena. Mr. Bannon has       persisted in his refusal to produce any documents to the       Select Committee, and he has failed to provide a privilege       log identifying specific, asserted privileges. Mr. Bannon has       now further compounded his non-compliance by refusing to       appear on October 14, 2021 at the Select Committee deposition       to which he was summoned to provide testimony. The Select       Committee will therefore be meeting on Tuesday, October 19,       2021 to consider invoking the contempt of Congress procedures       set forth in 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 192, 194.        If Mr. Bannon believes that there are any additional issues       relating to his non-compliance with the Subpoena that have       not been addressed, please submit them in writing to the       Select Committee by 6:00 p.m. E.S.T. on Monday, October 18,       2021 for the Select Committee's consideration in its       deliberations.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, at 6 p.m. on Monday,  October 18, 2021, Mr. Costello replied to that letter and requested a  1-week ``adjournment'' to respond. Mr. Bannon's attorney said they  needed time to ``assess'' the Select Committee's requests for documents  and testimony in light of litigation filed by former President Trump in  DC District Court. I include Mr. Costello's letter in the Record.                                      Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP,                                         Attorneys at Law, * * *,                                                   October 18, 2021.      Re: The Subpoena for Stephen K. Bannon dated September 23,           2021.       Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, House Select Committee to Investigate the January           6th Attack,        Dear Congressman Thompson: We write on behalf of Stephen       Bannon. We have just been advised of the filing of a lawsuit       in federal court for the District of Columbia entitled Donald       J. Trump v. Bennie Thompson, et al., 21-Civ-02769 (D.D.C.       2021). In light of this late filing, we respectfully request       a one-week adjournment of our response to your latest letter       so that we might thoughtfully assess the impact of this       pending litigation.            Very truly yours,                                                Robert J. Costello.     Madam Speaker, the former President's  lawsuit, however, is immaterial to Mr. Bannon's defiance of our lawful  subpoena. As House Report 117-152 makes clear, Mr. Bannon had a duty to  produce documents and appear before the Select Committee. His flat  refusal to comply with the subpoena is unacceptable. I made that clear  in a letter to Mr. Costello before the Select Committee's business  meeting on Tuesday, October 19, 2021. I include in the Record my  response to Mr. Costello's October 18th letter.           Select Committee To Investigate the January 6th Attack on             the United States Capitol,                                                  October 19, 2021.      Mr. Robert J. Costello,      Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP,        Dear Mr. Costello: The Select Committee to Investigate the       January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol (``Select       Committee'') is in receipt of your October 18, 2021, letter       requesting a one-week ``adjournment'' of your response to my       October 15, 2021, letter. The only basis for your request is       yesterday's filing of litigation by former President Trump       against the Chairman, Select Committee, Archivist of the       United States, and the National Archives and Records       Administration. That litigation relates to the Select       Committee's requests for documents in the possession of the       National Archives and is immaterial to the Select Committee's       demand for documents and testimony from Mr. Bannon. The       investigation of the Select Committee is extremely important       and urgent for the nation, and further delay in compliance by       Mr. Bannon undermines the ability of the Committee to timely       complete its essential responsibilities. Accordingly, no       grounds exist for any ``adjournment'' or other delay and your       request is denied.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, meanwhile, with regard to  Mr. Bannon's claims that executive privileges somehow precluded his  production or appearance pursuant to the Select Committee's subpoena,  on Monday, October 18, 2021, the Office of White House Counsel wrote a  letter to Mr. Costello and specifically stated that ``at this point we  are not aware of any basis for [Mr. Bannon's] refusal to appear for a  deposition.'' It further stated that President Biden ``has already  determined that an assertion of executive privilege is not in the  public interest, and therefore is not justified, with respect to  certain subjects within the purview of the Select Committee.'' I  include the full White House letter in the Record.                                                The White House,                                   Washington, DC, October 18, 2021.      Robert J. Costello,      Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP,      * * *.        Dear Mr. Costello: I write regarding the subpoena for       documents and deposition testimony issued on September 23,       2021, by the House Select Committee to Investigate the       January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol (the ``Select       Committee'') to your client, Stephen K. Bannon.        As you are aware, Mr. Bannon's tenure as a White House       employee ended in 2017. To the extent any privileges could       apply to Mr. Bannon's conversations with the former President       or White House staff after the conclusion of his tenure,       President Biden has already determined that an assertion of       executive privilege is not in the public interest, and       therefore is not justified, with respect to certain subjects       within the purview of the Select Committee. Specifically,       President Biden determined that an assertion of executive       privilege is not justified with respect to a set of documents       shedding light on events within the White House on and about       January 6, 2021, and with respect to documents  [[Page H5767]]       and testimony concerning the former President's efforts to       use the Department of Justice to advance a false narrative       that the 2020 election was tainted by widespread fraud.       President Biden's determination that an assertion of       privilege is not justified with respect to these subjects       applies to your client's deposition testimony and to any       documents your client may possess concerning either subject.        Please contact me if you have questions about the matters       described herein. Please note, however, that at this point we       are not aware of any basis for your client's refusal to       appear for a deposition.            Sincerely,                                                    Jonathan C. Su,                                   Deputy Counsel to the President.     Madam Speaker, after the Select  Committee's October 19th business meeting, I wrote to Mr. Costello yet  again to urge Mr. Bannon to change course and comply with the Select  Committee's subpoena of September 23, 2021. I reiterated that Mr.  Costello's stated reasons for Mr. Bannon's flat refusal to provide  documents and appear at a deposition have no legal basis or support. I  provided him with a link to the Select Committee's adopted report on a  contempt citation to review the detailed basis for our recommendation  to the House. I include my October 19th letter in the Record.           Select Committee To Investigate the January 6th Attack on             the United States Capitol,                                                  October 19, 2021.      Mr. Robert J. Costello,      Davidoff Hutcher & Citron LLP,      * * *.        Dear Mr. Costello: I write yet again to urge your client       Stephen K. Bannon to change course and comply with the       September 23, 2021, subpoena from the Select Committee to       Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States       Capitol (``Select Committee'').        As explained in our prior correspondence, your stated       reasons for Mr. Bannon's flat refusal to provide documents       and appear at a deposition have no legal basis or support.       Because of Mr. Bannon's continued refusal to comply with the       subpoena, the Select Committee has unanimously voted to       recommend that the House of Representatives find Mr. Bannon       to be in contempt of Congress. The detailed basis for that       recommendation is contained in the Select Committee's report,       a copy of which is available at the following link: https:// docs.house.gov/Committee/Calendar/ ByEvent.aspx?EventID=114156. Should the House of       Representatives agree with that recommendation, the Speaker       of the House will certify the relevant statement of facts to       the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia,       ``whose duty it shall be to bring the matter before the grand       jury for its action.'' See 2 U.S.C. Sec. 194.        Additionally, President Biden's recently communicated views       relating to your client's reliance on executive privilege as       a basis for his non-compliance provide further support for       the Select Committee's position. As you know, in its October       18, 2021, letter, the Office of the White House Counsel       concluded that ``at this point we are not aware of any basis       for [Mr. Bannon's] refusal to appear for a deposition.'' The       letter further noted that President Biden has ``already       determined that an assertion of executive privilege is not in       the public interest, and therefore is not justified, with       respect to certain subjects within the purview of the Select       Committee.'' In short, the current President's statements       should remove any doubt regarding the inappropriateness of       Mr. Bannon's reliance on assertions of executive privilege as       grounds for his noncompliance with the subpoena. Mr. Bannon       has no basis in law to continue to defy the appropriate use       of congressional subpoena authority.        These developments underscore the folly of any continuing       defiance of the Select Committee subpoena by Mr. Bannon. The       Select Committee remains focused on expeditiously obtaining       the testimony and documents necessary to meet our       responsibilities and we continue to expect immediate       compliance by Mr. Bannon. Should Mr. Bannon choose to change       his posture, please notify Select Committee staff * * *.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, the importance of our  investigation, and the recommendations we make for legislative and  other policy changes that result from our investigation, require the  participation of witnesses who have clear knowledge of the events  leading up to and during the January 6th attack. Mr. Bannon's own  actions in defiance of our lawful subpoena for a valid legislative  purpose demand the consequences reflected in the House resolution  citing him with contempt and referring his case to the Department of  Justice.
