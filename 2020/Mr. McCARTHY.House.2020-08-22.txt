 ``I urge everyone to be calm. . . . The Postal Service  is not incapacitated. It is still fully capable of delivering the  mail.''   Those are not my words I speak. Those aren't even words of a  Republican. They are the words of Ruth Goldway, a Democrat, a former  Postal Commissioner and Clinton appointee who served for 18 years under  three Presidents.   Based on the facts, Goldway says the Postal Service is perfectly  capable of handling election mail.                                time  1500    Unfortunately, we have got bad news for her. This majority didn't get  the message. Instead of listening to the experts or following the  facts, Democrats are wasting precious time spreading Speaker Pelosi's  mailbox myths.   You had an opportunity to have bipartisanship. I have heard words on  this floor today, Mr. Speaker, ``essential,'' ``critical'' that we are  here. I applaud the few Democrats on the other side who were willing to  show.   I know if you cannot make it today, you have to sign paperwork that  your health will not allow you to be here. And the Speaker is bringing  us back on a Saturday because it is so critical to be here right now,  in this moment, in this time, but one-third on the other side must  think otherwise.   Now, let's go through some of the myths versus facts.   Myth no. 1: The Postal Service is being sabotaged.   The Postal Service is properly funded for the election and beyond. We  said it many times here. It is funded completely through August 2021.  That is according to the Postal Service.   The Postal Service has long-term challenges, but they predate  anything about this administration. It isn't being sabotaged.   Myth no. 2: Removing mailboxes from public places is uncommon and  cause for alarm.   This is shocking. We have got country-western stars putting this up  on Instagram. We need to rush back here on Saturday. But little did we  know that, during the Obama-Biden years, nearly 12,000 mailboxes were  removed from communities. Never once did we rush in on a Saturday to  have a bill that you didn't have marked up and one-third of the  Democrats would not show.   The Postal Service is actually constantly moving mailboxes from low-  to high-volume growth areas, kind of a smart thing to do. In some  cases, they replace them with more modern versions. I saw a picture  where they actually had a lock in the front.   If you have townhall meetings, you will find out a lot of mail gets  stolen, so they were protecting the packages but still allowing you to  put the letter in. This isn't voter suppression. It is routine  maintenance.   Myth no. 3: The Postal Service doesn't have the capacity to handle  more absentee ballots.   The Postal Service delivers 471 million pieces of mail on an average  day. Little known fact: People mail less every single year. With all of  the advancements we put in the Postal Service, with the technology of  our own life, do you know what year equalled 471 million? About exactly  what we did in 1985.   But we do it different than 1985. We have more technology. And  because of that, the Postmaster General actually refuted the capacity  in no uncertain terms to the Senate yesterday.   The Postal Service released this: If all Americans vote by mail, 330  million ballots over the course of this election, it would only be 75  percent of what they deliver in a single day.   Now, I don't want to claim, Mr. Speaker, that all the Democrats think  this is a myth. Maybe that is why one-third didn't show today. I am not  sure. They said their health was bad. I am not sure if that is the case  either.   Even The New York Times isn't buying the House Democrats' obvious  untruths. As it was reported earlier this month: Experts agree that the  Postal Service has the raw capacity to absorb the additional ballots,  even if 150 million people decided to vote by mail.   Myth no. 4: The Democrats' legislation will make the Postal Service  fiscally sustainable.   You are not fixing any of the fundamentals. You are not even taking  the bill that you spent years on, with a Republican and a Democrat,  with Elijah Cummings and Mark Meadows, two who would say they come from  different walks of life, from a philosophy, but found common ground  when it came to the post office, to really fix the core of what the  problems are. But that is not why we are here today.   So, as the Democrats perpetuate this sad political stunt,  unfortunately, there is serious business that goes unmet. But it shows  real priority.   This week, we learned that 71 percent of small businesses have used  their entire paycheck protection loan--they spent it all--and 46  percent anticipate that they will need more financial support over the  next 12 months. But that wasn't critical enough to be here, because  these are real people with real families. They don't expect miracles  from us, but they do expect us to at least care. Unfortunately, not one  piece of legislation in this so-called emergency session is about the  families or their future.   Nor are we working to protect vaccine research and support Operation  Warp Speed. No, House Democrats are doing what they have done for the  last 2 years: They are putting politics before people.   Last month, Speaker Pelosi said to us: We can't go home until a  coronavirus relief package is complete.   I guess we know that is not true. I wonder if she wants to keep her  word this time as well, but I guess we will go home this Saturday. But  good news for one-third of the Democrats: They don't have to go  anywhere. They are already home. When she did not get her liberal wish  list, she sent Members home. And I guess good news for some Americans:  Those who stayed home and voted, they still got paid.   But those small businesses that are running out, that we are here in  this body right now that we could do something about, or those who are  on unemployment we could do something about--you have the majority; we  don't. We are not allowed to bring it to the floor; you can. But you  picked a crisis of something that is already funded.   They can't spend the money you want to give them. Why? Because they  have got $14 billion sitting in the bank and another $10 billion they  could pull from. But the small businesses don't. The families that  can't pay their rent, they don't. And what about the vaccine?   But you did do something this week. You extended the shadow voting  scheme, granting yourselves permission to vote from home until October  2.    Mr. Speaker, I will take a bet. I will make a bet on this floor right  now, maybe even a prediction. I bet that gets extended again and  probably goes a few days past the election in November.   Who would like to take that bet with me? How much do you want to get  that extended all the way through?   What does that mean to the American people? Well, it means the  majority party, the Democrats, have cast over 2,520 votes--and  counting--from home. That is just unconstitutional. It doesn't matter  that it is such a big crisis that we are called back. There is plenty  of room on the floor on the other side.  [[Page H4282]]    It means a Democrat Member can dial in from his boat to vote. I am  not making that up. That actually happened.   It means another Democrat can play hooky to go watch a space shuttle  launch that isn't even in his own district.   It means Democrats collect a paycheck while the hardworking taxpayers  have to pay for their vacation.   And today, it means that 68 Democrats--one-third of their Caucus-- didn't even care enough to show up for this so-called emergency  session.   It is critical. I have heard you say it. We cannot wait. We cannot  wait one day. We need to be here and now. Now, I believe that is true,  but not about the post office; about those millions of Americans who  need us to act.   Every time we brought legislation to this floor dealing with the  COVID situation, it seems to me the Speaker has been able to hold it  up. I don't know. Maybe you want to try to hold it up past the  election. It seems to me that would be playing politics. It seems to me  that would be a dereliction of duty. It is not how you empower the  people's voice in Washington; it is how you dilute it. This is  leadership malpractice. This is shameful and this is embarrassing.   Mr. Speaker, our first Postmaster General, whom I have heard people  speak of, Ben Franklin, could have been talking about this majority  when he said: ``Lost time is never found again.''   As a majority, Democrats have been more focused on distractions than  solutions for the American people, from the weakest, most partisan  impeachment in American history to politicizing the pandemic and  stopping relief for workers and families and, now, spreading a debunked  conspiracy theory about the Postal Service.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats have failed the American public. They have  failed the laid-off workers, the families, the students who are waiting  for help; the small businesses, the doctors, the nurses, they are  waiting for help; the researchers, the scientists who are developing a  vaccine, they are waiting for help. But this majority said no.   They did, however, say yes to China. On this floor, just a few weeks  ago, there was a bill to sanction anyone who would hack into our  companies, into our institutions that are working on a vaccine faster  than ever before--that would only slow it down--to save lives.   We had an opportunity to tell those countries: Work with us; don't  steal from us. But your voice was heard loud and clear, all the  Democrats who showed up that day. More than two-thirds of you voted  ``no'' on the same day that it was reported that two Chinese were  hacking into our vaccine. That is what you said.   I heard the majority leader say it was an MTR. Yes, it was.   Why was it an MTR? Because you don't give us an amendment.   Why was it an MTR? Because at the moment in time, it was essential,  it was critical. It was reported on that day. You could act that day.  The country needed us to act, but you said no. You stood up for the  Chinese that day.   I do not know what the Chinese Communist Party has on the Democrats,  Mr. Speaker, but it must be powerful. It must be so powerful.   I know there are bills in the Senate that have passed that would hold  them accountable, but they can't come to the floor.   I have read the reports from the FBI that they are playing in this  campaign, that they do have a person they want to win, to put a new  person in office, but that is not critical to you.   It is critical that we come today to provide $25 billion to an  organization that Republicans and Democrats, that are the  commissioners, say they do not need.   Why do they not need it? Because they looked at their own bank  account and realized they have $14 billion. They do not need it  because, in the CARES Act, we gave them another $10 billion to sit  there. They do not need it because they said they could deliver every  piece of mail, that it would be only 75 percent of what they do in a  single day.    Mr. Speaker, I do not want to say all the Democrats feel that way,  because one-third of them didn't show up for work today even though  their own leader, the Speaker, said they needed to come, even though,  when we passed on this floor something different than we haven't done  in more than 230 years, to let somebody stay home, be on a boat, call  in, and still get paid, you said you could not do that. You could only  do it if your health was at need. I am not quite sure a hospital is on  a boat in a lake, but to Democrats it must be.   They won't vote on a bill that I propose to sanction Chinese- affiliated hackers who attack our vaccine research. I am not sure that  is partisan. I thought that was pure American.   They won't help working Americans. They won't help protect our  vaccines. But, yes, they stood that day proudly supporting of the  Chinese Communist Party.   I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. America's too great for a vision so small  with our challenges before us.   We showed up. But you know why we showed up? We showed up for the  small businesses. We showed up for those who are unemployed. We showed  up for those school districts that want to find a way to open safely.  We showed up for the doctors and the nurses.   I know, when I look up on the board, there will be a lot of Democrat  votes. I don't know where those one-third are. Maybe they are on the  boat. Maybe they are watching a spaceship. I am not sure. Maybe some  are watching Oprah.   But one thing I do know, it is essential that we are here. But we  should be here for other reasons. We should be here for the reasons  that the American public expect us to.   Mr. Speaker, we can do so much better. This country needs us. We  should rise to the occasion, not fall for a vision so small as what I  see today.
