 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 47th  anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade, that  ultimately gave women the right to control their own reproductive  health.   Today, that choice is under attack as the current administration and  several States have enacted bans to restrict a woman's right to control  her own body.   This year proves to be a pivotal year for access to abortion. Next  month, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case of June  Medical Services v. Gee.   As co-chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus, I firmly believe that  every woman has the right to decide when, how, if, and with whom to  begin or expand her family. That is why we must push back against those  who wish to take away this legal right.   The public is overwhelmingly in favor of protecting Row v. Wade-- nearly 8 in 10 Americans.   In the face of increased attacks on women's right to choose, I  continue to fight for the reproductive healthcare that all women  deserve.                            ____________________
