 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  and thank the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres) for yielding me  the customary 30 minutes.   Madam Speaker, today we are considering H.R. 7, the Paycheck Fairness  Act. This legislation seeks to prevent wage discrimination on the basis  of sex, but this is already prohibited under current law.   The Paycheck Fairness Act is a false promise made by the majority  that would not provide the outcomes that we all seek as Americans. This  legislation will empower trial lawyers and offers no new protections  against pay discrimination.   According to the Equal Pay Act of 1963, Federal law currently  prohibits all discrimination in pay or other employment practices based  upon sex or any other nonjob-performance-related issue.   In 1964, Congress enacted comprehensive antidiscrimination civil  rights protection based on race, color, national origin, religion, and  sex under title 7 of the Civil Rights Act.   Together, these laws protect against sex discrimination and provide a  range of remedies for victims. As a result, sex-based wage disparity is  in direct violation of not one, but two current Federal laws.   It is important to acknowledge that there are bad actors. A small  number of managers may practice pay discrimination, but their actions  are illegal, and this opens their businesses to lawsuits and to heavy  fines.   I could not agree more that such discrimination has no place in those  businesses or in society in general. However, those who perpetuate  these illegal acts are the exception and not the rule.   Congress must not ignore the positive trends our Nation has seen in  the last 26 months:   Since 2017, the Trump administration has made significant strides in  reining in Federal overreach, improving opportunities and results for  Americans in the past 2 years;   The Tax Cut and Jobs Act has given all Americans greater opportunity,  regardless of sex, leading to an improved economy;   Unemployment is at its lowest level in nearly half a century;   Median wages across all demographic groups are rising faster now than  at any time in recent history.   According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, the United States  economy added jobs for 100 consecutive months. The current labor market  is not only benefiting the low-skilled services, but also high-skilled  workers and those with advanced degrees.   In both low-skill and high-skill sectors, there remains a short  supply of willing or qualified workers, driving up wages for both.  Across the spectrum, all workers are benefiting from the current  economy.   Our former colleague Jack Kemp used to describe a situation where ``a  rising tide lifts all boats.'' We may very well be in that ``rising  tide'' period.   But despite the good news, the majority has crafted legislation that  would place a greater burden on employers and reduce the privacy of  employees and increase Federal spending.   H.R. 7 does little to protect the wages of American workers. In fact,  it makes it harder for employers to defend legitimate differentials in  pay.   Currently, employers may pay different wages due to factors other  than sex, such as education, training, or experience.   Let's say that again. Under current law, you must pay equal wages for  equal work. That means all other things being equal, a woman cannot be  paid differently than a man.   When an employee brings different qualifications to the job, such as  an advanced degree or more years of experience, the factors used to  evaluate employee pay are no longer equal. This preserves the  flexibility for employers to make the best decision for their business,  including hiring the most qualified employees, regardless of their  gender.                                time  1230    H.R. 7 would now require that non-sex reasons for any wage disparity  would have what is termed a ``business necessity.'' Now, ``business  necessity,'' this is a term that goes undefined in the legislation.  Proving a gender-based business necessity that accounts for the entire  differential in pay is sometimes a nearly impossible standard to  defend.   Employers would no longer be able to hire or pay employees based on  qualifications, unless that qualification is being one sex or the  other, a standard that is defined in very few jobs. In addition,  employers would not be able to consider market or economic factors of  their particular business sector that might account for a wage  disparity.   This change to what is called a ``bona fide factor defense'' does not  take into account the reality of the labor market. Employees are often  willing to accept lower pay for greater control over their work  location, their schedule, or how they aggregate their leave. Studies  have shown this is particularly true for women, but it is also true for  men.   With the threat of a lawsuit hanging over the heads of employers,  they are less likely to allow for flexibility in the workplace. Instead  of allowing employees to negotiate their own pay and their work  arrangements, employers will be incentivized to transform jobs that  were once negotiable and flexible into jobs where one size must fit  all.  [[Page H2842]]    H.R. 7 also limits an employer's ability to pay its employees based  on performance. If a woman were to earn a performance-based bonus or  salary that her male coworker did not receive, that man could file a  suit against the employer on the basis that the bonus is not a business  necessity, due to the vagueness of the term in H.R. 7.   With this threat in mind, employers may be less likely to use  performance-based pay and bonuses, despite studies showing such pay  models actually increase employee pay. As approximately 40 percent of  employers now use performance-based compensation, this bill and the  vague definitions in this bill could potentially lead to a stagnation  or a decrease in wages.   Under current law, employers are prohibited from pay discrimination  whether it is intentional or not. If such pay discrimination is  intentional, employees can sue the employer in a class action suit for  up to $300,000 in compensatory and punitive damages.   The Paycheck Fairness Act would remove the threshold to this  liability and would require that workers be included in class action  lawsuits. It would require that they be included in class action  lawsuits unless they opt out, but many people may not be aware of that  requirement that they must opt out. Otherwise, they are automatically  included.   In addition, there are no limits on the fees charged by trial  lawyers. There were amendments offered at the Rules Committee hearing  to do just that, but they were not accepted as part of this rule.   One of those amendments, in fact, limited the compensation for  litigation attorneys to $2,000 per hour. That was the cap placed on  attorneys' fees, $2,000 an hour. That is a phenomenal sum of money. It  was rejected by the Rules Committee. Apparently, they felt that their  litigation attorneys were worth more than $2,000 an hour or are  required to earn more than $2,000 an hour in order to put food on the  table for their families. It just doesn't make sense. There should be  reasonable limitations on those fees.   While legitimate claims do exist, and I hope that all employees who  have experienced discrimination seek a legal remedy, the changes in  H.R. 7 would significantly increase the size and the profitability of  lawsuits, making unnecessary lawsuits even more likely for trial  lawyers looking for new cash flows.   The Paycheck Fairness Act would also have a substantial impact on the  rights of both employers and employees. The bill would prohibit  employers from requesting information regarding an employee's pay  history, which is likely an unconstitutional limit on the employer's  freedom of speech.   Furthermore, the bill reduces the right to privacy for employers and  employees as it removes any recourse should an employee make public the  wages of other employees, even without the consent of those employees  or their employer.   H.R. 7 also requires employers to provide disaggregated employee  information to the Department of Labor without delineating mechanisms  to keep that information safe.   We saw just that last week with the Federal Emergency Management  Agency data breach. The government is not always the best steward of a  citizen's private information, and we should limit the data received by  agencies until those capabilities are improved and verified.   Let me be clear: Wage discrimination certainly has no place and is  illegal in the United States of America. But I believe this bill places  undue and unnecessary restrictions on otherwise lawful business  practices and is based upon unsubstantiated findings. Therefore, I  cannot support H.R. 7.   The path that Congress must take is not to increase opportunities for  trial lawyers but to continue focusing on strong economic policy that  expands opportunities for all Americans.   Last year, 2.8 million jobs were added to the United States' economy.  Fifty-eight percent of those jobs were taken by women. Nearly 75  million women are participating in the workforce today, more than at  any time in our Nation's history. A robust and resilient economy will  provide the jobs and wage gains Americans expect and deserve.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   In almost every election cycle in which I have participated since  2002, people on the Democratic side of the aisle have talked about  wanting to rebuild the middle class. I will submit to you, over the  last 26 months, this administration, this President, has rebuilt the  middle class.   Let me just quote to you from an article in The Wall Street Journal  from March 1 of this year, a very recent article. ``All sorts of people  who have previously had trouble landing a job are now finding work.  Racial minorities, those with less education, and people working in the  lowest-paying jobs are getting bigger pay raises and, in many cases,  experiencing the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for their  groups.''   Continuing to quote here: ``They are joining manufacturing workers,  women in their prime working years, Americans with disabilities, and  those with criminal records, among others, in finding improved job  prospects after years of disappointment.''   It is incongruous to me that we would want to roll-back those gains  that this administration has made in the last 26 months.  [[Page H2843]]    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Madam Speaker, I would just like to remind the Speaker and colleagues  in the House that when the President came and delivered his State of  the Union message, he was significantly proud of the fact that right  now more women are working in the workforce than any time in our  country's history.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time remains  on my side?    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Madam Speaker, I appreciate Congresswoman Maloney, the previous  speaker's, comments. She and I served on the Joint Economic Committee  together back in 2010. The country just lost a very wise economist,  Alan Krueger. I remember Alan Krueger coming in and testifying to our  Joint Economic Committee; he testified about--of course, at the time in  2010, the description was that we were in a low-pressure labor market.  He contrasted that with the high-pressure labor market of the 1960s. I  don't recall if there were specific suggestions how to move from that  low-pressure labor market back to a high-pressure labor market, but I  don't think there can be any misunderstanding that we are back in a  high-pressure labor market. That is a good thing.  [[Page H2844]]    I quoted a few minutes ago from an article in The Wall Street  Journal. Let me just read a little deeper from that article:         One face of the red-hot job market is Cassandra Eaton, 23,       a high school graduate who was making $8.25 an hour at a       daycare center near Biloxi, Mississippi, just a few months       ago. Now she earns $19.80--that is almost $20 an hour--as an       apprentice at a shipyard in nearby Pascagoula.    The article continues:   ``It's amazing that I am getting paid almost $20 an hour to learn how  to weld, says Ms. Eaton, the single mother of a young daughter. When  she finishes the 2-year apprenticeship, her wage will rise to more than  $27 per hour.''   Madam Speaker, such is the strength of a high-pressure labor market,  and I include this article from The Wall Street Journal in the Record.                [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 1, 2019]              Inside the Hottest Job Market in Half a Century    A look at who's getting ahead, who could be left behind and how long                             the boom can last                     (By Erie Morath and Lauren Weber)         The job market doesn't get much better than this. The U.S.       economy has added jobs for 100 consecutive months.       Unemployment recently touched its lowest level in 49 years.       Workers are so scarce that, in many parts of the country,       low-skill jobs are being handed out to pretty much anyone       willing to take them--and high-skilled workers are in even       shorter supply.        All sorts of people who have previously had trouble landing       a job are now finding work. Racial minorities, those with       less education and people working in the lowest-paying jobs       are getting bigger pay raises and, in many cases,       experiencing the lowest unemployment rate ever recorded for       their groups. They are joining manufacturing workers, women       in their prime working years, Americans with disabilities and       those with criminal records, among others, in finding       improved job prospects after years of disappointment.        There are still fault lines. Jobs are still scarce for       people living in rural areas of the country. Regions that       rely on industries like coal mining or textiles are still       struggling. And the tight labor market of the moment may be       masking some fundamental shifts in the way we work that will       hurt the job prospects of many people later on, especially       those who lack advanced degrees and skills.        But for now, at least, many U.S. workers are catching up       after years of slow growth and underwhelming wage gains.        One face of the red-hot job market is Cassandra Eaton, 23,       a high-school graduate who was making $8.25 an hour at a       daycare center near Biloxi, Miss., just a few months ago. Now       she earns $19.80 an hour as an apprentice at a Huntington       Ingalls Industries Inc. shipyard in nearby Pascagoula, where       she is learning to weld warships.        The unemployment rate in Mississippi, where Huntington       employs 11,500 people, has been below 5 percent since       September 2017. Prior to that month, the rate had never been       below 5 percent on records dating back to the mid-1970s. In       other parts of the country, the rate is even lower. In Iowa       and New Hampshire, the December jobless rate was 2.4 percent,       tied for the lowest in the country. That's helped shift power       toward job seekers and caused employers to expand their job       searches and become more willing to train applicants that       don't meet all qualifications.        ``It's amazing that I'm getting paid almost $20 an hour to       learn how to weld,'' says Ms. Eaton, the single mother of a       young daughter. When she finishes the two-year       apprenticeship, her wage will rise to more than $27 per hour.        It's no surprise to economists that many people who were       previously left behind are now able to catch up. It's       something policymakers have been working toward for years.       Obama administration economists debated how to sustain an       unemployment below 5 percent. Now Trump administration       officials are considering how to pull those not looking for       jobs back into the labor force.        ``If you can hold unemployment at a low level for a long       time there are substantial benefits,'' Janet Yellen, the       former chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, said in an       interview. ``Real wage growth will be faster in a tight labor       market. So disadvantaged workers gain on the employment and       the wage side, and to my mind, that's clearly a good thing.''        This was one of Ms. Yellen's hopes when she was running the       Fed from 2014 to 2018; keep interest rates low and let the       economy run strong enough to keep driving hiring. In the       process, the theory went, disadvantaged workers could be       drawn from the fringes of the economy. With luck, inflation       wouldn't take off in the process. Her successor, Jerome       Powell, has generally followed the strategy, moving       cautiously on rates.        ``This is a good time to be patient,'' Mr. Powell told       members of Congress Tuesday.        The plan seems to be paying big dividends now, but will it       yield long-term results for American workers?        Two risks loom. The first is that the low-skill workers who       benefit most from a high-pressure job market are often hit       hardest when the job market turns south. Consider what       happened to high-school dropouts a little more than a decade       ago. Their unemployment rate dropped below 6% in 2006 near       the end of a historic housing boom, then shot up to more than       15% when the economy crumbled. Many construction,       manufacturing and retail jobs disappeared.        The unemployment rate for high-school dropouts fell to 5       percent last year. In the past year, median weekly wages for       the group rose more than 6 percent, outpacing all other       groups. But if the economy turns toward recession, such       improvement could again reverse quickly. ``The periods of       high unemployment are really terrible,'' Ms. Yellen said.        The second risk is that this opportune moment in a long       business cycle might be masking long-running trends that       still disadvantage many workers. A long line of academic       research shows that automation and competition from overseas       threaten the work of manufacturing workers and others in mid-      skill jobs, such as clerical work, that can be replaced by       machines or low-cost workers elsewhere.        The number of receptionists in America, at 1.015 million in       2017, was 86,000 less than a decade earlier, according to the       Labor Department. Their annual wage, at $29,640, was down 5       percent when adjusted for inflation.        Tougher trade deals being pushed by the Trump       Administration might help to claw some manufacturing jobs       back, but economists note that automation has many of the       same effects on jobs in manufacturing and the service section       as globalization, replacing tasks that tend to be repeated       over and over again.        Andrew McAfee, co-director of the MIT Initiative on the       Digital Economy, said the next recession could be the moment       when businesses deploy artificial intelligence, machine       learning and other emerging technologies in new ways that       further threaten mid-skill work.        ``Recessions are a prime opportunity for companies to       reexamine what they're doing, trim headcount and search for       ways to automate,'' he said. ``The pressure to do that is       less when a long, long expansion is going on.''        With these forces in play, many economists predict a       barbell job market will take hold, playing to the favor of       low- and high-skill workers and still disadvantaging many in       the middle.        The U.S. is adding jobs in low-skilled services sectors.       Four of the six occupations the Labor Department expects to       add the most jobs through 2026 require, at most, a high-      school diploma. Personal-care aide, a job that pays about $11       an hour to help the elderly and disabled, is projected to add       778,000 jobs in the decade ended in 2026, the most of 819       occupations tracked. The department expects the economy to       add more than half a million food-prep workers and more than       a quarter million janitors.        Those low-skill workers are reaping pay gains in part       because there aren't a lot of people eager to fill low-skill       jobs anymore. Only about 6 percent of U.S. workers don't hold       a high school diploma, down from above 40 percent in the       1960s, according research by MIT economist David Autor.        James O. Wilson dropped out of high school in the 10th       grade and started selling drugs, which eventually led to a       lengthy incarceration. When Mr. Wilson, 59, was released in       2013 he sought out training at Goodwill, where he learned to       drive a forklift. Those skills led him to a part-time job at       a FedEx Corp. facility at an Indianapolis airport. He was       promoted to a full-time job in 2017 and is now earning more       than $16 an hour. He has a house with his wife and enjoys       taking care of his cars, including a prized Cadillac.        ``I wanted to show FedEx you can take a person, and he can       change,'' he said. ``I want FedEx to say, `Do you have any       more people like him?` ''        Skilled workers in high-tech and managerial positions are       also benefiting from the high-pressure labor market,       particularly in thriving cities. Of 166 sectors that employ       at least 100,000 Americans, software publishing pays the       highest average wages, $59.81 an hour in the fourth quarter       of 2018. Wages in the field grew 5.5 percent from a year       earlier, well outpacing 3.3 percent overall growth in hourly       pay. The average full-time employee in the sector already       earns more than $100,000 a year.        Other technical industries, scientific research and       computer systems design, were also among the five best paying       fields. Some of the hottest labor markets in the U.S.--      including Austin, Texas; San Jose, Calif.; and Seattle--have       more than twice the concentration of technical jobs as the       country on average.        A Wall Street Journal analysis of Moody's Analytics data       found Austin to be the hottest labor market in the country       among large metros. It ranked second in job growth, third for       share of adults working and had the sixth-lowest unemployment       rate last year, among 53 regions with a population of more       than a million. San Jose, the second-hottest labor market,       had the lowest average unemployment rate last year and the       second-best wage growth.        While a strong economy is conveying benefits to a broad       swath of Americans, those in rural areas aren't experiencing       the same lift from the rising tide.        In metro areas with fewer than 100,000 people and in rural       America, the average unemployment last year was half a       percentage point higher compared to metro areas with more       than a million people, according to an analysis by job search       site Indeed.com.  [[Page H2845]]         ``Finding work can be challenging for rural job-seekers       because rural workers and employers both have fewer       options,'' said Indeed economist Jed Kolko. ``Many rural       areas have slow-growing or shrinking populations.''        Bradley Cox lives in Vevay, Ind., a rural community of       fewer than 2,000 people. The 23-year-old graduated with a       bachelor's degree in business administration and liberal arts       from Indiana University East in December, but said he had       found opportunities limited in his region.        After years working in hourly positions at a casino, he       took a job last summer as a cashier at a CVS Health Corp.       drug store, making about $12 an hour. He hoped to work at a       bank, or perhaps in a traveling sales role, making use of his       business degree. ``But to be honest, for me to do that, I       would have to move to one of the cities or commute to one of       the cities, at least,'' he says. ``I don't have the       opportunity around where I live.''        Other workers are employed--but need to string together two       or more jobs to make ends meet.        Michelle Blandy, 48, had a full-time digital marketing job       in Phoenix but hasn't been able to find steady work since       moving to Harrisburg, Pa., to be closer to her family.       Instead she's pieced together some freelance projects,       occasionally drives for Lyft and sells refurbished jewelry       boxes on Etsy. ``I have applied for full-time jobs, I just       didn't have any luck,'' she said. ``Harrisburg is tiny       compared to Phoenix. There's not as many tech companies or       big companies here that are hiring.''        The good news is this long run of low unemployment could       last for a while. Economic theory holds that when       unemployment is very low, it stirs inflation, which causes       the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates and       short-circuit growth and hiring. That kind of cycle ended the       1960s period of low unemployment, but inflation in this       period remains below the Fed's target of 2 percent.        That has allowed the Fed to keep rates low. By January       1970, when the unemployment rate was 3.9 percent, the Fed had       raised its target short-term interest rate to more than 8       percent to fight inflation. By contrast, when the jobless       rate fell below 4 percent last year, the Fed kept its target       rate below 2.5 percent thanks to low inflation.        ``It may turn out that lower unemployment proves to be more       sustainable than it was in the 1960s,'' says Ms. Yellen. ``I       think we don't know yet.''     Again, I would point out that since the inauguration of  Donald Trump, our labor market has, in fact, experienced a resurgence  that a rising tide is indeed lifting all boats. It is incumbent upon us  not to damage the economy that has brought the benefit to so many  people--so many of those forgotten Americans--who were denied that  benefit before, those very Americans to whom President Trump committed  at the time of his inauguration in January 2017.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, if the previous question is defeated, I will offer an  amendment to the resolution.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Mrs. Lesko) to explain the amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Arizona.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, while this resolution attempts to increase protections  against wage discrimination based on sex, it does not significantly  improve what already exists in current law.   I agree with my Democratic friends that there should be no tolerance  for wage discrimination based on sex or for any other factor protected  under the Equal Pay or Civil Rights Act, but this bill is not the way  to do so.   So, Madam Speaker, as we conclude, I urge a ``no'' on the previous  question, ``no'' on the underlying measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
