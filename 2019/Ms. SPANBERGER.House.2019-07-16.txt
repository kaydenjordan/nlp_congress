 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment,  although I am not opposed.    Mr. Chair, I am proud to introduce this amendment  alongside my colleague, Congressman Hurd from Texas, who is also a  former CIA case officer.   Our bipartisan amendment, the Trafficking and Smuggling Intelligence  Act, comes at a time of great hardship, violence, and heartbreak across  Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries and at a time of crisis at  our southern border.   The volatility in our backyard should be cause for serious concern.  Here in the United States, we have experienced the devastating effects  of the drug trade on the health of our citizens. On our southwest  border, we have witnessed how ongoing violence and instability in  Central America is a driving factor for increased migration toward the  United States.   Our bipartisan amendment would require intelligence assessments of  drug trafficking organizations, human trafficking organizations, and  human smugglers across Mexico and the Northern Triangle.                                time  1945    These would include reports that could be released publicly to the  American people.   Our amendment would direct our public servants to use their expertise  to better understand the root causes of violence, instability, and  migration. With these improved assessments from DNI, we would be able  to strengthen our national security in the face of threats from  traffickers, smugglers, and other criminal organizations.   Like so many of our colleagues, Congressman Hurd and I recognize that  if we are to keep Americans safe while also responsibly addressing the  situation at the border, we must address the conditions at the core of  the instability we are seeing in Central America.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join  us in supporting this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
