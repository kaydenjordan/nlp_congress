 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize February as  Career and Technical Education Month.   Our education system should always be tailored to prepare all  students, not just those attending a 4-year college. CTE programs  ensure graduates have the vocational and technical skills necessary to  succeed in the future. In fact, there are 30 million jobs in the United  States that pay an average of $55,000 per year that don't require  bachelor's degrees.   The U.S. Department of Education estimates there will be 68 percent  more job openings for transportation occupational careers in the next 5  years than there are people training to fill those jobs. With  opportunities like these, students shouldn't feel forced to attend one  type of institution over another.  [[Page H1002]]    Not every student is bound for college, but every student should  leave high school with the skills and knowledge necessary to join  today's workforce.                            ____________________
