 Mr. Speaker, we stand here doing what we  have done, I guess, 38 times now since 1998, and that is passing an  extension of the National Flood Insurance Program without the much- needed reforms that should be in that program. This is unacceptable.   Subsidized flood insurance represents what economists call a moral  hazard, and let me tell you why. We tell Americans that if you buy  flood insurance from Uncle Sam, no matter how many times your house  floods, we will give you money to rebuild it.   We haven't worked to decrease that moral hazard through reform;  rather, we have embraced and refueled it, and we make it more difficult  for people to move than rebuild.   We fail to encourage communities to mitigate flood risk. We continue  to build in high-risk areas. The clearest sign of moral hazard is the  number of repeatedly flooded properties that are rebuilt with little  deference to mitigation.   I will give you some examples:   A $90,000 home in Missouri has been flooded, now, 34 times, at a cost  of more than $600,000;   A $56,000 home in Louisiana flooded more than 40 times at a cost of  $430,000;   A $72,000 home in Texas that flooded again last year cost taxpayers  over $1 million in payouts.   I came to the floor today hoping to support a bill that Mr.  Blumenauer and I authored that would have extended the flood program  with what The Wall Street Journal called de minimis policy changes that  have broad, bipartisan support, which would do something about the fact  that you have got fewer than 2 percent of the 5 million policies that  have absorbed more than $8 billion of the payments because we don't  have these reforms. That is not in this bill before us.   Unfortunately, I oppose this can-kicking exercise, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.
