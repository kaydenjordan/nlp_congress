 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Madam President, it was a sad day yesterday when we  didn't get enough votes because the Democratic leader didn't want  Democrats to vote. We did get four of those votes from that side of the  aisle, but the police reform bill didn't come out.   Senate Republicans are taking a step in advancing real change on this  issue in our country. We have heard calls for police reform and are  responding--not only because of George Floyd's murder in Minneapolis a  few weeks ago but also because of peaceful demonstrations around the  country on this issue calling for police reform.   Senator Scott is the leader of the JUSTICE Act. I am a cosponsor. It  encourages States to stand as partners in addressing police reform. If  State and local police departments don't comply with the provisions of  the JUSTICE Act, such as training officers on deescalation and use-of- force and ensuring consistent use of body-worn cameras, they will not  receive Federal funding for police action.   Iowa has made significant changes already, and a number of other  States have followed Iowa's example. The Iowa Legislature unanimously  passed police reform issues very much like what is in the Scott bill,  and, working with leaders of color in Iowa to accomplish this goal, it  went very smoothly through the Iowa Legislature. I got a firsthand  report from my grandson, who is speaker of the Iowa House. The Iowa  House is divided 53 to 47, but both houses of the Iowa Legislature  passed these reforms unanimously.   Why can't Senate Democrats let us go forward with the Scott bill? All  we need are four more Democratic votes. If it can happen in the Iowa  Legislature, it ought to be able to happen here.   We have a role to play in the Senate, but let's not forget that,  while we are doing that, we are also encouraging our State partners to  also lead the charge in effecting real change. In fact, 50 State  legislatures--every municipality--ought to be moving forward on police  reforms of not only our type but whatever they may think is best for  their States or municipalities.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
