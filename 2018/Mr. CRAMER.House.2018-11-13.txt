 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Lamborn, Chairman  Bishop, and the ranking member for their cooperation and for helping me  move this important legislation that was sponsored, as Chairman Lamborn  said, by Senator Hoeven, and for working on my companion bills that  were introduced in the House earlier this year. I appreciate the  hearings that the Natural Resources Committee held and for favorably  reporting the bills out of the committee.   These two bills to convey BOR property to local park entities are  very important to many of my constituents. In July, two of those  constituents, Tom Fisher and Craig Headland, came to Washington to  testify in support of these bills. Combined, they represented over 100  families with homes on these reclamation properties who wished to cast  aside the uncertainties of residing on Federal land and carry out their  dreams of home ownership by purchasing the lands they maintain.   Certainty, not only for them, of course, but for financial lenders,  will generate greater investment in these properties to improve the  lifestyle and the local economy, while maintaining the integrity of the  use of the reservoirs.   The land, beyond those residents, which makes up the vast majority of  the acreage, will continue to be open to the public for recreation and  other uses to the benefit of our people. As a firm believer in land use  decisionmaking authority being as local as possible, I believe these  bills will allow for better management and improved opportunities for  the citizens of North Dakota and for our visitors.   Lastly, I want to thank the administration for working on these bills  with Senator Hoeven and me. I am grateful that the administration is  willing to work on issues such as these that have carried on for years,  and sometimes decades, with indecision and delay.   So I urge support by my colleagues and, again, thank the chairman,  the ranking member, and the committee for their good work.                                time  1630
