 Mr. Speaker, today we are talking about infrastructure.  I want to focus on one aspect of infrastructure that touches the lives  of all Americans, especially in my home State of California, and that  is water.   I know firsthand the urgent challenges facing our water  infrastructure. The crippling recent drought and subsequent record  rainfall has prompted more discussion on a need for a smart water  management strategy to improve drinking water, water reuse, and  recycled water systems for communities across the United States.   We must take meaningful steps to increase our water conservation,  reduce unnecessary energy use, and cut costs for Americans. Let's  commit to investing in technology and science-based solutions that will  address the weaknesses in our water drinking systems from threats like  climate change, crumbling pipes, and water source contamination.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to focus on legislation that will  put Americans back to work building the systems we need to support the  future of this great country.
