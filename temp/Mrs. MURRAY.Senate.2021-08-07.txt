 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Minority  Veterans of America on the occasion of their fourth anniversary on  August 7, 2021. Minority Veterans of America is doing important work in  home State of Washington and around the country advancing equity and  justice for nearly 5 million underrepresented veterans, including  women, people of color, LGBTQIA+, and religious and nonreligious  minorities. As a nation, we make a promise to take care of our veterans  when they return from service. It is the least we can do for those who  have sacrificed to defend our freedoms. Minority Veterans of America  addresses the additional challenges minority veterans face in receiving  the benefits they have earned.   Minority Veterans of America was founded in Washington State in 2017  by two military veterans, Lindsay Church and Katherine Pratt. Over the  course of 4 years, Minority Veterans of America has grown to include  thousands of members spread across nearly every State. They have worked  tirelessly advocating for reforms that address economic and health  disparities among minority veterans. In my home State of Washington,  they have organized innovative programs that address the unique need of  minority veterans in transitioning to civilian life, financial  stability, social engagement, and access to resources. At the national  level, Minority Veterans of America has organized grassroots movements  to address issues such as discrimination in the military, military  sexual trauma, and the transgender military ban. They also work  directly with the Department of Veterans Affairs to increase equitable  and inclusive access to services.   It is clear to me that Minority Veterans of America has made a  substantial contribution to veterans in Washington State and across the  country. It is my pleasure to thank Minority Veterans of America for  their hard work and commitment. I congratulate Minority Veterans of  America on 4 years of outstanding service to our military veterans and  look forward to working with them in the years to come as we continue  to advance equity and inclusion for our veterans.
