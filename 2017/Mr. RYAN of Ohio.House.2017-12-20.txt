 Mr. Speaker, what a day in Washington, D.C. We have  many Republicans in this town saying: What a great day it is for the  American people; what a great Christmas for America.   The average family--63 percent in America--can't withstand a $500  emergency. With this tax cut, Apple is going to get $47 billion and  Donald Trump's family is going to get $1 billion. They are going to  toss out a few crumbs to working class families who work 60, 70 hours a  week, and the fat cats in Washington and Wall Street are going to run  off with the whole pot of gold.   Whatever happened in this country where we said, To whom much is  given, much is expected?   We need to challenge the wealthy corporations. They are sitting on $4  trillion worth of cash. If they want to start a factory, buy a machine,  or hire workers, they could do it now. They don't need to take it from  the middle class.                            ____________________
