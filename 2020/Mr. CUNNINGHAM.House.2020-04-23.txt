 Madam Speaker, today I will vote to extend a lifeline  to small businesses, shore up our hospitals, and expand testing so we  can reopen our economy, but it is unacceptable that it has taken this  long.   Supporting hospitals and small businesses is not partisan, but,  again, politics is obstructing policy.   This bill fails to ensure relief goes only to small businesses that  need it most instead of large corporations, nor does it help States  respond to this unprecedented crisis.   We cannot wait until the next disaster forces both sides to the  table. Our constituents deserve more from their Representatives. Let's  come together and get our country back to work.
