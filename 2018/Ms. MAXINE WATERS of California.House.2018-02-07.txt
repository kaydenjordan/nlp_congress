 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1153, the so-called  Mortgage Choice Act of 2017.   Unfortunately, this bill is yet another attempt to undermine the  strong consumer protections Democrats established under the Dodd-Frank  Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, taking us back to the  days of the subprime bubble.   While some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have  forgotten those days, I haven't. I remember how predatory lenders  targeted unsuspecting home buyers by hiding fees and obscuring loan  costs, tricking them into exploding mortgages and locking them into  loans that they really couldn't afford.   Millions of home buyers were steered into high-cost, subprime loans  even  [[Page H908]]  when they qualified for prime mortgages, and lenders didn't even bother  to verify whether or not borrowers had the ability to repay their  mortgages. They weren't required to do that, so they didn't. The end  result was rampant fraud on a massive scale to millions of foreclosures  and a tremendous loss of generational wealth, particularly for  Black homeowners. Some of my constituents are still struggling and  trying to recover from the financial devastation that occurred during  this financial crisis.    The last thing Congress should do is to open the door to a return to  these fraudulent and harmful policies, yet that is exactly what H.R.  1153 would do. This bill seems like a technical fix to allow affiliated  title insurance and settlement services firms to be excluded from the  qualified mortgage rule's 3 percent cap on upfront points and fees paid  by borrowers. But make no mistake, there is nothing technical about  this. In fact, this bill would allow title insurance companies to jack  up prices on borrowers and allow lenders to receive what would  otherwise be illegal kickbacks.   Under this bill, lenders, including repeat offender megabanks, like  Wells Fargo, would have new opportunities to reap huge financial  profits at their customers' expense by steering them into costly title  insurance policies that have no cap on fees whatsoever.   Prior to the enactment of Dodd-Frank, lenders were able to earn  tremendous profits through lucrative kickbacks paid by their  affiliates. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, or RESPA,  prohibits giving a fee kickback or thing of value in exchange for a  referral of business related to a real estate settlement service. But  this kickback prohibition does not apply to affiliated companies of  lenders, like a title insurance firm. To avail themselves of this  kickback loophole, some lenders have bought or created businesses to  enable them to profit directly from the relationship.   So Dodd-Frank established the responsible underwriting practice of  requiring lenders to verify a borrower's ability to repay when they  originate a loan. Dodd-Frank also enabled lenders to obtain some legal  protections when making residential mortgages if those loans are  considered a qualified mortgage or QM.   To be considered QM, a loan must have terms and conditions that are  understandable to borrowers and not contain predatory features  considered to be unfair or deceptive. QM loans, for example, can't be  interest-only loans, longer than 30 years, or have balloon payments.  Specific to the bill we are considering today, the amount of upfront  points and fees on QM loans cannot exceed 3 percent of the total amount  of the loan.   In short, QM loans are supposed to be low risk, prudently  underwritten, and free from the type of features associated with those  predatory mortgages that trapped borrowers in loans they couldn't  afford and that led to the financial crisis.   The points and fees cap included under the QM definition includes,  among other things, real estate-related fees paid to affiliates of the  lender for services, such as property appraisals, settlement services,  and title insurance. Fees paid to affiliates of the lender pose greater  risks to borrowers since lenders cannot steer borrowers directly to  their affiliates without open competition, and higher prices charged by  affiliates directly benefit the lenders.   Affiliate title insurance is especially problematic. The title  insurance industry is notoriously opaque. Due to a lack of competition  and readily available information on terms and pricing, consumers do  not shop around for title insurance as they might for other products  and services. Megabanks, like Wells Fargo, have used title insurance to  take advantage of consumers through illegal kickbacks schemes.   The Consumer Bureau took an enforcement action in 2015 against Wells  Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, ordering those megabanks to pay more than $24  million in civil penalties and more than $11 million to consumers  harmed by their kickback schemes with Genuine Title, a now defunct  title company.   At the time, Director Cordray said: ``These banks allowed their loan  officers to focus on their own illegal financial gain rather than on  treating consumers fairly. Our action today to address these practices  should serve as a warning for all those in the mortgage market.''   Madam Speaker, these kickback schemes continue despite Congress'  efforts to shut them down, and would likely increase if H.R. 1153 is  enacted. Because H.R. 1153 would remove fees that are charged by a  lender's affiliate title insurance company from the QM fee cap, the  bill directly encourages lenders to, once again, steer borrowers to  their affiliates so they can extract even more money from them.   Now, supporters of the bill argue that, because individual States  provide adequate regulation over the title insurance industry, it is  unnecessary, they say, to have additional safeguards related to  affiliated title companies and the fees they charge. However, research  from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners shows that  State laws do not, by themselves, offer robust protection to consumers  with title insurance. More than half of all States don't even collect  data from title agents. Some States have ``no particular standard'' for  determining whether title insurance rates are adequate, and even a  couple, like Illinois and Arkansas, do not regulate title insurance  rates at all.    Congress should be strengthening prohibitions on kickbacks, not  weakening them. We should enable borrowers to get the best price,  terms, and conditions on mortgage loans instead of creating more ways  for these megabanks, like Wells Fargo, to gouge American consumers.   When Congress considered this same measure last term, the Obama  administration issued a veto threat, stating that the bill ``risked  eroding consumer protections and returning the mortgage market to the  days of careless lending focused on short-term profits.''   Madam Speaker, buying a home is likely the largest purchase most  consumers will ever make. For this reason alone, Congress should  absolutely reject proposals like H.R. 1153 that would permit  residential mortgage lenders to take advantage of borrowers trying to  achieve the American Dream.   Finally, a long list of groups, including civil rights groups, such  as the NAACP and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights,  as well as consumer groups at the National, State, and local level,  like Americans for Financial Reform, National Consumer Law Center, and  the Center for Responsible Lending, all oppose this so-called Mortgage  Choice Act.   So for all of these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to join me  in opposing H.R. 1153.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct the chairman.  [[Page H910]]    He said that RESPA prohibits kickbacks. While RESPA prohibits paying  kickbacks to third-party title agencies, the law does not prohibit  payments to affiliated title firms. This incentivizes a title agency to  be affiliated so it can gain the payment option without violating  RESPA, including affiliated title insurance fees in the QM defines  points and fees caps, provides important market pressure to control  costs for consumers, and supports access to credits.   By the way, when we talk about RESPA, we are talking about the real  estate settlement procedures that define all of this.   So let's be clear again that, while RESPA prohibits paying kickbacks  to third-party title agents, the law does not prohibit payments to  affiliated title firms.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, for the life of me, I cannot understand why my  colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle would be in support of  anything that would cause a home buyer to have to pay more money in  fees when they are taking out a mortgage.   On a $400,000 mortgage, you are talking about you want to go beyond a  $12,000 cap, which is 3 percent? Why would you want to do that to a  homeowner?   What we are saying is, under QM and what we worked so hard to  establish, was to put a cap on all of these fees so that the  homeowners, the home buyers, would not be paying more than 3 percent of  that mortgage.   We think that is fair.   Now you want to open up the flood gates so that these title companies  can increase the amount of that they are charging and go beyond the 3  percent.   How much higher do you want it to go? Do you want them to be able to  go up to 4 percent or 5 percent with these homeowners who are paying  downpayments and who are trying to get into homes? Why is it you want  to expand beyond a 3 percent cap on the average hardworking home buyer  in this country?   I don't get it. I don't understand it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I don't think I heard my colleague correctly when he said that this  bill had something to do with encouraging first-time home buyers. It  has nothing to do with encouraging first-time home buyers.   As a matter of fact, if we proceed with this bill that is before us  today that they are supporting, it will discourage first-time home  buyers and home buyers in general because what they are doing is they  are increasing the possibility for more points and fees that have to be  paid when we have a cap now at 3 percent, which any reasonable person  would know makes good sense.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   My friends on the opposite side of the aisle just dislike qualified  mortgage. They dislike QM. And a lot of the arguments that you have  heard had nothing to do, really, with this bill, itself, but more with  the fact that they have always wanted to dismantle the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau, who has the responsibility of implementing  QM.   So they will talk about everything from access to credit to you name  it, but it has nothing to do with the fact that they are here with a  bill that is trying to open up opportunities for affiliated title  companies to be able to charge home buyers more money than would be  allowed under QM.   The fact of the matter is we have a 3 percent cap on all points and  fees in the legislation that we created to protect homeowners--3  percent. Why is it they want to open it up so that home buyers have to  pay more than 3 percent on all of these points and fees?   As a matter of fact, I get questions all the time, particularly from  first-time home buyers asking me: What are all these points and fees  that I have to pay? Do you mean to tell me that on a $400,000 loan,  they are going to rip off $12,000 on points and fees or more? And we  have to explain that we have kept it to 3 percent.   But now they want to open up the floodgates, and they want to say  that these affiliated companies can charge more on points and fees as  it relates to title insurance. So I am opposed to it.   And for those who did not understand, who may have voted because of  the way that is oftentimes presented by the opposite side of the  aisle--and, as a matter of fact, it is obscured in the way that they  present it in talking about trying to help homeowners, trying to  protect homeowners, trying to open up opportunities. It has nothing to  do with any of that.   This is because the title insurance people who have wielded their  influence have come here to change the law so that they can raise those  rates and charge more money and have kickbacks, et cetera, et cetera.  This is what this is all about.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Try as they may, they cannot explain to anyone why it is they want to  open up the opportunity for these affiliated companies to charge more  on these title loans.   As a matter of fact, again, I am going to keep reminding everyone who  is listening that, under Dodd-Frank, under the work of the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau, under the qualified mortgage rule, all of  the work that was done after this country found itself in a position of  where we were in a recession, almost a depression because of what we  had allowed to happen in this country from some of the biggest banks  and financial institutions in the world, we discovered that there were  all kind of exotic loans, all kind of different kinds of loans that  were put together to entice consumers and home buyers to take out these  mortgages.   We heard about all of them: no-documentation loans where they didn't  even know where the consumer, the homeowner was going to get their  money from; they did not vet them, they did not know their employment  history, and on and on and on.   So the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is absolutely carrying  out the work of what Dodd-Frank was intended to do, and that is to  reform all of this and to make sure that consumers are treated fairly,  to make sure that consumers are not ripped off, to make sure that  consumers don't have a whole list of these fees and points before they  can even get their downpayments, incredibly, and have to pay over 3  percent and more in these points and fees as they are trying to access  a mortgage.                                time  1000    This is all about keeping the cap on the 3 percent for all of those  points and fees. If you do what this bill is intended to do, you are  saying that you are opening up the opportunity for these points and  fees to be increased because of these affiliated companies that want to  take the cap off. I don't know how better to explain that.   My friends on the opposite side of the aisle would charge consumers  more with this bill. We on this side of the aisle are opposed with  that. We are saying that it is not fair to consumers. What you need to  do is let Dodd-Frank reforms work so that we can protect our consumers  and not have them gouged and increase the amount of money they have to  pay in these points and fees.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Democratic leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Allow me to just say that we continue on this most important  legislation, H.R. 1153, and we have had the opportunity to yield time  to Leader Pelosi, and while she certainly came in to oppose this bill  that we have before us, having yielded 1 minute to the leader is the  most profound 1 minute probably in the history of this institution,  that 1 minute that ended up 8 hours where Leader Pelosi talked about  the plight of DACA and the DREAMers.   And I am very proud that in yielding that 1 minute we had the  opportunity to listen to Leader Pelosi deal with an issue and demand  that we have an opportunity to have a real debate and a real discussion  in the people's House.   Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that we had that opportunity, and now  let me just say, I have no further requests for time, and I am prepared  to close.   Mr. Speaker, American consumers are under attack by the Trump  administration and Republicans in Congress every day. We learn about  either another effort to weaken guardrails, protecting consumers from  predatory actors, or another Trump appointee refusing to hold bad  actors accountable.   Trump supporters at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the  Securities and Exchange Commission have basically stopped enforcing our  Nation's consumer and security laws.                                time  1815    Mr. Speaker, as you know, there is a lot of excitement here because  of what took place in the last 8 hours, so I don't feel interrupted at  all. I just feel very, very pleased that we had the opportunity to have  that speech by our leader.   However, I will just continue. Let me just get to the fact that,  again, Mick Mulvaney, whom Trump unlawfully appointed as Acting  Director of the Consumer Bureau, is gutting the Consumer Bureau's  Office of Fair Lending Equal Opportunity limiting the Consumer Bureau's  ability to stop bad actors from discriminating against communities of  color.   News reports also suggest that Mulvaney has slowed down the Consumer  Bureau's investigation of Wells Fargo, the ultimate example of a  recidivist megabank. Wells Fargo has publicly admitted to ripping off  millions of Americans with fraudulent checking accounts, credit cards,  forced-placed auto insurance, and much, much more.  [[Page H965]]    But the Trump administration has a partner in its efforts to  undermine consumer protections. House Republicans have been in lockstep  with the President when it comes to rolling back consumer protections.  Take the Consumer Bureau's rule on forced arbitration: Wall Street  lobbied hard against this rule, and instead of putting consumers first,  House Republicans passed a Congressional Review Act resolution to  repeal a rule that would have helped consumers who have been wronged by  the big banks to join together to hold them accountable.   But that is just one example of how House Republicans have tried to  undermine consumer laws. For years now, they have tried to cut the  funding of the Consumer Bureau or to change its structure, and having  failed in those attempts, they now have their inside man, Mick  Mulvaney, who is working to destroy the Bureau from within. We  shouldn't be surprised since the chairman of the Financial Services  Committee has said he wants to ``financially terminate'' the Consumer  Bureau.   The bill before us today should be viewed as one part of this long  line of attempts by my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle to  undermine the fundamental consumer protection. Home buyers should not  be gouged or swindled just because they want to own a home. H.R. 1153  would legitimize predatory kickbacks through affiliated firms.  Megabanks, including bad actors like Wells Fargo, and other lenders  would be incentivized to steer their borrowers into more costly  products simply because they can.   H.R. 1153 is a bad bill that will only line the pockets of Wall  Street with the hard-earned savings of Main Street. But don't just take  my word for it. Civil rights groups and consumer advocates all agree  that this is bad for America.   So, despite all of the excitement that we have had here on the floor  today with Leader Pelosi and the message that she brought to this  Congress, I want all of our Members to simply reject President Trump's  and House Republicans' attack on consumers. Vote ``no'' on H.R. 1153  and support Leader Pelosi in calling for a debate in this House on the  issue dealing with DACA and the DREAMers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the extraordinary achievement of Elon Musk and SpaceX for the  spectacular and historic launch of its giant Falcon Heavy rocket, now  the world's most powerful operational rocket, from Cape Canaveral on  Tuesday, February 6, 2018.   Besides the launch itself, which carried Mr. Musk's personal Tesla  Roadster into space, SpaceX also achieved a second amazing feat by  guiding two of the Falcon Heavy's rocket boosters back to Earth for an  upright landing. This rocket launch has paved the way for faster,  cheaper launches of satellites and cargo into space.   So, as the representative of California's 43rd Congressional  District, this milestone is especially meaningful to me. SpaceX is  headquartered in my district in the city of Hawthorne, California, and  employs thousands of talented men and women in our community.   I congratulate Elon Musk and SpaceX for continuing the great  tradition of achievement by aerospace companies in the South Bay.                            ____________________
