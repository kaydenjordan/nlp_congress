 Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today, I am pleased to honor Maag Prescription & Medical Supply in  Pocatello as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for August 2020 and  congratulate them on 70 years of business.   Maag Prescription & Medical Supply is an independent, locally owned  pharmacy which has been operated by the Maag family since 1950.  Established by Irvin and Genevieve Maag, the couple ran all aspects of  the business and quickly developed a reputation for providing exemplary  service while meeting the specific needs of their customers. As the  business flourished and ownership transitioned to their son and  daughter-in-law, Greg and Kathy Maag, a fire ravaged the facility in  1977. The Maags quickly sprang into action and rebuilt their business  across the street with the strong support of the Pocatello community.   Forty-three years later, Maag Prescription & Medical Supply remains a  staple in Southeast Idaho, providing more than 20 jobs to the community  and expanding three times to meet the needs of their customers. Their  ability to adapt quickly and meet customer demands has been especially  important during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the business now offering  curbside pickup, free home delivery of prescriptions and oxygen tanks,  and in-house production of hand sanitizer for the community. Their  emphasis on customer satisfaction has been central to their continued  success.   Maag Prescription & Medical Supply's resiliency and service to the  community has not gone unnoticed. For the past 2 years, the business  received the Idaho State Journal's annual Reader's Choice award. Their  business stands as a true testament to American industriousness,  exemplifying one of our Nation's most treasured values. Now, in one of  the most economically uncertain times, their story reminds us of the  importance of commitment to our communities and resilience in the face  of adversity.   Congratulations to Greg and Kathy Maag and all of the employees of  Maag Prescription & Medical Supply on being selected as the Idaho Small  Business of the Month for August 2020. You make our great State proud,  and I look forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
