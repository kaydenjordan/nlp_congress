 Mr. President, today, it is with both great pride  and tremendous sadness that I honor the legacy of an incredible  Nevadan, Assemblyman Tyrone Thompson, who was taken from us far too  soon, earlier this month. A proud native of Las Vegas, Assemblyman  Thompson, a product of Nevada's public education system, graduated from  Valley High School in 1985. He then went on to earn his bachelor's  degree in criminal justice with a minor in sociology from Northern  Arizona University, and he earned his masters of arts degree in  organizational management from the University of Phoenix in 2000.   Thompson was first appointed to the Nevada State Legislature by the  Clark County Commission on April 16, 2013 as the representative for  District 17. During the 79th and 80th legislative sessions, he fought  for improvements to our States' public education system as chairman of  the education committee. Then, during the 80th session, Assemblyman  Thompson's leadership skills were recognized by his peers in the  Statehouse when he was appointed majority whip for the Nevada Assembly.   In October 2017, Thompson was inducted into the College of Social and  Behavioral Sciences Hall of Fame at Northern Arizona University, his  alma matter.   Assemblyman Tyrone Thompson had a heart that was bigger than life.  Whether it was tackling homelessness in our State, increasing access to  quality education, mentoring, or fighting to expand social services,  Assemblyman Thompson always followed through on his word. Our community  lost a champion on May 4, 2019, but Tyrone Thompson lives on through a  legacy unmatched in Nevada. He touched countless lives, inspired so  many, and planted seeds of selfless acts throughout Nevada.   We honor him and his family as we carry his heart, passion,  selflessness, and community-minded spirit with us every day.                            ____________________
