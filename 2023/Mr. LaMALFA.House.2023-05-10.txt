 Mr. Speaker, I would like to highlight a potential  catastrophe that may befall the Western United States in this upcoming  2023 fire season. Indeed, it is underway. A total of 196 fires have  already burned a total of over 50 acres so far, and it is going to be  much, much more than that since it is on the heels of wintertime when  they are easier to contain.   The worst wildfires in the West are due to overgrowth and neglect of  our Federal lands that are overpopulated with trees. They get too hot  for conventional firefighting methods. When this occurs, fire retardant  dropped  [[Page H2183]]  from aircraft is our best and sometimes only option.   Dropping retardant from aircraft ahead of advancing wildfire helps  our firefighters who are on the ground in harm's way to maybe not get  enveloped in fire and be able to do their jobs. It allows us time to  organize evacuations and eventually contain and put the fire out.   A radical environmental organization is suing to have an injunction  put on the use of fire retardants until firefighting agencies complete  a yearslong permit process to use fire retardants.   It is ridiculous and amazing how out of touch they are to take away  the tool of fire retardant dropped from aircraft to help put fires out  in the West.   Congressman Panetta and I are working on a bill that we are  introducing called the Forest Protection and Wildland Firefighter  Safety Act. We need this sort of thing. We need that protection.                            ____________________
