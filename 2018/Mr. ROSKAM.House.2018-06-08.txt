 Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate Lieutenant  Colonel Sean Morrow, a constituent of the Sixth District of Illinois.   On June 19, Sean will be taking command of the United Nations  Security Battalion in the Joint Security Area of the Demilitarized Zone  on the Korean Peninsula. This unit is the most forward-deployed on the  peninsula and stands on the front lines of freedom 24 hours a day, 7  days a week, facing the North Korean People's Army eye to eye in  defense of democracy and our way of life.   As the son of a Korean war company commander myself, I am honored  that my constituent is taking the helm of this command at such a  crucial time. Sean is a warrior-scholar. A Ph.D. candidate in  international relations at the University of Chicago, he is committed  to protecting the United States on the battlefield but also rigorously  studying the pressing national security challenges we face and their  solutions. He has dedicated his life and his career to keeping our  Nation safe.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Sean, his wife Meghan, and their three children  God's very best, and I thank him for his service.                            ____________________
