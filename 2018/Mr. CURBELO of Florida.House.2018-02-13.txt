 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Reichert and  Ranking Member Pascrell for their important work on this legislation.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 4979, to provide a 3-year  renewal of the Generalized System of Preferences. The GSP program  provides duty-free access to the U.S. market for selected goods from  121 developing countries.   As a member of the Ways and Means Committee, I have always been an  advocate of policies that allow businesses and consumers to acquire  products of their choice at the best possible price. The GSP program  gives our businesses and consumers that choice by promoting economic  growth in developing countries while creating jobs here at home.   In 2017, U.S. importers enjoyed nearly $865 million in savings on  import duties under the GSP program. During the same year, my home  State of Florida had $1.2 billion of imports covered by the program and  a total savings of $59 million on import duties. Mr. Speaker, that is  about a 40 percent increase in savings from 2016.   I want to share the story of Mr. Bruce Price, a small-business owner  in my district who would benefit from renewing the GSP program. He  recently told my office he expects savings in the range of $25,000 to  $45,000 per year if the program is renewed. For Mr. Price, those  savings go a long way and make a major difference in determining his  business decisions.   I commend the work the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade has done  to reinforce our commitment to free and fair trade partnerships around  the world. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 4979 to help  Mr. Price and other small-business owners hire more workers all across  our country.
