 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I witnessed, as did all of us,  the jubilation of my friends, the Republican majority, in passing the  tax cut measure that had been advocated as tax reform for a substantial  period of time, but, finally, they did admit that it was a tax cut.   I rise here today just to lay down a marker. I have said, as have  many of my colleagues, that what we witnessed is the beginning of what  ultimately will allow for us to address the entitlements in this  country.   Many of us know that the deficit that the tax cuts create are going  to allow, some time during the course of next year or shortly after the  election, us to begin discussing Medicare and Medicaid. I think that is  a mistake, and I want that to be recognized.                            ____________________
