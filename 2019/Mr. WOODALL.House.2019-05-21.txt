 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I want to thank my friend from Colorado for yielding me  the customary 30 minutes.   It is a close-knit bunch of folks up there on the Rules Committee,  Madam Speaker. If you have not been by recently, you ought to come by.  There are only 13 of us there. It is easy to remember everybody's name,  but you don't go to the Rules Committee when you have important  bipartisan legislation to bring to the House floor. You go to the  suspension calendar for that.   You go to the Rules Committee when you have contentious pieces of  legislation to bring to the floor. I regret that we are here today on  things that are absolutely contentious that could have been absolutely  partnership bills.   I want to reference first H.R. 1500. That is the bill my friend from  Colorado spoke about as it relates to the Consumer Financial Protection  Bureau. He is absolutely right. The way this Congress set up the  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau when Democrats were running this  institution and President Obama was in the White House was to make it a  completely administration-driven agency with no accountability to  Congress whatsoever. That was a mistake.   But the folks who set it up liked the team that was running it at the  time, and so our efforts in the minority to stop that from happening  were rebuffed. Now we are here today, Madam Speaker, and you might  think that we have a list of legislative fixes to the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau. Not so.   I encourage you to pick up a copy of H.R. 1500 just to see what those  fixes  [[Page H4026]]  might be. It is a 40-page bill. You have to get to page 21 before  accusations and assertions against former Director Mick Mulvaney end,  and the important work, like changing the way we reference the agency  by name, begins.   I don't have any language today. No amendments were offered in the  Rules Committee last night, Madam Speaker, to talk about all of the  things that former Director Cordray did while he was there. The list of  things that he did that I don't like are long. The list of things that  he did that I thought violated the actual text of the law is pretty  long.   But he is gone, and we have the ability to fix anything we want to  fix that he did. So no amendments were offered to impugn the integrity  of the former director. Well, not the former director, Mr. Cordray; but  the former director, Mick Mulvaney, yes, acting director. There are 21  pages of a 40-page bill dedicated to personal attacks on the former  director.   Madam Speaker, if we wanted to do something about the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau that brought its authority out of 1600  Pennsylvania Avenue and right back here to where it belongs in Article  I, we would make this agency subject to congressional appropriations.  This is a bipartisan issue.   If you want to find something that we agree on as an institution,  let's talk about making Article I the lawmaker in this country, rather  than Article II. Let's talk about taking it out of the White House's  hands and putting it back into the people's hands on Capitol Hill. You  will not find that idea in these pages.   It is a disappointment because we could be doing something in  partnership. Standing for consumers is a shared value, not a divisive  one.   I go now to the bill coming out of the Ways and Means Committee, H.R.  1994. Madam Speaker, as my friend from Colorado referenced, this bill  passed unanimously out of the Ways and Means Committee. Unanimously.   Take a look at the men and women on the Ways and Means Committee. I  think there are 42 of them. These are not shrinking violets on the Ways  and Means Committee. I see a couple of them out here. I won't call  anybody out by name--Mr. Panetta--but they are not shrinking violets on  this committee. These are serious public policy advocates who represent  very diverse parts of the country and who fight hard for the values  that their constituents represent.   Unanimously, they came together as a committee, Madam Speaker, to  change the rules for retirement, to make it easier for families to  save; to change the rules around college savings plans so that families  who ran into challenges in secondary years, families whose kids develop  special needs and might not be going on to college, but who have very  real needs today, to allow those dollars to be tapped by those families  to serve the educational needs of their children.   Unanimously it passed the committee. In fact, I will read from the  committee report. This is not something that was done lightly in  committee, Madam Speaker. We are talking about hundreds of pages of  legislation, hundreds of pages of a committee report. This was a  thoughtfully designed and crafted piece of legislation.   The committee said this:         The committee believes that expanding 529 plans will help       families save for education expenses that meet each family's       unique needs.    We run into that problem often, Madam Speaker. We try to do something  that is good for America, and it turns out that 330 million Americans  have different needs and priorities. So the Ways and Means avoided a  one-size-fits-all solution, recognizing those unique needs. I will read  on.   The committee says:         By allowing tax-free distributions for apprenticeship       expenses, homeschooling expenses, student loan repayments,       elementary and secondary expenses, in addition to tuition,       families can customize the use of their education savings to       make education more affordable.    We didn't read that on the headline of any major newspaper when the  Ways and Means passed that unanimously. I am sure there was something  in the headlines of that major newspaper about wars in foreign lands. I  am sure there was something in the newspaper that day about partisan  politics and how folks were poking each other with sharp rhetorical  sticks.   There was not a word about how the men and women of the people's  House on the Ways and Means Committee came together unanimously, not  because it wasn't hard to craft solutions. It is hard to craft  solutions, but they came together unanimously on consensus language to  move out of committee.   It sounds like I am going to tell a story with a happy ending, Madam  Speaker, and I should be. This should be a story about how we get  things done, but what happened last night that you also won't see on  the front page of the paper is, we took this consensus product that was  passed unanimously by Republicans and Democrats, and we took it up  there to the Rules Committee.   On a straight party-line vote, we ripped out all of the language  protecting families who were trying to help their children at home;  children who may not be getting everything they need through the public  schools and so they get additional education at home; families that may  have opted out of the public school system because they couldn't get  what their children need, and they are homeschooling their children.   This language that was agreed upon unanimously in a bipartisan way,  was ripped out in a party-line vote in the Rules Committee last night.  We will never vote on it in this Chamber, Madam Speaker.   The Ways and Means Committee in a long committee report, long  committee language, they deliberated over this language and concluded  that the right thing to do was to help all American families. But  somewhere between that unanimous vote in committee and late last night  in the Rules Committee, the decision came down from on high--and by on  high I do mean your side of the aisle, Madam Speaker, because when you  sit in the Speaker's chair, you have that kind of authority. The Rules  Committee is, in fact, the Speaker's committee--that said we are going  to rip this language out.   We offered an amendment last night. And I think it is only right that  folks come to sit here to watch the people's business. They think that  we are going to operate a transparent building here, and we work very  hard to do that.                                time  1300    We offered an amendment last night in the Rules Committee to allow a  simple vote of the people's House on this provision. If you don't like  parents supplementing their students' education at home, so be it. I  don't understand it, but so be it. But let's have a vote on it here  just like they did in the Ways and Means Committee. On a party-line  basis, the amendment to allow the people's House to have a vote on this  provision was defeated.   You might not have noticed it when the Reading Clerk was reading,  Madam Speaker. I don't want to tell you how long that took to read. We  have a lot of things packaged in this bill. You will have to go all the  way down to the 12th section of the rule, and the important words are:  modified by the amendment printed in part B of the Rules Committee  report, modified by part B of the amendment printed in the Rules  Committee report.   I will translate that for you, Madam Speaker. That means with no vote  of this institution whatsoever and with no consultation or input from  the Ways and Means Committee that crafted this legislation, we are  going to revoke all benefits that would have gone to families who  cannot find the services they need outside the home and, thus, are  paying for those services inside the home.   Representative Mitchell came to the Rules Committee to testify on  this amendment last night, Madam Speaker. He said that his family is  blessed enough to have the financial resources to take care of their  special needs family member. But he talked about all the American  families who he has met in his district--the Speaker has them in her  district; the gentleman from Colorado has them in his district; and I  have them in my district--who don't have the financial means and who  don't have that sense of security.   The Ways and Means Committee in its wisdom unanimously said let's  provide that security to American families. The Rules Committee in an  error  [[Page H4027]]  in judgment repealed it because six Members voted ``yes'' last night.  That is all it took. All it took to silence an institution of 435,  Madam Speaker, was six Members voting to include this one seemingly  innocuous line that disadvantages families and children all across this  Nation.   It is another missed opportunity, Madam Speaker. We could have been  here today celebrating the things that we do here together. We could  have been here celebrating shared values. We could have been here today  making a difference that your constituents have asked of you and my  constituents have asked of me.   From the start of this process, for the weeks in committee, and for  the weeks since the committee has passed it, we were doing exactly  that. In about 6 minutes of voting last night, we erased it all. It  took weeks to build bipartisan consensus, Madam Speaker. It took  moments to erase it all.   We have choices in this institution, Madam Speaker. We made the wrong  one in the Rules Committee last night.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat this rule and give us a  chance to make a right one. But we only get so many bites at this  apple. The trust of the American people in us as an institution and in  us as individuals is not infinite. If we betray that trust often  enough, it will disappear forever.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, you heard the earnestness with which Mr. Panetta just  described the committee's work. You can go through every line of the  committee's work, and you are going to find a story similar to the one  that Mr. Panetta has told about his family that applies to hundreds of  thousands of families across the country.   That is what this work product was. That is what the committee spent  weeks and weeks putting together. That is, candidly, what my  constituents think we do up here every day: find problems, find  partners, craft solutions, and bring them to the floor.   My friend from Colorado said that we shouldn't let the perfect be the  enemy of the good, and I think he is exactly right. I haven't voted on  the perfect bill since I have been here, Madam Speaker. You may have  had that opportunity; I have not. I vote on bills that move the ball in  the right direction. Even had I been king for a day, I couldn't have  done it better.   But the flip side of ``don't let the perfect be the enemy of the  good'' is that this bill passed out of the Ways and Means Committee  unanimously. It was perfect if bipartisanship was your goal. It is now  good legislation. But with this change, it is perfectly partisan.   I would advise my colleagues that we spent a lot of time when we were  in control--and I had the pleasure of leading the rule, as my friend  from Colorado does today--protecting our Members from tough votes. You  may not know, Madam Speaker, but the way the Rules Committee works, we  could have offered waivers. If you wanted to strike protections for  homeschooling families, if you wanted to strike protections from  families who need to buy more than what they can find in their public  school system for their special needs child, you could have brought an  amendment to the floor of this House and said: I don't like those  protections for those families. I want to strike them.   But then you would have had to have stood up and said that whatever  your ax was that you were grinding that day took priority over those  families. No Member in this institution wants to do that, which is why  it comes to the Rules Committee as a seemingly innocuous line in a  committee report and why it only takes six members to vote ``yes'' on  it up there to make it a part of the underlying bill. It pretends that  the committee voted on it when, in fact, they did not.  [[Page H4028]]    If we want to vote on these issues, then let's vote on these issues.  But I will just tell my friends here in their fifth month of leadership  that they will begin to rue the day that they told their new Members  they could come to Capitol Hill, be a United States Congressperson, and  not have to take tough votes.   We began to rue that day when we started down that road, and you only  get one chance to start again.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to associate myself with everything my friend  from Massachusetts just said. Every line of this bill, as crafted by  the Ways and Means Committee, was designed to make a difference in a  family's life, a difference that every single one of us can be proud  of, and no one has a single bit of concern about that language.   The concern is that, instead of being down here celebrating this  bipartisan product, in the dark of night it was converted.   My friend from Colorado is absolutely right. Not only was the home- schooling provision stripped out; a provision for Gold Star families  was put in.   Now, I will just tell you, if you have any concerns, Madam Speaker,  let me speak on behalf of the Republican Conference. If you want to  stand up for Gold Star families, I have got Members who want to stand  with you. I don't have some; I have them all.   To be fair, that has nothing to do with being a Republican. If I go  to the Democratic side of the aisle and look for folks to stand with  Gold Star families, I won't find one; I will find them all.   That is yet another thing that unites us, and kudos to Richard Neal,  as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, for taking an opportunity  to make the bill better in that way.   I happen to have his manager's amendment here, Madam Speaker. This is  the language that was taken up by the Rules Committee last night and,  again, stuck in because only six people voted ``yes.'' And page after  page is dealing with those Gold Star families and trying to right that  clerical error in drafting.   It is in the middle of page 3, with looks like seven words: ``In  section 302, strike subsections (b) and (d).'' You might not know what  section 302 is and what sections (b) and (d) are, Madam Speaker. I will  read some of that to you, again, from the Democratic chairman's  committee report, from the unanimous legislation that was passed.   The provision allows tax-free treatment to apply to distributions  made for certain additional qualifying expenses on behalf of designated  beneficiaries attending elementary and secondary schools.   This is the offensive language that my friend referenced that some  Members of his caucus had problems with that needed to be taken out.  Here it comes. And I don't mean to offend you by reading these words,  Madam Speaker, but I am just going to read them directly because I feel  the burden to do it.   In addition to tuition, tax-free treatment would apply to a  distribution made for expenses for fees, tutoring, special-needs  services, books, supplies, and other equipment incurred in connection  with the attendance of elementary school.   I am aghast. I am aghast that that is what the Ways and Means  Committee decided to do. I am just going to tell you again, Madam  Speaker.   The committee, in its wisdom, unanimously decided that we should  speak up for families who have problems with expenses for fees,  academic tutoring, special-needs services, books, supplies, and other  equipment incurred in connection with their child's attendance in  elementary school.   That is what this big to-do was about today. If you want to have a  vote on the floor of the House that says, ``I don't want children in  elementary school to have any help,'' we can have that vote. I think it  would lose, and so do my friends on the other side of the aisle.   That is why we are not going to have that vote. We are going to sneak  it in, in the rule, and never be able to speak on it.   I appreciate my friend raising the Gold Star issue because that is  yet another area of agreement, like the issue my friend from  Massachusetts spoke about, like the issue my friend from California  spoke about.   Madam Speaker, when you are in the majority in this Chamber, it is  easy to get legislation passed. You control the Rules Committee. You  control the votes on the board. You get to jam everything through.   I know. I spent 8 years in the majority, and that is the way every  day is when you are in the majority.   But you don't have to jam everything through. Occasionally--just  occasionally--there are bills, like this bill from the Ways and Means  Committee, where every single line is dedicated to solving problems,  problems that affect your district and problems that affect my  district.   Occasionally--just occasionally--we find Members on both sides of the  aisle sitting down, rolling up their sleeves, looking for solutions  instead of talking  [[Page H4029]]  points. And, when that happens, you produce good legislation like the  bill Chairman Neal brought before us today.   We could have been down here celebrating that legislation, Madam  Speaker. Instead, we are talking about the efforts to unwind it. And,  for the life of me, I just don't understand why that is the path we  have chosen.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I don't have any speakers remaining. I  have a powerful previous question vote that I would like to describe,  and I am prepared to do that at this time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   We can't always get exercised about every single line in every single  bill. We would never get anything done.   We have an amendment process so that, if you get exercised about a  particular line in a particular bill, you can bring your amendment to  the floor and we vote on it.   We are going to get into the appropriations process soon. When we  spend money, it turns out to be one of those issues that people feel  strongly about. We are going to entertain hundreds of amendments-- Republican amendments, Democratic amendments.   Some Republican amendments are going to pass; some are going to fail.  Some Democrat amendments are going to pass; some are going to fail.   But we are going to work the will of the body, and we are going to do  the best we can to get to a final package that we move across the  street to the Senate.   My frustration in this moment, Madam Speaker, isn't that we have the  inability of moving things forward and discussing ideas. We do have the  ability to do that, and we did that well in the Ways and Means  Committee.   My frustration is that, when people don't like the way the committee  unanimously, in a bipartisan way, did something because they have  bipartisan concerns--and, to be clear, the concerns about this language  are not Republican concerns. This language was not stricken because  Republicans objected. This language was not stricken to satisfy any  bipartisan concern of any kind.   This was purely a partisan exercise. And if you want to have a  partisan exercise, I know 435 Members who are here all day, who will  come down here to the House floor and vote on it, and we can do that.   So I want to offer that opportunity, Madam Speaker. For folks who  think this is about public policy, as it was when the committee  considered it in a bipartisan way, I want to offer an amendment to this  bill.   If we defeat the previous question, Madam Speaker, I will offer an  amendment that strikes this offending section. What that means in  layman's terms is the bill would contain the Gold Star family language  that is very important to every Member of this Chamber. It would  contain the pension language that is very important to every Member of  this Chamber.   It would contain every line designed in a bipartisan fashion by the  Ways and Means Committee to make a difference in families' lives, but  it would strike the majority's effort, with only six votes on the Rules  Committee, to eliminate protections for home-schooling families  altogether.   Vote against the previous question, defeat the previous question, and  we can restore the bipartisan consensus language the Ways and Means  Committee crafted, and we will add the Gold Star family language that  my friend from Colorado and I agree on.   I don't serve in the Ways and Means Committee, Madam Speaker. They  have got big ideas they have to work on over there. I don't serve on  the Financial Services Committee. They have got big ideas they have to  work on over there.   I serve in the Rules Committee. My job is to get bills to the House  floor and to make sure that voices are heard on perfecting that  language.   If we defeat the previous question, we can achieve exactly the  partisan goal that the majority wants, but we can achieve it by  actually having a vote of the House on that goal.   I think the American people are tired of things being done in secret.  I think they are tired of things being done without the full story  being told.   I talk to my friends on the other side of the aisle regularly, daily,  hourly, Madam Speaker. I know the hunger from your side of the aisle to  deliver on behalf of the American people. I know that hunger. I know  the hunger on your side of the aisle to roll up sleeves and do the hard  things. Because the easy things somebody else has already taken care  of. All that is left for you and me are the hard things.   Going to the well of partisanship, pulling your sharp stick out of  your quiver and poking the other team, those aren't the hard things.  Those are the easy things. And, candidly, those aren't the surprising  things. They have become all too commonplace.   I don't get to run this institution, but I do get a vote in it. I see  opportunities for partnership, not because everybody wants it, but  because it has to happen. Republican President, Republican Senate,  Democratic House: The only way we succeed, Madam Speaker, is to succeed  together. That is the only pathway forward.   If anybody in this Chamber ran for their seat because they wanted to  stand up here and talk about it for 2 years, we have got a great  pathway for you. But if you ran for this seat because you actually  wanted to get it done, these bills today aren't doing it.   The Senate won't consider them. The President is not going to sign  them. But there are ideas in these bills, Madam Speaker, as expressed  unanimously by the Ways and Means Committee, that America is hungry for  and you and I can deliver.   Let's exceed expectations today. Defeat the previous question, and  let's restore this bill to the bipartisan compromise that the Ways and  Means Committee created.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the amendment be printed in the Record immediately prior to the vote on  the previous question.    Madam Speaker, on that, I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
