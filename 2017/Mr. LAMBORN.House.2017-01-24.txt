 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give voice to the millions  of lives that have been lost in the aftermath of Roe v. Wade.   In the 44 years since that disgraceful decision, an unconscionable 58  million abortions have been performed. That represents 58 million  children who will never grow up, never make their own decisions, and  never influence the world around them, but whose lives are cut short.   The House took a vital step today with the passage of H.R. 7, the No  Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure  Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill that permanently  prohibits taxpayers from funding abortion through the Hyde amendment.   Since its original passage, this amendment has saved over 2 million  babies. Congress must make permanent these protections to honor the  conscience rights of a strong majority of Americans who do not want  their taxpayer dollars paying for abortions.   This week, we gather to mourn the tragic loss of life and to seek  God's forgiveness for the stain of abortion on our Nation's conscience.   May God have mercy on our country.                            ____________________
