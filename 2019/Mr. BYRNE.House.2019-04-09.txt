 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to raise questions of grave  constitutional significance.   Last week, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee  requested the IRS turn over years' worth of President Trump's personal  and business tax returns. These are returns that cover business  decisions and dealings long before the President came to office.  [[Page H3138]]    Similarly, the chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform has  indicated that his committee will examine allegations regarding how the  President valued real estate, among other business decisions, long  before the President was elected. He has also indicated he may call  members of the President's family to testify about these and other  Trump Organization dealings.   These actions are not only blatantly partisan, but they raise serious  constitutional concerns.   Our system is one of limited powers and of checks and balances. The  Congress is not a law enforcement agency. It is not a court of law. It  is a legislative body.   Beside me are the words of Chief Justice Earl Warren, someone whom I  would say most on the other side hold in high esteem:   ``There is no general authority to expose the private affairs of  individuals without justification in terms of the functions of the  Congress. . . . Investigations conducted solely for the personal  aggrandizement of the investigators or to `punish' those investigated  are indefensible.''   As the Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed, investigations  conducted by this House ``must be related to and be in furtherance of a  legitimate task of the Congress.''   The Court has particularly warned that investigations of the private  affairs of individuals are off limits without a clear connection to  this body's constitutional functions. Rightly so. We are a nation of  laws and of liberty.   The President's political opponents tried and failed to make his tax  returns and his business dealings an issue in the 2016 Presidential  election. The American people settled that issue at the ballot box.                                time  1045    It is absolutely clear that the majority does not seek the  President's tax returns, information about his business, or to haul his  family before Congress in an effort to pass new laws or for some other  legislative purpose.   These investigations are thinly veiled attempts to use the powers of  this Chamber to provide ammunition for the 2020 election.   Mr. Speaker, each of us swears a duty to uphold the Constitution.  Each of us has a responsibility to ensure that our actions conform  within its boundaries and its principles. I urge the majority to  remember that obligation and reconsider this course.   The investigatory power of this institution is absolutely critical to  our function as a coequal and independent branch of government.   Excesses by the body led to an intervention by the Supreme Court in  an over 40-year period when the right of Congress to compel testimony  was called into question.   Again, in the 1950s, the court was forced to intervene to stop the  excesses of the House Un-American Activities Committee.   Let's be clear. These so-called investigations set a dangerous  precedent. The majority wants to use Congress to investigate the past  personal and business dealings of an elected official and his family.  This is yet another attempt to coerce and intimidate people with whom  they disagree.   This isn't legitimate. This is a witch hunt, and it threatens to  undermine legislative investigations in the future.   So, again, I ask the majority to think very hard about their  constitutional obligations and what these partisan attacks against the  President will mean for the future of this House. It is your right to  oppose the President at the ballot box, not to use the powers of this  body to score political points.   There is no legitimate purpose for this Congress to investigate the  President or his family before he was elected to office.                            ____________________
