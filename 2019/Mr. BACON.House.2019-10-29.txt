 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Steve Tamayo in  recognition of Native American Heritage Month for his lifetime  contributions in the arts and the preservation of Native American  culture.   Steve's passion has been fueled by the desire to restore what was  taken away from the indigenous people of this land. For centuries,  cultural teachings have been passed down through art. Symbols, colors,  patterns, and construction techniques are narratives that reflect  values and beliefs of traditional Native American life. American  history is bound in the antiquity of its Native people.   We are proud of the role Mr. Tamayo has played in ensuring that we  can all learn and appreciate this rich heritage.   Steve Tamayo was one of four children raised by loving parents  Fortunato and Beulah Tamayo. As a migrant worker, Fortunato grew up  working the fields from Texas to Montana. Notwithstanding this lack of  schooling, he was successful in obtaining a job and taking care of his  family. Steve describes his mother as a kind and compassionate woman  despite her difficult childhood as a survivor of the American Indian  boarding school tragedy. Steve's parents encouraged their children to  have a strong work ethic, to focus on getting an education, and to  pursue the opportunities they were not afforded.   After graduating from Thomas Jefferson High School in May 1984, Steve  enlisted in the U.S. Army, serving with the 101st Airborne Division.  After returning to Omaha, he sought out Native elders to guide him in  his pursuit of cultural knowledge.   In 1988, his first teacher was Cleo Frazier from Yankton Sioux  Reservation of South Dakota. She resided in the Omaha area and took  time to teach Steve and his older brother about indigenous life. This  relationship fostered Steve's quest to learn as much as possible about  the history and stories of indigenous people.   This led him to an elder named Howard Wolf, a World War II veteran  from the Umo N Ho N Nation of Nebraska. Under elder Wolf's guidance,  Steve learned about art and regalia, including the traditional  materials, construction, and the history surrounding Native American  artifacts.   In 2000, he moved to the Rosebud Reservation, where he was able to  gain a deeper understanding of the art of the Northern Plains Tribes.  Because of the unique skills and specific knowledge gained, Steve was  hired as faculty in the Lakota Studies Department of Sinte Gleska,  where he taught college students for 12 years.   In 2005, he became the cultural specialist for the Native American  Advocacy Program on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota. This was a  special time for Steve because he was in a place that was the ancestral  homeland of his mother's family.   That same year was an important point in his professional life. A  group of conservators from the Smithsonian Institution stumbled upon  him while tanning a buffalo hide in his front yard. Six months later,  he was headed for Washington, D.C., for a 6-month internship.   Since that time, Steve has been one of the main consultants from the  Plains Tribes for the National Museum of the American Indian. He has  been part of numerous exhibitions, including an exhibit scheduled to  run for 15 years called ``As We Grow,'' featuring historic games and  toys of the Plains Indians.   In 2015, Steve traveled to Washington, D.C., to erect a teepee that  he painted on The Mall and presented to President Obama, which is now  part of the Smithsonian's collection.    He had the opportunity to paint two buffalo robes for Willie Nelson  and Neil Young at the ``Harvest the Hope'' concert in Neligh, Nebraska,  to honor them for their work in preserving our Nebraska land.   Steve's work has helped to educate our country about our history, the  culture, and the struggles of Native American people.   Today, Steve leads study groups on all four reservations in Nebraska  and nine reservations in South Dakota. He travels to schools and  museums throughout the country to help train students, docents,  conservators, and curators on the significance of traditional Native  arts, as well as the dangers of cultural appropriation.   Steve is on the Artists in Schools and Communities roster for the  Nebraska Arts Council. He serves as the cultural consultant for the  Omaha Public Schools' Native Indigenous Centered Education program. He  works as the cultural specialist for the Nebraska Urban Indian Health  Coalition. Steve has also been an adjunct instructor for the University  of Nebraska Omaha and Metropolitan Community College.   In 2014, he was honored by Nebraska Governor Dave Heineman at the  Nebraska Arts Council's Governor's Arts Awards when he was presented  the Heritage Art Award. His proudest moment was when his mother saw him  receive that award.   Steve has also become a source of pride and empowerment for his  children. Of his six children, his eldest  [[Page H8546]]  daughters, twins Nicole and Rebecca, work in the field of Native  American advocacy, health, and education. Steve and his wife, Susan,  love their children and their numerous grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Steve for all of his contributions. Because of  his work, generations to come will learn about the culture and  contributions of the indigenous people.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to take the time to thank Ms. Lofgren  and Mr. Davis for guiding this discussion, this debate today, and Trent  Kelly for submitting a great bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution which honors the  memory of two great American warriors: Army Sergeant First Class Sean  Cooley and Army Specialist Chris Horton. These heroes rest in honored  glory, servants to our great Republic, who answered the call and gave  their lives fighting for our freedoms and to give hope to others  fighting for a better future in Iraq and Afghanistan.   We could never repay the debt we owe, but we can honor them by caring  for their families. This is why this resolution to establish the Gold  Star Family Fellowship Program in the House is so important and has my  full support.   Since becoming a Member of the House, I have made it my mission to  work across the aisle to ensure Congress does its part to honor our  heroes and care for the families who bear the daily burden of their  loss.   To our Gold Star and surviving families, I recall President Lincoln's  words to a grieving mother who lost five sons in the Civil War: ``I  pray that the Heavenly Father may assuage the anguish of your  bereavement, and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and  lost, and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid so costly a  sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.''   As we approach Veterans Day, this action is timely and sends an  important message of support to our military families and to the  American people.   The daring raid this weekend which ended the life of the world's most  wanted terrorist is a reminder of how much we--indeed, the entire free  world--owe to our military, our military servicemembers and their  families.   Mr. Speaker, I wish to personally thank my good friend and wingman on  the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Kelly, for introducing this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
