 Madam Speaker, today I rise to  congratulate Lumbee Tribal Council member, Terry Hunt, who during  July's council meeting was honored for nearly three decades of service  in the U.S. Army and the North Carolina National Guard where he served  as a Command Sergeant Major.   During the meeting, Councilman Hunt was bestowed with the Old North  State Award, which honors guard members who have served at least 20  years and who have shown a dedication of service beyond expectation. He  was also awarded the North Carolina Association Certificate, which  honors National Guard retirees.   Councilman Hunt was elected to the Tribal Council in 2018,  representing District 14, which includes communities in Eastern Robeson  County. I am proud to work alongside him and the other members of the  council as we pursue long-overdue Federal recognition for the Lumbee.   Congratulations to Councilman Hunt on this great honor. The people of  North Carolina are grateful for his service.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for yielding.   The Transportation Security Transparency Improvement Act is a  commonsense solution to strengthen national security and promote  communication with stakeholders. Involving stakeholders in policymaking  is the most effective way to implement trustworthy and efficient  decisions. As any stakeholder will tell you, information sharing is  critical.   My bill will improve consistency in TSA's designation and redaction  of materials as sensitive security information, as well as address the  security directive and emergency amendment process and its impacts on  international aviation security. My bill will also ensure clear and  consistent designations and emphasize TSA's outreach with carriers and  local law enforcement to promote information sharing.   Finally, the Transportation Security Transparency Improvement Act  will instruct the TSA Administrator to implement guidelines to ensure  all security and safety measures are being met. This legislation will  undoubtedly improve aviation security by ensuring TSA clearly  communicates critical security information to transportation security  stakeholders.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.
