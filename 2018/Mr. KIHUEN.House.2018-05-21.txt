 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Quinton  Robbins.   Quinton attended the Route 51 festival in Las Vegas on October 1.   He was a student at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, UNLV. He  looked forward to going to dental school after receiving his bachelor's  degree.   When he wasn't in school, he spent his time either working as a  recreational assistant at the Arroyo Grande Sports Complex or playing  on a softball team. Quinton had a passion for softball, and would  occasionally coach youth t-ball teams.   Quinton was loved by everyone he met. All those who knew him remember  him for being a kind and loving soul.   Quinton was a leader who welcomed everyone with a smile that could  light up a room.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend my condolences to Quinton  Robbins' family and friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas,  the State of Nevada, and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
