 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the IDEA Act that  Representative  John Ratcliffe and I introduced.   The idea behind this act is very simple. I represent Silicon Valley.  Companies in the private sector in Silicon Valley have very  sophisticated websites that make it really easy for consumers to use  those websites. There is no reason that the United States Government  shouldn't have websites that are as user friendly and easy to use. This  bill will require our agencies to be as user friendly to citizens as  the private sector is for consumers.   This bill would never have taken place if it wasn't for bipartisan  leadership. I want to particularly recognize Chairman Will Hurd, who  not only helped with this, but gave me advice on how to draft the bill,  and, of course, Ranking Member Robin Kelly. I also want to recognize   John Ratcliffe for his extraordinary work; Senator Rob Portman, who has  moved this in the Senate; and Matt Lira at the White House Office of  American Innovation, who has been instrumental in this. It shows that  the Congress can work to bring modern technology into government.
