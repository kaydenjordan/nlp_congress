 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished ranking member  of the House Ways and Means Work and Welfare subcommittee for the time.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, the surprise billing our workers act, is  another extreme MAGA attempt that threatens to punish hardworking  constituents whom, at no fault of their own, may have been overpaid  unemployment insurance benefits.  [[Page H2291]]    If deficiencies and errors on the part of the unemployment  authorities in each State caused an overpayment, this bill would allow  the government to go after those funds for up to 10 years.   Imagine that. Constituents in my district in North Las Vegas, who  have been working hard, paying their bills, and taking care of their  families, suddenly get a surprise bill that says that they owe hundreds  or even thousands of dollars.   On top of that, you want to go after fraudulent people gaming the  system. We have laws and resources in place to go after networks and  individuals who purposely try to get money that they are not entitled  to.   Just look at the Member from the other side of the aisle who was  indicted yesterday for unemployment fraud, among other things.    Mr. Speaker, last Congress, I introduced the  Unemployment Insurance Technology Modernization Act, which would  prevent fraud and address the technical shortcomings of many State  unemployment programs. I would ask my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle to work with me and other colleagues to actually provide  solutions.   Stop targeting our constituents. Let's go after the corporate cartels  that are involved in this fraud of our unemployment insurance, but  let's protect the unemployment program, which is a bridge to people who  need it. My constituents faced the second highest unemployment during  the pandemic. I will fight for them every step of the way.
