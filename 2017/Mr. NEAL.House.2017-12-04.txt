The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.   Stated for:    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to instruct at the desk.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  instruct.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mr. Neal moves that the managers on the part of the House       at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses       on the Senate amendment to the bill H.R. 1 be instructed to--        (1) disagree with section 11081 of the Senate amendment       (relating to elimination of shared responsibility payment for       individuals failing to maintain minimum essential coverage),       and        (2) recede from section 1303 of the House bill (relating to       repeal of deduction for certain taxes not paid or accrued in       a trade or business).    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 7 of rule XXII, the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal) and the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Brady) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Massachusetts?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, this could be a long few days if they can't agree on a  motion to go to conference. That is not exactly the most heightened  controversy we have.   Mr. Speaker, I want to stand in support of the Democratic motion to  instruct conferees on the Ryan-McConnell tax package and in strong  opposition to the Republican tax plan.   Behind me is a replica of the national debt clock. This clock was  just reconfigured. New features have been added just in time for the  Republicans to acknowledge that they are about to add $1 trillion to  this national debt clock, which they tortured Democratic Presidents on  for years about the debt.   So let me provide you with some historical perspective. In January of  2001, when Bill Clinton said good-bye, we were looking at a $5.4  trillion surplus, four straight balanced budgets, and record economic  growth. The CBO said that the surplus might even go beyond $5.6  trillion.   But what really happened during that period of time?   After the Bush administration left, we were staring at $6.1 trillion  worth of debt.   So what happened?   In 2001, the Republican Party cut taxes by $1.3 trillion and said it  was all about economic growth. Then they came back in 2003 and said:  Well, the growth hasn't been substantial enough, so we are going to cut  taxes by another $1 trillion, $2.3 trillion of tax cuts, and a  repatriation tax holiday where the money is returned at 5.25 percent on  the promise of economic growth and job creation; none of which  happened.   So where are we tonight?   We are back to the same old pattern and playbook that they continue  to utilize. They promised job growth. In a meeting with the President  recently, he said he didn't understand why we couldn't have job growth  of 4, 5, or 6 percent. I don't know an economist who thinks we are  going to have 6 percent economic growth, but they use that as the  linchpin, the excuse for a tax cut that is going to add $1 trillion to  the budget deficits, all based on the following economic assumption:  maybe.   Maybe we will have growth that will help us to pay down the debt. All  of the mainstream economists say maybe a return of one-third on the tax  cuts in terms of revenue. Joint Committee on Taxation, The Wharton  School, the Tax Policy Center, moodys.com, they all say the same thing:  None of this is going to happen.   So we are also back to a familiar argument that they hear, and I  think you should pay some attention to this for the moment.   They will say things repeatedly like: It is the people's money. The  people know what to do with it.   Well, let me say this as well tonight: It is the people's veterans  hospitals; one million new veterans after Iraq and Afghanistan who are  going to be in need of long-term care. That is the people's  responsibility.   In addition, 10,000 baby boomers retire every single day in America.  Social Security is part of their retirement system, even as it averages  about $15,000 for American citizens.   We are going to live longer, and we herald that achievement  regularly, but it is also going to mean more Alzheimer's and more  dementia that families are going to have to reconcile, and they are  going to come back and say at the right moment: Oh, because there is  less revenue, we are going to have to have cuts in social spending.   So they are going to say at the right moment: Oh, we are going to  have to now change the way we calculate Medicare and Social Security.   This is a missed opportunity above everything else. Everybody agrees  on what is wrong with the Tax Code.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, there was a chance here to do some investment in human  capital: community colleges, vocational education, internship programs.  The  [[Page H9604]]  Labor Department reported 3 weeks ago, 6 million jobs go unanswered in  America every single day.   I hope tonight, as the Republicans confer, they can tell us where  they are actually conferring because, between the paste and the bubble  gum, they keep putting on a new dimension to their proposal.    This should be a debate that included both parties. Before I reserve  my time, for the moment, I want to say this: We had a chance to really  do something big. They have, unbelievably, proposed to take the entire  revenue architecture of this country in 3 weeks without one hearing,  without one witness. They are going to change it all, and the middle  class is about to get it in the neck to take care of people at the top.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin), who announced this past weekend that he is going  to leave this institution. He has served this institution with  distinction and grace for a long period of time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett), a valued member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett), a valued member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an additional  30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson), a valued member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Larson), a neighbor and a good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Larson), a neighbor and a good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Blumenauer), a particular champion of all renewable energy forms.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Blumenauer), a particular champion of all renewable energy forms.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), a very important member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Crowley), a member of the leadership of the Democratic Party.  I think he is going to tell us about what the elimination of the State  and local tax deduction means to the people of New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), who is a valued member of the Ways and  Means Committee. The gentleman is also a great champion of new markets  tax credits and the historic tax credit which is eliminated in the  Republican tax plan.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, in every place that I  went yesterday, people asked me: What are you going to say to the  conferees?   I said that I am going to join with my colleagues and say to the  conferees: Help the needy and not the greedy.   I am going to say to the conferees: Why give 50 percent of the tax  break to the wealthiest 1 percent of the population in this country?   I am going to say: Why cut Medicare, Medicaid, and provisions of the  Affordable Care Act that have kept millions of people from having the  agony, pain, and frustration of not being able to find healthcare?   I am going to say: Save the children; save the veterans; save the  center cities that are decayed; save the infrastructure; save the  safety net; and save America.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Higgins), who is a valued member of the Ways and Means  Committee.   Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, it has been said by the U.S.  Treasury Secretary that tax cuts pay for themselves. He says that not  only will these corporate taxes pay for themselves, they will add an  additional $2 trillion in economic activity. Nobody believes that.  There is no credible report that supports that contention.   What do pay for themselves are tax credits, particularly the Federal  historic tax credit. That is one that returns generously to the Federal  Treasury. The Federal historic tax credit returns more to the Treasury  than it costs. In fact, $25 billion in credits have returned $29  billion to the Federal Treasury; $5 of private investment is made for  every dollar in the Federal historic tax credit program.   Nationally, $132 billion in private investment has been made because  of $25 million in Federal historic tax credits. Over 43,000 buildings  in downtown areas like my community of Buffalo, New York, have  benefited tremendously from this valuable program.   It is eliminated in the House bill; it is eliminated in the Senate  bill; and the conference should restore it as an issue of fairness.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell), who is a great champion of the middle class and a  Marshall Scholar.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell), who is a great champion of the middle class and a  Marshall Scholar.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene).   Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, over the past few weeks Republicans have  been cutting backroom deals that benefit the wealthy and well-connected  out of the light of day, piling hurt onto people who won't be able to  speak for themselves.    Now we are on the verge of being force-fed a bill in which  corporations  [[Page H9608]]  get massive tax cuts while hardworking Americans are forced to pick up  the tab. Over the life of the Ryan-McConnell plan, 36 million middle  class families struggling to pay for healthcare, education, childcare,  housing, and retirement are going to see their taxes go up. Now  millions may lose healthcare coverage as well.   What happened to fiscal responsibility?   Economists are telling us that the increased debt won't be paid for  by economic growth, and CEOs are openly sharing their plans to reward  their shareholders with their new tax breaks--not create jobs.   This bill is reckless, and I urge my colleagues to support this  motion.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Sanchez), who is a distinguished member of the Ways and  Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu), who is the former revenue commissioner of  California and who knows something about revenue projections.   Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, this tax scam is one of the  greatest cons I have seen in my time in Congress, and Republicans know  it. Why else would they rush to vote without giving the public time to  review or understand legislation that impacts 100 percent of our  economy? In the Senate, they even shattered regular order to pass this  bill with handwritten, illegible changes in the dead of night on  Saturday. Perhaps it is because they don't want anybody to see how far  this bill strays from their promises.   They promised historic tax cuts, but unless you are already rich or a  corporation already seeing record profits, you are unlikely to benefit.  Instead, you and your children will be paying to make the rich richer.   Republicans don't even deny that individuals get less than  corporations. But it is okay, they claim, because that money will get  to you eventually. They keep citing these magical numbers of money that  you will get, but we know these dollars won't come.   Whether losing deductions for State and local taxes, paying more for  student loans, or facing higher healthcare prices, thanks to the repeal  of the mandate, the GOP tax scam will hurt millions.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), who is the assistant  Democratic leader.   In reference to my friend, Mr. Kelly, Mr. Clyburn is a real champion  of the middle class.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), one of the best legislators in the House, the  Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, apparently the gentleman forgets the  difference between the Clinton years and the Bush years, as it relates  to the deficits.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Pelosi).    Mr. Speaker, might I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 3\1/4\  minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard this discussion back and forth tonight  about tax relief for the middle class; and we have heard the other side  say that you are going to get $1,189 for a family of four, I think,  making $59,000 a year.   But what they don't say is that they are going to take away the State  and local tax deduction; they are going to take away the ability of  children to deduct interest payments on student debt; that they are  going to shave back the mortgage interest deduction; get rid of the  historic tax credit; that they are going to get rid of new markets tax  credits.    And here is the best one of all: as champions of the middle class  they are, they are going to repeal the estate tax.   The gentleman from Pennsylvania, who is my friend, said that we need  to stop talking about wealth.  [[Page H9611]]    Well, how about approaching it this way? We are wealthy and we are  not going to take it anymore, because that is essentially what this  argument is about.   When you look at the distribution tables as to who gets what in this  tax proposal, the concentration of wealth at the very top is  highlighted time and again.   When we talk about tax relief for the middle class, when we examine  what this is about to do to California, to New York, to Massachusetts,  and to Connecticut, to name, but a few of the States that are going to  pay a penalty for this tax plan--   And I dispute fully what the chairman said about the Obama years.  Fourteen million jobs were created during the Obama years. Twenty-three  million jobs were created during the Clinton years. The day that George  Bush left, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month in America. That is the  reality.   When you look at economic growth during those years, the 2 percent  that we look at was not enough. But it has now been almost 13 years  when middle class people have not had a pay raise and, time and again,  we have heard the preposterous argument--and, boy, did it get us into  trouble--that tax cuts pay for themselves.   You cannot find a mainstream economist that will say that tax cuts  pay for themselves.   Now you hear the repeated argument that, if we cut taxes and we add  dynamic scoring, based upon what might occur, or maybe, or if, then we  are told that this is going to alleviate slow productivity and slow  growth in America, all based upon the premise of tax cuts.   You know what we should be doing tonight, Mr. Speaker?   We should be talking about investing in human capital. We should be  talking about the 6 million jobs that go unanswered in America every  single day. We should be talking about community colleges. We should be  talking about the idea of apprenticeship programs and, yes, investing  in vocational education. We should be also talking about, finally, what  to do about the 2 million people in America who have opiate addictions  and don't go to work every day. We should be concerned about the labor  participation rate in America.   Instead, the answer always becomes the Holy Grail of Republican  economics; cut taxes for the people at the very top, and plead the case  that what you are really doing is for people in the middle class.   The alternative minimum tax is devoted to people at the top, and the  idea of repealing the estate tax for so few people in America is  outrageous.
