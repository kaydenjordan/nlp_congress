 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of my  constituents, Ernie Edison West, who passed from this life on May 1.  His fellow soldiers knew him as Private First Class West. His friends  knew him as Ernie. Mr. West bravely served his country during the  Korean War, and his heroic actions earned him our Nation's highest  military honors, including both a Medal of Honor from President  Eisenhower, and later a Purple Heart.   Although Mr. West lost one of his eyes while defending and saving the  lives of several of his fellow soldiers in Korea, he never considered  himself disabled. As a town mayor, coach, friend, and mentor to many,  Mr. West was an unconditional friend to all he met, and lived a life of  selfless service to his community. He worked all his life to help  veterans and was buried in the very cemetery, the Veterans Cemetery  North East in Greenup County, for which he, himself, worked to secure  the land and the funding. Mr. West's efforts were also crucial to the  establishment of the Greenup County War Memorial. This memorial honors  hometown heroes on the main street of Mr. West's hometown in Wurtland,  Kentucky.   Mr. West leaves behind his daughter, Amy West Hogsett and her  husband, Randy; five granddaughters; and seven great-grandchildren. In  the words of his niece, Marny Gilluly, Mr. West was ``larger than life,  truly a hero to many, and personified the good in people.'' May this  brave hero rest in peace.                            ____________________
