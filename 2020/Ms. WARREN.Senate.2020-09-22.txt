 Madam President, ``trailblazer,'' ``icon,'' ``titan,''  ``Notorious RBG''--those are just a few of the words that describe the  Honorable Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who passed away last Friday. But  there is another of Justice Ginsburg's title that I will always hold  dear: ``friend.''   As a young mother and a baby law student at Rutgers's Law School, I  had almost no examples of female lawyers or female law professors. Like  so many young women who were trying to do something as seemingly  outlandish as going to law school, it was a really lonely undertaking.   Ruth was one of the few women whom we could see--a woman who had made  it, and, even better, a woman who was fighting for other women.   As I arrived at Rutgers, Ruth had left Rutgers for Columbia Law  School. Rutgers was a small family, and all the women and the men knew  about her. She was putting together the Women's Rights Project at the  ACLU to give her a way to fight for equality in the courts. Her sharp  legal mind and stubborn determination were already legendary, and we  were sure she would change the world. And she did.   I am forever grateful for her example to me and to millions of young  women who saw her as a role model. I am also forever grateful that she  made real change, opening doors that had remained stubbornly closed.   Justice Ginsburg may have been tiny, but she stands among the  greatest fighters for justice our Nation has ever seen. She turned  every barrier into an opportunity for change. And when she became the  second woman in our Nation's history to sit on the Supreme Court, she  continued her fight for justice, blazing a trail for women's rights,  laying out the framework for protecting our democracy, and helping to  secure justice for the most vulnerable. Ruth Bader Ginsburg changed the  world, and I will miss her.   While I mourn her loss, I also hold close one of the things I loved  most about Ruth: She was a fighter. We honor her memory by fighting for  the things that Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought for during her long career:  a woman's right to make decisions about her own body, healthcare for  millions of Americans, Dreamers who have made a home here, voting  rights, LGBTQ rights, workers' rights, union rights, and making our  Nation a place where no one is more likely to be murdered or imprisoned  or discriminated against because of the color of their skin, how they  worship, or who they love.  [[Page S5773]]    Yes, it is a long list. Ruth defended it all, and now she is gone,  and because she is gone, these rights and values are all on the line,  vulnerable to being snatched away by another rightwing tilt of the  Supreme Court.   Justice Ginsburg's replacements will determine who the highest Court  in the land works for--women and sick kids and workers and immigrants  or billionaires and giant companies and rightwing politicians who want  to shrink our democracy in order to stay in power.   Ruth left our Nation a note before she died, and her words were  clear. She said that her most fervent wish was that her replacement not  be named until a new President is installed.   Senator McConnell has already told us how to deal with the death of a  Supreme Court Justice in an election year--a Justice whom Senator  McConnell treated with respect.   In 2016, Justice Scalia died a full 269 days before the Presidential  election--months before any American would be able to cast a vote. But  in 2016, that didn't matter to Senator McConnell and his Republican  henchmen. They locked arms and insisted there could be no confirmation  until after the next President had been elected and sworn in.   Now, in 2020, the world is evidently different. Senator McConnell has  made it clear that the practice he used when Justice Scalia died would  not be used when Justice Ginsburg died.   On the very same night that Justice Ginsburg passed, Mitch McConnell  announced that he and Donald Trump would move immediately to name a new  Supreme Court Justice, despite the fact that voting is already underway  across the country and there are only 42 days before the election is  completed.   Democrat or Republican, the American people know that is not right.  Democrat or Republican, the American people know that treating a  Supreme Court vacancy as an opportunity for a naked partisan no-holds- barred power grab is burning down the pillars of integrity that support  our Senate, our courts, and our democracy. Democrat or Republican, the  American people will judge these choices for what they are--shameful.   If this feels personal, that is because it is. Ruth Ginsburg was a  personal hero, for me and for millions of other women.   Ruth Ginsburg was a woman who never let any man silence her. The most  fitting tribute to her is to refuse to be silenced and to name exactly  what Donald Trump and Senate Republicans are trying to do: steal  another Supreme Court seat.   This kind of sleazy double-dealing is the last gasp of a desperate  party that is undemocratically overrepresented in Congress and in the  halls of power across our country, the last gasp of a corrupt  Republican leadership numbed to its own hypocrisy that doesn't reflect  the views of the majority of Americans or the values that we hold dear,  the last gasp of a rightwing, billionaire-fueled party that wants to  hold onto power a little longer in order to impose its extremist agenda  on the entire country.   And if Mitch McConnell and the Senate Republicans ram this nomination  through, it is our duty to explore every option we have to restore the  Court's credibility and integrity; every option to expand our  democracy, not shrink it; every option to ensure that a working single  parent and a millionaire corporate executive have equal justice in our  courts; and every option to ensure that all Americans are represented  in our institutions.   The list of what is at stake if Republicans get their way and their  extremist agenda finds a home in the Nation's highest Court is truly  staggering.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg voted to protect healthcare for millions of  Americans. In a 5-to-4 decision, healthcare was saved for millions of  people. But in the midst of a global pandemic with more than 200,000 of  our loved ones dead from a virus raging out of control, Mitch McConnell  and Senate Republicans want to install a Justice who will rip that  healthcare away.   The Supreme Court will hear arguments just days after the election on  whether the Affordable Care Act should be overturned. If Justice  Ginsburg is replaced with a McConnell-Trump choice, the 5-to-4 decision  that saved healthcare by a single vote could be overturned.   That would strip away protection from anyone with preexisting  conditions. It would tell people with diabetes or high blood pressure  or cancer, people who have had strokes, people who have had hundreds of  other diseases, conditions, and events: You are on your own--no  protection from an insurance company that just wants to cut off your  insurance policies.   It would let insurance companies charge women more simply because  they are women. It would end the requirement that insurance companies  cover young people up to the age of 26. It would gut Medicaid.   And if you are one of the millions of Americans who has had COVID and  survived, well, gutting the ACA would allow insurance companies to deny  coverage because of it. COVID could become your preexisting condition.   Three years ago, Mitch McConnell couldn't get the votes to repeal the  Affordable Care Act, even in his own Republican-controlled Senate. And  why? Because this is not what the American people want. They want  access to healthcare and protection for people with preexisting  conditions.   But Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump have a plan B, a plan to advance  their rightwing agenda even if most Americans don't want it, and  McConnell and Trump seem to think that, if they can steal another  Supreme Court seat, they will get it.   There is more at stake. Ruth Bader Ginsburg voted to protect the  rights of all women to make their own decisions about their bodies.  Just a few months ago, in another 5-to-4 decision, Ruth Ginsburg's vote  was crucial to the Supreme Court overturning a Louisiana law designed  to make it harder for women to access abortion care.   Trump promised to appoint a Supreme Court Justice who will overturn  Roe, and his two Supreme Court picks have already delivered, agreeing  to let Louisiana restrict a woman's right to choose   Nineteen States now stand ready to gut abortion protections if the  Supreme Court overturns Roe, and now Senator McConnell and Senate  Republicans want to hand them one more Justice so they can get the job  done.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg also voted over and over for the principle that  American citizens should have an equal right to vote and an equal voice  in our democracy. She issued a scathing dissent in Shelby County v.  Holder, the Supreme Court decision overturning part of the Voting  Rights Act.   As the pandemic continues to sweep the Nation, the Supreme Court has  blocked attempts to make it easier for Americans to safely cast their  vote. Just in April, in a 5-to-4 decision with Justice Ginsburg  dissenting, the Court reversed a lower Federal court's decision to  expand the deadline for absentee voting in Wisconsin by 6 days.   Republicans know that, to stay in power, they need to make it harder  for all Americans to participate in the democratic process, and they  want a Supreme Court Justice who will be committed to rolling back  voting rights for decades to come.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg understood the threat that climate change poses  to our children's and our grandchildren's future. She joined in the  opinion in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, another 5- to-4 ruling, which required the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas  emissions from automobiles.   The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have actively  rolled back regulations that keep our air clean and our water safe, and  they are committed to putting another Justice on the Supreme Court who  will help advance their anti-environment agenda and block any  government attempts to tackle the dangers of climate change.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg understood the importance of protecting the  rights of workers to join together and fight for fair pay and working  conditions. In Epic Systems Corp. v. Lewis, she joined the minority in  a 5-to-4 decision dissenting from the Court's ruling that employers can  ban workers from joining together to demand protections against wage  theft and other abuses. A Supreme Court Justice handpicked by Trump and  McConnell could turn back the clock even more on workers' rights.  [[Page S5774]]    Throughout her life, Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought for justice and  equality for all Americans, and now Americans across this country are  following in Justice Ginsburg's footsteps. Americans are speaking out  and demanding change, and they are voting. With a pandemic raging out  of control, thanks to the incompetence and the corruption of Donald  Trump and his Republican enablers, with a battered economy and millions  of people out of work, with Americans across the country calling for an  end to the systemic racism that has cut short the lives of countless  Black men and women, Americans understand now more than ever that this  year's elections will determine the direction of our Nation for  generations to come.   Today, Ruth is gone, but her life's work endures. We will honor her  with action and channel our grief into change. We are at the cusp of a  brighter day in our Nation, and this is the moment. We must tap into  the reserves that we didn't know we had.   We tap into the reserves bequeathed to us from fighters we have  recently lost--like Justice Ginsburg and Congressman Elijah Cummings  and Congressman  John Lewis--and from the knowledge that we cannot--we  will not--leave our children worse off.   Three years ago I watched our Nation rise up in the face of  impossible odds and defend healthcare when Donald Trump and Mitch  McConnell wanted to strip away care from millions of Americans. We face  those same odds today as we again fight to protect the healthcare of  those same Americans and to protect so much more.   But I have hope because I know that this is a righteous fight, and I  know that millions of other Americans are also in this fight.   Before she died, Ruth gave us our marching orders: Do not fill this  Supreme Court seat until after the election when the next President is  installed. We have our call to action. We honor her legacy by  continuing the fight for justice, for equality, and for dignity--the  fight for a world where we finally make those words ``equal justice  under law'' real.   Now I would like to spend just a little bit of time focusing on  Justice Ginsburg's legacy by reading just a few of the statements by  her that really stood out to me as I reflected on her work.   At a 2012 symposium to honor the 40th anniversary of Justice Ginsburg  being hired as the first woman with full tenure at Columbia Law School,  two of Justice Ginsburg's former clerks, Abbe Gluck and Gillian  Metzger, now both law professors themselves, had a public conversation  with their former boss.   They asked Justice Ginsburg how she ended up working with the ACLU,  which became a major part of her legendary career, and she began her  answer by discussing the time that she lived in Sweden. Here is what  she said:         My eyes were opened up in Sweden. This was in '62 and '63--      women were about a quarter of the law students there, perhaps       three percent in the United States. It was already well       accepted that a family should have two wage-earners. A woman       named Eva Moberg wrote a column in the Stockholm Daily paper       with the headline, ``Why should the woman have two jobs and       the man only one?'' And the thrust of it was, yes, she is       expected to have a paying job, but she should also have       dinner on the table at seven, take her children to buy new       shoes, to their medical check-ups, and the rest. The notion       that he should do more than take out the garbage sparked       debates that were very interesting to me. Also in the months       I spent there, a woman came to Sweden from Arizona to have an       abortion. Her name was Sherri Finkbine. She had taken       thalidomide and there was a grave risk that the fetus, if it       survived, would be terribly deformed. So she came to Sweden       and there was publicity that she was there because she had no       access to a legal abortion in her home state. Well, that was       at the start of the 60s. I put it all on a back burner until       the late 60s when the women's movement came alive in the       United States.        My students, then at Rutgers, asked for a course on sex       discrimination and the law. And I went to the library and       inside of a month read every federal court decision on gender       discrimination--no mean feat at all because there were so       few, so very few. Also I had signed up as a volunteer lawyer       with the ACLU of New Jersey, more because it was a       respectable way of getting litigation experience than out of       ideological reasons, I will admit. Complaints from women       began trickling into the office, new kinds of complaints. For       example, women who were school teachers were required to       leave the classroom the minute their pregnancy began to show       because, after all, the children shouldn't be led to think       that their teachers swallowed a watermelon. Anyway, these       were women ready, willing, and able to work, but forced out       on so-called maternity leave, which meant ``You're out, and       if we want you back, we'll call.''        Another group of new complainants were women who had blue-      collar jobs and wanted the same health insurance package for       their family that a man would get. A woman could get health       insurance for herself, but she wasn't considered the       breadwinner in the family. Only the man got family benefits.       And just to indicate the variety, there was a wonderful       summer program at Princeton. The National Organization for       Women complained about it. Princeton had already become co-      educational. The summer program was for students at the end       of sixth grade. It was a Summer in Engineering program. The       children came on campus, they had an enriched program in math       and science. There was just one problem: it was for boys, not       girls. I should also mention one other complainant. Abbe       Seldin was her name. She was the best tennis player in her       Teaneck, New Jersey high school, but she couldn't be on the       varsity team. There was no team for girls, and although she       could beat all the boys, she couldn't be on the team.   So all this was under way. People were lodging complaints they were  either too timid to make before or they were sure they would lose. But  in the 1970s, they could become winners because there was a spirit in  the land, a growing understanding that the way things had been was not  right and should be changed.   They brought those complaints, and Ruthie Ginsburg is one of the  people who helped make those changes. As we all know, Justice Ginsburg  went on to become one of the fiercest advocates for women's rights our  Nation has ever seen.   On the Supreme Court, Justice Ginsburg became famous for her  dissents. She was asked about this, and I think her response is worth  sharing.         [Y]ou can let out all the stops when you're a dissenter. I       would distinguish two kinds of dissent. There's the great       dissent written for a future age--the Brandeis and Holmes       Free Speech dissents around the time of World War I are       exemplary. They are the law of the land today. Another kind       of dissent aims to prompt immediate action from the       legislature. The Lilly Ledbetter case is a recent example. I       should tell Lilly Ledbetter's story because some of you may       not know it.        Lilly Ledbetter worked as an area manager for a Goodyear       Tire Plant. She was hired in the 70s, then the only woman       doing that job, and was initially paid the same as her male       colleagues. Over time, her pay slipped. She might have       suspected it but she didn't know it for sure because       Goodyear, like most employers, didn't give out its wage       records. One day, she found a little slip in her box at the       plant; it listed the salaries of the men employed as area       managers. Compared to Ledbetter's salary, the disparity was       startling, as much as forty percent. In the years of her       employment at Goodyear, she'd done a pretty good job, earning       satisfactory performance ratings, so she thought she had a       winnable case. She filed suit and won in the district court,       gaining a substantial jury verdict. On appeal, Goodyear       argued that Ledbetter sued too late. She should have sued       within the 180 days Title VII says, within 180 days of the       discriminatory incident, so if you count from the very first       time her pay slipped, that would have been back in the 70s.       The Supreme Court agreed that her claim was untimely, which       meant the jury's verdict for damages was overturned.        My dissenting opinion pointed out that a woman in       Ledbetter's position, the only woman doing a job up till then       done only by men, doesn't want to rock the boat. She is       unlikely to complain the first time she suspects something is       awry. She will wait until she has a secure case. My opinion       suggested that if she had sued the first time her paycheck       was lower, had she found out about it, she probably would       have lost because the excuse would have been ``She doesn't do       the job as well as the men.'' But after twenty years, that       argument can't be made with a straight face. By then, she has       a winnable case. The Court's answer, she sued too late. She       argued that every paycheck renewed the discrimination. I       agreed. My dissenting opinion concluded: The ball is now in       Congress's court to amend Title VII to say what I thought       Congress meant all along. Within two years, the Lilly       Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was passed. It was the first piece of       legislation signed by President Obama. The audience to which       my dissent appealed was Congress. Congress picked up the ball       with a little help from many groups that prodded the       legislators to amend Title VII.    This is a reminder that Justice Ginsburg used all of her tools to  make change.   Speaking of dissents, in 2014, Justice Ginsburg was asked about the  worst ruling this current Court had produced. Her unambiguous answer  foreshadows the dangers we face today. This is what she said:         If there was one decision I would overrule, it would be       Citizens United. I think the notion that we have all the       democracy that  [[Page S5775]]       money can buy strays so far from what our democracy is       supposed to be. So that's number one on my list. Number two       would be the part of the health care decision that concerns       the commerce clause. Since 1937, the Court has allowed       Congress a very free hand in enacting social and economic       legislation.        I thought that the attempt of the Court to intrude on       Congress's domain in that area had stopped by the end of the       1930s. Of course health care involves commerce. Perhaps       number three would be Shelby County, involving essentially       the destruction of the Voting Rights Act. That act had a       voluminous legislative history. The bill extending the Voting       Rights Act was passed overwhelmingly by both houses,       Republicans and Democrats, everyone was on board. The Court's       interference with that decision of the political branches       seemed to me to be out of order. The Court should have       respected the legislative judgment. Legislators know much       more about elections than the Court does. And the same was       true of Citizens United. I think members of the legislature,       people who have to run for office, know the connection       between money and influence on what laws get passed.    And one last note, almost a year later, Justice Ginsburg's opinion  hadn't changed. Let me read from a New York Times report about the  remarks she delivered at Duke Law School:         In expansive remarks on Wednesday evening, Justice Ruth       Bader Ginsburg named the ``most disappointing'' Supreme Court       decision in her 22-year tenure, discussed the future of the       death penalty and abortion rights, talked about her love of       opera and even betrayed a passing interest in rap music.        The Court's worst blunder, she said, was its 2010 decision       in Citizens United ``because of what has happened to       elections in the United States and the huge amount of money       it takes to run for office.''        She was in dissent in the 5-4 decision.        The evening was sponsored by Duke University School of Law,       and Justice Ginsburg answered questions from Neil S. Siegel,       a professor there, and from students and alumni.        Echoing a dissent last month, she suggested that she was       prepared to vote to strike down the death penalty, saying       that the capital justice system is riddled with errors,       plagued by bad lawyers, and subject to racial and geographic       disparities.        She added that she despaired over the state of abortion       rights.        ``Reproductive freedom is in a sorry situation in the       United States,'' she said.        ``Poor women don't have choice.''    That was our Ruth Ginsburg, concerned to the very end about how law  affects all of the people it touches.   Ruthie, we will miss you   I yield the floor.
