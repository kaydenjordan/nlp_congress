 Mr. Speaker, I rise for purposes of  expressing my concerns with H.R. 362, H.R. 360, and H.R. 359, in their  current forms.   Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that, without clarification, these bills  risk significantly disrupting how the Federal Government has  collaborated regarding cybersecurity for nearly two decades.   Congress has repeatedly supported the framework that designates the  Department of Homeland Security as the lead for ensuring that Federal  agencies work together and with the private sector to protect and  secure critical infrastructure.   This framework was developed in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist  attacks to guard against repeating the mistakes of a disjointed, siloed  approach to national security and is well-understood and has been well- litigated within this body.   It has been reinforced repeatedly by numerous laws, Presidential  policy directives, and executive orders that have the support of  Democrats and Republicans alike.                                time  1215    The policy is clear: DHS serves as the lead agency responsible for  coordinating Federal efforts to protect critical infrastructure in the  16 diverse sectors.   To carry out this mission, DHS, through the Cybersecurity and  Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, is tasked with coordinating  with other sector-specific agencies.   The Department of Energy is the sector-specific agency for the energy  sector and is well-suited to do so. Its role as the facilitator of  robust cybersecurity within the energy sector is important.   However, the problem common to the three measures today is that, in  their current forms, they risk siloing cybersecurity efforts when it  comes to protecting the energy sector, as none of them acknowledges DHS  as the coordinating partner to DOE for cybersecurity.   As a reminder, this is the same infrastructure that has been under  sustained, sophisticated attack from foreign adversaries, some of which  have been successful.   While cyberattacks against the energy sector have accelerated, the  sector does not exist in a vacuum. Over the past few years, DHS and the  FBI have been sounding the alarm about Russian-led attacks on energy  infrastructure that coincide with and often mirror attacks in other  sectors.   In a 2018 technical alert issued to all infrastructure sectors, DHS  and the FBI described a multistage intrusion campaign by the Kremlin.  The alert explained that Russia used a similar playbook to target U.S.  entities as well as organizations in the energy, nuclear, commercial  facility, water, aviation, and commercial manufacturing sectors.   In the face of these threats, the Cybersecurity Solarium Commission  and others have called for a redoubling of efforts to strengthen DHS'  role.   I would like to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from New  Jersey.   Chairman Pallone, I remain concerned that the cyber bill before us,  as well as the other cybersecurity bills being considered today, do not  provide sufficient direction to the Secretary of Energy to coordinate  his Department's cybersecurity activities with the Department of  Homeland Security.   Is it your intent that the activities authorized by this legislation  be carried out in coordination with the Homeland Security Secretary and  that Department?    I yield to the gentleman from New  Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I am glad to hear that,  without any equivocation, Mr. Pallone fully expects DOE to coordinate  with DHS, but that only addresses one of my concerns.   My other concern is that these bills do not, in any way, shape, or  form, detract from or erode the existing authorities of the Secretary  and Department of Homeland Security, including the authorities set  forth in the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Act of 2018.   I understand that is your position that these bills do not in any way  infringe on DHS' existing authorities or prerogatives. Is that correct?    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from New  Jersey for that information.   To be clear, it is your intention that these measures do not affect  DHS' authority under PPD-21, PPD-41, Executive Order 13691, and  Executive Order 13636?    Would you agree to work with me to  communicate to the Senate and the administration that the intention  behind these measures is to have the Secretary of Energy coordinate  activities with DHS consistent with the existing cybersecurity  framework?    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Pallone for  addressing my questions.   While I still have concerns over these measures, I appreciate his  willingness to put into the Record these statements and look forward to  working with him to clarify expectations going forward.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  New Jersey for his cooperation and clarifying these three pieces of  legislation.
