 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of the  60th anniversary of Ben Taub Hospital.   The Harris County hospital district was created in November 1965 by a  voter referendum. The hospital district remains a leader in indigent  care in my home State of Texas, and the center of the system is the  acute trauma center at Ben Taub Hospital.   The hospital cares for more than 80,000 emergency patients each year  who are in the most critical need. At Ben Taub, world-class doctors  treat everyone regardless of their income, their gender, their  insurance, or their immigration status.   The doctors, nurses, support staff, and administrators are not just  well known and respected locally for their training and patient care  but also internationally.   I am so grateful to have them serving my district and my  constituents. I thank Ben Taub Hospital for 60 years of level one care,  and may they have the best and most successful 60 more years to come.                            ____________________
