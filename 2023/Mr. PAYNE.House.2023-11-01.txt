 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great trailblazer in  my district, Goldie Burbage.   Ms. Burbage made history in East Orange, New Jersey. She was the  first African-American woman to serve as the executive assistant to an  East Orange mayor. She served under Mayor James Kelly and the city's  first African-American mayor, William Hart.   During her time in Mayor Hart's office, Ms. Burbage created the  Offices of Employment and Training, Drug Abuse, and Personnel. Her work  earned her a promotion to become the city's first chief personnel  officer.   Outside of her career, Ms. Burbage was a well-known and respected  social justice advocate. She founded the Historical Society of East  Orange and served as vice president of the East Orange Chamber of  Commerce. Her community support earned her induction into the East  Orange Hall of Fame.   Many residents referred to her as the matriarch of their community,  and I am proud to honor her on this day.                            ____________________
