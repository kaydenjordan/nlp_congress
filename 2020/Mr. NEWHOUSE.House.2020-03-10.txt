 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, Mr. Davis,  for yielding and thank him also for all of his hard work bringing this  resolution to the floor. I also want to thank him for being here in  person himself to help us argue the good points of this resolution and  its bipartisan nature.   Mr. Speaker, for over a year, the bipartisan Select Committee on the  Modernization of Congress has worked together to discuss how Congress,  as an institution, conducts business on behalf of the American people.   From broad subjects, like government transparency and congressional  office payroll, to narrower topics, like formatting legislative  documents, our goal is to bring Congress into the same century as the  constituents whom we serve.   This resolution is a great first step in accomplishing that goal. It  requires our technology offices to streamline the approval process for  new and innovative technologies. It takes steps towards Housewide bulk  purchasing of technology products and services and will save every  Member money out of their MRAs.   Additionally, the resolution examines expanding or eliminating the  cap on the number of employees for Member offices. Many Members,  particularly in rural areas like my district in central Washington,  have multiple district offices, and Members should be able to staff  their offices as they see fit.   Empowering Members to adequately staff both district and D.C. offices  can improve retention, but, more importantly, it can improve  communication with our constituents.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to again thank Chairman Kilmer  and Ranking Member Graves for their leadership and their work in  bringing this resolution to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues, all Members, to  support the adoption of this resolution.
