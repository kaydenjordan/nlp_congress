 Madam Speaker, over the last few weeks, we have  lost two Americans about whom I want to, here, speak.   Earlier this month, we lost a valued member of our southern Indiana  community. Lorilee Ward from Clarksville died of cancer. All of us, her  friends, her family, are devastated by her loss, and the outpouring of  support from fellow Hoosiers shows just how large a legacy Lorilee  leaves behind in her wake created by that strong dedication she always  had to her community and the values she so fervently believed in.   Lorilee's warmth and enthusiasm was a staple of our Clark County  community. Lorilee served on the board of southern Indiana's Clark- Floyd Counties Convention Tourism Bureau, a group dedicated to  bettering our neighbors. She furiously believed in the prosperity  and future of our towns all the way across southern Indiana, and she  gave liberally of her time and of her energy to make sure that we are  all the best we can be.    For Lorilee, the future of our communities of Indiana and of our  country rests in preserving and promoting our conservative values in  principles like the value of all life; supporting our troops and  veterans, which she did so passionately through her involvement in  Wreaths Across America; economic opportunity and job creation; and  putting America and Americans first.   Lorilee always fought to make sure our voices and values were heard.  She served adamantly as the president of the Clark County Republican  Women, a reliable and relentless volunteer for her President, and a  member of our Indiana GOP. She did it all on behalf of others, knowing  that she was fighting for bettering the lives of future generations.   Southern Indiana will not be the same, both because of her work and  because of our loss.   Lorilee's mighty spirit shown through in all she did. Lorilee has  always been a fighter. At the age of 18, Lorilee was diagnosed with  stage 4 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and she was told by her doctors that  the end was near, that she should expect the worst. But Lorilee did not  expect the worst. She fought for the best. She fought for her future  and lived another 37 years.   Despite the challenges she faced, Lorilee had a smile on her face  every day and went through life with a positive energy that inspired  everyone around her. Lorilee was truly a force of nature, and her death  is a great loss.   It was once said that success in old age is having a crowded table,  knowing that your friends, your family want to gather with you on  special occasions  [[Page H742]]  and spend time with you. This was especially true for Lorilee.   Lorilee, survived by her incredible family, was loved dearly by them.  Lorilee put her family above everything else, and I know her husband of  25 years, Donald; her two daughters, Chantelle and Darci; her father;  her siblings; and her 14 grandchildren will miss her dearly. That, to  me, sounds like a crowded table. That, to me, sounds like a great  legacy.   Madam Speaker, may Lorilee rest in peace.                  Honoring the Life of Thomas Lavell Secrest     Madam Speaker, Thomas Lavell Secrest passed away  this week after a life full of service to his country.   Tom was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, and attended the U.S. Military  Academy at West Point from 1966 to 1970. After graduation, Tom served  in Germany and Fort Knox, achieving the rank of captain, as a tanker.  Tom is remembered by his West Point classmates as a smart and kind guy.   After his service in the Army, Tom returned to Texas to attend law  school at the University of Texas and then went on to a very successful  legal career in New York City. Over his career, Tom represented  Polaroid, AT&T, Lucent, and Hunter Douglas in defending their  intellectual property. Tom's demand for uncompromised performance was  evident in every pursuit of his life: academic, military, professional,  and personal.   Tom spent the last few years of his life in South Carolina with his  beloved wife, Liz, where they enjoyed their mutual passion for golf.  Throughout their marriage, they also ensured that their friends, their  family could participate in their love for golf, including Golf  Magazine's editor-in-chief, George Peper.   In 2002, George highlighted his friend Tom's spirit both on and off  the golf course in an article that tells you exactly who he was: an  ardent believer in hard work, a fiercely loyal friend, husband, and  father. He was someone who never missed an opportunity to hit the  links. And while always staying humble, Tom's golf game was legendary.   A golfer once said that many golfers argue very frequently, very  vigorously about where they played or which course was the best; but,  at the end of their lives, what they will remember is with whom they  played. Tom truly embodied this by always remembering it was with whom  you played that mattered most. He played with his favorite friends, his  family.   He is survived by his wife, his son, his daughter-in-law, his  brothers, his nieces, his nephews, and his grandchildren. I know each  of them will miss him dearly but will carry on the legacy of  earnestness and humor that he instilled in each of them.   Tom is someone whom those around him could always rely on, but he was  taken from us far too son. Our country and his family are better off  because of his life, because of his service, and because of his spirit.   Madam Speaker, may Tom rest in peace.
