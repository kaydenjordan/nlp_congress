 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in support of H.R. 115, the  Thin Blue Line Act, which will act as a deterrent against criminals who  seek to harm first responders. Increasing the Federal penalties that  can be imposed against those who would kill or attempt to kill  policemen, firemen, or first responders is a just response to such  heinous crimes.   This week is National Police Week, and I am reminded of the words  etched on the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, D.C.,  which states: ``The wicked flee when no man pursueth, but the righteous  are bold as a lion.'' This is from the Book of Proverbs.   It takes a special kind of person to willingly run toward danger and  to shield the innocent from the wicked. That is what our law  enforcement and first responders do every day.   I am very grateful for the men and women who serve and protect our  communities; and I was honored to be present for Police Week in a small  town in our district, Green Cove Springs, in Clay County, Florida,  where they had the Police Memorial; and on that was a verse from John  15:13: ``Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for  one's friends.''    I hope that God watches over our first responders and keeps them safe  to bring them home to their families.
