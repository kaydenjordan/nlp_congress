 Mr. Speaker, this is National Forest Week across this  country. I encourage everybody to partake and enjoy your national  forests. Our Nation indeed was blessed by God with some truly inspiring  natural beauty. It is our job to preserve it and utilize it for future  generations.   Unfortunately, many of our national forests are under threat not from  the usual climate change nonsense but actually wildfire caused by  overcrowded forests, too many trees.   We haven't been tending to the forests for 50 years. The Federal  Government has refused to properly thin and manage our forests, largely  because of the lack of funding or, in a lot of cases, frivolous  lawsuits--preventing the work that needs to be done--by extreme  environmental groups.   They are now overgrown, overcrowded tinderboxes. All it takes is one  lightning strike, a cigarette butt, or a spark from a flat tire going  down a rural highway. Once they catch fire, they become infernos, such  as the million-acre fire I had in my district a couple years ago called  the Dixie fire.   A healthy forest has about 40 to 70 adult trees per acre. We have a  situation where we have 500 or more trees per acre, a recipe for  disaster. We need to do better and manage our forests.                            ____________________
