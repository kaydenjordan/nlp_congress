 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore (Ms. SINEMA). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar     Madam President, I rise to seek consent to advance the  nomination of a Virginian and friend, Leopoldo Martinez, to be  Executive Director of the Inter-American Development Bank. The IDB is  the largest source of development financing for Latin America and the  Caribbean. It is a critical part of the ability of the United States to  engage diplomatically with our American partners to counter a growing  influence of Russia and China and Iran and other nations in the  Americas. And it is very much in the national interest of the United  States  [[Page S4842]]  to build up economic prosperity of countries in the Western Hemisphere.   We have seen over and over that when countries have troubled  economies, it is not a distant or faraway problem. It drives government  corruption; it drives organized crime; it drives drug abuse and drug  trafficking. And then it expands migration that could start as a  country's problems but very quickly become our country's problems as  well. When we don't step up, we see that other nations--China and  Russia, in particular--in the Americas fill the vacuum.   As Latin America and the Caribbean countries continue to face  challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic--where the region has had the  highest global per capita infection and death rates in the world and is  experiencing the largest economic contraction of any region in the  world--the IDB has a key role to play in improving economic outcomes  for the region.   But the problem is the IDB is without an executive director. It is  without leadership confirmed by the Senate at this critical moment in  time.   Leopoldo Martinez brings decades of experience in the public and  private sectors, as well as academia. He has extensive experience  advising Fortune 500 companies, private equity funds, international  businesses, and nongovernmental organizations. He is the CEO for the  Center for Democracy and Development of the Americas, as well as a  commissioner for small business in the Commonwealth of Virginia. He is  on the board of one of our public universities, the University of Mary  Washington.   And as I have said, he is not just a constituent; he is also a  friend. And in all respect, he is outstandingly qualified for this  position.   Now, I understand that there are differences of opinion in the Senate  about the success, or lack thereof, about the Biden administration's  policies in Latin America. Earlier this week or late last week, some of  my Republicans challenged the Biden administration as being too soft on  corruption issues in the Americas.   I was asked about my Republican colleagues' critiques, and I would  say: Well, I got a critique, too. I wouldn't say they are too soft, but  I would say they are too inattentive. I don't think we have, under this  administration or the previous administration or the previous  administration--going back nearly to the beginning of this country, I  don't think we paid the attention to the Americas that we should.   And when we only pay episodic attention to the Americas, a lot of bad  things happen in Western Hemisphere countries that end up making things  worse for us. But if there is a critique to be laid against the Biden  administration, or any administration in the Americas, we don't solve  the critique by leaving key positions vacant that could be used to  strengthen our activities in the hemisphere.   I understand that some of my colleagues have objected--and this was  raised in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--to some, frankly,  partisan tweets--some annoying and nasty tweets--that my friend Leo  Martinez put on his social media accounts.   I want to say to pages: You might want to think about this now  because in 10 or 30 years when you are running for the Senate or you  are up for a position that is a Senate-confirmed position, anything you  tweet is going to be held against you.   But I do think they have to be put into context. My friend Mr.  Martinez is a Democrat. And no surprise, he is being nominated by a  Democratic administration. He has let his tongue race ahead of his  brain on a couple of occasions. But I think all 100 of us have seen  this pretty often in the last 10 years, and we have learned to apply a  little bit of a discounting to it.   I have voted for many Trump administration nominees who had some  negative tweets and even said negative things about me. I didn't like  them and I wouldn't have nominated them, but I would acknowledge that  they are qualified for the job. And I believe that Mr. Martinez is more  than that.   Finally, I want to speak, in particular, to my colleague from Texas,  who is here. My colleague from Texas serves with me on the Foreign  Relations Committee. I believe I am going to be accurate about this,  but I will be corrected if I get any details wrong. He asked Mr.  Martinez in some written questions about working together with faith- based organizations in his role in the IDB should he be confirmed  because throughout the region and throughout the world, sometimes  faith-based organizations are some of the most effective in, for  example, providing humanitarian aid, working with refugees, et cetera.   The initial responses from Mr. Martinez, I believe, were not  satisfactory to my colleague, and maybe other colleagues as well, but I  do believe that Mr. Martinez has tried to amplify those and meet and  discuss this issue.   I worked as a missionary in Honduras. I know very powerfully the role  that religious organizations do in the region. I know how important it  is for us, whether it is USAID or State Department or IDP, to work in  tandem with some of these faith-based organizations who do such a  powerful job. And everything I know about my friend Mr. Martinez  suggests that he would see the value of those partnerships as well.    So with that, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the Committee on Senate Foreign Relations be  discharged and the Senate proceed to the following nomination: PN1028,  Leopoldo Martinez Nucete, to be Executive Director of the Inter- American Development Bank; that the Senate vote on the nomination, with  no intervening action or debate; that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table; and that no further motions be  in order as to this nomination.    Madam President, just a brief response. I will not respond  to Senator Cruz's representation of Mr. Martinez's testimony before the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has his opinion about what those  words mean, and I think he quoted them accurately. But I would just say  for anyone, you can go and look at that quote and decide for yourself  whether you think that was a statement that was hostile to faith or  whether that was a statement by a bank or business guy financier about  what he thought were the most important issues that an international  development bank should be focused on.   I read those same comments as not hostile or antipathetic to faith; I  view them as comments of an individual who has been in the finance  industry who knows what the remit of the international development bank  is and is talking about his own priorities in terms of how that bank  should program their work.   But I do want to respond to the first point. Senator Cruz is correct  about Mr. Martinez's past. He grew up in Venezuela. He was initially in  a government that apparently had a lot of promise to offer to  Venezuelans because Mr. Chavez was elected by Venezuelans in a  democratic election overwhelmingly. But my colleague didn't tell you  the rest of the story.   Mr. Martinez is now a political exile from Venezuela who was part of  the Venezuelan opposition, who has been strong in critiquing the human  rights' record of both the Chavez and Maduro regimes, and I think that  is actually one of the reasons that President Biden nominated him for  this position. If anyone knows the danger of authoritarian governments,  including authoritarian governments from the left in the Americas, and  knows what it will take for America to counter that with smart  strategies, it is somebody who grew up in that culture and came to  realize the dangerous path that his country was on.   I think whoever is the IDB President is going to have an awful lot of  work to do, but the single largest challenge in the Americas right now,  at least in terms of pushing refugees out of the country, is in  Venezuela. And who better than someone who knows it firsthand and,  after seeing it, decided to become a dedicated member of the Venezuelan  opposition in exile in the United States--who better to counter that  influence?   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
