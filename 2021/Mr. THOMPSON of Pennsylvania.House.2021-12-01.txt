 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate the Redbank Valley Trails Association for winning the 2021  Thomas Petri Recreational Trails Program Achievement Award. This award  recognizes top-notch projects that use recreational trails program  funds to improve local trails.   In 2018, the Redbank Valley Trails Association and Allegheny Valley  Land Trust completed the Climax Tunnel Rehabilitation project. Because  the Redbank Valley Trail is a former rail corridor, much of the trail  consists of old bridges and stone archways. To keep the trail  functional and safe, restoring the tunnels, bridges, and arches are  necessary.   Located in western Pennsylvania, the Redbank Valley Trail is a 51- mile non-motorized trail maintained mainly by volunteers.   Madam Speaker, after spending 30 years in the healthcare field before  coming to Congress, I understand the importance of physical activity to  maintain a healthy lifestyle. The Redbank Valley Trail is a great  option for residents and visitors alike to explore the great outdoors.   Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the Allegheny Land Trust for their  dedication to keeping the Redbank Valley Trail healthy and accessible  for years to come.                            ____________________
