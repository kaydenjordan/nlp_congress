 Madam Speaker, on July 2, the President of the United  States sent out this message to small business owners across America:  ``My message to the companies running gas stations and setting prices  at the pump is simple: This is a time of war and global peril. Bring  down the price you are charging at the pump to reflect the cost you are  paying for the product, and do it now.''   When I first read this message, I was perplexed. After all, the  President should know that gas stations already offer their fuel at a  price just slightly above what they buy from wholesalers. There is  basically no room for cost savings at this final step in the supply  chain. In fact, most gas stations make their money on what is sold in  the convenience store and not at the gas pump.   This ill-advised message does nothing to help solve the problem but  only confuses and angers the small business owners who own gas stations  and convenience stores. Even billionaire Jeff Bezos called out the  White House, saying: ``Inflation is far too important a problem for the  White House to keep making statements like this. It is either straight- ahead misdirection or a deep misunderstanding of basic market  dynamics.''   I agree with Mr. Bezos. This is far too important of an issue for the  White House to keep misleading the American people. Apparently,  President Biden missed the lesson on economics the day they studied it  in class, or maybe he has just forgotten what he learned.   The bottom line is that the President needs to take this issue more  seriously and stop pointing the blame at others. First, it was Russia;  then, it was the oil companies; and now, it is the gas station owners.  It is only a matter of time until the President finds a way to blame  this on Republicans or perhaps former President Trump.   Ultimately, the buck stops at the White House, and the President must  take responsibility for his anti-energy policies that have made it more  and more difficult to explore and drill for oil right here under our  feet in the United States.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, this weekend, President Biden took a trip to  Saudi Arabia with the purpose of asking Crown Prince Mohammed bin  Salman to increase oil output. News reports are saying the President  might have come home empty-handed after the Crown Prince informed the  President that Saudi Arabia is already close to reaching maximum  output.   I don't understand why the President would go through all this hassle  when we have what it takes to increase oil output, lower prices, and  reemerge as the energy-independent country we were under President  Trump, right here at home. The President could have saved time and  taxpayer dollars by taking a trip to Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.   Unfortunately, as long as the Biden administration continues to  implement more regulations and restrictions on investments in the oil  and gas industry, we will continue to be at the mercy of foreign  countries and their dictators.                            ____________________
