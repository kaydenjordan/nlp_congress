 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to amendment No.  69, sponsored by Representative Cohen from Tennessee, which is included  in this en bloc.   While I appreciate the gentleman's concerns for our Nation's wild  horse and burros, and I don't doubt that at all, the amendment is  misguided and will actually end up hurting these animals more than it  helps.   I have been working on this issue for more than 6 years. There is  nothing more important to the rural part of my district than is this,  yet none of the sponsors of this amendment came to me to talk about  this amendment. If they had come, I could have saved them some time.   The amendment seeks to push the PZP contraceptive. The only problem  with that is it doesn't work. Instead, we should allow research  scientists and the BLM to do their jobs in determining the best way to  manage these herds.   Tying their hands by earmarking 50 percent of the increase on PZP  birth control doesn't allow them to follow the best science to maintain  healthy herds and healthy ranges. If you care about these animals and  if you don't want to see them starve to death, then, please, work with  us, and let's defeat this amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to conclude, if I have a few more seconds. We  have a diverse and bipartisan group that has been working on this, as I  have, for many years.
