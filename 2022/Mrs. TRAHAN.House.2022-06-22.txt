 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of two pieces of  bipartisan legislation the House will consider later today. I  introduced these bills alongside Republican colleagues because there is  simply no question that they will save lives and protect our children.   The first piece of legislation is critical in the fight against the  opioid crisis plaguing every single community across our country. Known  as the MATE Act, this legislation is simple. It will require that  doctors who prescribe highly addictive pain medications are trained to  spot signs of addiction and intervene accordingly.   Healthcare professionals often interact with and have opportunities  to provide effective treatments for individuals suffering from  addiction, critical opportunities to save lives. But far too often,  those chances to help are missed. In fact, research has shown that most  clinicians could not confidently diagnose and treat patients with  substance use disorder.   Stigma, discrimination, and lack of understanding about addiction  have prevented far too many Americans from accessing evidence-based  care for addiction. The MATE Act will change that.   I drafted this legislation after meeting with a physician in my home  State of Massachusetts, Dr. Jim Baker, who shared the tragic story of  his son, Max.   Dr. Baker was visiting his primary care physician one day when his  PCP asked him if there was anything he could do to help. Dr. Baker  pleaded with his PCP for help with Max's opioid addiction.   To Dr. Baker's surprise, his PCP did not have adequate education or  understanding of addiction to point Dr. Baker in the direction of  appropriate treatment for Max. Max Baker died from an overdose at just  23 years old.   Every person in this Chamber knows that the Bakers' story, a parent's  worst nightmare, is not unique. Each of us has heard similar stories  from families who were willing to do anything and everything to save  the life of a loved one battling addiction. We can get these families  another path for help by passing the MATE Act.   I am grateful to Dr. Baker for his advocacy for this legislation, as  well as my colleagues, Representatives Trone, Carter, Kuster, and  McKinley, who were instrumental in securing today's vote.   Madam Speaker, the second piece of legislation is just as essential.  My bipartisan bill, with Ranking Member McMorris Rodgers, Congresswoman  Axne, and Congresswoman Kim, doesn't need a fancy name. It just needs  to become law. That is because it will extend and strengthen key youth  and young adult suicide prevention efforts.   Many of us have talked about the youth mental health crisis  extensively, and the past 2 years have only increased the urgent need  for solutions that protect our children.   That starts by reauthorizing the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act and  the key programs it supports to provide mental health resources,  bolster suicide prevention efforts, and end the stigma associated with  getting help.   Make no mistake, these programs have a long track record of success.  Study after study has proven that these initiatives have significantly  reduced youth suicide rates for young people and saved tens of  thousands of lives.   We must ensure that these programs continue, and I urge my colleagues  to support this legislative package so we can do just that.                  ibew 1505 celebrates 50 years at raytheon     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the hardworking men  and women of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local  1505 for their 75 years working at Raytheon in Massachusetts.   The members of IBEW 1505 are some of the most skilled in the  manufacturing industry in the entire world. They are unsung American  heroes, rarely receiving publicity or recognition for their devoted  service and ingenuity but continuing to provide well-made defense  systems to American Armed Forces.   The Patriot missile is built by the members of IBEW 1505, along with  [[Page H5738]]  other advanced defense systems. These systems are active around the  world, including right now in Poland, where they are helping to protect  our NATO allies.   IBEW 1505 has provided many generations of families in Massachusetts  with family-sustaining wages and benefits.   I am proud to call so many members of IBEW 1505 my constituents and  to bring recognition of their 75 years of service to our country here  on the House floor of the United States Congress.                            ____________________
