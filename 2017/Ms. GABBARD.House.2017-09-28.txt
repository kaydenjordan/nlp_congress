 Mr. Speaker, Josue Fuentes was brought to Hawaii from El  Salvador when he was 13 years old, where he was escaping rampant gang  violence and domestic abuse at home.   He went to high school in Honolulu, made friends, got a job. But no  matter what he did, he couldn't escape the dark shadow cast on his  future because of his immigration status.   Josue describes DACA as a weight lifted from his back. He was  empowered to apply for college. He bought a home and pursued  opportunities that any of us would want for our children.   Today, he is a small business owner. He owns a landscaping company,  he volunteers at his local church, and continues to give back to the  Kaneohe community that he calls home.   I urge my colleagues to sign a discharge petition to bring the Dream  Act to the floor for a vote so we can pass a permanent solution for  Josue and millions of DREAMers across the country. Our Nation made a  promise to these young men and women. We must uphold that promise.                            ____________________
