 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, our Nation stands at a crucial midway  point in our battle against this terrible virus. The heroism of  healthcare professionals, essential workers, and families from coast to  coast got our Nation through a springtime like no other. Communities  across America put normal life on pause to buy breathing room for our  medical system. We essentially had to winterize the world's largest  economy for weeks on end and spare our people as much of the resulting  pain as possible. The task was historic, and so was the Senate's  response. We wrote and passed the CARES Act--the largest rescue package  in American history. Our legislation helped pull both our health system  and our economy back from the brink. Tens of millions of jobs were  saved. The hallways of our hospitals did not become Italy. The Senate's  leadership helped the Nation endure the first phase of this, but this  crisis is far from over.   The virus that has claimed 140,000 American lives has not gone  anywhere. As some places step back toward normalcy, infections are  climbing again in hotspots across our country. The start of our  economic recovery has been sharp and impressive, but in absolute terms,  we still have just begun to pick up the pieces. Our progress so far has  been encouraging, but it remains fragile and far from sufficient. I  would argue that our country's job now is even more complex than it was  back in March.   Now, as then, we need to keep our health system robust, but now,  instead of locking down the country to do it, we want to stand up a  society that functions somewhat more normally at the same time.  [[Page S4310]]    The American people cannot completely stop building their lives until  the vaccine is available. The United States of America was not built  for a defensive crouch. We need to stand up an educational system and  an economy that works for workers and families in the meantime. We need  to find the right sort of middle ground--middle ground that is smart  and safe but also more sustainable. It is another historic set of  challenges and another opportunity for the U.S. Senate to deliver.   For weeks now, I have made it clear that further legislation out of  the Senate will be a serious response to the crisis. We will not be  wasting the American people's time like the House Democrats, with their  multimillion-dollar proposal for high taxes on small businesses, cut  taxes for blue-State millionaires, and send diversity detectives into  the cannabis industry.   I have said we will start with the facts and develop real, targeted  solutions on the subjects that matter most to American families. It  turns out that means three things: kids, jobs, and healthcare--kids,  jobs, and healthcare.   Surveys show the American people's top priorities for reopening are  childcare and K-12 schools. This country wants its kids back in the  classroom this fall--learning, exploring, making friends. Their  educations depend on it. In some cases, their safety depends on it, and  so do the livelihoods of working parents.   The American Academy of Pediatrics stated unambiguously that our goal  must be in-person--in-person instruction. But of course, parents,  teachers, and doctors all agree it has to be as safe as possible. That  is where the Senate comes in.   This majority is preparing legislation that will send $105 billion so  educators have the resources they need to safely reopen. That is more  money than the House Democrats set aside for a similar fund, by the  way, and that is in addition to support for childcare needs. It is  amazing how you can find room to fund serious priorities when you take  a pass on the far-left daydreams.   Second, the economic slowdown has hurt millions and millions of  Americans. Before this crisis, we had never had 7 million Americans  receiving unemployment at the same time. Today, we have 17 million.  More than a million people have filed new unemployment claims every  single week for more than 4 months now.   The American job market needs another shot of adrenaline. Senate  Republicans are laser-focused on getting American workers their jobs  back. Our bill takes several specific incentives to hire and retain  workers and turn the dials on those policies way up. The legislation  will help reimburse for safe workplaces so Main Street can afford the  PPE, testing, cleaning, or remodeling to protect workers and entice  customers.   The ingenuity and spirit of America's small business isn't possible  to overstate, but they still face a tough road. With the majority of  businesses expected to exhaust their initial Paychecks Protection  Funding this summer, we will also be proposing a targeted second round  of the PPP with a special eye toward hard-hit businesses.   Speaking of building on what worked in the CARES Act, we want another  round of direct payments--direct payments to help American families  keep driving our national comeback. Helping to create more Americans  jobs is an urgent, moral priority, and these are just some of the  policies we are discussing that will help that happen.   In addition to kids and jobs, our third major focus is healthcare.  The reason is obvious. The reason is obvious. If we lose control of the  virus or if research stalls, then everything else will be window  dressing.    Our proposal will dedicate even more resources to the fastest race  for a new vaccine in human history, along with diagnostics and  treatments. Our bill will also protect seniors from a potential spike  in premiums. And the Federal Government will continue to support  hospitals, providers, and testing.   These are just some of the elements that Senate Republicans are  discussing among ourselves and with the administration. There is one  more central proposal that ties kids, jobs, and healthcare all  together.   As I have said for months, the next recovery package will include  strong legal protections for the healthcare workers who save strangers'  lives and the schools, colleges, charities, and businesses that want to  reopen. The American people will not see their historic recovery  gobbled up by trial lawyers who are itching to follow this pandemic  with a second epidemic of frivolous lawsuits.   Gross negligence will still be actionable, but we are creating a safe  harbor for institutions that make good-faith efforts to follow the  guidelines available to them. Doctors and nurses clearly deserve this  protection, and school districts, universities, nonprofits, and small  businesses will need it, as well, if we want any genuine reopening at  all.   The legislation that I have begun to sketch out is neither another  CARES Act to float the entire economy nor a typical stimulus bill for a  nation that is ready to get back to normal. Our country is in a complex  middle ground between those two things. We can't go back to April, and  we can't snap our fingers and finish the vaccine overnight. We need to  carve out a new normal.   Senate Republicans are continuing to discuss these and other ideas  among our conference and with the administration. The majority will be  laying down another historic proposal very soon. Here in the Senate, an  outcome will require bipartisan discussions.   I do not believe there will be anything in our bill that our  Democratic colleagues should not happily support, but we will stand  ready and eager to work together and produce a bipartisan outcome.   As I said yesterday, in March the Senate gave a historic master class  in how to pass major bipartisan legislation. The CARES Act, the largest  rescue package ever, was drafted by Republicans, promptly negotiated  across the aisle with Democrats, and then passed urgently without a  single dissenting vote.   Last month, in June, we recorded a master class in how not to make a  law. Instead of amending Senator Tim Scott's JUSTICE Act, our  Democratic colleagues flat-out blocked him. They filibustered the issue  of police reform altogether. Well, for the sake of America's kids,  jobs, and healthcare, let's hope our Democratic friends bring their  bipartisan urgency and good faith to the process and leave the partisan  poses behind.   The Senate has led every step of this crisis. We need to rise to the  task one more time.                            ____________________     Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 643.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    I yield the floor.
