 Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau's recently finalized rule to limit the use of  predispute, forced arbitration clauses in contracts for financial  services and products. I strongly oppose the Congressional Review Act  resolution to dismantle this vital consumer protection.   Forced arbitration clauses force individuals to sign away their right  to go to court as a condition of buying a product or a service, and  they allow corporate America to take advantage of a shadow justice  system that is inherently biased toward the corporation and offers no  meaningful appeals process. To put it bluntly, these clauses serve one  purpose and one purpose alone, to help make sure the giant corporations  still come out on top if they have wronged consumers.   Thankfully, we started to make some progress in addressing forced  arbitration. Five years ago, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  began an intensive study of forced arbitration clauses in consumer  financial services contracts for things like credit cards, savings  accounts, and private student loans. The study confirmed that forced  arbitration stacks the deck against consumers and in favor of powerful  corporations. Of the 341 reviewed cases of forced arbitration in which  consumers made claims against financial institutions, the CFPB found  that consumers obtained relief in just 32 disputes. That is 32 out of  341--9 percent of the time.   By contrast, of the 244 cases of forced arbitration in which  companies made claims against their customers, the companies obtained  relief in 227 of them or 93 percent of the time. For the consumers who  did obtain relief, the CFPB found they won far less than they had  claimed, while the companies that obtained relief recovered nearly the  entirety of their claim.   The study also demonstrated how giant financial institutions have  learned to pair forced arbitration clauses with class action bans to  shutter the courtroom doors on groups of individuals with small claims.  Once blocked from going to court as a class, most people drop their  claims entirely because they lack the financial means or will to fight  a corporation in arbitration as an individual, where outcomes are  seemingly predetermined in favor of the corporation.   Although millions of financial consumers are covered by forced  arbitration clauses and class action waivers, the CFPB found, on  average, that only 25 consumers with claims of less than $1,000 pursue  arbitration annually. Think about it. That is just license for  corporations to rip you off $20, $30 at a time. It is license.   Finally, forced arbitration is shrouded in secrecy, which  shortchanges current and prospective customers of information that may  affect their financial decisions. Between confidentiality requirements  contained in many forced  [[Page S6752]]  arbitration agreements and the secretive nature of the arbitration  proceeding itself, financial institutions use force arbitration  agreements to shield themselves from accountability to the courts and  to the public eye.   Let's take the Wells Fargo scandal. Just last year, the public was  shocked to learn that over the course of 5 years, Wells Fargo employees  had been incentivized to open millions of sham accounts in the names of  Wells Fargo customers, including over 31,000 in my State of Minnesota.  Then the bank charged the customers for those accounts without their  permission. One reason this fraudulent practice was able to continue  for so many years is because Wells Fargo's customer account agreement  included and continues to include, yes, a forced arbitration clause.   When customers discovered and attempted to sue Wells Fargo for the  sham accounts, the company forced them into arbitration, having  successfully argued that any dispute arising from the sham account was  covered by the arbitration clause in the agreement for the real  account.   Let me say that again. Wells Fargo successfully argued that any  dispute arising from the sham account was covered by the arbitration  clause in the agreement for the real account. That is what we are  voting on here.   If these claims--some of which date back to 2013--had been able to  proceed to court rather than in private, forced arbitration, other  Wells Fargo customers would have been alerted to the wrongdoing and may  have been able to save themselves and thousands of others from being  ripped off and prevented damage to their credit. That really matters to  people. A bad credit score can mean the difference between getting a  mortgage and not getting a mortgage, getting a car loan or not, or even  getting a job or not   Fortunately, a few months ago, the CFPB issued a rule to ban  financial institutions from preventing their customers from banding  together to seek justice in a public court of law. This is good news  for consumers who have been scammed by payday lenders, debt relief  companies, or big banks like Wells Fargo; it is good news for our  servicemembers and veterans who wish to vindicate their rights under  the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act; and it is good news for small  businesses, community banks, and credit unions that have been forced to  compete with powerful corporations that are pocketing billions in  stolen money from consumers.    Let's be very clear about what the rule doesn't do because I think  there has been some misinformation put out there. The rule is not about  banning arbitration altogether, and the rule does not prevent a  consumer from pursuing arbitration if he or she wants to, assuming the  corporation also wants to go to arbitration. Instead, the rule simply  takes the ``forced'' out of ``forced arbitration'' and gives the  consumers a real choice again to pursue a claim of wrongdoing in  arbitration or band together with similarly harmed consumers to seek  justice in a public court of law.   Now the big banks and financial institutions--including Equifax, the  massive credit bureau that put 143 million Americans' private  information at risk--are trying to kill the rule, and they are far too  close to getting their way.   As long as I have been in the Senate, I have been fighting to end  forced arbitration. I have always said my efforts are about reopening  the courtroom doors because they should never have been closed in the  first place.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see the CFPB's  rule for exactly what it is, a commonsense way to restore transparency  and accountability in our Nation's financial system and to level the  field between Wall Street and consumers. We must allow the CFPB to move  forward in implementing this critical consumer protection.   I ask you to please join me in showing strong support for the CFPB's  rule, knowing what is in the rule, knowing what this is about, and then  opposing the special interests that are attempting to take this rule  away.   Thank you.   I yield the floor to the Senator from Connecticut.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.    Mr. President, I rise today to remember and celebrate  the life of my friend, Senator Paul Wellstone.   Paul led a lot of fights in the Senate on behalf of working families  and those without a voice. He didn't back down even when a fight seemed  unwinnable. He told voters exactly what he believed even when it wasn't  popular. It was by taking such positions that Minnesotans, whether they  agreed with him or not, always knew where he stood.   In the final days of the 2002 campaign, he told Minnesotans:         I don't represent the big oil companies, I don't represent       the big pharmaceutical companies . . . they already have       great representation in Washington. It's the rest of the       people that need it. I represent the people of Minnesota.    But Paul also knew full well that standing up to powerful interests  could have steep political costs. His career in the Senate was  bookended by votes on going to war in Iraq. Both of his votes were  unpopular, but Paul stood on principle, not on politics. His maiden  speech, the first speech he gave as a Senator, was in opposition to the  first Gulf war, and one of the last Senate votes he cast was against  the second war in Iraq.   He was facing a tough reelection challenge at the time of his vote,  and he knew it might cost him his seat, and he told friends so. But to  have voted otherwise, he said, would have violated the principles that  guided his career. So he voted his conscience and put political  considerations aside, just as he did throughout his time in public  office.   Then, just 11 days before election day, his plane went down, taking  not only Paul and Sheila, his wife, but their daughter Marcia, campaign  staffers Tom Lapic, Mary McEvoy, and Will McLaughlin, as well as pilots  Richard Conry and Michael Guess.   Since coming to the Senate, I have learned how well regarded Paul was  around the Capitol, not only by Senators from both sides of the aisle  but also by Capitol police officers, whom he knew by name, and the  elevator operators, for whom he always made time.   Paul's legislative work continues to make a profound difference in  the lives of millions of Americans. Among his accomplishments are his  pioneering efforts, along with Republican Senator Pete Domenici of New  Mexico, on mental health parity, which ensures that copays and  deductibles for addiction and mental health services are on par with  payments for other medical services. The law was jointly named for Paul  and Senator Domenici, and it passed in late 2008, 6 years after Paul's  death.   After I was seated in 2009, one of the first things I did was to work  with Paul's son David on getting the final rules written to implement  Wellstone-Domenici. That work inspired me to later push for investments  in school mental health services, to help students and their families  who need those services.   Paul also led the David-and-Goliath effort to stop bankruptcy  legislation that favored big banks and credit card companies over  working families. Despite going up against a wide range of special  interests with huge lobbying power and lots of money, he successfully  held off passage of the bill during his lifetime.   He also took on special interests when he stood against oil drilling  in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He believed, like I do, that  the long-term consequences of endangering the home of indigenous people  and a pristine habitat for wildlife far outweighed ``a short-term  speculative supply of oil that will not . . . help consumers.'' Because  of Paul and others in the Senate, the Wildlife Refuge, at least for  now, remains pristine.   Paul also had an amazing and special relationship with Sheila, who  became an important partner in his Senate work. She became a leading  advocate for survivors of domestic violence, spending years raising  awareness about the issue and the need to address its causes. Former  Senator and Vice President Joe Biden said Sheila deserves as much  credit as any lawmaker for passage of the landmark Violence Against  Women Act. Since the law's enactment, incidents of domestic violence  have been reduced significantly. It was a landmark achievement.   My constituents remember Paul fondly. They leave notes and mementos  for him at the quiet memorial site honoring him just off of Highway 53,  near Eveleth, MN. They leave them for his wife Sheila, too, and for the  others who died with them exactly 15 years ago tomorrow, when their  plane tragically crashed just miles from the Eveleth-Virginia Municipal  Airport.   I have been to the memorial site, and I have seen how deeply and  personally Paul touched people in Minnesota and across the country. He  inspired them not only as a U.S. Senator for 12 years but also as a  Carleton College professor who encouraged a generation of students to  take action in their communities. He did so as a fiery organizer who  stood up for Minnesota farmers and for working families and insisted on  giving them a voice and a seat at the table. He never lost the  tenacious spirit that led him to be a collegiate wrestling champion--he  is in the college wrestling hall of fame--and he brought that same  approach to standing up for Minnesotans. He stood strong against  injustice, even when it  [[Page S6775]]  twice meant being arrested. It wasn't because he wanted to break the  law, but because he thought it was necessary to bring about change for  the better.   He also had a special way of connecting with people. Former Senator  Tom Harkin said at a memorial service for Paul that he ``made a miner  up in the Iron Range know he was as important . . . as the president of  the United States.'' That is how Paul voted in the Senate, too, putting  ordinary Minnesotans ahead of politics, money, and influence.   The last time I saw Paul was at a 2002 campaign event in St. Paul,  just weeks before he died. He was locked in a bitter struggle for  reelection. Despite being in a grueling fight for his political life,  the first thing he said to me was, ``How's your mom?'' That was Paul.   I had just come from my mom's nursing home in Minneapolis, where she  had a picture of Paul on her wall that said: ``Phoebe, keep fighting.''  She wasn't doing very well. I told Paul that she had dementia--some  sporadic dementia--and that day I couldn't have a conversation with  her. He put his hand on my shoulder and said: ``Touch means so much.  Touch means so much.''   The next day, I went to the nursing home, and I took my mom out into  the garden, in a wheelchair. She was having a bad day again, but I put  my arm around her as we sat. It was a beautiful day. I don't know if it  meant anything to her, but it sure meant everything to me.   Paul's life and his work meant a lot to me too. His examples as a  tireless, passionate champion for working families, for veterans, for  farmers, and for those who simply needed a voice have inspired my own  time in the Senate. I keep Paul's picture and his Senate name plate in  my office behind me as a reminder at my desk every day. Every day I  serve, I think back to Paul's words. This is what Paul said:         Politics is not about power. Politics is not about money.       Politics is not about winning for the sake of winning.       Politics is about the improvement of people's lives.    While Paul isn't here with us today, his legacy lives on in so many  ways. It lives on in the generations of students and activists he  trained and inspired in Minnesota. It lives on in the policies he  fought for here in the Senate, for access to mental health care, for a  clean environment, and for making sure that working families get a fair  shot. It lives on in the countless lives that he touched, like mine and  my mom's.   Paul made us all better, and I hope his legacy will continue to  inspire us well into the future.                            ____________________
