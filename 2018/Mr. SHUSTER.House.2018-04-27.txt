 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 4.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 839, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, I support considering these amendments en  bloc, all of which have been approved by both the majority and  minority. These Members put forward thoughtful amendments, and I am  pleased to be able to support moving them en bloc.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's attempts and work to try  to decrease the deficits and the debt in this country, but Essential  Air Service is just that. He named a few communities, and they are  close to--I guess I can't make a great argument about those, but there  are places like Alaska, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana,  or Iowa. These folks are living miles and miles, hours and hours away-- several hours, in many cases--from the nearest airport. As Mr. DeFazio  pointed out, this connects those communities for economic development.   The other thing, he makes a point, as a conservative, when you pay  user fees into a trust fund and it goes to that intended purpose--in  this case, a small piece of that goes to Essential Air Service--that is  what we should be doing in America: people that use something are  contributing to that service or whatever that government agency is  providing them.   Again, under the bill, in 2012, we put reforms in to reform Essential  Air Service; and, this bill, the underlying bill, directs the GAO to  study and find out the effects of those reforms.   So, again, while I support and applaud the gentleman's efforts to  help get the debt under control, this is not the place to start.   Mr. Chairman, I urge rejection of this amendment.  [[Page H3720]]         Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's amendment. It does remove the  confusion with the industry stakeholders, but the hysteria that the  other side is proclaiming, that roadways are going to become a  slaughterhouse because if this goes away or it is clarified, truckers  are just going to be out there running into people left or right, I  mean, it is ridiculous.   It is not a good business model for any company to want to have an  incentive, which the other side has, I think, said, to hire unsafe  drivers. That is not a good business model. In fact, you will go out of  business, most likely, if you go out there and hire drivers who are bad  drivers, dangerous drivers. The facts don't bear that out.   Of the auto accidents that include trucks in it, over 75 percent of  them are not the trucker's fault, it is the person in the car's fault.   Truckers are professionals, and to have impugned this whole class of  people, this whole group of people that go out on these roadways and  work hard every day and try to do it as safely as they can, is just  plain wrong.   Again, as I said, truckers are professionals. Seventy-five percent of  those accidents that truckers are involved in, it is not their fault.   We continue to hype up and to put these things out there for, again,  another class of worker out there, and that is the trial lawyers. They  make millions and millions of dollars going out there and suing these  people that, again, do their best every day to try to be safe on the  roadways.   So, again, this is a sensible amendment, this clarifies it, and it  helps to make our roadways safer, not more dangerous.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption, and I thank the gentleman again for  yielding.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Duncan of Tennessee) having assumed the chair, Mr. Bacon, Acting Chair  of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4)  to reauthorize programs of the Federal Aviation Administration, and for  other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Speaker, first, to the gentlewoman's motion: First  of all, everybody should know that the President already has the  authority to waive the cost-share, so this is unnecessary for us to  pass it.   I want to thank all the committee staff, all the staff, for their  hard work on this bipartisan bill: full committee staff, my personal  staff, aviation staff, economic development staff, and, of course, the  legislative counsels.   There is one particular former staffer I want to thank, Matt Sturges,  who was with the committee for 5\1/2\ years, the staff director, just  went down to be the Deputy Administrator at FRA. He worked tirelessly  for the past couple of years on this FAA bill.   Again, I thank the following staff.   Our full committee staff, including Chris Vieson, Geoff Gosselin,  Fred Miller, Clare Doherty, Kathy Loden, Collin McCune, Hannah Matesic,  Brittany Smith, Tracy Mosebey, Justin Harclerode, Jeff Urbanchuk,  Andrew Wargofchik, Eric Burgeson.   Our Aviation Subcommittee staff: Holly Woodruff Lyons, Naveen Rao,  Hunter Presti, Max Rosen, Cameron Humphrey.   Our Economic Development Subcommittee staff: Johanna Hardy, Pam  Williams, Hannah Noyes.   Our Legislative Counsels: Tom Dillon, Rosemary Gallagher, Karen  Anderson, Stephen Hagenbuch.   Finally, I want to thank a few staff who have recently moved on, but  were instrumental in this process: Matt Sturges, Simone Perez, Keith  Hall, and Curt Haensel with Legislative Counsel.   Mr. Speaker, in addition, I would like to finish by thanking the  minority staff and the minority leader on the other side, again,  working very closely with the minority staff to produce this bill. And  finishing up with thanking the minority staff, I just want to say this  is a good bipartisan bill that was introduced with seven Democratic  cosponsors, including the ranking member and subcommittee ranking  members as well as our subcommittee chairmen.   Over the last 2 days, we worked in a very bipartisan manner. We had  116 amendments to this bill: 50 Democratic amendments and over 22  bipartisan amendments. The process has been nothing short of fair and  equitable to both sides, I believe. This is a good bill that needs to  get through the House so that we can achieve the first long-term  reauthorization of FAA in years.   We have had five short-term extensions since the last long-term bill  in 2012, creating uncertainty for the FAA, air traffic controllers, our  airports, and, most importantly, the American people. It is time we  move forward on this.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to also say that Frank LoBiondo has been a  very, very able subcommittee chair on Aviation. I thank the gentleman  for all his service to the Nation and to the committee, as well as this  will be my last Aviation bill.   Just in case anybody wants to give Frank a great send-off, I would  encourage having a big bipartisan vote on this bill, because, again,  Mr. LoBiondo and I both worked very, very hard to make sure this bill  was crafted in a bipartisan fashion. So, again, we need to get this  bill to the Senate and get the bipartisan bill to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
