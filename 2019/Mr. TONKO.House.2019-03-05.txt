 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 762) to amend the Energy Policy and Conservation Act to provide  for the dissemination of information regarding available Federal  programs relating to energy efficiency projects for schools, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 762         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Streamlining Energy       Efficiency for Schools Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. COORDINATION OF ENERGY RETROFITTING ASSISTANCE FOR                     SCHOOLS.         Section 392 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42       U.S.C. 6371a) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(e) Coordination of Energy Retrofitting Assistance for       Schools.--        ``(1) Definition of school.--Notwithstanding section       391(6), for the purposes of this subsection, the term       `school' means--        ``(A) an elementary school or secondary school (as defined       in section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act       of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801));        ``(B) an institution of higher education (as defined in       section 102(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.       1002(a)));        ``(C) a school of the defense dependents' education system       under the Defense Dependents' Education Act of 1978 (20       U.S.C. 921 et seq.) or established under section 2164 of       title 10, United States Code;        ``(D) a school operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs;        ``(E) a tribally controlled school (as defined in section       5212 of the Tribally Controlled Schools Act of 1988 (25       U.S.C. 2511)); and        ``(F) a Tribal College or University (as defined in section       316(b) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.       1059c(b))).        ``(2) Establishment of clearinghouse.--The Secretary,       acting through the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable       Energy, shall establish a clearinghouse to disseminate       information regarding available Federal programs and       financing mechanisms that may be used to help initiate,       develop, and finance energy efficiency, distributed       generation, and energy retrofitting projects for schools.        ``(3) Requirements.--In carrying out paragraph (2), the       Secretary shall--        ``(A) consult with appropriate Federal agencies to develop       a list of Federal programs and financing mechanisms that are,       or may be, used for the purposes described in paragraph (2);       and        ``(B) coordinate with appropriate Federal agencies to       develop a collaborative education and outreach effort to       streamline communications and promote available Federal       programs and financing mechanisms described in subparagraph       (A), which may include the development and maintenance of a       single online resource that includes contact information for       relevant technical assistance in the Office of Energy       Efficiency and Renewable Energy that States, local education       agencies, and schools may use to effectively access and use       such Federal programs and financing mechanisms.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 762.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to voice my strong support for H.R. 762  introduced by my good friend and colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Cartwright).   This legislation will provide a coordinating structure for our  Nation's schools to help them better navigate available Federal  programs and financing options.   Across our great country, K-12 school districts spend literally  billions of dollars on their energy bills each year, while an estimated  14 million American children attend deteriorating public schools. By  upgrading these systems, we can increase efficiency and focus school  funding to achieve better educational outcomes.   We have a huge opportunity this Congress to make major investments in  our Nation's infrastructure--including our most essential institutions,  such as schools.   I believe efficiency has to be our fuel of first choice. We can save  local taxpayers money while upgrading and modernizing these facilities.   This legislation has passed the House in each of the last two  Congresses with broad bipartisan support, and I am proud to be an  original cosponsor of this year's iteration.   I commend Representative Cartwright and the bill's bipartisan  cosponsors for their efforts, and I urge my colleagues to join me in  voting for the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright). Representative Cartwright  is from Pennsylvania's Eighth Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch), my colleague and friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage our colleagues to support this measure.  Obviously, H.R. 762 enables us to make certain that we target  wastefulness and energy efficiency. It is a good way to make certain  that resources that can be committed to education are not wasted  through inefficient use of energy--a good, strong message for the  development of our children.   So it is a great bill. I applaud Representative Cartwright and his  cosponsors for moving us forward and ask that our colleagues support  this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 347) to extend the authorization of the Uranium Mill Tailings  Radiation Control Act of 1978 relating to the disposal site in Mesa  County, Colorado.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 347         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Responsible Disposal       Reauthorization Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION.         Section 112(a)(1)(B) of the Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation       Control Act of 1978 (42 U.S.C. 7922(a)(1)(B)) is amended by       striking ``September 30, 2023'' and inserting ``September 30,       2031''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  [[Page H2330]]  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 347.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, last September the House approved an identical bill,  H.R. 2278, in the 115th Congress by a voice vote. Unfortunately, that  bill did not move in the Senate, so we are back to reconsider H.R. 347,  introduced by Mr. Tipton and cosponsored by my Energy and Commerce  colleague, Ms. DeGette.   The Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act established a process  for remediating inactive uranium-ore processing sites, such as the one  in Grand Junction, Colorado.   To protect public health and safety from potential risks, uranium  mill tailings must be disposed at a site that is licensed and that  meets standards established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and  the Environmental Protection Agency.   The continued operation of the Cheney Disposal Cell is critical. Last  year, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment provided  the following for the Record: ``Given that this is the only DOE uranium  mill tailings disposal site left in the country, it is critical that  this facility remains open to receive and dispose of the uranium mill  tailings that are discovered in our communities. This action will  ensure the continued protection of human health and the environment.''   The cell receives approximately 2,700 cubic yards of additional waste  per year, and has sufficient space to receive an estimated 235,000  cubic yards, which represents 86 more years of operation at current  rates.   H.R. 347 would authorize the Department of Energy to continue to  operate the Cheney Disposal Cell through September 2048 or until it is  filled to capacity. Currently, DOE is authorized to operate this cell  through September 2023.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good, bipartisan bill, and I hope we can move  it forward today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers on my side, and  I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I continue  to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I, too, for the reasons that this legislation  would allow for the only disposal site of its kind in the country, it  is important that we pass this important infrastructure concept, and I  encourage our colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1138) to reauthorize the West Valley demonstration project, and  for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1138         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. WEST VALLEY DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.         (a) Reauthorization.--Section 3(a) of the West Valley       Demonstration Project Act (Public Law 96-368; 42 U.S.C. 2021a       note) is amended by striking ``$5,000,000 for the fiscal year       ending September 30, 1981'' and inserting ``$75,000,000 for       each of fiscal years 2020 through 2026''.        (b) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit       to Congress a report that describes--        (1) the volumes, origins, and types of radioactive waste at       the Western New York Service Center in West Valley, New York;        (2) what options have been identified for disposal of each       such type of radioactive waste;        (3) what is known about the costs of, and timeframes for,       each such option;  [[Page H2331]]         (4) the benefits and challenges of each such option,       according to the State of New York and the Department of       Energy; and        (5) as of the date of enactment of this Act--        (A) how much has been spent on the disposal of radioactive       waste associated with the demonstration project prescribed by       section 2(a) of the West Valley Demonstration Project Act;       and        (B) what volumes and types of radioactive waste have been       disposed of from the Western New York Service Center.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1138.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, last September, the House approved an identical bill,  H.R. 2389, in the 115th Congress, by a voice vote.   Unfortunately, that bill did not move in the Senate. Today, we will  reconsider H.R. 1138, which has been reintroduced by my New York  colleague and friend, Mr. Reed.   The Western New York Nuclear Service Center in West Valley, New York,  has been the center of disputes and legislative actions since the  1980s. This site is a difficult reminder that we are still dealing with  the consequences of our Nation's entry into the atomic age.   While the site is owned by New York State, between 1966 and 1972 it  was operated by a private business to reprocess spent nuclear fuel  primarily provided by the Federal Government. Those reprocessing  activities ended decades ago, but high-level waste and transuranic  waste continue to be stored at the site.   A cost-sharing agreement for the site's remediation has been  resolved, but disposal of the waste remains a point of contention.   Since 1986, DOE has classified the waste as commercial rather than  waste deriving from atomic energy defense activities.   Under this classification, DOE believes that the cost for disposal of  the wastes should be borne by the State of New York. New York State  believes that since 60 percent of the material sent to West Valley was  from facilities that conducted defense activities, and 80 percent of  the reprocessed plutonium shipped out of West Valley was sent to  defense facilities, it should be categorized as defense-related waste.   This classification disagreement has major consequences for how the  waste can be disposed of and who will be responsible for covering the  costs. While I would prefer more certainty in clarifying the wastes'  classification, this legislation puts us on a path towards solving this  issue by requiring a GAO report on the origins of and disposal  pathways, including cost estimates.   In addition, the bill reauthorizes the West Valley Demonstration  Project at $75 million annually for 7 years. This funding level is in  line with historic appropriations levels and will ensure the cleanup  will continue on schedule.   This bill may not resolve the decades-old dispute between New York  and the Department of Energy. It does address funding for the  remediation of the site and attempts to move the ball forward to ensure  that wastes are disposed of properly and, most importantly, fairly.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins), my colleague and friend from the  26th Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, West Valley, as an issue, has been there for  a long time. It is good to know that we are moving the ball forward.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina  for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I thank the dean, the gentleman from North Carolina,  for bringing us together. The delegation has done an awesome bit of  tribute here to recognize Walter B. Jones, Jr., our colleague who has  served so faithfully well. I will offer a few comments here. It has  been a tremendous tribute.   I do, in my initial comments here, want to extend my condolences to  his widow and his family and his many friends and colleagues and, in a  particular way, to his staff.   To know Walter Jones is to love Walter Jones. I have to believe that  the relationship that he had with so many and, in particular, his  family and his extended family, his work family, had to be driven by  that love, that compassion that was part of him. It was undeniable. It  was so clearly presented by every step, every thought he shared.   He was a person of deeply rooted faith. His Christian faith, his  Catholic faith guided him. He was a pious individual who was not self- righteous but spoke with such integrity and such deeply rooted beliefs  that our goal in life is to connect inextricably with everyone and to  serve everyone.   He understood the role of a legislator to be compassionate, to  empathize, to be able to express to the many people who trusted in his  leadership, to share what needed to be done here.   And so, tonight, we gather together to offer our thanks to this  consummate gentleman who was every bit of the way, yes, an individual  of greatness, but if we do not mention his heart, his kindness, we  don't capture the individual.   His kindness worked in several ways. He wove that kindness into every  bill that he addressed, every vote he undertook, every step that he  made in his career of public service. He understood that these acts of  kindness would accumulate to express an individual of greatness.   His integrity was impeccable. I cherish the many conversations we  would have on the walk over to the House or in riding in the trolley  about having a sense of guidance, a sense of how to conduct yourself,  how to go forth and understand that the work you can address in this  body affects individuals so greatly.   Obviously, he was a person who was humble and could acknowledge  mistakes, as was indicated earlier, to do that publicly and graciously  as he did when he suggested that the many thousands, the 12,000-plus  letters that he had drafted to families of dead troops since 2003 was,  in a sense, an act of penance, a sense of expression that he had erred  and that he regretted that there were these consequences of war that  were borne by these many families who lost their loved ones  prematurely.   There was a sense of coming together that he would allow all of us to  share in the efforts for peace. Walter carried himself in a peaceful  way, a peaceful manner. He was a moral compass for this House, one who  taught us, by his very actions, that it is essential for us to be bold,  that our fight to be there for what is just and fair should guide us.  [[Page H2349]]    Tonight, I acknowledge his great work, his great friendship, his  great lessons taught. He didn't use or need to use words to teach us.  His actions spoke louder than any words he could utter. And tonight, we  say thank you to an individual who is very much missed already in the  weeks that have passed since his departure from this world.   Walter, we cherish your memory. It will live forever. You will be the  measuring stick for Members who serve in this House, and you will be  that constant reminder, as I look at that kind and loving smile that  you have worn in this photograph that we have on display on the House  floor. It has guided us. It will continue to speak to us.   Your actions are powerful. Your words were so carefully chosen and so  heartfelt. Your drive to be a just and fair man has earned you an  eternal reward. Good job, humble and faithful servant.   God bless you. May you rest in peace.                                time  2030
