 Mr. Speaker, this tax bill is bait and  switch.   Republicans said the tax bill would simplify the tax system and help  working people, not the rich. Well, that is out the window. With this  Republican bill, 86 million middle class households will see their  taxes go up.   Remember when the Republicans said we would be filing our taxes on a  postcard?   The postcard is now gone. Instead of making our Tax Code simpler,  Republicans have made it more complicated. They have even added an  additional bracket.   Their claim that this is not a tax bill that favors the rich and the  corporations, some of which ship jobs overseas, is malarkey. While  there are some tax cuts for the middle class, they are all temporary.  But the breaks for corporations are permanent. That is leaving too many  people behind.   Let's not forget about the State and local tax provision. Because of  the changes the Republicans are making, some home values in some States  are projected to drop by 10 percent.   The richest of the rich are getting a break. The top bracket is  dropping from 39.6 percent to 37 percent. Those folks are not your  working, middle class families. To add insult to injury, it raises our  debt by $2.3 trillion.   It is a bad bill. Please vote ``no.''
