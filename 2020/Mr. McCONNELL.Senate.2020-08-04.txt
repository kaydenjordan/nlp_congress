 Madam President, another day has come and gone in this  once-in-a-century national battle for our country.   Yesterday, more of our neighbors had to say goodbye to loved ones  whose lives were claimed by this virus. Yesterday, more doctors and  more nurses worked long shifts on the frontlines, fighting to heal  strangers and limit the national death toll that now exceeds 150,000.  Yesterday, more workers brought home pink slips, and more Main Street  businesses saw the end of their PPP lifelines fast approaching.  Yesterday, more laid-off Americans filed new claims for unemployment  insurance or lay awake wondering about next month's rent. Yesterday,  more school officials wondered what to tell parents, students, and  teachers about September.   What happened here in the Capitol yesterday? With the American people  fighting all of these battles and more, what did the Speaker of the  House and the Democratic leader do with yet another day of  deliberations? Yet again, it was the exact same refrain. It never seems  to change: We are feeling optimistic. We spoke very politely to the  administration, but we are still nowhere close on the substance.   It has now been more than a week since Senate Republicans released a  serious proposal for another major rescue package--$1 trillion for  kids, jobs, and healthcare. The Democrats are blocking it all. It is  like they expect applause for merely keeping a civil tone with the  President's team--never mind they are still obstructing any action for  our country.   Senate Republicans want to revive a Federal add-on to unemployment  insurance, which the Democratic leader would not let us extend last  week. We want to send another round of direct checks straight into  families' pockets. We want to supply generous, new incentives for  rehiring American workers and workplace safety. We want to send  historic money to schools for reopening and invest even more in testing  and vaccine research. We want legal protections so schools, churches,  charities, and businesses can reopen.  [[Page S4680]]    The Democrats say they want many of the same things. I certainly  believe that many of my Democratic colleagues who serve as ranking  members want many of the same things and could easily find common  ground with our chairmen if the Democratic leader would let them talk.  Instead, we have gotten a full week of the Speaker of the House's and  the Democratic leader's shutting out all of their own Members and  refusing to move an inch off of demands that everyone knows are  outlandish.   The Democratic leaders want the entirety of their massive, far-left  wish list--all of it. Speaker Pelosi is still agitating for strange,  new special interest carve-outs for the marijuana industry--even  claiming they are COVID-related. She said that, with respect to this  virus, marijuana is ``a therapy that has proven successful.'' You can't  make this up. I hope she shared her breakthrough with Dr. Fauci. In the  other corner, Leader Schumer is still demanding massive tax cuts for  rich people in blue States or he won't let any relief become law.   These are the kinds of nongermane pet projects that our Democratic  colleagues are demanding--not a dime for kids, jobs, and healthcare  unless the administration let's them check off every leftwing  lobbyist's Christmas list 5 months early.   Let's listen to what Speaker Pelosi's own House Democrats said about  this bill when they passed it. Here is what House Democrats said about  the bill that Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leader now say is their  absolute redline:   One quote: ``The partisan nature and wide scope of this bill make it  doomed upon arrival in the Senate.''   Another quote: ``In response to COVID-19, our relief efforts must be  targeted, timely, and transparent. The HEROES Act does not meet those  standards.''   Another quote: ``This isn't a plan; it's a wish list.''   Another quote: ``Partisan gamesmanship.''   Another quote: ``Some in my own party . . . have decided to use this  package as an opportunity to make political statements and propose a  bill that goes far beyond pandemic relief and has no chance at becoming  law, further declaring the help so many need.''   Those are quotes from House Democrats' views about the so-called  Heroes Act, but now the entire thing is the price of admission for  giving hard-hit Americans any more aid.   What worked back in March with the CARES Act were productive and  good-faith conversations between chairmen and ranking members--a  bipartisan process led by Members.   But this time, the Speaker and the Democratic leader have forbidden  their Members from negotiating at all. The ranking member on HELP  cannot even discuss testing with Chairman Alexander. The ranking member  on Small Business cannot even discuss PPP with Chairman Rubio and  Chairman Collins.   No, no; the Speaker and the Democratic leader only want themselves at  the table so that behind closed doors they can say that nobody gets  another dime of Federal unemployment money; nobody gets extra school  funding; and nobody gets more money for testing and PPE unless they  burn cash on 1,000 unrelated things.   I am talking about things like stimulus checks for illegal  immigrants; a trillion-dollar slush fund for States, even though States  and localities have only spent a quarter of the money we sent them in  March. Let me say that again--a trillion-dollar slush fund for States,  even though States and localities have only spent a quarter of the  money we sent them in March. In my State, the State administration only  spent 6 percent of the money we sent them--6 percent--diversity and  inclusion studies, a soil health program, and on and on and on.   The House bill does all these things while completely forgetting a  second round of the Paycheck Protection Program--no second round for  PPP--and sending less money for schools than the Senate bill.   This is what they will not budge from. And every day the script is  the same, and the script is: We had a pleasant conversation, but we  don't feel like making a deal. Maybe tomorrow.   Here is the problem: Every day the Democratic leaders repeat the same  act here in the Capitol, they are letting down the struggling people  who need our help. Day after day, Americans are trying to stay above  water--layoffs, benefit cuts, threats of eviction, the possibility of  losing a family business forever, towns wondering if their Main Streets  will ever come back, school principals with no idea what to tell  communities.   That is the reality in Kentucky and in all 50 States, and none of  these people are helped one bit, not one bit, by the Democratic  leaders' charade.   What American families need is an outcome, a bipartisan result.  Senate Republicans have had a roadmap sitting on the table for more  than a week. We didn't put every Republican wish list item in history  into an 1,800-page encyclopedia and insist on starting there.   We built a serious starting place based on the bipartisan programs we  passed back in March--unanimously, by the way--and what the country  needs now.   If our colleagues across the aisle would do the same--frankly, if our  colleagues across the aisle were even allowed--allowed to take part in  the discussions, we could get this done for our country. We did it in  March. We could do it again, but both sides have to actually want it.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
