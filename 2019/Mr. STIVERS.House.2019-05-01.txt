 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career of  Dave Blom as he retires after 17 years of service as president and CEO  of OhioHealth this July.   While his leadership in the industry is unparalleled, as a veteran, I  want to focus on what strikes me about Dave the most, and that is his  commitment to improving access to healthcare for those who have served  our Nation.   In 2014, the Department of Veterans Affairs was facing rising numbers  nationally, and, unfortunately, many veterans were not receiving the  good care that they deserved. As a result, the Congressional Commission  on Care was formed, a 15-person task force that would make  recommendations about how to best serve our Nation's veterans with  healthcare.   I knew Dave's knowledge of healthcare and longstanding commitment to  our Nation's heroes made him an outstanding candidate for that  Commission, and I was proud to work with my colleagues, Representative  Beatty and Representative Tiberi, at the time, to secure him  an appointment from Speaker Boehner.    In 2015, Dave Blom and the Commission got to work. After over 10  months  [[Page H3344]]  of effort, they ultimately produced 18 reforms for the VA and Congress,  including the VA Mission Act, which gives veterans access to local  providers outside the VA system and guarantees timely access to care.   Dave was a vital contributor to these reforms, and I know he counts  his time on the Commission among the most rewarding experiences of his  life.   It is impossible to quantify the impact that he has had on the lives  of millions of veterans and their families across this country, but it  is certain to resonate with veterans far into the future.   I am incredibly grateful for Dave's service and his leadership, and I  wish him all the best in his next chapter of life. I am confident that  he will remain involved in central Ohio and its communities for a long  time to come. I am also fortunate to call him a friend. He is a great  leader in healthcare, and he has been a great leader for our country.   I thank Dave Blom for his service to our veterans, and I congratulate  him on an incredible career in healthcare.                            ____________________
