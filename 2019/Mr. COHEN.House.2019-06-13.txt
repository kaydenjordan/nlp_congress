 Mr. Chair, I am speaking in favor of the amendment we have  that would prohibit the use of funds at businesses owned by President  Trump. Mr. Raskin joins me in these amendments.   President Trump's refusal to divest himself of his many businesses  raises serious questions about compliance with the domestic Emoluments  Clause, which protects against Presidential corruption.   By prohibiting the use of Federal funds at businesses owned, in whole  or in part, by President Trump, we will be sending a strong message to  the American people that we will not allow this or any other President  to use his high office for personal enrichment.   The fact is, when we stay at his hotels and his properties, he makes  money. Nobody is supposed to make money from the Presidency, directly  or indirectly, and they are supposed to report these possibilities to  the Congress, so we have knowledge.   That has not been done. We need notice, we need knowledge, and we  need prohibition.   I urge passage of this amendment to protect the American taxpayer.
