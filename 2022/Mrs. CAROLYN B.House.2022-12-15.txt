 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)  [[Page H9859]]         MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker and my dear  friend, Nydia Velazquez, from the great State of New York, I rise today  to recognize the outgoing staff director of the House Committee on  Oversight and Reform, Russell Anello.   Russ became my trusted adviser and leader of our committee staff in  May 2021. Before his promotion to staff director, Russ served under  three of our distinguished colleagues: Chairman Henry Waxman, Chairman   Jim Clyburn, and Chairman Elijah Cummings.   Russ is a tireless leader who defended democracy when democracy  needed defending the most. Under his leadership, the committee passed  landmark legislation, held high-profile hearings, and skillfully  navigated complex investigations to hold government and private actors  to account.   Russ' sharp legal skills and political instincts have helped to make  our government more effective and efficient and have improved the lives  of Americans.   On behalf of the members of the House Committee on Oversight and  Reform, and on behalf of the American people, I thank Russ for his  selfless, dedicated service to our Nation.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, to my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle, it has been a privilege to have had this  extraordinary opportunity to serve with you for the past 30 years in  the House of Representatives.   A special thank you to our tremendous Democratic House leadership.  Thank you, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, for being a great strategist,  mentor, and friend; and, Majority Whip  Jim Clyburn, for what you have  taught me and all that you have done for this great Nation.   Thank you to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a trailblazer who was the first  female Speaker of the House in history and is rightfully being called  the most effective Speaker in modern times. A very special mention to  the new minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries. New York is so proud of you.   Like Speaker Pelosi, my career has been a series of firsts. I was the  first woman to represent my district on the city council and to  represent my district in Congress and the first in history to give  birth while on the city council. Many men became fathers, but I was the  first one to become a mother while serving on the city council.   I was also the first woman to serve as chair of the Joint Economic  Committee, as well as the House Committee on Oversight and Reform.   I remember almost as if it were yesterday, walking toward the Capitol  as a newly elected Member. I had just defeated a 14-year incumbent  Republican, who outspent me 4 to 1. No one thought I could win. Yet, I  did, and I had such a feeling of hope and optimism for what could be  done to help people.   I will never forget walking down the aisle, not to get married but to  be sworn into the United States Congress. I said it then, and it is  still true today, that serving in the United States Congress is the  thrill, honor, and extraordinary opportunity of a lifetime.   The first time I ever walked onto the floor of this historic Chamber  was 1992. It was called the Year of the Woman.   I announced my run for Congress on the day of the Planned Parenthood  v. Casey Supreme Court decision, which placed restrictions on Roe to a  woman's right to choose.   Along with great New York leaders like Bella Abzug, Geraldine  Ferraro, and Elizabeth Holtzman, they expressed their outrage, and I  announced my run for Congress to fight to reverse this situation and to  bring other changes.   It is really hard to believe that, years later, in 2022, the Supreme  Court didn't just chip away at abortion. They bulldozed our rights into  the ground, depriving 33 million American women of access to abortion.   When I first entered Congress, about 10 percent of Congress were  women. Back then, the entire Women's Caucus  [[Page H9890]]  could meet in an elevator. Our numbers have now moved to 149, or nearly  28 percent.   As the great New Yorker Shirley Chisholm once said: ``You don't make  progress by standing on the sidelines, whimpering and complaining. You  make progress by implementing ideas.''   There is no better place in the world to implement new ideas than the  United States Congress, and that is just what I did.   In the last 30 years, I have authored and passed more than 80 bills  and had 12 Presidential bill signings with five of our Presidents,  which are usually reserved for transformational legislation.   President Clinton signed my Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act and the  Standby Guardianship Act for children. President Bush signed my Debbie  Smith Act, which has been called the most important antirape  legislation ever passed, as well as many sex trafficking prevention  laws, and CFIUS, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United  States, to protect our infrastructure and country.   In 2009, President Obama signed my Credit Card Bill of Rights, which,  according to the CFPB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has  saved consumers over $16 billion each year since 2009.   Even President Trump signed my Never Again Education Act to support  Holocaust education, as well as the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act,  which is part of the reason why my coat is hanging here.   I wore this coat for well over a year, every single day, until we  approved the necessary funding for this vital program to help our  heroes and heroines.   They were there for us. We need to be there for them, and they still  need more help. More legislation needs to be passed this year to help  them.   Just this past April, President Biden signed my bipartisan Postal  Service Reform Act. Thanks to Oversight Committee Ranking Member    James Comer, we proved that bipartisanship can prevail over partisan  bickering in the best interests of America.   All of these achievements would not have been possible without my  fellow Members of Congress, who have proven to me that if you work hard  enough, our government can provide for the people.   I truly believe that the best legislation is always bipartisan, and I  hope our Congress can come together more for more meaningful  legislation as we did after 9/11, as we did after natural and financial  disasters, as we came together during the COVID-19 pandemic, and as we  came together in our bipartisan infrastructure bill and so much more.   Believe me, there is no Nation that is better, stronger, or more  innovative than the United States when we work together.   I also recognize those who have worked in my office over the years,  including my district office staff, my D.C. staff, and the staff of the  Oversight Committee and the Joint Economic Committee.   Our work truly would not have been possible without your hours of  dedication, your intelligence, and your selfless dedication to public  service.    To each and every one of my friends and constituents, thank you for  your continued support and inspiration. It has been the honor of my  life to represent the people of New York's 12th Congressional District.   I also thank my wonderful family, my two amazing daughters, Christina  and Virginia; my son-in-law, Peter; and baby Leland. You are the joy  and meaning of my life.   Thank you to the love of my life, Cliff Maloney, who is with me in  spirit and whose support always meant the world to me.   As I speak today, I am thinking of the important work that lies  ahead. Rest assured, I will continue to keep fighting for the issues  that are near and dear to my heart, including the Equal Rights  Amendment. Let's get it ratified and in our Constitution.   There can be no time limit on equal rights, and the ERA is needed now  more than ever to stop any more bulldozing over women's rights.   We need Senator Schumer, and over 150 of my colleagues have joined me  in writing to him and requesting him to put the time limit bill on the  floor for a vote so that the American people can see who is for equal  rights and who is against it.   Infrastructure is in my DNA, especially in these times when  modernization and new systems for transportation are so vital to our  future.   I am proud that the two largest federally funded construction  projects--not in New York City, not in New York State, but in the  entire country--are in the district I am privileged to represent, the  Second Avenue Subway and the East Side Connector.   I am proud to have brought more than $10 billion in infrastructure  funding to my district alone, and as I part, I will continue to work  toward building high-speed rail between New York and Boston. Nothing  would build our economy stronger or better.   My dear colleagues, together we have bent the moral arc of this  Nation in the direction of justice and fairness, but we mustn't rest  until equal means just that--equal.   Finally, I have always regarded public service as a loan, one that I  must repay each and every day I am in office. Thanks to your tireless  efforts, wisdom, and support, I feel like I leave office debt-free.   The best is yet to come.   It has been an honor to work and serve with all of my colleagues.    MALONEY of New York. It has been a privilege to be  inspired and to work with you, and thank you for being arrested with  me--    MALONEY of New York.--as we protested for the rights  of women to make decisions about their own bodies. I would say there is  no democracy if you cannot make your own healthcare decisions.    MALONEY of New York. It was an honor to work with  you. I will miss all of my colleagues.
