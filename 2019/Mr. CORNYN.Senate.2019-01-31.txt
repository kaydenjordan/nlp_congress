 Mr. President, on Tuesday of this week, the Senate  Finance Committee had a very important hearing on the skyrocketing  costs of prescription drugs, something the Presiding Officer knows a  lot about.   In 2017, a study found that more than half of Americans regularly  take some form of prescription medication. Modern medicine has made  living with chronic health conditions that would have once been  debilitating or fatal--like diabetes, high blood pressure, or asthma-- modern medicine has made living with those conditions manageable. That  is a blessing for which we are all grateful.   I know, at the same time, many of my constituents and many Americans  struggle to buy prescription drugs to treat common health problems, not  because they aren't widely available but because they simply are  unaffordable. For many higher cost, brand-named drugs, generic  alternatives are available at a lower price. For example, I happened to  take a drug called Lipitor, which previously was covered by a patent.  As a result of that patent, the cost of the drug was higher because the  producer of the drug had a monopoly. We grant that monopoly for a  period of time--I believe it is 12 years--in order for them to recoup  their research and investment dollars. Unfortunately, many of these  efforts to come up with lifesaving drugs are unsuccessful. So in order  to encourage innovation and lifesaving discoveries, we have to find a  way to allow drug companies to recover their sunk costs and make a  profit.   Generic drugs have really been a lifesaver for many people. That same  Lipitor that I take now is off of patent and is available for a few  dollars for a 30-day supply. That is just one example. One study found  that 93 percent of generic prescriptions are filled at $20 or less,  with the average cost being just more than a little over $6, but for  many drugs, there are no low-cost alternatives, and people are  increasingly struggling to cover the rising costs of their medication.   One witness from Indiana, Kathy Sego, I think, speaks for a lot of  parents who have children suffering from diabetes needing insulin, and  I think her story was emblematic of that problem across the country.   In her case, she is a wife, a mother of two, and a choir teacher. Her  son Hunter is one of the more than 30 million Americans who suffer from  diabetes, and he relies on insulin to manage his blood sugar.   Kathy told us that when her son Hunter started college, he started to  go to the pharmacy to pick up his insulin prescription himself. That is  when he discovered that it cost $1,700 a month, even with health  insurance. The copay--the part they were responsible for and had been  paying for Hunter, unbeknownst to him--is $1,700 a month. Kathy assured  him that, unfortunately, that cost was correct; $1,700 only covers a 1- month supply.   Over the next few weeks, their family began to notice a change in  their son Hunter. He was losing weight, falling behind in school, and  was depressed--a far cry from what she said was his normally positive  and energetic self. Unbeknownst to his parents, Hunter had only  purchased one vial of insulin when he needed four, and he began  rationing his supply of the drug. To try to counterbalance that, he  began skipping meals--which is dangerous for a diabetic to do, let  alone an incredibly active college football player like him.  Fortunately, in time, his family realized what had happened, and they  intervened, avoiding what could have been fatal consequences, but her  family still battles with the expense of this insulin.   Kathy says she worries about what happens when Hunter graduates from  college, noting that his life choices are contingent upon his ability  to pay for the medicine he needs to keep him alive. She wondered at our  hearing: Can he afford an apartment, utility bills, and repay his  student loans? Hunter, she said, needs insulin to live, but should that  need for insulin keep him from living?   About 1.5 million Americans have type 1 diabetes like Hunter, where  their body produces no insulin to deal with the blood sugar, but as I  mentioned earlier, 30 million Americans, according to the Centers for  Disease Control, have diabetes, and about 3 million of those 30 million  are in my State of Texas. Three million Texans have diabetes for which  insulin is a required treatment.  [[Page S781]]    While we know it is common to see higher drug prices for new drugs  that have recently completed the costly research-and-development phase,  that is not the case for insulin, which has been around for nearly a  century and is a type of biologic drug which is generally more  expensive to produce.   I hope Kathy and Hunter's story--which could be told millions of  times by other families across the country--impels us to investigate  the causes for these unreasonable costs for some of these prescription  drugs. I hope we find a solution--and I am confident we will if we try  hard enough--that will allow families like Kathy's to live without the  burden of wondering how to pay for their healthcare costs, particularly  when it comes to prescription drugs.   At Tuesday's hearing, I also questioned our witnesses about a  phenomenon known as rebates and the way pharmacy benefit managers deal  with pharmaceutical companies.   I noted that, ordinarily, it was a crime to kick back money to a  provider. For some reason that nobody could justify, there was an  exclusion for these rebates by pharmacy benefit managers to  pharmaceutical companies.   In the case of prescription drug pricing, rebates and discounts  provided by manufacturers could mean the difference between a drug  being covered by your insurance plan or not, and, certainly, whatever  the net price is after the rebate is not transparent to anybody, much  less to the consumer, or returned directly to the consumer. Not only  does this drive up the list price and out-of-pocket cost of lifesaving  drugs, but it makes it impossible for Congress or anybody to determine  where each dollar goes.   I find this lack of transparency alarming. It shouldn't take an  advanced degree to figure out where your money is going when you buy  prescription drugs or how to shop for the most effective drug at the  right price. When it comes to prescription drugs, we need to promote  transparency first and foremost, and we need to streamline and  eliminate regulations and laws that allow the middlemen to  unnecessarily drive up prices. We know we have the opportunity to do  that in the coming months.   We shouldn't require people suffering from chronic diseases to  subsidize the healthcare costs of healthy people. There is something  strangely wrong about this picture. I am glad we had the opportunity to  listen to witnesses on this topic, and I thank them for taking the time  to share their insights.   I look forward to continuing to work with all of our colleagues on  the Finance Committee and generally to identify ways to make  prescription drugs more affordable and accessible to the American  people.   As the Presiding Officer knows, given his background in healthcare, I  am confident he can be an important part of that solution, as well.                          Tribute to Susan Pamerleau    Mr. President, switching gears just a bit, I want to share a quick  good-news story of two outstanding Texans who blazed the trail for  women in public service.   While I was in San Antonio, my hometown, a couple of weeks ago, I had  the chance to congratulate our new U.S. marshal for the Western  District of Texas, Susan Pamerleau. Over the years, she has held many  impressive titles--general in the Air Force and sheriff--and now she is  a U.S. Marshal. In addition to each of those, I have always been proud  to know her under a different title--as a friend.   At Susan's ceremonial swearing-in, Chief Judge Orlando Garcia opened  by noting the historical significance of her being the first female  marshal ever in the Western District of Texas, which was established in  1857.   Susan's long and impressive career began at Lackland Air Force Base  in Texas, where my dad happened to have been stationed at one time,  where she received her commission through officer training school. Over  the course of her 32-year career in the Air Force, she rose through the  ranks and retired, ultimately, as an Air Force major general in the  year 2000.   When she returned to Texas, Susan joined USAA as a vice president and  later became senior vice president. It wasn't until 10 years later that  her career in law enforcement began when she was elected sheriff of  Bexar County, TX, which is the 11th largest sheriff's office in the  Nation.   Susan was the first woman to hold that role as well, but she said:         It was not about being the first woman. It was really about       redefining the role of what the Bexar County sheriff does.    Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work with her on a  number of issues impacting my constituents and our constituents,  including mental health and law enforcement reforms. I think she has  made an enormous contribution to both of those areas.   Needless to say, I was thrilled when the President nominated Susan to  be the new U.S. marshal for the Western District of Texas and when she  was confirmed last fall. Her integrity, leadership, and management  skills are critical to the Western District of Texas, which comprises  68 counties and more than 6 million people.   I wish, once again, to congratulate my dear friend Susan Pamerleau on  becoming the U.S. marshal, and I look forward to continuing to work  with her as we serve together the people of Texas                        Remembering Mary Lou Robinson    Mr. President, finally, when you talk about women opening doors in  Texas, you can't leave out Mary Lou Robinson, who sadly passed away  last weekend at the age of 92.   Her long and distinguished legal career began at the University of  Texas School of Law, where she met her husband, A.J. After law school,  they returned to Amarillo, TX, where they opened up the firm  appropriately named Robinson & Robinson.   In 1955, she left the private practice of law when Potter County  commissioners appointed her judge of the Potter County Court at Law,  making her the first in a series of firsts for this remarkable woman.   Judge Robinson found her passion, and she was hooked. In the coming  decades, she became an advocate for women's rights, and she helped to  promote the passage of the Texas Equal Rights Amendment, a  constitutional amendment voted on by the people in 1972.   Over the course of her remarkable 63-year judicial career, Judge  Robinson served as the 108th District Court judge, followed by  associate and then chief justice of the 7th Court of Appeals, located  in Amarillo.   In 1979, she was appointed by President Jimmy Carter to be a judge of  the U.S. District Court for Northern District of Texas, where she  served for nearly 40 years.   Her career is impressive, not only for its length but for its  quality. One attorney practicing before Judge Robinson noted: ``Lawyers  may disagree on a lot of things, but almost all agree that she treats  everyone equally and fairly.'' That is high praise for a district  judge.   Judge Robinson will be remembered as an inspiring and devoted judge,  an early advocate for women's rights, and a beloved member of her  community.   Last summer, Senator Cruz and I introduced a bill to rename the  Federal building and courthouse in Amarillo the J. Marvin Jones Federal  Building and the Mary Lou Robinson United States Courthouse.   This lasting testament to her judicial career will live on for  generations, and I am proud that Senator Cruz and I were able to cement  this legacy for this legal pioneer.   While our family sends our prayers to the family of Mary Lou  Robinson, we can all be proud of her distinguished career of service,  not only to her beloved community in Amarillo but to the State of Texas  and to the Nation as a whole.   I yield the floor.
