 Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation  to create an independent, bipartisan Commission to examine the January  6 attack on the Capitol that killed five people.   A full and honest review is critical not only to understand the  events of that day but also to ensure the continued strength and well- being of our democracy.   On the afternoon of January 6, Americans watched in horror as  thousands of insurrectionists stormed the Capitol to prevent the  certification of a free and fair Presidential election.   Many of us carry vivid memories from that nightmarish day. We recall  the panic and confusion, the shouting and chants of an angry mob, and  the crashing of windows and doors being smashed inside these hallowed  halls.   While many of us were on the Senate floor until being evacuated to a  secure location by the Capitol Police and Sergeant at Arms, we have  learned since that violent members of the mob were minutes away from  reaching the Senate Chamber with us inside.   Capitol Police officers, upholding their sworn duty to protect and  defend the Capitol and Members of Congress, were beaten with sticks,  bats, and even the American flag as the mob charged the building.   Rioters broke into this very Chamber, dropping down from the Gallery,  some carrying zip ties presumably to restrain any Senators or police  officers they caught. Others were chanting ``hang Mike Pence'' while a  makeshift gallows was built outside the Capitol Building.   While these memories remain clear, I fear the record for January 6 is  being blurred by misinformation and political posturing.   An independent, bipartisan commission is our best chance to set the  record straight and establish the truth about the events on January 6.   Congressional committees, the Department of Justice, and President  Trump's impeachment trial have conducted their own reviews of the  violence on that day and some of the events leading up to it. However,  those reviews weren't comprehensive and didn't have the stature of a  congressionally mandated, independent, and bipartisan Commission, along  the lines of the 9/11 Commission.   In addition to providing an independent and authoritative account of  the January 6 attack, the Commission would evaluate the motivation for  and planning of the attack, identify gaps in law enforcement  preparation and response, and enable Congress and the administration to  take action to prevent future attacks.   I would remind Senators that the same arguments being used against  this Commission were used against forming the 9/11 Commission.  ``Reviews are already underway. It will become political. We need to  look forward, not backward.'' But the 9/11 Commission revealed critical  new information about the planning and implementation of that attack  and made recommendations that led to landmark legislation. It is now  the model of an independent Commission, and the legislation before us  today is based on that model.   I call upon every one of my colleagues to support this serious,  comprehensive, and bipartisan review of the violent attack on the  Capitol.   We owe it to the American people to pass this legislation and  establish an independent Commission.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the ``San  Francisco Bay Restoration Act.'' Thank you to Senator Padilla for  cosponsoring and I am happy to be once again be working with  Congresswoman Jackie Speier, who is leading the bill in the House.   This legislation would create a San Francisco Bay Program within the  Environmental Protection Agency dedicated to conserving and protecting  the San Francisco Bay estuary ecosystem--the largest estuary in the  western United States.   The San Francisco Bay estuary is truly a national treasure, and it is  vital to the nation's environmental and economic health. It is home to  more than 1,000 plant and wildlife species, roughly 77% of California's  remaining perennial estuarine wetlands, and an important stopover for  birds along the Pacific Flyway. The Bay region produces more than $370  billion in goods and supports more than 4 million jobs.   Unfortunately, during the last 150 years, the water quality and  health of the San Francisco Bay has been diminished. According to the  United States Geological Survey, the Bay has lost 95% of its wetlands,  which serve as both habitat for vulnerable species and as an important  barrier to protect against climate change impacts such as rising sea  levels and extreme weather events made only more common by global  warming.   The program created within EPA to focus on the San Francisco Bay  Estuary would increase federal investment into the San Francisco Bay  Estuary to ensure that it can continue to support the environment,  agriculture, and economy for generations to come.   A 2018 General Accounting Office report on the San Francisco Bay  Delta Watershed found that the lack of sufficient Federal funding is  one of the biggest risks to long-term restoration efforts, and a major  factor limiting habitat restoration and water quality improvement.   The GAO noted that while Bay Area voters established a local funding  source through a bond measure for some Bay restoration, local funding  ``needs to be leveraged by significant state and Federal dollars to  meet the estimated $1.5 billion needed for restoration in the Bay  Area.''   This bill recognizes the important restoration work that must be done  to protect and restore the iconic San Francisco Bay Estuary. It  authorizes $50 million per year for five years for the creation of the  San Francisco Program office.   This program office would work with local stakeholders to compile an  annual list of project and study priorities that advance the goals of  the National Estuary Program for the San Francisco Bay estuary.   Funds would be distributed by the agency in a competitive grant  program, prioritizing projects that improve water quality, provide  wetland restoration, promote endangered species recovery, and support  adaptation to climate change.   This legislation would bring the Federal funding investment in line  with other major estuaries in the country, like the Chesapeake Bay,  Great Lakes, and Puget Sound.   This is another example of the type of front-end investment in green  infrastructure and natural resources that will only pay dividends in  the future and, most importantly, for future generations.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.   Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mr. Coons, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Warren,          Mr. Booker, Mr. Markey, Ms. Cortez Masto, and Ms. Hirono):   S. 1912. A bill to clarify the rights of certain persons who are held  or detained at a port of entry or at any facility overseen by U.S.  Customs and  [[Page S3900]]  Border Protection; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
