 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a  balanced budget amendment which should be one of several steps that we  take in Congress to control spending.   As a State senator, I worked with Governors Mitch Daniels and Mike  Pence to balance Indiana's budget every single year, while lowering  taxes and investing in key priorities. Today, Indiana has a $1.8  billion rainy-day fund and a AAA credit rating. Sadly, Washington,  D.C., has not followed Indiana's example.   According to the latest estimates from the CBO, the Federal  Government is set to run $82 trillion in deficits over the next 30  years. This is simply unsustainable. We cannot allow this crippling  debt that will burden our children and grandchildren to continue  growing.   In the short term, I applaud the Trump administration's decision to  use the rescission tool to rein in Federal spending. The legislation  that we are considering today, which would force Congress to balance  the budget, should be part of a comprehensive effort to address  spending and get America's finances back in order.   This amendment will ensure Congress has no excuses and reforms the  broken congressional budget process. Hoosier families know how to live  within their means and follow a budget, and Washington ought to do the  same.                            ____________________
