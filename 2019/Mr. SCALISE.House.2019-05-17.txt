 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule for next week, and I yield to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I want to ask about the conversations and  negotiations that are going on regarding the disaster supplemental. I  know the gentleman is well aware that there are some good, I think,  very fruitful, negotiations going on. Clearly, we want to make sure  about some of the things that weren't in the bill that went out of the  House, especially as it relates to the crisis at the border, as it  deals with unaccompanied children, as well as making sure that we get  the right kind of help to our farmers who had devastation to their  crops in these disasters.   I ask the gentleman if he can give an indication of a timeline.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Hopefully, those conversations do continue on.   I am encouraged by the negotiations in terms of how both sides seem  to be willing to get this resolved and, hopefully, quickly, ideally, if  we could have a bill on the floor next week that would be a very  bipartisan bill to address this so that we can get the relief.    I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I do want to ask about the appropriations  process because I know the gentleman from Maryland had talked earlier  this week about a desire to have the entire appropriations process  completed by the end of June. He also talked about a robust amendment  process.   I would just ask the gentleman, as we look at this week, the  concerning trend that we have been talking about a few weeks now, when  amendments came out of the Rules Committee this week, 26 amendments  came out that were offered by Democrats, and only 1 amendment was  allowed by a Republican.   As the gentleman from Maryland talks about a robust appropriations  process, I would hope he would pay closer attention to fairness in that  robustness, because 26 Democrat amendments allowed and only 1  Republican amendment allowed is surely not a fair process. It might be  considered robust, but in a hyperpartisan sense.   So I hope as we get into the appropriations process the gentleman,  and especially the leadership from the Rules Committee, would take into  account that this is a process where the House should be able to come  together and offer their ideas and let the will of the House prevail,  but at least allow for that debate here on the House floor on as many  amendments as possible in as fair a way as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    I appreciate that, and, again, we will be watching and,  hopefully, see that they become more fair as we get into that  appropriations process.   Finally, I would like to ask the gentleman about legislation that has  been filed that is a companion to a Senate bill that passed the Senate  with a vote of 77 votes to stand up against the BDS movement.   As we both know, and I know the gentleman has been supportive of  these efforts, the concern is that Israel continues to come under  attack by many countries around the world trying to delegitimize their  economy and delegitimize their status as a Jewish state by this  movement to undermine their economy, to boycott and divest from Israel.   So we have legislation. The companion bill is H.R. 336 by Mr. McCaul  from Texas. It doesn't have the concerns. There were some concerns over  the way that the Senate bill came over, but at least we do know,  because of the vote, with 77 votes, it was a very bipartisan vote.   There is strong concern by the Senate to address this and strong  concern by many Members of the House, Republican and Democrat, to stand  up to the BDS movement, and not just in words.   Clearly, there are resolutions out there. We can all give speeches  and say that we are against it, but it actually takes real action and  real effort, things that are in the legislation that give teeth to our  stand against BDS and for Israel.   Of course, if you look at some of the examples in the legislation,  not just words, but $33 billion in military assistance to Israel,  security cooperation enhancements, things that ensure that Israel  maintains a qualitative edge to defend itself from the daily threats  that, unfortunately, we see from other countries and terrorist  organizations that want to undermine their status as a Jewish state.   With that, could the gentleman give us an indication, would there be  a timeline that we can establish to bring this bill to the floor short  of the discharge petition?   There is a discharge petition with more than 180 signatures already  on it to bring this bill to the floor, but it would be a lot better if  it were truly bipartisan from both leadership sides saying that we are  willing to stand up against this movement, not just in words, but in  deeds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    We will continue to discuss it. I appreciate that.   Clearly, as we have an interest in not just expressing our words,  like on many other important issues, we have to back that up with laws,  legislation that gives teeth to the words and gives true support to our  friends, especially Israel, in such a time of need where this movement  is growing. And we want to move as quickly as possible, so we will  continue to have this conversation and, hopefully, get a formal  timeline as soon as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Clearly, the Senate looked at that as well and worked  through that. They actually made some changes to the bill which we  conformed into this. The discharge petition has a rule that will  actually conform it to the Senate to address those issues.   Again, the Senate bill got 77 votes, highly bipartisan, especially on  such an important issue. So, hopefully, we will continue those  conversations and come to an agreement on a timeline that is expedited.   Mr. Speaker, unless the gentleman has anything else, I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________
