 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding, for  his leadership through this tough conference, and for bringing this  bill to the floor.   Madam Speaker, this bill continues the Tactical Air and Land Forces  Subcommittee's long tradition of bipartisan work to make America's land  and air forces the best in the world.   I also thank our subcommittee ranking member, Mrs. Hartzler, for her  commitment and contributions to this process and upholding that  tradition of bipartisan work.   Our cooperation has kept us focused on what is truly important. We  have delivered a defense bill that addresses the modernization and  readiness requirement of our Nation's air and land forces.   At the same time, this bill includes bipartisan provisions that allow  for aggressive oversight of the Department's largest and most complex,  expensive, and risky programs to protect the taxpayer and support our  military.   This bill also manages risk in our American defense industrial base  by providing additional funds for the Army Chinook helicopter, armored  vehicles, and trucks.   This bill includes long-overdue changes that improve the quality of  life for our men and women in uniform, the workforce that supports  them, and the families who serve right beside them. This bill provides  12 weeks paid parental leave for those workers across the Federal  Government and includes a 3.1 percent pay increase for our military  servicemembers.   Additionally, the bill provides health protections for military  families and retirees from exposure to the potentially cancer-causing  contaminate PFAS. This also includes ensuring that blood tests are  conducted for our firefighters on military bases who might have been  exposed.    I am proud of the hard work that this committee has done to serve  America's national security interests, and I urge my colleagues to  support it.
