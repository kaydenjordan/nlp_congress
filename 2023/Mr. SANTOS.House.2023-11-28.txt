 Madam Speaker, it is a source of immense pride that  numerous prospective high school graduates in my district aspire to  join a service academy.   Following a rigorous selection process, I have put forth nominations  for 29 applicants. Thus far, four of them have received appointments to  academies.   Alex Gao from Levittown has been appointed to West Point. David Yoon  from Great Neck has been appointed to West Point. Joseph Kim from  Little Neck has been appointed to West Point. Tanner Schultz from  Northport has been appointed to the Merchant Marine Academy.   Embarking on the journey of attending a service academy is no easy  feat. It requires diligent effort to master your chosen major and  acquire the necessary knowledge to serve your country upon graduation 4  years later.   I feel privileged to have had the opportunity to nominate all 29  applicants. I anticipate the appointment of many more nominees from New  York's Third District to serve in the coming weeks.                          Congratulating Richard Xu     Madam Speaker, we just hosted the Congressional App  [[Page H5934]]  Challenge recently, and this week, we revealed the winner for New  York's Third District. Richard Xu emerged victorious with his  innovative creation VolunHour, an app designed to streamline the  tracking of volunteer hours.   Among the 17 impressive applicants from my district, each  contributing fantastic app ideas, Richard Xu's VolunHour stood out as  the winning entry.   Richard cited his passion for volunteering and community service as  the driving force behind the creation of this app. He started a  volunteer organization with a small group of friends, witnessing its  expansion from 5 members to 30. Throughout this experience, he  recognized the cumbersome and time-consuming nature of tracking  volunteer hours, prompting him to develop a solution.   I congratulate Richard and send a big shout-out to all the  participants from the Third District of New York who submitted  applications to the Congressional App Challenge. Well done.                   Recognizing Dedicated Staff for Casework     Madam Speaker, let me take a moment to discuss my office.  Regarding my team, they consistently dedicate substantial effort to  handle casework for our constituents.   We operate from three locations, two within the Third District of New  York and one in Washington, D.C., ensuring accessibility and a  commitment to serving the residents of New York's Third District.   To this day, we have received a total of 1,286 cases. We have  successfully resolved 1,149 cases, leaving us with 137 cases currently  under the diligent attention of my team.   The completed casework encompasses a variety of matters, including  passports, immigration issues, and distinctive cases like securing a  Purple Heart medal for the surviving family members of a World War I  hero.   The work of my office does not go unnoticed, and I and the  constituents of the Third District of New York are extremely grateful.  I thank my entire team for all the hard work they have put forward  throughout these last couple of months.                          On the Matter of Expulsion     Madam Speaker, on the matter of expulsion, we are now  going down a third attempt for a privileged resolution to expel me from  the House of Representatives this week. One was introduced earlier  today, and just earlier this evening, we had a second.   Here is the case in point. In history, five Members of Congress have  been expelled. All five had suffered convictions in a court. All five  had due process.   This expulsion vote simply undermines and underscores the precedent  that we have had in this Chamber. It starts and puts us in a new  direction, a dangerous one, that sets a very dangerous precedent for  the future.   Are we to now assume that one is no longer innocent until proven  guilty, and they are, in fact, guilty until proven innocent? Are we now  to simply assume that because somebody doesn't like you, they get to  throw you out of your job? Or better more, does the Constitution bear  no consequence where a duly elected Member of the House of  Representatives is elected by the general public but then a couple of  politicians decide that they don't like that person?   These are all matters and questions that can be brought up. I will  leave it at this. The process in which the Ethics Committee engaged was  incomplete, irresponsible, and littered with hyperbole and littered  with biased opinions.   The chairman of the committee himself admitted that it wasn't the  full extent of process. Therefore, he couldn't recommend from the  committee a punishment or action, therefore cheapening the process of  the Ethics Committee, cheapening the process that this country has  expected from this Chamber.   It is not a right to be a Member of Congress. The media will always  remind me of that every time I talk to them. It is a privilege, a  privilege you work hard for. You get elected to Congress as a privilege  to represent those who have chosen you.   Madam Speaker, I think we can all agree that due process matters and  that we should all be very concerned about the way that we are  conducting this process. I ask that all of my colleagues in the House  consider and understand what this means for the future.   To set the record straight and put this in the Record, I will not be  resigning.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 10 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, November 29, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
