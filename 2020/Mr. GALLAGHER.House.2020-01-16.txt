 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas.   Mr. Speaker, last week, the House passed H.R. 535, the PFAS Action  Act of 2019. This important legislation marks a critical step forward  in addressing the public health crisis caused by so-called forever  chemicals like PFAS.   According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry,  certain compounds of PFAS, like PFOA and PFOS, are known to cause liver  damage, thyroid disease, asthma, birth defects, and even some cancers.   Unfortunately, for many in northeast Wisconsin, this fight is  personal and tragic. Anyone who has been to our small corner of the  country knows that water is part of what makes northeast Wisconsin so  special and beautiful. Unfortunately, this water, which is so central  to our way of life, is under threat from chemicals like PFOA and PFOS.   While until recently, PFAS was an unknown contaminant. Recent studies  give us a better understanding of the risks posed by compounds like  PFOA and PFOS. Not only have our communities been unwittingly placed at  risk by these toxins, but it has taken far too long to get them the  resources required to mitigate their effects.   As a result, these toxic chemicals have contaminated local water  sources and literally poisoned the well from which Wisconsinites drink.   No one should be afraid to drink or use the water from their tap. The  fact that this is the case for many across the country, including in  northeast Wisconsin, and in Peshtigo, in particular, means one thing:  We must act with a sense of urgency to defend our communities and  protect the clean water that underpins our way of life.   As a member of the PFAS Task Force, I am committed to finding ways to  combat PFAS and its negative effects on our communities.   Last year, Representative Delgado and I introduced the PFAS Right-to- Know Act, a bipartisan bill that would require PFAS to be listed on the  Toxics Release Inventory and require manufacturers, processors, and  producers to report their usage of PFAS chemicals to the EPA.   Signed into law last month as part of the 2020 National Defense  Authorization Act, this bill provides communities with a better  understanding of where these toxins come from so we can better combat  their effects. While this was an important first step, there is more to  be done.   The PFAS Action Act builds on last year's progress through a number  of important provisions. It designates  [[Page H319]]  PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances to ensure that all those  responsible for contamination do their part to clean up and restore our  waters and habitats. It establishes stronger drinking water standards  to give States and communities the resources they need to mitigate  contamination. It strengthens the Clean Water Act to include PFOS and  PFOA as toxic pollutants.   This legislation will be critical in protecting waters in northeast  Wisconsin and across the country for current and future generations.  When it comes to the PFAS crisis, I would simply argue to my own  colleagues who may be skeptical of which direction we need to go or the  need for the Federal Government to get involved that inaction is not an  option.   The PFAS Action Act is a thorough, comprehensive, and long-overdue  solution, and I want to thank Representatives Pallone and Dingell for  their leadership, as well as my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  for their hard work in protecting our water and our communities.                                time  1130
