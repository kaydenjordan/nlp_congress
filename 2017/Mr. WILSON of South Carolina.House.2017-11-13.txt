 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, congratulations to Bill  Bethea, chairman of the South Carolina Military Base Task Force, on  receiving the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce Sergeant William  Jasper Freedom Award this year. Bill and his wife, Paula, are  appreciated State leaders for families.   The Sergeant William Jasper Freedom Award is named for the  Revolutionary War patriot and is given to those who have performed  outstanding public service and contributions to the freedom of the  people of South Carolina and our Nation.   As chairman of South Carolina's Military Base Task Force, Chairman  Bethea has worked with leaders across the Nation to enhance the value  of South Carolina's military installations and facilities. He has also  improved the quality of life for military personnel and their families.   As the father of four sons in military service who have served  overseas, I am grateful for the leadership of Bill Bethea. This is a  well-deserved honor. I look forward to working with him in the future  to make sure our men and women in uniform who call South Carolina home  are fully appreciated.  [[Page H9140]]    In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
