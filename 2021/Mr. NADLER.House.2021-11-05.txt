 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule and  the Build Back Better Act. There are so many important provisions of  this legislation, but I want to highlight just a few of the Judiciary  Committee's contributions, which invest in our communities, our  economy, and our people.   We invest in communities by supporting community violence  intervention programs, and we invest in our economy by providing  resources to the antitrust enforcement agencies for their work to  protect competition.   We also invest in people by improving our immigration system to  provide protections and stability to those who have made significant  contributions to our economy.   This legislation provides an opportunity for immigrants who have  lived here since January 1, 2011, to receive temporary protection from  removal, as well as work permits, if they are not inadmissible on  criminal, national security, or other grounds.   While this is not the permanent protection so many of us wanted, the  peace of mind that comes along with protection from deportation is life  changing for these people and their families. This legislation will  provide security and stability to millions of people, including an  estimated 1.6 million Dreamers, 1 million farmworkers, and 2.6 million  other essential workers who kept us safe during the pandemic.   The bill would also restore the availability of over 400,000 unused  immigrant visas lost due to COVID-19 or bureaucratic delay and would  enhance green card processing.   This historic and transformative legislation makes the investments we  need to continue growing our economy and strengthening our communities  for many years to come. I urge all of my colleagues to support the rule  and the Build Back Better Act.
