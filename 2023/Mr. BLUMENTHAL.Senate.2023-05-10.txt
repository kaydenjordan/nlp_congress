 Madam President, I rise today to recognize the  Connecticut Audubon Society as it celebrates 125 years of dedication to  the protection and preservation of Connecticut's birds, other wildlife,  and their habitats.   The Connecticut Audubon Society was founded in 1898 in Fairfield, CT,  by a group including the noted author and conservationist Mabel Osgood  Wright. In its first year, the group rapidly expanded into a statewide  organization, with members in towns and cities across Connecticut,  including Bristol, Ivoryton, Bridgeport, Brooklyn, New Haven, Hartford,  Roxbury, Farmington, and Greenwich. On June 4, 1898, the organization  ratified its first by-laws and outlined its purpose: ``to discourage  the destruction of birds and their eggs, and to promote the study of  nature.'' Connecticut Audubon Society remains true to this purpose  today, while also having expanded the scope of their work to  conservation efforts more broadly.   For more than a century, the Connecticut Audubon Society has provided  refuges for birds and other wildlife and important opportunities for  people to enjoy nature at its sanctuaries and preserves. Today, the  organization manages 22 sanctuaries totaling more than 3,400 acres,  including the oldest private songbird sanctuary in the United States,  Birdcraft, established in 1914. The organization now has regional  centers in Fairfield, Milford, Old Lyme, Pomfret, Hampton, and Sherman,  an educational program in Hartford, and an EcoTravel office in Essex--a  truly statewide presence, bringing their important work to all corners  of Connecticut.   One hundred and twenty-five years after its founding, the Connecticut  Audubon Society continues its vital mission through conservation,  education, and advocacy. The organization boasts 5,600 member-families  in every town in the State, and its outdoor conservation, science, and  education programs reach more than 100,000 students and adults each  year.   Dedicated to preserving our natural heritage and advocating for a  more sustainable future, the Connecticut Audubon Society is a positive  model for environmental education and wildlife conservation. I applaud  its many accomplishments and hope my colleagues will join me in  congratulating the Connecticut Audubon Society on 125 years of  unceasing commitment to ecological and environmental  excellence.                            ____________________
