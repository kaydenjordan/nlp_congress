 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, today, I begin an effort to provide  regular updates to the Senate and the country about the devastating  consequences for women in every State if Texas Judge Kacsmaryk issues a  ruling banning mifepristone nationwide.   Two weeks ago, I stood on the Senate floor and laid out what has to  happen if and when this decision comes down. President Biden and the  Food and Drug Administration must ignore it. The Food and Drug  Administration has the authority it needs to keep this medication on  the market without interruption, regardless of what this ruling says.   I have already laid out the rationale for why the case is absurd,  meritless, and lacks any legal standing, as well as the FDA's legal  authority to ignore such a ruling.   Today, I am not going to rehash those important points. I want to  discuss what I have heard over the last couple of weeks about the human  cost if every woman in this country loses access to mifepristone.  Republicans on the Supreme Court said that the issue of abortion ought  to be returned to the States, that the country shouldn't have a ``one  size fits all'' policy on this subject that is so essential to  protecting the privacy rights of women in our country.   I am going to talk about the States for a minute or two.   My home State of Oregon has some of the strongest protections for  reproductive health in the Nation. Abortion is legal. If you have  health insurance, it is required to cover this critical priority. If  you don't, you can still access care. There are no waiting periods. You  can get abortion medication via telemedicine and by mail, something  that is crucial in large States and small States with very large rural  populations, like mine. In fact, despite the dangerous Dobbs decision,  access to reproductive care has been expanding in Oregon, partially to  accommodate women traveling from nearby States whose own home State  laws deny them this critical right to privacy.   Oregon has leaders like Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General  Ellen Rosenblum fighting to keep mifepristone legal and accessible to  women in our State. I am proud to come from a State where the law  reflects the fact that a woman's right to privacy is paramount and a  woman's right to choose is hers and hers alone.   But if the plaintiffs and the anti-abortion activists prevail in that  case in Texas, everything changes--everything changes--for the people  facing important reproductive decisions every day and everywhere in the  United States. We are talking about every single State--every one.   Despite strong laws on the books, women in my State of Oregon stand  to lose mifepristone, a drug that is used now in more than 50 percent  of abortions. So much for the idea of States' rights. All that talk  about returning abortion law to the States is just going straight out  the window.   I have said it before, and I will repeat it here. So often, the  Republican Party often seems concerned about the States' rights only  when they think a State is right. Otherwise, they seem happy to take  over and tell the States what to do. Well, the people I am honored to  represent, Oregonians, don't appreciate that selective application of  their philosophy, but here it is.   Because of one judge, handpicked by Donald Trump, in the 16th largest  city in Texas, there is serious potential that soon Americans, from one  side of the country to the other and everywhere in between, will no  longer be able to access the safest, most effective, and most relied on  form of abortion care.   This is not leaving decisions to the States, like the U.S. Supreme  Court told us would happen back in June.   Look at the Dobbs decision. That was the very foundation of the Dobbs  decision. And, no shock to anybody, that is not what is being seen  today. Here is what is going to ensue when the reckless decision in  Texas comes down. We know that providers are already being stretched  very thin. They are harassed and subject to vile threats. They are  going to be thrown into a landscape of chaos and confusion.   Over the last few months, I have heard nonstop from these heroic  medical professionals in my State. They worry there will be lines out  the doors of women needing help. They worry about long wait times for  the women who are fortunate enough to eventually receive in-person  care. They worry about the women who will never make it to a doctor's  office because they live in a rural county or lack the means to make  the journey that will now be necessary to receive abortion care. They  worry about what will happen next. When will another judge in another  State that looks nothing like Oregon make it so that these providers  are not able to treat women seeking to exercise their privacy rights?   This is not some far-fetched slippery slope. It is happening now-- now--right in front of our eyes.   Women have relied on mifepristone for more than 20 years. I held the  first congressional hearing on this drug in 1990, when I was a Member  of the other body. And finally--finally--there has been access to this  drug, and it provides freedom to women to make their own private  medical decisions and face far less stigma. That fundamental right is  potentially about to be further gutted.   This is America. Aren't we for freedom--freedom to determine our own  lives and futures, freedom to decide whether and when to have a family?   We have heard lots of horror stories of life before Roe. There are  too many people with immense power in this country who tragically want  to yank America back to those times. I doubt those people have given a  moment's consideration to the danger women face when a pregnancy goes  wrong, how their lives can be at risk.   This is about women's health and survival. This is about control over  their lives, control over their bodies. It is about depriving  Oregonians and women everywhere of their fundamental right to privacy.   I am here to say that, unfortunately, these anti-abortion activists  aren't going to stop until abortion in every form and in every State is  simply banned. The need to control women's bodies is not going to end  at attacking mifepristone, which I would say, as I did earlier, has a  long record--a long record--grounded not in political rhetoric but in  scientific evidence for being safe and effective.   It will not end with the topic of abortion either. Rightwing  extremists are coming after access to reproductive healthcare more  broadly. Some lawmakers and their allies have filed legislation and  lawsuits to block access to birth control--birth control.    I remember the President of the Senate helping us in this body to  champion for so many years those priorities. And now we have  legislation to block access to birth control, lifesaving cancer  screenings, HIV prevention. The list goes on.   As these attacks go forward, we also know who is going to be hurt the  most--people of modest means, people in rural areas, people of color,  immigrants, LGBTQ Americans.   I said it 2 weeks ago when I was on the floor to discuss the case, I  will say  [[Page S631]]  it again: Enough, enough, enough. No more sitting back and just letting  things happen. I don't want to be back here in a few days, but I fear  that will be the case.   Let me talk about political change. Ever since the days when I was  director at the Gray Panthers, the senior citizens group, I always said  political change rarely starts here in Washington, DC, and trickles  down. It starts at the grassroots level. What we really need now is a  nationwide mobilization to protect a woman's right to privacy and the  right to make these choices for herself. What I would like to ask  today, for everybody who shares that view, is to go on out there and  keep mobilizing. Talk to your city council member, talk to your mayor,  talk to your State legislator, talk to anybody who has an election  certificate about how important this is to you. Momentum is needed more  now than ever to ensure that mifepristone stays legal and accessible.   I will close with this. The FDA, using the authority it already has,  needs to keep mifepristone on the market without any interruption,  regardless of Judge Kacsmaryk's ruling. And we the people need to  mobilize in Oregon, in Michigan, in Florida, and in every nook and  cranny of the Nation.
