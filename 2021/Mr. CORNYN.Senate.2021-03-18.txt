 Madam President, whether the administration wants to call  it a challenge or a mess--or pick your word--a calculated word choice  does not change the magnitude of what is currently happening on our  southern border.   Hundreds of unaccompanied children are being detained on a daily  basis, completely overwhelming the capacity of the Border Patrol and  Health and Human Services to deal with it--witness the two new centers  opened up in Midland, TX, in West Texas, and a new one at the Kay  Bailey Hutchison Convention Center in Dallas that will house  approximately 300,000 young men.   At one point, there were more than 4,200 children in custody, nearly  3,000 of them held beyond the 72-hour time limit set by the Flores  Settlement. For comparison, there were about 2,600 children in custody  at any given time during the peak in 2019, so 2,600 now to 4,200.   In many cases, these children don't make the dangerous journey north  with their parents but in the care of human smugglers--coyotes, as they  are called. Parents pay these smugglers thousands of dollars to bring  their children to the United States.   In some cases, along that long, treacherous journey, whether it is  from Central America or from Mexico or anywhere else--because these  children are not just limited to Mexico and Central America--these  children are kidnapped by the smugglers on their way to the border  because they know having a child in their custody will give them  preferential treatment and allow them to stay in the country. Sadly, we  know that, too often, children are mistreated, abused, or even sexually  assaulted on the way to the United States.   There is a lot of work that has to be done from the moment the Border  Patrol first encounters these children until they are transferred into  the custody of Health and Human Services, but the Border Patrol lacks  the physical space or the personnel or the resources to provide this  number of children with the care and support they need and also to  carry out their duties, especially during a deadly pandemic.   On Monday, I spoke with the Border Patrol sector chiefs and the  Office of Field Operations Directors from across Texas. We talked about  the surge in unaccompanied children and the cascading consequences this  crisis has had on our other border missions.   As Border Patrol officers encounter, transport, and care for these  children, they are often invariably diverted from their job securing  the border, and so security gaps are left along the rest of the border.  This is not an accident. This is really part of the strategy that the  human smugglers and drug smugglers have: flood the zone, preoccupy the  Border Patrol taking care of children, leaving gaps that can then be  exploited, either by more human smugglers or by drug smugglers.   We all know that large amounts of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine,  fentanyl, and the like come across our southern border. Ninety-two  percent, according to the DEA, of all the heroin in the United States  comes from Mexico.   So these smugglers and their really criminal organizations that ply  in different commodities and different things, they flood the system to  distract the Border Patrol and then exploit the vulnerabilities to  bring people, drugs, weapons, and money across.   One of the Border Patrol chiefs told me that Customs and Border  Protection needs to be able to identify and classify the migrants they  meet, and it is being strained, which is impacting national security.  For example, last Friday when I was in Carrizo Springs and in Laredo  with my friend Henry Cuellar, a Democrat representing a border district  in Texas along the Rio Grande, the sector chief told us that, just so  far this year, migrants from 54 different countries were detained  coming across the border in the Del Rio Sector. Now, I think that sort  of gives you a better idea that this is not just a localized  phenomenon; these are criminal networks with really connections all  around the world. If you want to come from Mexico, for example, it will  cost you a few thousand bucks. If you want to come from Central  America, you pay a little bit more of a premium. If you want to come  from Europe or a Middle East country, it will cost you even more. But  it is only a matter of money because that is the only thing that these  smugglers and these criminal organizations care about.   But then people from 54 different countries, some of which are  countries of special interest to the United States for national  security purposes--54 countries represented just so far this year in  one sector, and I am sure the other Border Patrol sectors have similar  stories.   What is more, since October, the Border Patrol has encountered more  than 4,000 criminal aliens, nearly double the amount from the previous  fiscal year in less than half the time. In order to qualify as a  criminal alien, you have committed significant crimes, like assault,  battery, domestic violence, sexual offenses, even manslaughter and  homicide. Of course, these are just the ones we know about and who were  actually detained. Many more--we don't know how many more, but many  more get through unobstructed across the border.   While Border Patrol is overwhelmed by the sheer number of people  crossing  [[Page S1658]]  our border, including the alarming number of children sent by  themselves, the Border Patrol isn't able to properly surveil or  apprehend potentially dangerous individuals and substances.   We have experienced migration surges in the past, most recently in  2014 when President Obama called it a humanitarian crisis and then  again in 2019. We know how dangerous the journey to our border is for  migrants, especially children. We know that spring and summer are often  the busiest time periods. In other words, what we are seeing now is  just a foreshadowing of what we expect to see in the coming weeks and  months.   We also know that these criminal organizations pay attention to what  our leaders are saying here in the United States. Congressman Cuellar  and I, when we were in Carrizo Springs, were able to talk to a number  of young men, teenagers, and asked how they heard about the border and  their ability to get across. They said, well, they saw it on TV or  heard from family members here in the United States or saw it on social  media that now is the time to come, with a new administration that is  not committed to border security, and so this was the time to make  their run across the border.   But these organizations do pay attention, and unfortunately the  actions of the Biden administration not only contributed to another  surge this year, but they also made likely that it would be bigger than  any other in recent memory.   The President campaigned on policies that would lead to this very  outcome. After all, when you send a message that migrants can come to  the United States even with the flimsiest asylum claims and stay for  years until they are resolved and don't even really have to show up for  their court hearing because of the backlog of 1.2 million cases in our  immigration courts, what do we expect to happen?   What the Border Patrol tells me is that this is a combination of push  factors and pull factors. The push factors we are familiar with. Who  wouldn't want to come to the United States for a better life? Who  wouldn't want to avoid the violence and crime associated with some of  the gang activity in Central America? We all understand that. But the  pull factors are the sense that you can actually successfully get into  the United States through illegal means or by making a false asylum  claim and then overloading the system and basically navigate your way  into the United States without any negative consequences.   I believe we need to set up a system that honors and respects all  legitimate asylum claims, but this isn't it. We need to find a way to  move the children and other people claiming asylum to the head of the  line so they can present their claims to an immigration judge. But, as  you can imagine, only about 10 to 12 percent of the asylum claims are  actually granted, and if your only concern is making it into the United  States, maybe you don't want to go in front of an immigration judge.  But then again, those who don't, the immigration judge, when their  appointed court date comes, issues a default order of deportation. So  if you had a valid asylum claim that would have been granted by a  judge, you have lost that by virtue of your nonappearance at your  hearing.   Well, Secretary Mayorkas said we are on track to see the highest  number of border crossings in almost 20 years, and I can't say that I  am surprised. There is simply no way to rewind time and prevent this  crisis from happening, but it is absolutely urgent first that the  administration acknowledge it and then work with Congress to address  it.   I would encourage the President to follow his own advice, which is to  listen to the experts. The experts I listen to when I travel to the  border are Border Patrol, Health and Human Services, and the Office of  Refugee Relocation. Those are the three Federal Government Agencies  that deal with this crisis. I would be glad to welcome him to my State  and introduce him to the dedicated men and women along the border who  provide valuable services but who simply are overwhelmed and  undersourced.   The communities in which they live along the border are beautiful,  vibrant communities with outstanding local leaders, but they also feel  like they have been abandoned by the Federal Government. They are the  ones who are disproportionately impacted when you see a flood of  humanity come through their borders, and they try their best, through  nongovernmental organizations or just out of simple human mercy and  sympathy for the plight of these migrants, to help them any way they  can. But they, too, are overwhelmed. They are doing everything they can  to manage the crisis, which they had no hand in creating, and they  should not be expected to manage it without help from the Federal  Government that is, indeed, responsible for our border.   Law enforcement, mayors, county judges, nongovernmental  organizations--I have a long list of folks that I would be happy to  share with the administration if they would be willing to listen.  Indeed, one of the most significant things I think that President Biden  could do, like he did after the polar vortex, the big freeze we had in  Texas, the 120-year weather event--he was good enough to come to our  State and talk to the first responders. I think he would benefit  greatly if he made another trip on Air Force One down to the border so  he could do what I have had the opportunity to do, and that is to talk  to the experts and the people on the ground who understand this crisis  and who have some, I think, very constructive ideas about how to deal  with it.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, nearly 20 years ago,  I took my first trip to Israel. I had a good stroke of fortune: I met a  brilliant, hilarious, opinionated, larger-than-life man named Roger  Sofer. Roger was simply unlike anyone I had ever met before or anyone I  have met since. He could captivate a room with anything from a serious  discussion of national security and Israel-U.S. policies, to stories  from his childhood, to jokes that, well, probably shouldn't be repeated  here on the Senate floor.   Roger cared deeply about his family, his Jewish faith, and the many  friends he earned throughout his life. I consider myself fortunate to  be among those friends, and I would like just to share a few words  about my friend Roger, who passed away last week.   As the old saying goes in my State, Roger wasn't born in Texas, but  he got there as fast as he could. The incredible story of his life  began in Queens, NY. It led him to the University of Tampa on a  baseball scholarship as a left-handed pitcher and then to Fort Dix with  the Army. He then went back to Florida, where he worked as a cabdriver,  home to New York as a sales representative, and then finally to  Houston, TX, where he lived when he and I met.   Clearly, young Roger was an enterprising guy. He understood the value  of hard work, and even more importantly, he learned about the value of  relationships. Roger and his friend Dan Steiner started their own  financial planning and insurance firm and quickly found success.   Roger truly cared about everyone he worked with--his clients, his  employees, and their families.   That personal attention translated into a thriving business and a lot  of rewards in recognition to go along with it. But Roger never let work  consume his entire life or take away from the people and causes he  cared most about.   Roger grew up in a religious home and inherited a deep appreciation  of his Jewish faith. His father Hyman was his hero and instilled in him  a love of our country, as well as a love of Israel. Hyman would say,  ``Don't worry about business, Roger, because if there's no Israel,  there will be no business.'' That thought stuck. Throughout his life,  Roger fought to secure a brighter future for our friends and allies in  Israel.   In the 1980s, Melvin Dow and Stanford Alexander, two giants in the  AIPAC community--the American Israel Public Affairs Committee--asked  Roger to help grow the pro-Israel committee in Houston. Well, I know  Roger never did anything halfway; he poured his heart and his soul into  outreach efforts. When you have somebody as outgoing, passionate, and  likable as Roger, you are bound to get results.   Roger's work in Houston was so successful that in 2002 he was asked  to serve on AIPAC's National Board, a position he would hold for nearly  two  [[Page S1659]]  decades. Lucky for me, that is how Roger and I ended up on the same  trip to Israel in March of 2002. We visited Israel during the Second  Intifada, a time of serious violence and unrest. Little did I know at  the time I wouldn't just look to Roger for insight during our trip; he  would become a trusted friend and source of advice over the next two  decades.   Make no mistake, I wasn't the only one who learned from Roger. As a  member of AIPAC's National Board, he would make almost monthly trips to  Washington, DC--often with a group of Texans--to advocate for a strong  future and a strong U.S.-Israel relationship.   Teddy Roosevelt once said, ``Nobody cares how much you know until  they know how much you care.'' It only took a few words to realize how  much Roger knew because you also saw how much he cared. He cared deeply  about Israel, its people, and its success, and became a respected voice  on the importance of a strong U.S.-Israel relationship. He didn't care  if you were a Democrat or a Republican--if you were willing to listen,  he was happy to talk. But meetings with Roger weren't limited to  conversations about the Middle East or ongoing political tensions; in  typical fashion, he peppered every conversation with a lot of fun too.   It wasn't uncommon for Roger to walk into a meeting with a Senator or  a Congressman and show them pictures of his beloved dog, Ginger. It was  even less surprising for that person to ask Roger the next time that  they saw him, ``So, Roger, how is Ginger doing?'' He was a big animal  lover, and along with dogs, his other great love, interestingly enough,  was horses. He loved the animals themselves, as well as the atmosphere  and energy at horse tracks. He was such a great handicapper that Rice  University sent a statistics class with him to a horse track just so  they could see how he did it.   Last year, just days after being diagnosed with a rare form of  leukemia, Roger was able to witness the moment every horse enthusiast  dreams about. A horse he co-owned named Tiz the Law qualified for the  Kentucky Derby. That horse would go on to win the Belmont Stakes and  place second in the Run for the Roses--one of Roger's proudest  accomplishments.   Yes, Roger was a man of many talents: a left-handed pitcher, an  expert handicapper, an amateur comedian, a skilled storyteller, and an  effective advocate. Above all, though, Roger's greatest skill was his  ability to live fully and authentically. He valued his relationships  above all else, and he could turn a complete stranger into a friend  with just a few words. I believe our friendship was proof of that.   Sadly, I, along with my wife Sandy, send condolences to Roger's  beloved family, including his wife Linden; his children, Nicole, Scott,  Jennifer, and Rebecca; as well as his grandchildren, Elizabeth, Sam,  and Beau.   Roger lived an extraordinary life, and he leaves behind an  unforgettable legacy. I am grateful to have known this man.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
