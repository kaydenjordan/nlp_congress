 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Captain Eleanor LeBeau  Cooke.   To friends and family, she was known as Ellie, the fifth of eight  children of David and Victoria LeBeau. She graduated from Althoff  Catholic High School in 2012 before attending Murray State University  in Kentucky.   In 2018, she answered the call of service and joined the Marine Corps  and became an Osprey pilot. It was in the Marines where she met her  beloved husband, Chase.   Ellie received the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on  Terrorism Service Medal, and the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon. In  March  [[Page H4428]]  of this year, she was promoted to captain.   Three weeks ago, Ellie lost her life in a V-22 Osprey crash on a  training mission off the coast of Australia. Two of her fellow marines  also passed away.   Her family and her home community in St. Clair County mourn her loss,  as do countless other southern Illinoisans. She was special. As her  obituary noted, ``There was just something about Ellie.''   Our prayers go out to Chase and to the entire LeBeau and Cooke  families at this very difficult time.   Semper Fidelis, Captain Eleanor LeBeau Cooke. Your impact on our  Nation will be remembered.                            ____________________
