 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor my friend Britt A.  Ortiz and congratulate Britt on his retirement from a long, impressive  career in higher education.   The son of Carmen and Arturo Ortiz, Britt grew up in Old Town Goleta,  California. His mother, Carmen, was an assembly line worker for a  manufacturing plant and later became a floor manager. His father,  Arturo, is an electrician.   Britt attended public schools and graduated from Dos Pueblos High  School in 1979. He went on to attend the University of California at  Santa Barbara as a first-generation college student.   I know his journey well. Though I grew up many miles south of him in  the San Fernando Valley, I, too, attended public schools, defying low  expectations from my teachers, counselors, and others. Just like other  Latino students like myself and Britt, we went on to be first- generation students at UC, Santa Barbara.   With dedication, grit, and hard work, Britt earned his bachelor's  degree in 1985 with a double major in sociology and psychology. Britt  went on to receive his master's degree in educational leadership and  policy studies at the University of California, Northridge.  [[Page H6148]]    His first full-time job after college was as an outreach counselor  for a UCSB partnership program that provided tutoring at junior high  and high schools in Goleta and Santa Barbara. This kicked off a long  career dedicated to helping students achieve their educational goals.   Seeing a need for dedicated and qualified educators and counselors in  the San Fernando Valley, Britt used his acquired skills to motivate  generations of Latino and Latina engineers and computer science  students. His leadership set the gold standard for opening doors to  traditionally underserved students.   He planned hundreds of bilingual financial aid workshops and  organized college resource fairs. He partnered with groups such as the  United Way to make these things happen.   During 2 years of work with CSUN's minority education program, Mr.  Ortiz and the MEP team brought in the largest freshman class of  minority engineering and computer science majors in the history of the  College of Engineering and Computer Science at California State  University, Northridge.   After mastering his skills in the San Fernando Valley, he returned to  UC, Santa Barbara and led the UC system's largest and oldest precollege  academic preparation program. His work helped prepare first-generation,  low-income, and underserved students and their families for higher  education.   Over the course of his career, he also worked to get $4.5 million in  grants and funding for various agencies, institutions, and early  academic outreach programs that helped students across the State of  California succeed and achieve their dreams.   He has done all of this work and more so that students who were often  discouraged and overlooked had the support, encouragement, and  opportunity they needed to chase after and achieve their dreams  regardless of the circumstances they were faced with or what was thrown  at them.   I thank Britt Ortiz for all that he has done during his 35-year  career. He showed kids what is possible. He gave them the tools they  needed to learn. He helped them achieve their full potential, and he  helped make their dreams come true.   What makes Britt's career so special is that as a young boy, he was  discouraged from going on to college, but he defied those negative  thoughts and actions against him by proving to himself--not to anybody  else, but to himself--that if he put his best foot forward, if he  always tried his best, if he always gave it his best, he could achieve  anything.   That is what is amazing about this great country, that no matter who  you are, no matter what language you start with, no matter what it is  that you are faced with, if you are focused and you take advantage of  all the opportunities that are here for you in this great country, you  can and will make it.   What is sad is all along the way some people may not believe in you.  They may try to discourage you and actually get in your way. Some  people may even try to get you thrown out of your school or out of your  classroom or what have you for things you have never done.   I say this because I have witnessed these things with my own eyes,  but it takes people like Britt Ortiz to prove to young people that  those are just lies, and they can be overcome. That is why today I  honor Britt Ortiz for his 35-year career of helping young people  overcome these challenges and to live their dreams.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4468.   I am frustrated and disappointed but not surprised to see my  Republican colleagues bring yet another bill to the floor that puts  polluters over people.  [[Page H6161]]    Scientists continue to warn us that the world is on its way to  getting warmer and warmer and increasing global warming temperatures.  If we want to avoid the worst climate changes and the worst disasters,  we must reduce our air pollution.   Why, when we know that the transportation sector is the largest  contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, would we limit the  Environmental Protection Agency's ability to carry out its authority to  improve transportation emissions?   Yet, today's bill would kill our chance of getting on the right track  and put us on the wrong track. Poor air quality and ever-worsening  climate disasters are increasing. Our constituents are already facing  these major problems all over our country.   More than 45 million Americans, including many of my constituents,  live within 300 feet of major roadways or corridors that contribute  directly to negative health effects like asthma, cardiovascular  disease, and premature death.   That is right, air pollution is a matter of life and death. Our work  here in Congress will determine how liveable our planet is, whether our  neighborhoods will be liveable or not for generations to come.   Today, my Republican colleagues have chosen to abandon a healthy and  prosperous future for Americans. Republicans choose Big Oil companies  and their profits over people. This is reckless, and I urge a ``no''  vote on H.R. 4468.   Madam Speaker, I wasn't here when my Republican colleagues were  against Social Security, against Medicare, and now they are against  making sure that we have a liveable planet. Please vote ``no'' on H.R.  4468.
