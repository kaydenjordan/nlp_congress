 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we all know why we are here--the problems that exist  within the Affordable Care Act. It is simply not working for the  American people--limited choice, costs going up, and millions without  access to care. Unfortunately, these are not just talking points, but  real issues affecting real Americans.   The Affordable Care Act has damaged the individual market. It has  driven insurers away from offering coverage. Now, we are seeing one- third of all United States counties with only one insurer. And among  the plans that have chosen to remain in the markets, there have been  widespread, double-digit premium increases.   The individual markets are a death spiral and are failing to live up  to the promises made 7 years ago--that Americans would be able to  receive affordable health care. As we knew then, and we know now, this  was an empty promise that has left an estimated 19.2 million Americans  without coverage. What is worse, these individuals are forced to pay  the individual mandate penalty or seek a hardship exemption because of  the costs to purchase and use health insurance.   Nine months ago, Mr. Speaker, we began our Better Way plan to save  the Nation's healthcare system and to bring relief to the American  people. This plan, which served as the blueprint for the American  Health Care Act, laid out the policies to stabilize the collapsing  insurance markets and to repeal the more burdensome Affordable Care Act  taxes and mandates that have hindered innovation and limited access to  care. So let's take a look at what the American Health Care Act does.   First and foremost, it provides immediate relief to the State  insurance markets. As Republicans, we know that one-size-fits-all works  for no one and certainly did not work for the individual markets. The  States should have the flexibility to support their insurance markets  and ensure that plans can continue to provide options for coverage.    To do this, we relaxed two of the egregious market regulations that  were imposed under the Affordable Care Act: the mandate that premiums  cannot vary for younger and older Americans by more than a 3-to-1  ratio, and the mandate creating fixed actuarial values for plans.   The mandate limiting a plan's ability to set premiums by age has  driven up the cost for coverage for younger and healthier Americans and  has pushed away those seeking coverage by the millions. Of the 19.2  million Americans who have sidestepped the individual mandate, it  estimated that as many as 45 percent of these individuals are under the  age of 35. Without these younger Americans seeking coverage, the  markets have further plunged into death spirals, as insurers hike up  premiums year after year.   To change this, we are relaxing the ratio to 5-to-1. It will lower  premium costs and provide necessary opportunities to stabilize the  markets.   Additionally, we are repealing the actuarial values mandate to  provide insurers with additional flexibility to offer more coverage  options.                                time  0930    To further supplement these efforts, we are establishing the Patient  and State Stability Fund. This fund provides States with $100 billion  over 10 years to promote innovative solutions to lower cost and  increase access to health care for unique patient populations in each  State. The goal is simple: to provide States with maximum flexibility  as to how they address the cost of care for their citizens.   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a combination of the  Stability Fund and other proposed changes to the market would reduce  premiums by 10 percent by calendar year 2026. We all want patients to  have access to high-quality, affordably priced coverage. The Patient  and State Stability Fund can help to lower costs.   In Medicaid, in addition to supporting the insurance market, the  American Health Care Act provides needed reforms to the Medicaid  program. Without changes, the Medicaid expansion alone is expected to  cost $1 trillion over the next decade. Medicaid desperately needs  reform so that States can continue to provide coverage to children,  people with disabilities, and other vulnerable groups.   To address these concerns, the American Health Care Act first phases  out the Medicaid expansion, the expansion that has crippled State  budgets and limited States' ability to ensure that  [[Page H2377]]  resources will continue to be available for those vulnerable  populations.   Additionally, our bill helps further bend the Medicaid cost curve by  shifting programs toward per capita allotments. The per capita  allotments, an idea that originated during the Clinton administration,  will set limits on the annual cost for growth for per capita  expenditures for which the States will receive matching funds from the  Federal Government.   The American Health Care Act increases the amount of flexibility that  States have in managing their Medicaid programs. The bill scales back  the Affordable Care Act mandates that have limited a State's ability to  tailor their plans to the needs of their beneficiaries. States can and  should be trusted to manage the needs of their beneficiaries, and this  bill allows States to do that.   Additionally, the bill before us today furthers the goal of providing  the States with greater flexibility in managing their Medicaid programs  by providing States with the option to implement two additional  opportunities: work requirement and block grants for Medicaid.   This time around we chose to engage our State counterparts in the  discussion and listen--listen--to their input as we designed this bill.  At the top of their list were the desire to see the work requirement  built in and the opportunity to work with Medicaid as a block grant.   We don't tell them what to do. They are given the permission to do  what they feel is best for their citizens. Republicans trust the States  and trust the Governors and the elected leaders in those States.   Finally, the American Health Care Act provides additional resources  to bolster State safety net providers. The bill provides increases in  the community health center funding, offers enhanced funding to support  safety net providers in States that did not expand Medicaid, and ends  the cuts to the disproportionate share hospital payments.   We are committed, Mr. Speaker, to ensuring that our local providers  can continue to deliver lifesaving care. The American Health Care Act  turns this commitment into action. For millions of Americans in rural  and medically underserved areas, these actions will provide needed  relief that was undercut by the Affordable Care Act.   Let me just say, Mr. Speaker, it has been an interesting process. We  had a 27\1/2\-hour markup in the Energy and Commerce Committee. We have  had over 15 or 16 hours in the Rules Committee. This bill has been  almost talked to death. I want to just acknowledge that I appreciate  the input of the administration. I appreciate the fact that the  directive to us last night was to put our pencils down and turn our  papers in. It is time, Mr. Speaker.   This is a good bill. The rule deserves our support. The underlying  bill deserves our support.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the  AARP; a letter from the National Rural Health Association; a letter  from the American Society of Addiction Medicine; and a letter from the  American Medical Association--all strongly opposed to the Republican  bill.                                                           AARP,                                                      March 7, 2017.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen and Ranking Members: AARP, with its nearly 38       million members in all 50 States and the District of       Columbia, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Virgin Islands, is a       nonpartisan, nonprofit, nationwide organization that helps       people turn their goals and dreams into real possibilities,       strengthens communities and fights for the issues that matter       most to consumers and families such as healthcare, employment       and income security, retirement planning, affordable       utilities and protection from financial abuse.        We write today to express our opposition to the American       Health Care Act. This bill would weaken Medicare's fiscal       sustainability, dramatically increase health care costs for       Americans aged 50-64, and put at risk the health care of       millions of children and adults with disabilities, and poor       seniors who depend on the Medicaid program for long-term       services and supports and other benefits.                                   Medicare         Our members and older Americans believe that Medicare must       be protected and strengthened for today's seniors and future       generations. We strongly oppose any changes to current law       that could result in cuts to benefits, increased costs, or       reduced coverage for older Americans. According to the 2016       Medicare Trustees report, the Medicare Part A Trust Fund is       solvent until 2028 (11 years longer than pre-Affordable Care       Act (ACA)), due in large part to changes made in the ACA. We       have serious concerns that the American Health Care Act       repeals provisions in current law that have strengthened       Medicare's fiscal outlook, specifically, the repeal of the       additional 0.9 percent payroll tax on higher-income workers.       Repealing this provision could hasten the insolvency of       Medicare by up to 4 years and diminish Medicare's ability to       pay for services in the future.                              Prescription Drugs         Older Americans use prescription drugs more than any other       segment of the U.S. population, typically on a chronic basis.       We are pleased that the bill does not repeal the Medicare       Part D coverage gap (``donut hole'') protections created       under the ACA. Since the enactment of the law, more than 11.8       million Medicare beneficiaries have saved over $26.8 billion       on prescription drugs. We do have strong concerns that the       American Health Care Act repeals the fee on manufacturers and       importers of branded prescription drugs, which currently is       projected to add $25 billion to the Part B trust fund between       2017 and 2026. AARP believes Congress must do more to reduce       the burden of high prescription drug costs on consumers and       taxpayers and is willing to work with you on bipartisan       solutions.                     Individual Private Insurance Market         About 6.1 million older Americans age 50-64 currently       purchase insurance in the non-group market, and nearly 3.2       million are currently eligible to receive subsidies for       health insurance coverage through either the federal health       benefits exchange or a state-based exchange (exchange). We       have seen a significant reduction in the number of uninsured       since passage of the ACA, with the number of 50-64 year old       Americans who are uninsured dropping by half.        Affordability of both premiums and cost-sharing is critical       to older Americans and their ability to obtain and access       health care. A typical senior seeking coverage through an       exchange has a median annual income of under $25,000 and       already pays significant out-of-pocket costs for health care.       We have serious concerns that the bill under consideration       will dramatically increase health care costs for 50-64 year       olds who purchase health care through an exchange due both to       the changes in age rating from 3:1 (already a compromise that       requires uninsured older Americans to pay three times more       than younger individuals) to 5:1 and reductions in current       subsidies for older Americans.        Age rating plus premium increases equal an unaffordable age       tax. Our previous estimates on the age-rating change showed       that premiums for current coverage could increase by up to       $3,200 for a 64-year-old, while reducing premiums by only       about $700 for a younger enrollee. Significant premium       increases for older consumers will make insurance less       affordable, will not address their expressed concern of       rising premiums, and will only encourage a small increase in       enrollment numbers for younger persons. In addition, the bill       proposes to change current subsidies based on income and       premium levels to a flatter tax credit. The change in       structure will dramatically increase premiums for older       consumers. We estimate that the bill's changes to current       law's tax credits could increase premium costs for a 55-year-      old earning $25,000 by more than $2,300 a year. For a 64-      year-old earning $25,000 that increase rises to more than       $4,400 a year, and more than $5,800 for a 64-year-old earning       $15,000. When we examined the impact of both the tax credit       changes and 5:1 age rating, our estimates find that, taken       together, premiums for older adults could increase by as much       as $3,600 for a 55-year-old earning $25,000 a year, $7,000       for a 64-year-old earning $25,000 a year and up to $8,400 for       a 64-year-old earning $15,000 a year. In addition to these       skyrocketing premiums, out-of-pocket costs could       significantly increase under the bill with the elimination of       cost sharing assistance in current law. The cost sharing       assistance has provided relief on out-of-pocket costs (like       deductibles and certain benefits) for low-income individuals       who are some of the most financially vulnerable marketplace       participants.                 Medicaid and Long-Term Services and Supports         AARP opposes the provisions of the American Health Care Act       that create a per capita cap financing structure in the       Medicaid program. We are concerned that these provisions       could endanger the health, safety, and care of millions of       individuals who depend on the essential services provided       through Medicaid. Medicaid is a vital safety net and       intergenerational lifeline for millions of individuals,       including over 17.4 million low-income seniors and children       and adults with disabilities who rely on the program for       critical health care and long-term services and supports       (LTSS, i.e., assistance with daily  [[Page H2378]]       activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, managing       medications, and transportation).        Of these 17.4 million individuals: 6.9 million are ages 65       and older (which equals more than 1 in every 7 elderly       Medicare beneficiaries); 10.5 million are children and adults       living with disabilities; and about 10.8 million are so poor       or have a disability that they qualify for both Medicare and       Medicaid (dual eligibles). Dual eligibles account for almost       33 percent of Medicaid spending. While they comprise a       relatively small percentage of enrollees, they account for a       disproportionate share of total Medicare and Medicaid       spending.        Individuals with disabilities of all ages and older adults       rely on critical Medicaid services, including home and       community based services (HCBS) for assistance with daily       activities such as eating, bathing, dressing, and home       modifications; nursing home care; and other benefits such as       hearing aids and eyeglasses. People with disabilities of all       ages also rely on Medicaid for access to comprehensive acute       health care services. For working adults, Medicaid can help       them continue to work; for children, it allows them to stay       with their families and receive the help they need at home or       in their community. Individuals may have low incomes, face       high medical costs, or already spent through their resources       paying out-of-pocket for LTSS, and need these critical       services. For these individuals, Medicaid is a program of       last resort.        In providing a fixed amount of federal funding per person,       this approach to financing would likely result in       overwhelming cost shifts to states, state taxpayers, and       families unable to shoulder the costs of care without       sufficient federal support. This would result in cuts to       program eligibility, services, or both--ultimately harming       some of our nation's most vulnerable citizens. In terms of       seniors, we have serious concerns about setting caps at a       time when per-beneficiary spending for poor seniors is likely       to increase in future years. By 2026, when Boomers start to       turn age 80 and older, they will likely need much higher       levels of service--including HCBS and nursing home--moving       them into the highest cost group of all seniors. As this       group continues to age, their level of need will increase as       well as their overall costs. We are also concerned that caps       will not accurately reflect the cost of care for individuals       in each state, including for children and adults with       disabilities and seniors, especially those living with the       most severe disabling conditions.        AARP is also opposed to the repeal of the six percent       enhanced federal Medicaid match for states that take up the       Community First Choice (CFC) Option. CFC provides states with       a financial incentive to offer HCBS to help older adults and       people with disabilities live in their homes and communities       where they want to be. About 90 percent of older adults want       to remain in their own homes and communities for as long as       possible. HCBS are also cost effective. On average, in       Medicaid, the cost of HCBS per person is one-third the cost       of institutional care. Taking away the enhanced match could       disrupt services for older adults and people with       disabilities in the states that are already providing       services under CFC.        AARP has concerns with the removal of the state option in       Medicaid to increase the home equity limit above the federal       minimum. This takes away flexibility for states to adjust a       Medicaid eligibility criterion based on the specific       circumstances of each state and its residents beyond a       federal minimum standard.        Although we cannot support the American Health Care Act, we       are pleased that the bill does not repeal some of the       critical consumer protections included in the Affordable Care       Act, such as guaranteed issue, prohibitions on preexisting       condition exclusions, bans on annual and lifetime coverage       limits and allowing families to keep children on their       policies until the age of 26. Also, AARP does support       restoring the 7.5 percent threshold for the medical expense       deduction which will directly help older Americans struggling       to pay for health care, particularly the high cost of nursing       homes and other long-term services and supports.        We look forward to working with you to ensure that we       maintain a strong health care system that ensures robust       insurance market protections, controls costs, improves       quality, and provides affordable coverage to all Americans.            Sincerely,                                                Joyce A. Rogers,                                              Senior Vice President,      Government Affairs.                                   ____                   Vote NO to the American Health Care Act         The National Rural Health Association urges a NO vote on       the American Health Care Act (AHCA).        Rural Americans are older, poorer and sicker than other       populations. In fact, a January 2017 CDC report pronounced       that life expectancies for rural Americans have declined and       the top five chronic diseases are worse in rural America. The       AHCA does nothing to improve the health care crisis in rural       America, and will lead to poorer rural health outcomes, more       uninsured and an increase in the rural hospital closure       crisis.        Though some provisions in the modified AHCA bill will       improve the base bill, including increased tax credits for       Americans between the ages of 50 and 64 who would have seen       their premiums skyrocket under the current plan, the National       Rural Health Association is concerned that the bill still       falls woefully short in improving access and affordability of       health care for rural Americans. Additionally, the new       amendments to freeze Medicaid expansion enrollment as of Jan.       1, 2018, and reduce the Medicaid per-capita growth rate will       disproportionately harm rural America.        The AHCA will hurt vulnerable populations in rural       Americans, leaving millions of the sickest, most underserved       populations in our nation without coverage, and further       escalating the rural hospital closure crisis. According to       the Wall Street Journal, the ``GOP health plan would hit       rural areas hard . . . Poor, older Americans would see the       largest increase in insurance-coverage costs.'' The LA Times       reports ``Americans who swept President Trump to victory--      lower-income, older voters in conservative, rural parts of       the country--stand to lose the most in federal healthcare aid       under a Republican plan to repeal and replace the Affordable       Care Act.''        Let's be clear--many provisions in the ACA failed rural       America. The lack of plan competition in rural markets,       exorbitant premiums, deductibles and co-pays, the co-op       collapses, lack of Medicaid expansion, and devastating       Medicare cuts to rural providers--all collided to create a       health care crisis in rural America. However, it's beyond       frustrating that an opportunity to fix these problems is       squandered, and instead, a greater health care crisis will be       created in rural America.        Congress has long recognized the importance of the rural       health care safety net and has steadfastly worked to protect       it. And now, much of the protections created to maintain       access to care for the 62 million who live in rural America       are in jeopardy. We implore Congress to continue its fight to       protect rural patients' access to care. Three improvements       are critical for rural patients and providers:        1. Medicaid--Though most rural residents are in non-      expansion states, a higher proportion of rural residents are       covered by Medicaid (21% vs. 16%).        Congress and the states have long recognized that rural is       different and thus requires different programs to succeed.       Rural payment programs for hospitals and providers are not       `bonus' payments, but rather alternative, cost-effective and       targeted payment formulas that maintain access to care for       millions of rural patients and financial stability for       thousands of rural providers across the country. Any federal       health care reform must protect a state's ability to protect       its rural safety net providers. The federal government must       not abdicate its moral, legal, and financial responsibilities       to rural, Medicaid eligible populations by ensuring access to       care.        Any federal health care reform proposal must protect access       to care in Rural America, and must provide an option to a       state to receive an enhanced reimbursement included in a       matching rate or a per capita cap, specifically targeted to       create stability among rural providers to maintain access to       care for rural communities. Enhancements must be equivalent       to the cost of providing care for rural safety net providers,       a safeguard that ensures the enhanced reimbursement is       provided to the safety net provider to allow for continued       access to care. Rural safety net providers include, but not       limited to, Critical Access Hospitals, Rural Prospective       Payment Hospitals, Rural Health Clinics, Indian Health       Service providers, and individual rural providers.        2. Market Reform--Forty-one percent of rural marketplace       enrollees have only a single option of insurer, representing       70 percent of counties that have only one option. This lack       of competition in the marketplace means higher premiums.       Rural residents average per month cost exceeds urban ($569.34       for small town rural vs. $415.85 for metropolitan).        Rural Americans are more likely to have obesity, diabetes,       cancer, and traumatic injury; they are more likely to       participate in high risk health behaviors including smoking,       poor diet, physical inactivity, and substance abuse. Rural       Americans are more likely to be uninsured or underinsured and       less likely to receive employer sponsored health insurance.       Rural communities have fewer health care providers for       insurers to contract with to provide an adequate network to       serve the community.        Any federal health care reform proposal must address the       fact that insurance providers are withdrawing from rural       markets. Despite record profit levels, insurance companies       are permitted to cherry pick profitable markets for       participation and are currently not obliged to provide       service to markets with less advantageous risk pools.       Demographic realities of the rural population make the market       less profitable, and thus less desirable for an insurance       company with no incentive to take on such exposure. In the       same way that financial service institutions are required to       provide services to underserved neighborhoods, profitable       insurance companies should be required to provide services in       underserved communities.        3. Stop Bad Debt Cuts to Rural Hospitals--Rural hospitals       serve more Medicare patients (46% rural vs. 40.9% urban),       thus across-the-board Medicare cuts do not have across the       board impacts. A goal of the ACA was to have hospital bad       debt decrease significantly. However, because of unaffordable       health plans in rural areas, rural patients still cannot       afford health care. Bad debt among rural hospitals has       actually increased  [[Page H2379]]       50% since the ACA was passed. According to MedPAC ``Average       Medicare margins are negative, and under current law they are       expected to decline in 2016'' has led to 7% gains in median       profit margins for urban providers while rural providers have       experienced a median loss of 6%.        If Congress does not act, all the decades of efforts to       protect rural patients' access to care, could rapidly be       undone. The National Rural Health Association implores       Congress to act now to protect rural health care across the       nation.                                   ____                                                 American Society of                                              Addiction Medicine,                                       Rockville, MD, March 8, 2017.

Dear Chairman Brady, Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Neal       and Ranking Member Pallone: On behalf of the American Society       of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), the nation's oldest and largest       medical specialty society representing more than 4,300       physicians and allied health professionals who specialize in       the treatment of addiction, I am writing to share our views       on the American Health Care Act (AHCA) that is being       considered by the Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce       committees.        ASAM is very concerned that the AHCA's proposed changes to       our health care system will result in reductions in health       care coverage, particularly for vulnerable populations       including those suffering from the chronic disease of       addiction, and we cannot support the bill in its current       form.        More than 20 million Americans currently have health care       coverage due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including       millions of Americans with addiction. This coverage is a       critical lifeline for persons with addiction, many of whom       were unable to access effective treatment before the ACA's       expansion of Medicaid eligibility to low-income adults, and       its requirement that Medicaid expansion plans and plans sold       in the individual and small group market provide essential       health benefits (EHB) including addiction treatment services       at parity with medical and surgical services.        We are concerned that rolling back the Medicaid expansion,       sunsetting the EHB requirements for Medicaid expansion plans,       and capping federal support for Medicaid beneficiaries will       reduce coverage for and access to addiction treatment       services, changes that will be particularly painful in the       midst of the ongoing opioid epidemic. Moreover, while the       AHCA retains the EHB requirements for private plans, it       repeals the ACA's actuarial value requirements for those       plans. We are concerned that this could result in insurers       offering addiction treatment benefits in name only due to       higher costs and/or less robust benefits.        The Medicaid expansion in particular has led to significant       increases in coverage and treatment access for persons with       addiction. In states that expanded Medicaid, the share of       people with addiction or mental illness who were hospitalized       but uninsured fell from about 20 percent in 2013 to 5 percent       by mid-2015 and Medicaid expansion has been associated with       an 18.3 percent reduction in unmet need for addiction       treatment services among low-income adults. Rolling back the       Medicaid expansion and fundamentally changing Medicaid's       financing structure to cap spending on health care services       will certainly reduce access to evidence-based addiction       treatment and reverse much or all progress made on the opioid       crisis last year.        To be sure, ASAM supports flexibility in the Medicaid       program and has supported several states' applications for       1115 waivers to transform their addiction treatment systems       to offer all levels of care described by The ASAM Criteria;       Treatment Criteria for Addictive, Substance-Related, and Co-      Occurring Conditions. However, ASAM has seen for decades how       states underfund addiction treatment services and waste       federal dollars on inefficient and ineffective care when they       are left to decide how to manage their federal Medicaid       dollars without mandates for parity and accountability to       cover appropriate care. Based on this experience, we       commended the Congress for requiring accountability for the       $1 billion in funding sent to the states to combat the opioid       epidemic authorized by 21st Century Cures. This funding is an       additional lifeline to suffering communities, but it will       come to an end while patients will continue to need treatment       for the chronic disease of addiction. When it does, the       Medicaid program must continue to fund appropriate addiction       treatment at parity with medical and surgical services.        ASAM has long advocated for broad access to high-quality,       evidence-based, individualized and compassionate treatment       services for persons suffering from the chronic disease of       addiction. The critical need for access to this type of care       has been heightened and highlighted by our nation's ongoing       epidemic of opioid addiction and related overdose deaths. The       ACA's Medicaid expansion, EHB requirements for addiction       treatment coverage, and extension of parity protections to       the individual and small group market have surely reduced the       burden of this epidemic and saved lives. As you consider this       legislation, we hope that parity protections will continue to       apply individual, small and large group plans as well as       Medicaid plans through the transition. Finally, throughout       this process, we implore you to keep in mind how your       decisions will affect the millions of Americans suffering       from addiction who may lose their health care coverage       entirely or see reductions in benefits that impede access to       needed treatment.            Sincerely,      R. Jeffrey Goldsmith, MD, DLFAPA, DFASAM,        President, American Society of Addiction Medicine.                                   ____                                     American Medical Association,                                        Chicago, IL, March 22, 2017.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: Due to projections       that enactment of the American Health Care Act (AHCA) will       result in millions of Americans losing health insurance       coverage, the American Medical Association (AMA) must express       our opposition to the proposal currently before the House of       Representatives. The need to stabilize the individual       insurance market and make other improvements in the       Affordable Care Act is well understood. However, as       physicians, we also know that individuals who lack health       insurance coverage live sicker and die younger than those       with adequate coverage. We encourage all members of Congress       to engage in an inclusive and thorough dialogue on       appropriate remedies. We cannot, however, support legislation       that would leave health insurance coverage further out of       reach for millions of Americans.        Earlier this year, we shared with Congress key health       reform objectives that we believe are critical to improving       the health of the nation. Among these objectives are ensuring       that those currently covered do not lose their coverage,       maintaining market reforms, stabilizing and strengthening the       individual insurance market, ensuring that low and moderate-      income patients are able to secure affordable and adequate       coverage, and ensuring that Medicaid and other critical       safety net programs are maintained and adequately funded.       While we appreciate that the bill's authors have made efforts       to maintain some market reforms and that regulatory efforts       are underway to strengthen the individual insurance market,       as a whole the legislation falls short of the principles we       previously outlined.        Health insurance coverage is critically important. Without       it, millions of American families could be just one serious       illness or accident away from losing their home, business, or       life savings. The AMA has long supported the availability of       advanceable and refundable tax credits, inversely related to       income, as a means to assist individuals and families to       purchase health insurance. The credits proposed under the       AHCA are significantly less generous for those with the       greatest need than provided under current law. The reduced       purchasing power with the AHCA tax credits will put insurance       coverage out of reach for millions of Americans.        We also remain deeply concerned with the reduction of       federal support for the Medicaid program and the resulting       significant loss of coverage. Medicaid expansion has provided       access to critical services, including mental health and       substance abuse treatment, for millions. Not only will the       AHCA force many states to roll back coverage to these       millions of previously ineligible individuals, but the       significant reduction in federal support for the program will       inevitably have serious implications for all Medicaid       beneficiaries, including the elderly, disabled, children, and       pregnant women, as well.        We also continue to be concerned about provisions that       eliminate important investments in public health, and those       that inappropriately insert the federal government into       personal decisions about where Americans are allowed to       access covered health care services.        We continue to stand ready to work with Congress on       proposals that will increase the number of Americans with       quality, affordable health insurance coverage but for the       reasons cited above, urge members to oppose the American       Health Care Act.            Sincerely,                                               James L. Madara, MD.    Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I just want to say to my colleague from  Texas, he said this bill was talked to death. It was talked to death by  politicians. There were no hearings on this bill, so no experts came to  testify, and none of these people who are now writing to us in  opposition had the opportunity to be able to come before us and tell us  how awful this bill is.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Hastings), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.
