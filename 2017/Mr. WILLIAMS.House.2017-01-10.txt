 Mr. Chair, I rise today not only in strong support of  the  [[Page H262]]  HALOS Act but for the entrepreneurs everywhere in this country.   The facts are simple. Angel investors provide vital, often necessary  capital for startup companies. Unfortunately, after the passage of the  JOBS Act, the SEC made this more difficult, placing unnecessary burdens  on companies who are just starting out.    Mr. Speaker, the positive impact these startups often have on a  community are staggering. In the City of Austin, which I am proud to  represent, startup companies provide more than just new technologies.  They provide jobs, they generate taxes, and they give back to their  local community. In 2015 alone, tech companies in Austin were able to  raise almost a billion dollars in new capital. With our economy still  on the mend from the financial collapse in 2007, it is time to give  businesses, both large and small, the resources they need to compete in  an often competitive environment.   H.R. 79 rightly amends the SEC Act of 1933 to formally define an  angel investor group and exempts them from having to comply with  burdensome, third-party verification rules. The HALOS Act provides  essential protection for trade associations that often facilitate such  meetings between investors and fund managers, continuing to cultivate  small business capital formation relationships. This change may be  small, but the impact will be great.   Mr. Speaker, I will end my remarks by saying this: If the 115th  Congress is serious about jobs, serious about turning our economy  around, and serious about real change, passing bills like the HALOS Act  will be paramount to our success.   I urge all Members to support Chairman Chabot's bill.
