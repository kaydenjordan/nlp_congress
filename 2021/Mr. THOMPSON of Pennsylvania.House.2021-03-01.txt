 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize Miss Justice Giordano from Cambria County, Pennsylvania.   Justice, a 17-year-old junior at Portage Area High School, has been  selected by the Pennsylvania Chapter of Students Against Destructive  Decisions to serve as an ambassador for the upcoming year.   Students Against Destructive Decisions, often referred to as SADD, is  the Nation's premier youth health and safety organization. The  organization's mission is to empower young people to successfully  confront the risks and pressures that challenge them throughout their  daily lives. Justice will play an integral role in achieving that  mission and raising awareness across the Commonwealth. Most recently,  Justice has shifted her focus to the dangers of vaping and electronic  cigarettes.   Justice's school principal had nothing but great things to say about  her. He said, ``Justice is a leader among her peers, and she strives to  make positive decisions while making those around her better. We are  very proud of Justice here at Portage Area.''   Madam Speaker, I am confident Justice's positive attitude and  dedication to helping fellow students will help her excel in this  exciting new role.   Congratulations, Justice.                            ____________________
