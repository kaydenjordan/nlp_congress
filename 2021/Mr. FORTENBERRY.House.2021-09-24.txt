 Madam Speaker, the Women's Health Protection Act has  a powerfully good name, but the name masks its intention.   This bill would make America the most pro-abortion Nation on Earth.  It in no way advances the principles of inclusion and equity routinely  championed on this floor. It does just the opposite: it hurts the most  vulnerable in our society, expectant mothers and their preborn  children.   So, my colleagues, my friends, I urge us, let's please turn from the  contradictions here and maybe, just maybe, open our hearts to another  way. When there is news of an unexpected pregnancy and that vulnerable  moment of uncertainty, suppose that we as a community of care committed  to the journey of life to help a mother and her child, before birth, at  birth, and after birth. That is called commitment. That is called  compassion. That is called love. That is called care for her.
