 Madam Speaker, I thank my great caucus cochair and good  friend, Congresswoman Lois Frankel, for this bill. I thank the chairman  for bringing this bill to the floor. I also thank the Speaker for her  extraordinary work in this area.   I sit here and think to myself: Are we living on two different  planets? Why would any of you on the other side of the aisle want to  prevent a woman or a man from speaking up if they were raped by someone  in the office? Why would we allow for these NDAs?   Sexual harassment is an abuse of power made worse by the indignity of  being silenced and gagged about your experience.   We have heard this morning that a third of the American workforce is  bound by NDAs. Now, they were used originally to protect trade secrets.  We appreciate that. We get that. But they have now been extended to be  a weapon of choice for abusers and those orchestrating coverups.   Let's talk about the Washington Commanders' owner, Dan Snyder, at the  NFL. Snyder assured his fans that he knew nothing about rampant and  reprehensible harassment suffered by his employees, the women staffers  forced to endure harassment and attempted assault. Some testified  before the Committee on Oversight and Reform that they were told to  avoid him at all costs and other predatory employees.                                time  1300    Snyder even had cheerleaders videotaped without their consent, and  some without their knowledge, for a calendar photo shoot. The women  posed topless using only their hands and arms or body paint to cover  their breasts. Snyder knew they would have to change outfits and be  exposed at times, and he made sure that he got the video to watch and  share with his cronies.   Surprise: Snyder used predispute NDAs with many of those women  staffers.   Abusers like Snyder, Weinstein, Roger Ailes at FOX, and others should  not be allowed to be the predators they are in the workforce. Women and  men who become victims should be able to call them out.   It is time to end this predatory practice of silencing survivors. It  is time for workers to have the freedom to speak out. For those who say  that this should be a States' rights issue, remind me: Isn't it your  party who wants to ban abortions across the country and not leave it to  the States?
