 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today to offer a simple bipartisan  amendment. This amendment would ensure the language in the bill  conforms with current law.   All of us who represent areas around the country that have  experienced natural disasters know how difficult and complicated the  recovery process can be.  [[Page H654]]    Last Congress, we came together to pass the Disaster Recovery Reform  Act, a bipartisan bill that made key changes to improve how we respond  after disasters and also make recovery an easier process.   One of those changes was a provision outlining a better way to handle  concerns over duplication of benefits after a disaster. It created a  process that allows greater flexibility to respond to the unique  situations that occur after every disaster.   It is important to my constituents and anyone dealing with the  effects of a natural disaster that this administration has clear  instructions and that they can readily act on what Congress has  instructed them to do. The language of this amendment eliminates the  risk of any confusion over what process the administration should  follow.   Madam Chair, this is just another attempt by my colleague and me from  Louisiana who have, unfortunately, had the benefit of surviving through  a number of natural disasters and just trying to make it easier for our  constituents to navigate the process and difficulty of FEMA and  recovery. So what this amendment does is helps every area that will  have a disaster deal with the question of duplication of benefits.   Madam Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Price), who is the chairman of the subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I would just offer support for the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
