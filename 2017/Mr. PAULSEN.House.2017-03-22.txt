 Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the Orono girls  basketball team for recently winning the Minnesota High School State  Championship.   After falling short of high expectations to win it all last year, the  Spartans bounced back this season with an impressive 27-4 record and  the top seed, despite many thinking that they had missed their window.  That didn't stop these girls though. They were determined to finish the  job this season as they stormed through the playoffs. Led by senior  Tori Andrew, the team played selflessly. Andrew, the only returning  starter from last season, made it a point to give her teammates the  recognition that they deserved.   The Spartans went on to beat Winona 65-47 in the State title game.   Orono's resilience, Mr. Speaker, in response to the previous season,  speaks highly of their character and their program led by Coach Lavesa  Glover in her very first season with the team. These girls showed that  they give their all in everything they do, whether it is for their  team, their school, their families, or their community.   Mr. Speaker, we are so proud of the Orono girls basketball team.  Congratulations on the State title.  [[Page H2332]]                                ____________________
