 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 1 minute in morning business.    Madam President, as President pro tempore of the U.S.  Senate, I want to recognize democracy working in Taiwan.   On Saturday, the 23 million proud people of Taiwan exercised their  democratic right to select their own leaders. I congratulate President  Tsai on her reelection. I would also like to take this moment to  congratulate all Taiwanese for being a shining light amidst dark times  in other parts of East Asia. All of us remember what has been going on  in Hong Kong for the last several months as they try to exercise just  rights that the Chinese Government gave them in 1997, when they signed  an agreement with the British Government turning back Hong Kong to  China, and they would have the rights for the next 50 years to have the  same democratic principles they had under the British Empire.   Despite continued intimidation by the Chinese Communist Party across  the Taiwan Strait, this proud island stood up to protect its democracy  and sovereignty. That is exemplified by the election Saturday.   Let us all congratulate the people of Taiwan for their remarkable  accomplishment and continue to work in this Chamber to strengthen U.S.- Taiwan relations.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
