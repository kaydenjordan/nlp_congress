 Mr. Speaker, I am here giving a 1-minute speech on the  last day of our legislative week because not only in Judiciary were we  prevented from having minority witnesses come and having a minority  witness day--the majority could have changed the rules if they wanted  but they didn't bother, they just violated their own rules--we have  special orders every day, and that is 2 hours for each party. But with  impeachment going on, the Speaker chose to shut down that for the week  and shut down the 5-minutes speeches, so she pretty well shut down  speeches that we normally are allowed to have.   Normally, I would hope to read a Christmas proclamation, but since I  am only allowed 3 more seconds, I will just say: Merry Christmas and  happy new year.                            ____________________
