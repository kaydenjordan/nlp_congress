 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, give me a break. Since when is having babies a liberal  activity?   In fact, I believe that police women have babies, too. And let me  tell you about a couple of other women.   Erica was working at a warehouse lifting heavy boxes. She had been  working there for years. And when she was denied her request to pick up  lighter boxes, she lost her pregnancy.   Hannah gave 5 years of her life to a healthcare company, was  consistently promoted; but when she disclosed her pregnancy to her  employer, she was fired.   And Sara, who spent 7 years building a tech startup from the ground  up and truly loved her job and had been promised a promotion when she  came back from maternity leave, had it revoked.   These are all true stories of women who have faced the real-world  consequence of discrimination against pregnant workers in America. So  right now, if a woman becomes pregnant, she can be denied, for example,  an extra bathroom break, a place to sit, a lighter lifting, or fired  for asking for simple accommodations or even just disclosing that she  is pregnant.   This leaves many women having to choose between the health of their  pregnancy and putting foods on their family's table. We are putting  women in danger every single day while we hold off on this action. They  are real-world implications for women like Erica and Sara and Hannah,  especially in light of how women have really suffered the brunt of the  job loss during the pandemic and as we see a rise in maternal mortality  rates for women of color.   Mr. Speaker, so these stories are not unique. Pregnancy should not  prevent a woman from putting food on the table, for paying her bills.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everybody to pass this good and needed bill,  Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.
