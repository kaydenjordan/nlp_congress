 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak in  support of legislation we considered earlier this week, the Scarlett's  Sunshine on Sudden Unexpected Death Act.   More importantly, today I rise in the memory of my great-niece, Lia,  who died from SIDS just 2 years ago. As her mother and grandmother, my  sister, said: Our family will never be the same.   Lia is with me in my heart and in the work we do in Congress every  day. She turned out to be a formidable advocate at just 6 months of  life.   Each year, roughly 3,500 infants tragically die from sudden  unexpected death in the United States, impacting families across this  country in unimaginable ways.   While the incidence of SIDS has declined by more than 50 percent  since the 1990s, we still have so much work to do to better understand  the cause of sudden unexpected death syndrome and advance research that  can develop prevention strategies and further reduce infant mortality  in America.    The bipartisan legislation that the House passed this week, the  Scarlett's Sunshine on Unexpected Death Act, is a comprehensive  approach to improving national guidelines and data consistency for  sudden infant death and sudden unexpected death for children.   It also offers support for the families grieving their loss and  supports evidence-based approaches for outreach to decrease risk  factors.   I am a proud sponsor of this bill for my great-niece Lia, and I am  pleased to see the House advance this important legislation this week.              Honoring Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor and  commemorate the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the ``Notorious RBG.''   As Americans across the country mourn this tremendous loss, we look  back on an amazing life and an extraordinary career that so clearly  shaped the world we live in today.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a trailblazer for gender equality, a  brilliant jurist who wrote some of our country's most important legal  opinions, and a fierce defender of women's rights. Her presence, her  grace, indeed, her courage on the Court will be missed by all who  cherished her advocacy.   As only the second woman to serve on the highest court in the land,  Justice Ginsburg inspired a generation of women--my generation--to join  her efforts in creating a more perfect union and combating injustice  that lurked in every corner of our country.   From authoring the Court's opinion in landmark cases that struck down  laws discriminating against women to issuing blistering dissent in  cases like Ledbetter v. Goodyear, where she believed the Court was  failing to address pay discrimination in the workplace, Justice  Ginsburg's voice on the Supreme Court represented the life experiences  of so many American women.   Justice Ginsburg led a full and meaningful life, and her chapter in  American history will be earmarked for generations to come. It is now  up to all of us to complete the work unfulfilled and, in her words:  ``Fight for the things you care about, but do it in a way that will  lead others to join you.''   Justice Ginsburg has passed the torch, and now it is up to us.                            ____________________
