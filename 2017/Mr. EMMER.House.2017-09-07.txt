 I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to support this en bloc amendment because  it contains language I offered to support the hardworking people of  Minnesota.   Our amendment halts a last-minute effort by the previous  administration that would restrict all leasing, exploration, and  potential development of approximately 234,000 acres of Federal land in  northeast Minnesota.   If this ban were to take effect, it would have a devastating impact  on the economy of my State, as well as our Nation as a whole.   Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources has estimated there are  roughly $500 billion worth of minerals in the area proposed for  withdrawal, in addition to nearly $3 billion in royalty revenues for  Minnesota's Permanent School Trust Fund, which would support almost  900,000 K-12 students statewide.   Through this amendment, we have a real opportunity to get the Federal  Government out of the way so this land can remain available for future  development to bring much-needed jobs and revenue to the great State of  Minnesota.   These efforts have garnered the support of more than 60 members of  the Minnesota Legislature, from both parties I might add. We also have  the backing of Chairman Bishop of the House Natural Resources  Committee, as well as the chairman of the Energy and Mineral Resources  Subcommittee, Representative Paul Gosar.

Because we know that somehow, somewhere, someone will find a way to  mine the precious metals in this area in a safe and environmentally  responsible way----    Mr. Chairman, when that happens, Minnesota deserves to  have that opportunity and the jobs and economic prosperity that will  ensue.   Again, I thank the chairman for the opportunity to speak in support  of my amendment, and I encourage everyone to support the en bloc  package.
