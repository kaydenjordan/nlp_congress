 Mr. Speaker, during Human Trafficking Awareness Month,  I rise in support of the 21 million men, women, and children worldwide  who are victims of this insidious enterprise. Human trafficking is  nothing less than modern-day slavery. It targets society's most  vulnerable, stealing their souls and depriving them of any hope to  escape a downward spiral of despair.   Nations must be held accountable for their efforts to eradicate human  trafficking within their borders, which is why, today, I am  reintroducing the Sex Trafficking Demand Reduction Act. This  legislation targets the demand for commercial sex because the evidence  is clear that, where markets for commercial sex exist, human  trafficking proliferates as well. The bill requires governments to take  the initiative to eliminate the demand for purchase of commercial sex  in their efforts to combat human trafficking overall.   As a member of the Congressional Human Trafficking Caucus, I am  pleased to see Congress taking a leadership role in the fight against  human trafficking. We are getting closer to the day when human  trafficking will no longer represent a blight on humanity and we will  see victims and survivors created in God's image fully restored.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise today to speak in support of the  SEC Regulatory Accountability Act. I thank the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Wagner) for championing this important legislation.   Those of us who were in Congress last year will remember the  leadership of Scott Garrett in ensuring our financial regulators,  especially the SEC, make use of robust cost-benefit analysis while  imposing rules on businesses and the American people.   That is why this bill was reported from the Financial Services  Committee with bipartisan support in the 114th Congress and has  consistently received votes from both sides of the aisle in the past.   Policymaking can be tough. There are always dozens of pros and cons  that need to be considered. Every good idea, even those with the best  of intentions, likely have minor drawbacks. However, the idea of  ensuring benefits exceed the costs should not be a partisan one. We are  simply saying that our government's policies should do more good than  harm.   You might be surprised to hear that the SEC's Inspector General has  issued a report expressing several concerns about the quality of the  SEC's economic analysis. It found none of the rulemaking it examined  attempted to quantify either benefits or costs other than information  collection costs. However, our job creators and investors know the  scope of the potential cost is far broader than this.   That is exactly what the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act does. It  strengthens the cost-benefit analysis at a key regulator overseeing our  financial markets.   While the SEC has some existing cost-benefit-related policies put  forth by its staff, this bill would strengthen those requirements and  ensure that they are codified so that we can be certain that future  generations benefit from prudent rulemaking.   It would also subject the SEC to Executive Orders 12866 and 13563  issued by Presidents Clinton and Obama.   Oddly enough, some have even made the argument that rules promulgated  by the SEC should not be subject to cost-benefit analysis if they were  mandated by Congress. I don't know where they got this idea, but it is  a chilling reminder that Congress must do more to ensure that the SEC  avoids politically motivated rulemaking that disregards the foundations  of sound policy.   In testimony before the committee last year, Dan Gallagher, a former  Republican SEC Commissioner, noted the CEO pay ratio disclosure rule as  a prime example of agency lawyers taking advantage of loopholes in the  cost-benefit analysis rules and imposing significant burdens on public  companies. This could become a slippery slope if not stopped by  Congress.   We have an opportunity today to protect our capital markets,  investors, and job creators by ensuring that the SEC is doing less harm  than good. I would urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of sound  policymaking criteria and support Mrs. Wagner's important legislation.
