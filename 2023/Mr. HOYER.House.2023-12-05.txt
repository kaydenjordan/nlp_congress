 Mr. Speaker, many years ago there was a rule adopted  called the Holman rule. It allows the arbitrary and capricious cutting  of a salary if you don't agree with what the person does. It is  somewhat like if the Speaker of the House, who didn't like a vote of  one of the Members, could cut their salary to $1. Now, there are a  number of citizens who would probably like that, but in fact it would  be unfair, capricious, and undermining of our democracy.   Punishing someone for a difference of opinion is the antithesis of  American democracy. For years, however, Republicans have made it their  policy to vilify Federal workers. The Holman rule is their tool of  choice. They use it as an instrument of political vengeance to cut the  salaries of specific Federal officials who don't share their partisan  agenda; not for misfeasance or malfeasance, but because they didn't  agree.   In the past 2 months, Republicans used the Holman rule to advance 64  amendments targeting individual Federal workers. Fifty-five of those  were voted on. Two were withdrawn, and all 53 were defeated. What it is  is essentially pandering to their rightwing, to allow their rightwing  to pretend that they are doing policy. Every one of them has been  defeated by over 250 votes.   They have wasted over 9 hours of floor time on these pointless  amendments, time that we could have and should have spent funding our  government, time that we should have spent funding Ukraine, our ally,  which is under siege from a dictator who has broken international law.  Yet, we vote on reducing salaries to $1. How capricious.   They are about settling political vendettas. It is sheer, petty, and  irrational political posturing.   Among those Federal officials singled out were the FDA officials  tasked with ensuring the safety of America's medicine and food. There  was no finding that they weren't doing that properly. It was just  because they didn't like the policy.   Others were Federal employees who administer crucial food assistance  programs and other services upon which American people rely.   Mr. Speaker, Republicans also took aim at DOD, Homeland Security,  cybersecurity, and infrastructure security agencies. These men and  women are in charge of promoting military readiness, gathering vital  intelligence, and protecting our national security. There were no  arguments that they weren't performing those services. It was that  Republicans didn't like the policies.   Trying to eliminate their pay signals to America and to the world  that their essential work, their services don't matter. It also gives  the answer to what Texas Congressman Chip Roy said, that the  Republicans have not done anything. Chip Roy, a Republican, a  conservative.   Republicans attack Federal employees only to advance extreme policies  that are out of step with the American people, from restricting  reproductive care to undermining diversity and inclusion efforts. Their  vindictive behavior is nothing new.   In 2017, House Republicans tried using the Holman rule to eliminate  one-third of the Congressional Budget Office's staff, a nonpartisan,  impartial agency. Why? It was because they didn't like the scores their  bills were receiving. They didn't say they were wrong, but they said  they didn't like them, and they had a way to go beyond them to fund  projects they wanted to fund or policies they wanted to pursue.   The people responsible for government oversight and transparency  should not have to face reprisals for their thorough and objective  work. That is no way to run a country. No business on Earth would  conduct itself in this way. No employer that threatens to cut its  employees' pay to $1 on a whim can expect to recruit and retain top  talent. They would simply walk out the door, and properly so.   The Holman rule is not only vindictive, as I said, but it endangers  our democracy and our separation of powers. It is part of the politics  of vindictiveness, the so-called revenge tour President Trump promises  to unleash on  [[Page H6114]]  America. It is just another way he and his followers can, in his own  words, and I quote Mr. Trump: ``root out the . . . radical left thugs  that live like vermin within the confines of our country.''   What kind of rhetoric is that? What kind of objective is that for  somebody who might responsibly be the head of the greatest government  on Earth?   Though these amendments have no chance of becoming law, we must not  ignore them.   They force our Government to serve the political interests of their  authors.   Instead, we must allow our Government to serve the people.   Thank you, and I yield back.                            ____________________
