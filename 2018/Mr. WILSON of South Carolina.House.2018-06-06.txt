 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that, 28  years ago this week, I was appointed by the International Republican  Institute as an election observer for the first free elections in  Bulgaria as it emerged from totalitarian communism. Since that time, I  have seen Bulgaria advance to be a vibrant democracy as a member of  NATO and the European Union.   On the 75th anniversary of the rescue of Bulgarian Jews from the  Holocaust, the world recognizes this as a remarkable event in history.  Over 50,000 Jewish people were saved by the Bulgarian church, some  intellectuals and members of Parliament, but most of all, the Bulgarian  people.   The Bulgarian Jewish community was the only one in Europe which not  only survived World War II, but increased in size.   The Bulgarian people should always be appreciated for their courage  and action. As co-chair of the Bulgaria Caucus, I cherish the mutually  beneficial friendship between our two countries inspired by Prime  Minister Boyko Borissov and Ambassador Tihomir Stoytchev.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   God bless the memory of the American-led Allied troops who landed at  Normandy 74 years ago to begin the liberation of Europe, defeating  national socialism.                            ____________________
