 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Gary  Lee Mitchell, who passed away on March 13, 2019.   Gary was born in Jacksonville, Illinois, and was the son of the late  Eldred Dale Mitchell and the late Mary Green McGath. Gary served in the  United States Navy from 1965 to 1972 aboard the USS Nathaniel Green  submarine as a nuclear reactor operator.   Gary worked with Duke Energy for 43 years, where he was known as the  resident expert in the field of nuclear energy and oversaw mentoring  new interns coming into the field. Gary was awarded the prestigious  J.B. Duke Award, which recognized his career knowledge of how to react  to critical situations in saving a coworker from serious injury or  death.   Gary lived a life of service to others and voluntarily joined many  organizations, including the American Legion in 1972, where he served  as district commander at the South Carolina Department American Legion.  He served as zone commander and all vice commander levels. On June 2,  at the 94th annual convention held in Greenville, South Carolina, Gary  was elected department commander of the South Carolina American Legion  Department.   Gary was married to Marlene A. Mitchell for over 50 years and had two  daughters, Stephanie and Stacy, and his grandchildren, Victoria,  Alexandria, and Mitchell Friel. In describing what type of husband Gary  Mitchell was to his wife, Marlene, she stated that ``he was her best  friend and was the kindest person she ever knew.''   The world is a better and kinder place because of the life of Gary  Lee Mitchell, and he was a man who served his God, his family, and his  country.                            ____________________
