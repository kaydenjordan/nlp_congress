 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2147, the  Veterans Treatment Court Improvement Act.   For many veterans, the transition from military service has been  successful, with few challenges. However, that is not the case for all  veterans.   Unfortunately, for some veterans, the integration into civilian life  has been met with difficulties, complications, and being caught up in  the criminal justice system, often due to undiagnosed and untreated  mental health issues attributed to multiple combat tours.                                time  1600    The Veteran Treatment Court Improvement Act of 2018, H.R. 2147,  assists criminal justice-involved veterans in getting the help they  need to navigate the justice system and receive much-needed services  through the Department of Veterans Affairs.   H.R. 2147 authorizes the Secretary of VA to hire an additional 50  Veteran Justice Outreach specialists to support the existing VA Veteran  Justice Outreach program.  [[Page H5135]]    The veteran treatment court model helps prevent the unnecessary  incarceration of veterans who have suffered mental health issues,  substance abuse, and homelessness related to the military service.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2147 to better  meet the needs of the program and provide much-needed services to more  veterans in need.    Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 4635, the  Peer-2-Peer Counseling Act.   Currently, women veterans represent over 9 percent of our Nation's  veterans, and that number is expected to increase to 15 percent by the  year 2030. As more women veterans utilize VA healthcare, it is critical  for the VA to update and improve services for women veterans. One area  that warrants our particular attention for improved services is VA  mental health counseling services for women veterans.   An alarming statistic from VA's 2016 suicide data report noted that  the ``risk of suicide was 2.4 times higher among female veterans when  compared with civilian adult females,'' and it also noted ``rates of  suicide increased more among women than men in the same study.''   Unfortunately, many women veterans have experienced sexual trauma and  PTSD while serving in the military. Some women veterans are suffering  from other mental health conditions from multiple combat tours of duty  and are at risk of suicide and becoming homeless.   The Peer-2-Peer Counseling Act addresses these issues by requiring  the Secretary of the VA to ensure a sufficient number of volunteer peer  support counselors are available to facilitate peer-to-peer counseling  and assist women veterans with gender-specific care and services.   H.R. 4635 will increase access to vital mental health opportunities  within the VA for women veterans. I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting the Peer-2-Peer Counseling Act to better serve the growing  women veteran population.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 4635 to better  meet the needs of the program and provide needed services to many more  veterans.   I will mention one other bill that just passed the House, H.R. 2147,  the Veterans Treatment Court Improvement Act, which builds upon a very  successful program that essentially provides VA liaisons or veteran  justice outreach program officers within these veteran treatment courts  that facilitate VA services, whether drug and alcohol, mental health,  or other services, to veterans who would otherwise be incarcerated.  They have fallen into the criminal justice system often related to  their military service, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other  mental health disorders, where they have problems adjusting from  military life to civilian life.   What this program does is provide rehabilitative services in court  for our veterans. With the VA in support, it keeps these veterans at a  very successful rate. I think in the 18th Judicial District in my  congressional district, the veterans court has a 73 percent success  rate in keeping these veterans out of the criminal justice system by  providing VA rehabilitative services for them. I think an expansion of  this program is so important.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for having passed this bill  unanimously just previously today.
