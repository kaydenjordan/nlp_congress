 Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 6042) to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to delay  the reduction in Federal medical assistance percentage for Medicaid  personal care services furnished without an electronic visit  verification system, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6042         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DELAY IN REDUCTION OF FMAP FOR MEDICAID PERSONAL                     CARE SERVICES FURNISHED WITHOUT AN ELECTRONIC                     VISIT VERIFICATION SYSTEM.         (a) In General.--Section 1903(l) of the Social Security Act       (42 U.S.C. 1396b(l)) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (1)--        (A) by striking ``January 1, 2019'' and inserting ``January       1, 2020''; and        (B) in subparagraph (A)(i), by striking ``2019 and''; and        (2) in paragraph (4)(A)(i), by striking ``calendar quarters       in 2019'' and inserting ``calendar quarters in 2020''.        (b) Sense of Congress on Stakeholder Input Regarding       Electronic Visit Verification Systems.--It is the sense of       Congress that--        (1) the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services should--        (A) convene at least one public meeting in 2018 for the       purpose of soliciting ongoing feedback from Medicaid       stakeholders on guidance issued by the Centers for Medicare &       Medicaid Services on May 16, 2018, regarding electronic visit       verification; and        (B) communicate with such stakeholders regularly and       throughout the implementation process in a clear and       transparent manner to monitor beneficiary protections;        (2) such stakeholders should include State Medicaid       directors, beneficiaries, family caregivers, individuals and       entities who provide personal care services or home health       care services, Medicaid managed care organizations,       electronic visit verification vendors, and other       stakeholders, as determined by the Centers for Medicare &       Medicaid Services; and        (3) taking into account stakeholder input on the       implementation of the electronic visit verification       requirement under the Medicaid program is vital in order to       ensure that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services is       aware and able to mitigate any adverse outcomes with the       implementation of this policy.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials into the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 6042, which  will ensure the proper implementation of the electronic visit  verification system, or EVV, in State Medicaid programs. EVV provides a  way to track the delivery of in-home Medicaid personal care services to  help prevent instances of fraud and abuse and to protect patients,  ensuring they get the services they are entitled to receive.   Many frail, disabled, or otherwise homebound patients benefit from  and even rely on Medicaid personal care services and home health  services. Yet the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of  Inspector General, OIG, found in recent years that the existing program  safeguards at the time were often ineffective, despite the fact that  they were intended to prevent improper payments and to ensure medical  necessity, patient safety, and quality care.   Furthermore, the OIG warned that fraud in this area was on the rise,  which endangers vulnerable patients and wastes taxpayer money. EVV  systems were developed to protect some of the most vulnerable Medicaid  recipients.   Last Congress, in response to the OIG report, I wrote and included a  provision in the bipartisan 21st Century Cures Act to require State  Medicaid programs to use EVV to track all personal care services  conducted in a patient's home. In the time since the implementation of  Cures, I have received feedback that more time is needed to implement  EVV systems to make sure that they are properly and fully integrating  the EVV technology.   This year, I worked with Congresswoman DeGette and Congressman  [[Page H5245]]  Langevin to introduce H.R. 6042, which gives States an extra year to  put in place their EVV systems and ensure stakeholder input. Home  visits are a critical part of providing quality care to patients, many  of whom have disabilities and rely on extra care in their homes.   H.R. 6042 will make sure that EVV can be implemented effectively.  Thanks to hard work, the bill has changed a little bit working with  Congresswoman DeGette, who came to me and said we want to make sure  that we have stakeholder input. That is included in this version of the  bill that is before us now. Her diligence in doing that has been very  helpful, and I appreciate her efforts in that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill to  provide a simple fix for the benefit of improved accountability and  patient care in State Medicaid programs.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to close.   Mr. Speaker, I didn't see my friend from Rhode Island on the floor  when I was speaking earlier on Ms. DeGette and her work in this. He has  been working really hard. I appreciate my friend from Rhode Island  leading on this issue and us being able to work together and our staffs  working together to make something very important like this. His input  was very important on the stakeholder issue, as was Ms. DeGette's.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5801) to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to  provide for requirements under the Medicaid program relating to the use  of qualified prescription drug monitoring programs and prescribing  certain controlled substances, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5801         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(a) Requirements Under the Medicaid Program Relating to       Qualified Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs and       Prescribing Certain Controlled Substances.--Title XIX of the       Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) is amended by       inserting after section 1943 the following new section:       ``SEC. 1944. REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO QUALIFIED PRESCRIPTION                     DRUG MONITORING PROGRAMS AND PRESCRIBING                     CERTAIN CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES.         ``(a) In General.--Beginning October 1, 2021, a State       shall, subject to subsection (d),  [[Page H5246]]       require each covered provider to check, in accordance with       such timing, manner, and form as specified by the State, the       prescription drug history of a covered individual being       treated by the covered provider through a qualified       prescription drug monitoring program described in subsection       (b) before prescribing to such individual a controlled       substance.        ``(b) Qualified Prescription Drug Monitoring Program       Described.--A qualified prescription drug monitoring program       described in this subsection is, with respect to a State, a       prescription drug monitoring program administered by the       State that, at a minimum, satisfies each of the following       criteria:        ``(1) The program facilitates access by a covered provider       to, at a minimum, the following information with respect to a       covered individual, in as close to real-time as possible:        ``(A) Information regarding the prescription drug history       of a covered individual with respect to controlled       substances.        ``(B) The number and type of controlled substances       prescribed to and filled for the covered individual during at       least the most recent 12-month period.        ``(C) The name, location, and contact information (or other       identifying number selected by the State, such as a national       provider identifier issued by the National Plan and Provider       Enumeration System of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid       Services) of each covered provider who prescribed a       controlled substance to the covered individual during at       least the most recent 12-month period.        ``(2) The program facilitates the integration of       information described in paragraph (1) into the workflow of a       covered provider, which may include the electronic system the       covered provider uses to prescribe controlled substances.

(d) Report by Comptroller General.--Not later than October       1, 2020, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       issue a report examining the operation of prescription drug       monitoring programs administered by States, including data       security and access standards used by such programs.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, cosponsored by myself, Representative  Griffith, Representative Fitzpatrick, and Representative Blackburn,  requires Medicaid providers to check the prescription drug history of a  beneficiary through a qualified prescription drug monitoring program,  or PDMP, before prescribing a schedule II controlled substance. This is  a crucial step in helping us get a grip on the crisis we are facing.   Currently, 49 States have a PDMP program, and the final State,  Missouri, has begun creating a PDMP program. However, only 13 States  require the prescribers check the patient's prescribing history prior  to prescribing controlled substances, despite the fact that studies  show that mandatory PDMP access laws are effective in reducing  prescription drug abuse and, in particular, opioid abuse.   For example, evidence from New York suggests that PDMPs are  associated with a 75 percent decrease in the number of beneficiaries  who got a prescription drug from more than one prescriber and  dispenser. Implementation of Florida's PDMP was associated with a 25  percent decrease in mortality related to oxycodone.   Both the current and past administrations have noted that PDMPs  should be leveraged in the opioid crisis and are most effective when  they are used by all clinicians.   This bill requires that States have a qualified PDMP by October 1,  2021, and provides enhanced matching funds from fiscal years 2018 to  2021 for States to establish data-sharing agreements with bordering  States.   Finally, the bill requires CMS to publish best practices for how  States and covered providers can use PDMPs to reduce the abuse of  controlled substances.   Medicaid patients are especially vulnerable to being harmed by the  opioid epidemic. This bill is an important step and one that I believe  will help us address the scourge that is the opioid crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Griffith for his leadership on this issue,  which has been invaluable.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5590) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services  to provide for an action plan on recommendations for changes under  Medicare and Medicaid to prevent opioids addictions and enhance access  to medication-assisted treatment, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5590         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Opioid Addiction Action Plan       Act''.       SEC. 2. ACTION PLAN ON RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CHANGES UNDER                     MEDICARE AND MEDICAID TO PREVENT OPIOIDS                     ADDICTIONS AND ENHANCE ACCESS TO MEDICATION-                    ASSISTED TREATMENT.         (a) In General.--Not later than January 1, 2019, the       Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this section       referred to as the ``Secretary''), in collaboration with the       Pain Management Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force       convened under section 101(b) of the Comprehensive Addiction       and Recovery Act of 2016 (Public Law 114-198), shall develop       an action plan that provides recommendations described in       subsection (b).        (b) Action Plan Components.--Recommendations described in       this subsection are, based on an examination by the Secretary       of potential obstacles to an effective response to the opioid       crisis, recommendations, as determined appropriate by the       Secretary, on the following:        (1) Recommendations on changes to the Medicare program       under title XVIII of the Social Security Act and the Medicaid       program under title XIX of such Act that would enhance       coverage and payment under such programs of all medication-      assisted treatment approved by the Food and Drug       Administration for the treatment of opioid addiction and       other therapies that manage chronic and acute pain and treat       and minimize risk of opioid addiction, including       recommendations on changes to the Medicare prospective       payment system for hospital inpatient department services       under section 1886(d) of  [[Page H5248]]       such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(d)) and the Medicare prospective       payment system for hospital outpatient department services       under section 1833(t) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395l(t)) that       would allow for separate payment for such therapies, if       medically appropriate and if necessary to encourage       development and adoption of such therapies.        (2) Recommendations for payment and service delivery models       to be tested by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid       Innovation and other federally authorized demonstration       projects, including value-based models, that may encourage       the use of appropriate medication-assisted treatment approved       by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of       opioid addiction and other therapies that manage chronic and       acute pain and treat and minimize risk of opioid addiction.        (3) Recommendations for data collection that could       facilitate research and policy making regarding prevention of       opioid addiction and coverage and payment under the Medicare       and Medicaid programs of appropriate opioid addiction       treatments.        (4) Recommendations for policies under the Medicare program       and under the Medicaid program that can expand access for       rural, or medically underserved communities to the full range       of medication-assisted treatment approved by the Food and       Drug Administration for the treatment of opioid addiction and       other therapies that manage chronic and acute pain and       treatment and minimize risk of opioid addiction.        (5) Recommendations on changes to the Medicare program and       the Medicaid program to address coverage or payment barriers       to patient access to medical devices that are non-opioid       based treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration       for the management of acute pain and chronic pain, for       monitoring substance use withdrawal and preventing overdoses       of controlled substances, and for treating substance use       disorder.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Representative Kinzinger,  Representative Clarke, Representative LaHood, and Representative Davis  for their work on this important bipartisan bill.   H.R. 5590 requires the Department of Health and Human Services to  develop an opioid addiction plan to evaluate what HHS is doing across  the department to address the opioid crisis and how it can be improved.  This action plan will include an evaluation of coverage and  reimbursement rates for nonopioid pain treatments, the potential role  of medical devices in addressing this crisis, and the availability of  treatment for rural and medically underserved communities, among other  components.   In addition, Medicare and Medicaid are on the front lines of this  epidemic, and we need to be sure that they are not creating adverse  incentives that can harm beneficiaries with coverage and reimbursement  decisions.   The issues addressed in this bill will also provide an informative  review of how CMS can continue to fight this national crisis.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support and pass this bipartisan  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                       Washington, DC, June 7, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: On May 9 and 17, 2018, the Committee       on Energy and Commerce ordered favorably reported over 50       bills to address the opioid epidemic facing communities       across our nation. Several of the bills were also referred to       the Committee on Ways and Means.        I ask that the Committee on Ways and Means not insist on       its referral of the following bills so that they may be       scheduled for consideration by the Majority Leader:        H.R. 1925, At-Risk Youth Medicaid Protection Act of 2017;        H.R. 3331, To amend title XI of the Social Security Act to       promote testing of incentive payments for behavioral health       providers for adoption and use of certified electronic health       record technology;        H.R. 3528, Every Prescription Conveyed Securely Act;        H.R. 4841, Standardizing Electronic Prior Authorization for       Safe Prescribing Act of 2018;        H.R. 5582, Abuse Deterrent Access Act of 2018;        H.R. 5590, Opioid Addiction Action Plan Act;        H.R. 5603, Access to Telehealth Services for Opioid Use       Disorder;        H.R. 5605, Advancing High Quality Treatment for Opioid Use       Disorders in Medicare Act;        H.R. 5675, To amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act       to require prescription drug plan sponsors under the Medicare       program to establish drug management programs for at-risk       beneficiaries;        H.R. 5684, Protecting Seniors from Opioid Abuse Act;        H.R. 5685, Medicare Opioid Safety Education Act;        H.R. 5686, Medicare Clear Health Options in Care for       Enrollees (CHOICE) Act;        H.R. 5715, Strengthening Partnerships to Prevent Opioid       Abuse Act;        H.R. 5716, Commit to Opioid Medical Prescriber       Accountability and Safety for Seniors (COMPASS) Act;        H.R. 5796, Responsible Education Achieves Care and Healthy       Outcomes for Users' Treatment (REACH OUT) Act of 2018;        H.R. 5798, Opioid Screening and Chronic Pain Management       Alternatives for Seniors Act;        H.R. 5804, Post-Surgical Injections as an Opioid       Alternative Act; and        H.R. 5809, Postoperative Opioid Prevention Act of 2018.        This concession in no way affects your jurisdiction over       the subject matter of these bills, and it will not serve as       precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a       conference on the bills be necessary, I would support your       request to have the Committee on Ways and Means on the       conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to include       this letter and your response in the bill reports and the       Congressional Record.        Thank you for your consideration of my request and for the       extraordinary cooperation shown by you and your staff over       matters of shared jurisdiction. I look forward to further       opportunities to work with you this Congress.            Sincerely,                                                        Greg Walden      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                       Washington, DC, June 8, 2018.

The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       that fall within our jurisdiction. The Committee also       reserves the right to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House-Senate conference involving       this or similar legislation and requests your support for       such a request.        Finally, I would appreciate your commitment to include this       exchange of letters in the bill reports and the Congressional       Record.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
