 Madam President, first, this morning I want to  associate myself with a statement made yesterday by one of our  distinguished colleagues about the House Democrats treating impeachment  like a political toy. Here is what the Senator said: ``If it's serious  and urgent, send them over. If it isn't, don't.'' That was our  Democratic colleague, the senior Senator from California, the ranking  member of the Judiciary Committee. She wasn't alone.   ``It's time to get on with it.'' That is our Democratic colleague the  junior Senator from Delaware.   ``At some point, it's appropriate to send them and pass the baton to  Senators.'' That is our Democratic colleague, the senior Senator from  Connecticut.   ``I think the time has past. She should send the articles.'' That is  our Democratic colleague the junior Senator from Connecticut.   Now, this is a challenging time to create bipartisan agreement in the  Senate on any subject, but the Speaker of the House has managed to do  the impossible. She has created this growing bipartisan unity here in  the Senate in opposition to her own reckless behavior.   The Senators may not agree on much, but it appears most of us still  recognize the threat to our institution when we see one. Article I,  section 3, says: ``The Senate shall have the sole power to try all  impeachments''--period.   The House can begin the process, and Speaker Pelosi's majority has  certainly done that, but the Senate alone can resolve it. Yet, for  weeks now, the House majority has blocked the Senate from fulfilling  our constitutional duty. In a precedent-breaking display of  partisanship, the Speaker has refused to let her own allegations  proceed normally to trial unless she gets to hand-design various  elements of our Senate process. In other words, the House Democrats  already spent 12 weeks undermining the institution of the Presidency  with a historically unfair and subjective impeachment, and now, for a  sequel, they have come after the institution of the Senate as well.  That is where we are.   The dwindling number of our Senate Democratic colleagues who remain  complicit in this must realize what they are doing. Should future House  majorities feel empowered to waste our time with junior varsity  political hostage situations? Should future Speakers be permitted to  conjure up this sword of Damocles at will and leave it hanging over the  Senate unless we do what they say? Of course not.   This week, a majority of the Senate stepped forward to make it  perfectly clear that this conversation is over. A majority of this body  has said definitively that we are not ceding our constitutional  authority to the partisan designs of the Speaker. We will not let  [[Page S100]]  the House extend its precedent-breaking spree over here to our Chamber.   There will be no unfair new rule book written solely for President  Trump. The basic organization of the first phase of this trial will  track the phase one of the Clinton trial, which all 100 Senators voted  for in 1999. I have said for months that this is our preferred route.   By the way, that is exactly what the American people want. Seventy- seven percent told a Harvard-Harris survey that the basic outline of a  Clinton trial, reserving the witness question until later in the  proceedings, ought to be good enough for this President as well. Fair  is fair. In the same survey, 58 percent of Americans said they want  Speaker Pelosi to do her job and send the articles to the Senate rather  than continue delaying.   It makes sense that American families have lost patience with this  act just like we Senators have lost patience with it because this is  not just some intramural tiff between the two Houses in our bicameral  legislature. This recklessness affects our entire country.   When you take a step back, what has really happened over the last 3  weeks? What has happened? When you take a step back from the political  noise and the pundits discussing ``leverage''--by the way, that never  existed--what have House Democrats actually done?   This is what they have done. They have initiated one of the most  grave and most unsettling processes in our Constitution and then  refused to allow a resolution of it. The Speaker began something that  she herself predicted would be ``so divisive to the country,'' and now  she is unilaterally saying it cannot move forward to resolution.   It is bad enough that House Democrats gave in to the temptation of  subjective impeachment that every previous House for 230 years has  managed to resist. However unwise, that is their constitutional  prerogative. They get to start it, if they choose, but they do not get  to declare that it can never be finished. They do not get to trap our  entire country into an unending ``Groundhog Day'' of impeachment  without resolution.   Alexander Hamilton specifically warned against a procrastinated  resolution of impeachments. In part, that is because our duly-elected  President deserves a verdict, just like every American who is accused  by their government deserves a speedy trial.   This goes deeper than fairness to one individual. This is about what  is fair to the entire country. There is a reason why the Framers did  not contemplate a permanently unsettled Presidency. That is true under  any circumstances, but consider especially the circumstances of recent  days. Even as the Democrats have prolonged this game, we have seen Iran  escalate tensions with our Nation. We live in a dangerous world.   So, yes, the House majority can create this temporary cloud over a  Commander in Chief if they choose--if they choose--but they do not get  to keep the cloud in place forever. Look, there is real business for  the American people that the Senate needs to complete. If the Speaker  continues to refuse to take her own accusations to trial, the Senate  will move forward next week with the business of our people. We will  operate on the assumption that House Democrats are too embarrassed--too  embarrassed--to ever move forward, and we will get back to the people's  business.   For example, the Senate continues to process President Trump's  landmark trade deal, the USMCA, through our committees of jurisdiction.  It passed the Senate Finance Committee this week by a landslide vote of  25 to 3, a major victory for the President and for working families.  Now our other committees will continue their consideration.   And there is more. The epidemic of opioids, fentanyl, and other  substance abuse continues to plague our Nation. Some colleagues have  signaled they may raise privileged resolutions on war powers. The  Senate has plenty of serious work to do for our country. So while the  Speaker continues her irresponsible games, we will continue doing the  people's business.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 498.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following nominations:  Executive Calendar Nos. 541, 542 and 552.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  vote on the nominations en bloc with no intervening action or debate;  that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table en bloc; that the President be immediately notified  of the Senate's action; that no further motions be in order; and that  any statements related to the nominations be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, as my good friend Carter Hendricks  prepares to end his service as the mayor of Hopkinsville, he certainly  has a lot to show for his years of leadership in Southwestern Kentucky.  He has helped the region take full advantage of its great potential,  and I know I join his friends and constituents in expressing our  gratitude. Today, I would like to honor this remarkable Kentuckian and  wish him well as he embarks on his next chapter.   When he was first elected in 2014, Carter made headlines for becoming  the second youngest mayor in Hopkinsville's two centuries of history.  The local newspaper, the highly regarded Kentucky New Era, also  reported that Carter was only the city's second Republican mayor. He  quickly mobilized the city's administration with a bold strategy to  make Hopkinsville an attractive destination for economic development.  His flagship initiative, called ``Hoptown WINS,'' was a nearly $15  million capital campaign involving downtown improvements, as well as  new parks, a sports complex, and a visitors center. These state-of-the- art amenities are meant to help draw investment and good jobs into  Hopkinsville and the surrounding areas. Now halfway through his second  term, Carter and his constituents are beginning to see the positive  results of his leadership. His vision of Hopkinsville's bright future  is helping to create the conditions for growth and prosperity.   Carter had been encouraging economic growth in the region long before  he first stepped foot into the mayor's office. For nearly a decade,  Carter worked in senior positions at the Christian County Chamber of  Commerce, including 4 years as its president and CEO. With local  leaders and the business community, he helped develop creative  solutions to the county's challenges.   I have had the great privilege to work with Carter in both of these  capacities. When I heard the area's lack of access to a Federal  interstate was obstructing business investment, Carter and I teamed up  to find a solution. In 2017, Senator Rand Paul and I secured the  designation of a nearby section of the Edward T. Breathitt Pennyrile  Parkway as Interstate 169. When President Trump signed our provision  into law, he helped connect Christian County to the Federal interstate  system and bolstered Carter's efforts to encourage growth in the area.   We also partnered to support the brave men and women stationed at  Fort Campbell in Christian County. The installation is part of  Kentucky's critical role in our national defense structure, and the  local community takes seriously its responsibility to support Fort  Campbell's mission and the servicemembers stationed there. During his  time with the chamber, Carter led the business community's efforts to  be strong and supportive neighbors. Together, we wanted to welcome  [[Page S120]]  all members of the military and their families to Kentucky, make them  feel at home, and help them prosper in this community.   Carter said he didn't take the decision to leave the mayor's office  lightly. When the chance to lead the South Western Kentucky Economic  Development Council became available, however, he leapt at the  opportunity. Formed in 2012, the organization represents Christian,  Todd, and Trigg Counties and engages with job creators looking for  their new home. Carter admits the job will present new challenges, but  I am confident he will bring the same knowledge, determination, and  high energy that has led to so much success.   Although the city will certainly miss Carter's daily leadership, he  said, ``I'm not leaving the team--if anything I'm just in a slightly  different position.'' At the economic development council, Carter will  continue supporting the city's efforts and continue working toward the  same goal. He is certainly lucky to have a proud cheering section in  his wife Faye and their two children. I would like to thank Carter for  his constant dedication to creating opportunities for families in West  Kentucky and to congratulate him on his great achievements. I hope my  Senate colleagues will join me in commending this talented Kentuckian  for his leadership and service and in extending our best wishes as he  steps into a new role.   Mr. President, the Kentucky New Era in Hopkinsville recently  published a profile of Carter's distinguished service. I ask unanimous  consent that the article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                 [From the Kentucky New Era, Jan. 7, 2020]             Hendricks Shares Why He Pursued Position With EDC                           (By Zirconia Alleyne)         Hopkinsville Mayor Carter Hendricks announced Monday       afternoon that he will resign in order to accept the       executive director position with the South Western Kentucky       Economic Development Council.        His official resignation letter and date were not released       as of press time Monday.        Hendricks, who is in his second term as mayor, called a       meeting with city staff at the same time the SWKEDC met       across town Monday to determine he was the best candidate for       the role left vacant in November when Mark Lindsey resigned.        The Kentucky New Era broke the news shortly after the EDC       came out of closed session.        Hendricks had just wrapped his meeting with staff telling       them he was a candidate and would accept the position if       offered. He said he didn't know going into the meeting       knowing that he was selected, although there had been chatter       on social media throughout the weekend.        ``I went out on a limb by having that meeting, knowing that       I could have had egg on my face if it didn't go the way I was       praying for it to go,'' he said. ``But, that's the risk you       take sometimes.''        Why he applied?        Hendricks, who served as the executive director of the       Christian County Chamber of Commerce from 2010 to 2013, said       he has always been interested in economic development and       thought about pursuing the position with the regional EDC in       2017 when Lindsey was ultimately named the director.        ``There's been a couple other times I was interested in       that position, but the timing never felt right,'' Hendricks       said. ``The reason I was willing to step forward now and show       interest is because I have a passion for it, I believe I have       a skillset for it and I know I have experience in it. It was       inevitable that I would be looking for something different in       the next two to two and a half years, and I cannot afford to       wait until the next opportunity arises.''        Hendricks said he expected Lindsey to be in the position       for five to seven years like national trends show, and he       hoped to apply once his second term in office was done.        However, when the opportunity arose again in November,       Hendricks said he expressed interest. He went on to say he       had no contact with the EDC board members after his interview       in December, except the board chair to ask about the hiring       process.        The South Western Kentucky Economic Development Council was       formed in 2012 through a merger of the Todd County Industrial       Foundation with the Christian County Economic Development       Council, according to New Era archives. In May 2014, the       Cadiz-Trigg County Economic Development Commission joined       forces with the two.        The executive director works to recruit businesses and       industry to the tri-county region. Hendricks said the new job       will be a challenge, but he's up for it.        ``A lot of my dad's family is from Trigg County . . . and       I've got great working relationships with the mayors and       judge executives, and I've worked hard to maintain those       relationships,'' Hendricks said. ``I'm still going to have to       learn more about Todd County and Trigg County, but I'm eager       to do that.''                       Steps to appointing a new mayor         According to KRS 83A.040, Hendricks must submit a formal       resignation letter with his final date before the process to       appoint an interim mayor can begin.        The statute explains that his resignation shall be       effective at the next regular or special meeting of city       council after the date specified in his letter of       resignation. City council will then have 30 days to fill the       vacancy with an interim mayor.        The statute goes on to explain that the interim mayor can       serve until the next succeeding annual election, at which       time the vacancy will be filled by election for the remainder       of the term. The next general election is in November.        The mayor's assistant, Idalia Luna, is leaving at the end       of January for her new role with the city as executive       director of the Human Rights Commission. The mayor said he       didn't look for her replacement because the next mayor should       choose the person for that role.        ``I intentionally didn't fill that role until I knew how       this would turn out,'' Hendricks said.        Of the empty mayor's office that will be left, Hendricks       said the staff is equipped to keep the city afloat. ``People       like to believe that the mayor is the one running the city,       but if you're doing your job correctly, the credit is to       these city employees,'' he said.        ``I care a lot about this team,'' he continued. ``I spent       five years with them and had a heart attack with them--and I       don't say that lightly. This team rallied around me and they       showed up--they showed up in the hospital, they sent cards       and notes. They'll be my family no matter what role I'm in as       long as I'm in this community. They're good people.''                          Hendricks' time in office         Hendricks was elected for his first term as mayor of       Hopkinsville in November 2014. According to New Era archives,       Hendricks became only the second Republican mayor in the       city's history. Herb Hays was the first when he was elected       in 1985 and died in office in 1987.        Hendricks said he wouldn't trade his time as mayor for       anything, but he acknowledged that it was a tough job.        When asked about the stress of being mayor, Hendricks said       he believes a variety of things contributed to his heart       attack on Christmas Eve 2016.        ``When I first had the health scare, I was running on the       greenway, so it's not that I wasn't a healthy person,'' he       said. ``. . . More than anything it was genetic. My dad       passed away at 64 from heart disease and had his first heart       attack at 46.        ``Sure, I have to believe that some of the pressure and       stress of this job contributed to (my heart attack),'' he       recalled. ``At the time, we were really working on the WINS       initiative to get it approved, and I'm a pretty Type A       personality when I believe in something . . . those types of       characteristics combined with genetics and too many Dr.       Peppers contributed to a heart attack when I was 43.''        Hendricks' Hoptown WINS initiative, an acronym for       Wellness, Infrastructure and Neighborhood, was a major part       of his first term. The $14.8 million in capital projects came       to fruition through a tax increase voted on by city council.       The result? The construction of the Planters Bank-Jennie       Stuart Health Sportsplex, a series of downtown improvements,       extensions to the Hopkinsville Rail Trail greenway system,       two neighborhood parks, the completion of the visitor's       center on East Ninth Street and more sidewalks around town.        ``Everything we did in the Hoptown WINS initiative had       economic development in mind,'' he said. ``If you look at       what economic developers and site planners will tell you,       there's about five things that are the most important       criteria for communities to be successful. One of those is       quality of place--walkability, performing arts facilities       like the Alhambra theatre, youth activities . . . those types       of things matter.        ``You have to be a desirable community for industries to       want to invest in you,'' he continued. ``Those are the types       of projects that industries and workers are looking for, so       nearly everything we've done has been to try to position our       self to take better advantage of economic development       opportunities.''        Hendricks said he had the support of his wife, Faye, and       their two children, Chase and Lily, when he pursued the       position. He also said he prayed.        ``I know that sounds cliche, but as a result of prayer and       speaking with the family, I decided to pursue this       opportunity knowing that it wasn't an ideal time,'' he said.       ``There isn't an ideal timeline when you're serving in an       elected position and thinking about what you're going to do       next.''        Hendricks said he has no plans to leave his hometown       anytime soon and he doesn't plan to run for any other elected       positions. For now, Hendricks said he hopes to make positive       change in the community through his new role at the EDC.        ``What I hope people will see after it's all said and done       is . . . I'm not leaving the team--if anything I'm just in a       slightly different position of the team,'' he said. ``If you       think I've been the quarterback, I'm now the wide receiver,       and my job as this wide receiver is to go deep and score       touchdowns and recruit business and industries that will help       this community grow and provide more opportunities for       families.''  [[Page S121]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, at the beginning of a new year, most of  us look ahead with plans, expectations, and resolutions. The residents  of Monroe County in the Pennyroyal region of South Central Kentucky,  however, are spending the first days of the new year looking back on  their unique history. They are looking two centuries back, in fact, to  the county's founding in 1820. I would like to join with these  Kentuckians in kicking off a year of bicentennial celebrations of the  county's blessings and its rich heritage.   At its founding, local leaders looked to Presidential leadership when  selecting the name for the county and its seat. President James Monroe  was honored with the county's name while his Vice President, Daniel  Tompkins, was the inspiration for the county seat's name,  Tompkinsville.   Early Monroe County residents took advantage of the area's fertile  soil and its close proximity to the Cumberland and Barren Rivers. In  this beautiful setting, they began developing deep agricultural roots  with livestock and staple crops like tobacco and hemp.   Like many Kentucky counties, Monroe's early economic development was  stunted during the Civil War. Many local residents joined the war  effort, and support for the Union led to the establishment of Camp  Anderson and the raising of the 9th Kentucky Infantry. Unfortunately,  Monroe County's location on the Kentucky-Tennessee border also caused  multiple invasions by both Union and Confederate forces throughout the  war. During one of these raids, a Confederate unit captured  Tompkinsville and burned much of the town, including the courthouse,  causing lasting devastation.   Although the local economy was slow to rebound immediately after the  war, the new century helped Monroe County get back on track. Since that  time, families in the region have continued developing their rural  traditions while making important investments into new local  industries. A little over a decade ago, I was proud to partner with  local officials in Monroe County to deliver Federal funding for a new  water treatment facility, along with other upgrades. Together, we are  helping to encourage new opportunities for economic growth and good  jobs for Kentucky families.   In addition, I greatly enjoy working with a proud son of  Tompkinsville, Congressman   James Comer, who is a strong champion for  his hometown and all of the First District of Kentucky here in  Washington.   The yearlong bicentennial celebration will feature a wide range of  Monroe County's history, as well as some of its local specialties. From  its famous barbecue to a Gospel music event, the festivities will  showcase the many talents of Monroe County families. They will also pay  tribute to local veterans, honoring the county's long and distinguished  record of contributing to our Nation's defense.   In celebrating their wonderful history, these Kentuckians are also  preparing to take advantage of their great potential ahead. With the  principled leadership of Congressman Comer, State Representative Bart  Rowland, County Judge/Executive Mitchell Page, and many other local  officials, Monroe County is well-positioned for a bright future. It has  been a privilege to help kick-off this bicentennial celebration, and I  ask my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating all the residents  of Monroe County on this milestone. Together, we look forward to many  more prosperous years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 2 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
