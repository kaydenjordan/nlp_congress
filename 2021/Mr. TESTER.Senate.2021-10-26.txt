 Madam President, I rise today to honor the life of  William ``Bud'' LaCounte, a distinguished Montanan and decorated  veteran of World War II.   While Bud is no longer with us, his legacy lives on. On behalf of  myself, my fellow Montanans, and all Americans, I would like extend our  deepest gratitude for his service to this Nation.   Bud's story is one of incredible courage and sacrifice, having  survived both American Indian Boarding School and D-day. Born in  Bainville, MT, where he now rests, he was a proud member of the Turtle  Mountain Tribe of Chippewa Indians. At the age of just 6, he endured  the unimaginable when was taken away from his parents and sent to Fort  Totten Indian School.   But his commitment to answering the call of duty never faded. And on  the eve of the Second World War, Bud enlisted in the U.S. Army. Not  long after he joined, Bud deployed to France and fought bravely in the  battle of Omaha Beach in Normandy on June 6, 1944.   After the war, he returned to Montana and settled into his life in  Billings as a loving husband, dedicated father and grandfather,  rancher, dancer, and storyteller. While he has since passed, his memory  and spirit lives on in each of us--in his stories, in his children and  grandchildren, and in his enduring service and sacrifice to this  Nation.   I now have the profound honor of presenting Bud's family with the  French Legion of Honor Medal for his bravery in the line of duty. This  medal serves as a small token of our country's appreciation for Bud's  incredible service and outstanding character.   Let us pay a final salute to Bud, who represents the very best of  this great country.                            ____________________
