 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman  from Alabama for yielding. I want to thank him for bringing this  amendment up.   Mr. Chairman, it is really important to make sure we understand what  we are talking about here. The Paris accord was engaged in for the  purpose of benefiting the global environment, for benefiting the global  environment and for reducing emissions, yet what has happened under the  agreement with the pledges that the nations have made is that the  United States, over the last several years, has actually reduced our  emissions by nearly a billion tons. China has actually increased theirs  by 4 billion tons.   This agreement is so disparate it doesn't make sense. The President  was right to withdraw.   But to distinguish, we can stay focused on the targets, the pledges,  but we should not codify, memorialize, agree, or in anyway comply with  this disparate approach where China can continue polluting the  environment.   Mr. Chairman, this is similar to a scenario where I get together with  a group of friends and I say, hey, we are going to have a savings club,  and we are all going to get together, and I am going put money into it,  and they are going come and take money out. That is not a savings club.  That is what is happening.   This is not benefiting the environment. The United States should not  participate, codify, or support this scenario where China is out there  more than increasing by the emissions reductions that the United States  is achieving.   We have had the greatest emissions reductions in the world, greater  than the next 11 countries combined, and we have done it without this  agreement.   I urge adoption of the amendment.
