 Madam Speaker, as co-chair of the Career and Technical  Education Caucus, I rise to recognize National CTE Month.   CTE programs, like those at the Genesis Center in my home State of  Rhode Island, show the promise of economic opportunities for CTE  students of all ages.   Cindy's story is a great example. She was unemployed when she  enrolled in the Genesis Center's Pharmacy Technician Pre-Apprenticeship  Program at CVS, and before she completed her training, Cindy was  offered a job. She then went on to get her Pharmacy 2 certificate, and  she currently holds a full-time position in the Lifespan Health System.   Cindy's story is just one of many CTE successes, and I am so proud to  honor her and the millions of other students and educators this month.   Madam Speaker, I am also pleased to recognize my good friend and CTE  Caucus co-chair, GT Thompson, for his leadership in advancing CTE  policy in Congress. GT's partnership has been absolutely invaluable,  and I look forward to continuing our work together this month and  beyond.                            ____________________
