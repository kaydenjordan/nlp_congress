 Mr. Speaker, we have a few issues that ought to be  debated on the floor and brought to the attention of the news media to  help them with articles that would educate the American public a little  bit on issues of importance.   I haven't spoken on Ukraine lately, but I will point out that  Congress has not received a briefing on what is going on in Ukraine  since December. That is way too long to go on the first significant  land war in Europe in over 70 years. I ask the Biden administration to  send its officials over to allow Members of Congress to at least get  their opinion as far as what is going on.   As I have said before, this war should not be that difficult to end.  Ukraine has the second lowest birthrate in the world. The Ukrainians,  who have such a shortage of young people, should be especially ready to  end this war. The Russians also have a low birthrate, and even prior to  the war a lot of young Russians were emigrating.   Over 2 years ago, before the war started, I was in San Diego, and in  the San Diego sector the Border Patrol and the immigration folks told  me during the prior 2 weeks or month or whatever, in that segment, only  in the San Diego segment, the second largest nationality to be crossing  into America was Russian. You have two countries with shortages of  people. It should be ripe for reaching some sort of settlement.   I think the United States is perceived to be, maybe rightfully so,  overly partisan in this war, but somehow we should be prodding the  Israelis or Turks or French or somebody to reach a conclusion here, for  one, on humanitarian terms. I mean, for whatever reason, it is hard to  find exact numbers of people who died in this war. I am old enough to  remember the Vietnam war. They could give you the number of Americans  who died right down to the individual digit, but for some reason you  get wildly different numbers on the number of people who have died in  this conflict.   However, either way, there are a significant number of people dying,  and the Biden administration should be looking for a way to wrap it up.  It wasn't that long ago that we seemed to have good relations with both  of these countries. The longer it drags on, the more we drive Russia  into the arms of China, which isn't in anybody's best interests, and it  is a little frustrating that we are not getting a rationalization by  the Biden administration why we wouldn't try to end this. The American  press maybe ought to spend a little bit of time asking the Biden  administration whether they feel there is any end to this war.   In any event, I call on the Biden administration to give us a new  update in the auditorium, and I call on the press corps to start  asking, is there any time when we are going to end this war.   The next issue I think I should bring up, because they keep talking  about it on the news without giving us any new information, is the  transgender situation. Usually when we talk about it, we talk about it  with regard to biological men going into the women's locker room or  biological men competing in women's sports.   However, I think a more significant question is: Why are there  apparently more transgender people now than during the rest of my life?  It seems to me the Europeans have reached the conclusion that one of  the reasons for this wave of transgenderism is, people keep talking  about it on TV and in academic settings. The more one talks about it,  the more people begin to think that this is perhaps the route they  should go.   I talked to someone about a month ago, 6 weeks ago, who, I guess I  will call a recovering transgender, a woman, who now regrets it. She  had the surgery, breasts removed at age 15, the whole ball of wax. It  is not something that would have occurred to her, but she found  something on the internet which informed her that maybe the reason she  was unhappy is that she really was a boy. She went down the path. She  went to the gender reassignment doctors, who apparently make a living  on this. They talked her into the idea that, yes, the reason she was an  unhappy little 13-year-old girl is because she was really a boy. She  went through testosterone treatments, puberty blockers, and eventually  even had her breasts cut out, which is a true tragedy, and now she  regrets it.                                time  2000    I think the thing we ought to take out of it--and I have read this in  another places, as well--people who are--  [[Page H4023]]  nobody should ever be mean or that sort of thing, but people who are  overly solicitous or overly accepting of this transgender lifestyle  wind up encouraging more people, other people to adapt this lifestyle.   Every study out there shows these people wind up very, very, very  unhappy and miserable, and sometimes even wind up committing suicide.  So I would hope that the American press corps would put a new narrative  out there rather than just persuading people that this is all a  positive development.   They ought to take about where people wind up who wind up going  through the surgery. They ought to spend a little bit of time talking  about why it appears there are so many more transgender people today  than there were 30 years ago, and the answer is obvious. It is  presented favorably as a lifestyle for a lot of young people, and when  it is presented favorably, a number of young people get on the  internet, read about it, decide to adapt this lifestyle, which is  obviously only going to lead to misery and which does lead into misery.   I would ask the press corps to be a little bit more open-minded or  publish a little bit more as to why we seem to have more transgenders  than the pass. Is it like the Europeans have discovered, a matter of  the more we talk about it the more we have people like this.   Maybe then we will realize that the goal should not be to have  dramatic surgeries on young people's bodies. The goal should be on  pushing this kind of to the side and not have so many people adapt the  transgender lifestyle in the first place.   The next topic I am going to take up, which we haven't taken up this  session, but I think should be taken up next session or sometime in the  near future because it has such a big influence on America is that of  the breakdown of the family and the lack of fathers in homes, which is  bad, not only for the children, but it is bad for the father, as well.   In the 1960s, in which I think it was maybe the biggest domestic  policy blunder in this country's history, under Lyndon Johnson, tons of  money was aimed at families with children, but because the percent of  poverty was determined by your income level as a practical matter, this  money was conditioned upon not having a man in the household.   In other words, if you had mother and father both working in the  household, by definition, they were not in poverty. But if father was  somewhere else and mother was alone, say, with two or three kids, and  mother did not have a job, she was considered in poverty.   This program said that if you are in poverty, or the programs, the  Great Society, as it was called then--they should have called it the  war on marriage--under the war on marriage, people who did not get  married were given free housing at the time. So then they dialed back a  little, given a check. They were given free food. They could be given  free education. They would be given free medical care and given all  these free things.   Basically what they did is they set up the family without a dad as a  self-contained unit. Only 7 percent of the births in the United States  at the beginning of the sixties were born without a mother and a father  in the home. Now, we are over 40 percent.   I think, well, there are parents of all backgrounds doing yeoman's  work, doing a tremendous job raising their children, and we don't want  to denigrate them at all.   But the statistics would show that whether you are looking at crime  rates or educational achievement, depression, children, in general, are  happier with both parents in the home because not everybody is up to  raising kids in that environment.   You would have to be blind not to realize the reason we have gone  from 7 percent to over 40 percent is the great society and all these  programs in which to get benefits, or you do get benefits if both  parents are not around, and almost always that means the man is not  around.   Other programs like earned income tax credit, which was, I think, not  a very good program thought up by the Republicans and Jack Kemp, were  also conditioned upon getting the check. You don't want to have two  parents working in the household.   I would hope that we would do a subcommittee or something on this  problem, get back to the good old days where depression and youth  suicide was less than it is today, drug use a fraction of what it is  today and, in order to do that, we have to change the incentives that  were put into place by Lyndon Johnson.   This, by the way, was known by the end of the 1960s. I hate to cite  this study because it is so overcited, but Patrick Moynihan, by the  late sixties, had pointed out what a disaster it was to have incentives  in which the father wasn't in the home. So this is not new things I am  talking about today.   We knew this was a mistake by 1967, by 1968, by 1969, but Congress,  either because they did not have the will, or because there is a  radical element that Black Lives Matter represents, in which an  element, a Marxist element wants to get rid of what they call the  western prescribed nuclear family, and this is certainly a way to do  it, but, for whatever reason, we have not adequately changed incentives  in the 1960s.   Made a little think to the right direction under Newt Gingrich and  Bill Clinton in the 1990s, but since then it has all been downhill. I  think we have to ask ourselves, was it a good idea to do all we could  to set up the single parent as the sole parent in a child's life.   I realize this is little bit different than a divorce situation, a  little bit different than a widow situation, but there is no question  there has been a dramatic decrease in the number of men in children's  lives beginning in the 1960s.   I want to point to something else, too, about this issue that a lot  of times people don't take into account. This is something that George  Gilder, who was a great sociologist--he is still alive today--but he  wrote a book called ``Wealth and Poverty'' in 1980. At the time Ronald  Reagan was sworn in, the book received a lot of positive press at that  time. It has now been forgotten.    What Gilder pointed out is not only are two parents important for the  child but it is also important for the man because a lot of times the  man's self-worth comes from--just like the woman's self-worth--comes  from raising children. It is the most important thing in life.   As a result of all these welfare programs in the 1960s, you have a  lot of families without men in the household; the man had no purpose.  This is why I think you see so much crime lately, so much drug abuse,  because I think a lot of these men who were supposed to get self-worth  out of children have kind of been kicked out of their home. If they  actually did try to work and support their family, they may be  materially less well off, or their children would be materially less  well off than if dad wasn't around at all.   Like I said, that goes for all the different benefits. There is a  benefit called section 42 housing in which people taking advantage of  section 42 housing, not only do you have to be in poverty to get it,  but section 42 housing is frequently superior in quality to what people  who are not on government programs get.   Because section 42 housing is usually very new housing because the  government pays for so much of the housing or to build the housing,  people build section 42 low-income housing nicer than regular old  apartments that are being built now; but that would be an example of a  bad program that has bad results.   The next topic that I would like to take up, the final topic, which I  seem to address every week, but I think we should address again,  because every one of these appropriation bills that comes before this  place is subject to debate, either on this floor or in the Rules  Committee, with regard to diversity, equity, and inclusion.   This country has, for the last 50 years, at least with regard to  universities--it looks like it is going to end or to a degree end  because of a recent court decision. For 50 years, we have had programs  designed to hire people or promote people or fire people or let people  into colleges and universities or give businesses government contracts  based on people's race and gender too.   There are two rationalizations for this, but the press never spends  any time determining whether these rationalizations are right or wrong.  One  [[Page H4024]]  rationalization is that certain groups of people were discriminated  against all the way back to slavery days, and, more recently, Jim Crow,  that sort of thing.   The other rationalization is that in a workplace setting, diversity  is a good thing and that we should, therefore, force or mandate  businesses to hire people based on where their ancestors came from 200  years ago.   First of all, the idea that we owe people something--when you look at  the people who are beneficiaries of these programs, many of them do not  have any ancestors who were in America prior to the institution of  these programs.   If somebody, say, who is Black from Jamaica immigrates to the United  States in 1965, after Jim Crow ended, well after slavery, is there any  reason why that person should receive preference?   Recently, the Biden administration has tried to give preferences to  what they call North African or Middle Eastern people. So if I come  here from Egypt or Syria or Algeria today, and I am not even a citizen,  according to the Biden administration, we should make sure--kind of  weigh in on companies, universities I think they would like to weigh in  on admissions, and make sure we give preferences to people from Algeria  or Syria who are not even in this country yet.   I don't know why we don't have that debate. We also ought to have a  debate whether we ought to add a new so-called minority group of North  Africans and Middle Easterners.   With regard to diversity, I think we also have a problem. I guess the  idea behind diversity is a pure racist would say that someone's view of  the world or the way they tackle a job is going to be dependent upon  where their great-great-great-great-grandparents came from.   Now, I reject that idea. The idea that if I were to--I am not--but  the idea that if I had a great-grandparent who was born in Peru, I  would have a different view of the world than my next-door neighbor  whose great-grandparents were from Germany. That is kind of a racist  thing on its face, but that is what the diversity argument boils down  to, that we should look at people, not on their viewpoint today, not on  their personal experiences to this point in life.   If we have two people who both grew up in Chevy Chase, Maryland, in  houses next to each other, and one was one-quarter Mexican and one  wasn't Mexican, that they would carry different viewpoints into the  workplace, and it was important to get both viewpoints, even though,  perhaps the person from Latin America had never been to a Latin  American country in their life.   But the idea behind this program--and, by the way, you self-identify  as to what your group is--the idea behind the program is it is  important to get the viewpoint of somebody whose grandfather or great- grandfather happened to be from a different country. Again, even though  in the case, say, of a Latin American, people would not even know that  that is true.   But this is a rationalization used for these rather high-handed  programs that, as a practical matter, causes both the government people  who are hiring and the businesses who do business with the government  to hire based on ancestry.                                time  2015    I want to point out that I was actually talking to somebody from  India today--of Indian ancestry. He wondered about this program because  he was from India, and in India there are many different subgroups that  sometimes don't get along. He thought the United States was alone in  that we got along so well and it was such a wonderful thing we have  going here, why in the world with us getting along so well would we try  to duplicate countries like Nigeria or Sri Lanka or Iraq? Why would we  try to duplicate what they are doing in other countries where the  elections are contests between ethnic groups? These diversity, equity,  and inclusion programs are designed to cause people not to view  themselves as an American but view themselves as a Cuban American or a  Mexican American or an Asian American or a Pacific Islander.   In other words, they are going to view themselves when they vote and  at other times as a representative of where their ancestors came from  perhaps even decades, if not, centuries ago.   I am afraid one of the reasons for these programs I ran across  recently, I heard of someone who--I don't really like the phrase, but  would today be considered by people who are proponents of these  programs as a person of color--and this person, because they were from  south of the border, their employer, once they asked them where their  ancestry was--before I was in an elected position, the places that I  worked, we never asked people where their ancestry was, but nowadays we  ask them--and this large employer decided to hold breakout groups of  people based on their ethnicity.   We are going to have the Black group meet over there and the Hispanic  group meet over there and the Asian group meet over there, and what  happened is the diversity consultant--an occupation which shouldn't  exist in America, by the way--the diversity consultant tried to tell  this person that they were put upon and how they should think because  they had an ancestor from south of the border.   Now think how ridiculous that is. This person, who was just a fine,  regular American never viewed themselves any different from anybody  else, is being told because of where their ancestors came from, south  of the border, that they ought to have certain beliefs, including  certain political beliefs, which I think is the reason why the Biden  administration is pushing this sort of thing.   They want to tell people that if you are from Mexico or you are from  Colombia or you are from Nigeria or you are from India that you are put  upon and that you ought to have certain political beliefs.   It is better to cut this thing right away. We have a shortage of  people, workers in this country. The idea that we have people going to  college to be diversity experts is appalling. I am glad my colleagues  again and again are trying to take these diversity, equity, and  inclusion bureaucrats out of the Federal bureaucracy, but there are way  too many of them in the bureaucracy of individual big businesses around  the country. It is the wimps who run these big businesses who feel that  they have to kowtow to the diversity lobby, the special interest group,  and they are instituting these programs by themselves.   I think it is time we had a public discussion here as to whether this  whole diversity, equity, inclusion thing makes any sense. I can go  through topics that should be brought up by talk show hosts, by service  clubs, what have you.   Should we identify people by where their ancestors came from? If they  self-identify, should we be identifying people by where their great- grandmother or great-grandfather came from? That is an interesting  question.   If we are going to give preferences based upon where your great- great-grandfather is from, should we see if there is any true diversity  there before you say you should take my contract ahead of the other  guy's contract or you should hire me ahead of the other guy? Tell us  what you bring to the table because your great-great-grandmother was  from Mexico. How do you think different than the other guy?   Let's have that discussion. We are not having that discussion.   Should you, again, be able to self-identify? If I am seven-eighths  German and one-eighth Mexican, is it right that on the form I can put  down that I am a Mexican and I should be able to say I bring the view  of Mexican Americans to my engineering firm?   They can also talk about, in certain jobs, what is the benefit of  diversity? If we are talking about an engineering job, is the way I  engineer the building of a bridge any different because I am one- quarter Mexican? That doesn't make any sense, but that is the position  of the people who push these programs.   Let's have a discussion on that. Another discussion is, before we get  this divisiveness going on forever, how long is this going to happen?  This began in earnest--I think under John Kennedy, but it really began  in earnest under Lyndon Johnson in 1965 and at the time I am sure  nobody in a million years dreamed that we would still have this stuff  almost 67 years later.  [[Page H4025]]    Should we have a discussion? How long are we going to do this? Again,  let's have a discussion. If part of this is supposed to be a way to  make up for past sins, why are we giving benefits here to people who  may not even be citizens yet? Why are we giving benefits to people who  just moved here from Syria? Should that be considered a different sort  of person subject to benefits?   Let's have a discussion there.   In any event, I hope as we write more and more about the Supreme  Court case and preferences in college admissions, I hope people begin  to ask some of these questions as to whether or not they make any sense  at all whatsoever.   I leave here hoping that our news media and this Congress spend a  little more time updating themselves on what is going on in Ukraine. I  hope they spend a little bit more time wondering as to whether we have  this transgender crisis even a little bit. Just because we talk about  it, if we weren't talking about it so much, we would have a fraction of  the number of transgenders in the first place.    I think we should spend some time looking at the premise that the  diversity, equity, and inclusion is built upon and answering questions  like, should we be adding Egyptians and Syrians to the mix? Should I be  able to label myself a minority if I am one-quarter a minority? Should  I be able to label myself picked upon if my parents have given me $5  million?   These are questions that should be asked on the diversity level. I  think we should be asking is it time to stop government programs which  have resulted in an increase in fatherlessness from 7 to 40 percent,  programs I think which hurt people, and particularly hurt men, have  been around since the 1960s. There is no reason for these programs to  continue forever.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
