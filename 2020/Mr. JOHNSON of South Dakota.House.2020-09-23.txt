 Mr. Speaker, my friend, Mike Tobin, is  retiring. Mike and I met through LifeQuest, which serves people with  developmental disabilities. Mike has been on the board and he receives  support from LifeQuest.   Now, he is a Minnesota Twins and a Kansas Jayhawks fan, just like I  am, but he serves as a role model to me.   Mike has always been a hard worker, whether at Pizza Ranch or Elixir  or anywhere else. He is a good person, always with a smile on his face,  treating people warmly and with respect.   He is honest. A few years ago, Mike found $300 in cash in an envelope  on the street, and of course, he would turn it over to the police.   So congratulations, Mike, on your 65th birthday and on your  retirement.   Thank you for showing me and everyone else how to properly live life.                            ____________________
