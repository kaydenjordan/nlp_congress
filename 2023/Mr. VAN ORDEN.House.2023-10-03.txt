 Madam Speaker, I rise today to do a little truth  telling.   I rise today as a proud member of the silent majority of United  States citizens and the super majority of the Republican Party of this  august House.   I will be plain. The motion to vacate the speakership is a fool's  errand, and I can think of no greater leader in that effort than my  colleague from the State of Florida.   The American people are concerned about crime. One of our colleagues  was carjacked at gunpoint a mile and a half from where I am speaking  today.   The border is open. There have been over 6 million illegal crossings  since Joe Biden has taken leadership, 232,972 illegal immigrants were  encountered on the southern border last night alone. That is a 27  percent increase from July.   The Customs and Border Patrol has seized over 25,000 pounds of  fentanyl this year. That is enough to kill every American citizen over  and over and over again.   Madam Speaker, 151 people on the terrorist watch list have been  apprehended on the southern border on Joe Biden's watch. We don't know  how many people who are plotting to destroy our Nation got across our  border. Yet, today, we will spend the people's time so that someone can  audition for a television show or possibly the Governorship of a State.   This is unacceptable, and the time for these antics are over.                            ____________________
