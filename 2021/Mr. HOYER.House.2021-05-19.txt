 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding, and I  thank the chairman for his work.   I have been here a long time. This is my 40th year in the Congress of  the United States. I came at the same time Ronald Reagan was elected  President of the United States. It was clearly a time of difference in  the House and in the country between Republicans and Democrats, but it  was also a time when, frankly, the   John Katkos of the Congress were  in the majority in the Republican Party. And by that I mean, Mr.  Speaker, people who wanted to work together to get results that, while  not perfect for either side, were good for the country.   So while I thank Mr. Thompson for the hard work he has done, I thank  Mr. Katko as well for doing what Americans expect us to do, to come  together, looking at a challenge to our country and to our people,  coming to a decision to resolve those challenges and those problems.   That is what Mr. Thompson and Mr. Katko have done. Indeed, I think  this is, in some ways, the best of days and, in some ways, the worst of  days because we have seen today two Republican leaders turn what ought  to be a nonpolitical issue, an issue with reference to a unique event,  not just a demonstration that has occurred.  [[Page H2587]]    I grew up in the 1960s. Whether it was civil rights or Vietnam, there  were a lot of demonstrations. But the Capitol of the United States was  not attacked. It was not invaded. It was not breached.   The work of the Congress of the United States was not stopped because  people were trying to get through the door, with some Members trying to  stop them who then said: These are just tourists.   It is sad because what the minority leader in the Senate and the  minority leader in the House said is exactly what Mr. Katko pointed  out. They wanted a commission that was even, as the 9/11 Commission was  even, so that both sides would have an equal voice.   What was the resolution that Mr. Thompson and Mr. Katko attained?  Equal division, equal voice. Not only equal voice in terms of numbers  but, for instance, one of the things that was controversial was about  subpoenas. Mr. Thompson and Mr. Katko arrived at a resolution that said  both sides have to agree, or alternatively, the committee can agree. In  light of the fact that the committee is evenly divided, it would  obviously have to be a bipartisan request for subpoenas.   Now, what we didn't agree on was the distraction and the dissembling.  Let's look at this corner; don't look here. Let's look at this corner;  don't look here. Let's look at that corner; don't look there. Don't  look at just the invasion, the insurrection that occurred on January 6;  look at everything else because maybe we can confuse the issue enough  that we will lose sight of the insurrection on January 6. We ought not  to do that.   I have been here a long time, but I also know the history of the  House, and I do not know of any other instance that is analogous to  January 6, not one.   In 1812, of course, there was a similar invasion, but it was from a  foreign enemy. It was not the enemy within. I said that on the floor  that morning as we finished the business of the House, notwithstanding  the insurrection.   Mr. Speaker, it is vital that Congress establish a bipartisan,  independent commission to investigate January 6, not some other date.  That does not absolve any wrongdoing anywhere at any time. But it says  that this unique insurrection is a danger to our democracy, not to  Republicans or Democrats, to our democracy, to our Congress, to the  people's House and the United States Senate, which was occupied. At  least this House was not occupied.   But Members were terrified, work was stopped, and democracy, for a  short period of time, was overtaken by armed, violent insurrectionists.   Certainly, each one of us ought to be very concerned about getting to  the bottom of why that happened. How did it happen? How can we stop it  from happening again? What are the resources that we need, and, yes,  who was responsible? Some, perhaps, are going to vote against this  because that is what they fear.   The 9/11 Commission, as Mr. Katko pointed out, made America safer. It  made this institution safer. It made our law enforcement more acutely  aware of the failures that led to 9/11. I hope this commission does the  same. I have talked to numerous Republicans who tell me they think it  was right that we focused on January 6. Don't be distracted. Don't  cover up or make it more lacking in clarity by trying to deal with  every problem that we may have. Focus on January 6.   Together, Mr. Katko and Mr. Thompson negotiated a bipartisan  agreement to move forward with such a commission based on input from  Democrats and Republicans. There are going to be a significant number  of Republicans who vote for this bill.   Unfortunately, the truth has been a victim over the last couple of  weeks. It was okay for Liz Cheney to tell the truth once, but when the  former President of the United States kept telling a lie, and she said  that is a lie each time that he said it, well, that was not  appropriate, so she was removed. But the truth was removed with her.  See no evil, hear no evil.    The commission, as a result of Ranking Member Katko's participation  in these discussions, will be equally composed, as I said. It will have  subpoena power that will be shared by both sides. I was pleased that we  reached a bipartisan agreement and sad for this institution, for this  country, for the American people who must think: Well, can't you agree  on anything?   The minority leader got what he asked for, yet he won't take yes for  an answer. Trump does not want this commission. That can be my only  explanation.   Throughout my career, both in the State senate for 12 years, as  president of the Senate, and here in this body for 40, I think I am  known on the other side of the aisle as somebody you can work with. I  hope that is the case because I think that is the way Americans want us  to work.   President Trump opposes this commission. I am not sure why. It is  deeply disappointing that there is a division among Republicans about  whether to support the ranking member who worked hard to get to this  place and got what the minority leader asked for, except for the  distraction, except for the dissembling. He didn't get that. But he got  everything else.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my Republican colleagues will think not about  their politics, not about the former President, not about themselves. I  hope they will think of the country, of this Congress, of this House.  As they do so, I hope they say to themselves: We will vote for this  legislation.   What if George Bush had said we shouldn't have a 9/11 Commission,  perhaps out of fear that somehow the administration would have been  perceived as being responsible for 9/11? They weren't. Wouldn't all of  us have said: What are you talking about that we are not going to have  a commission to see how we can protect the Capitol and why this Capitol  was stopped from doing the work of our democracy?   This legislation is going to pass. It is going to pass on a  bipartisan basis, and I want to thank Mr. Katko for having the courage  and the integrity to stand up, fighting for what the minority leader  asked for.   I say to Mr. Thompson that that is the funny thing about this. I hope  Senators will think long and hard about rejecting this bipartisan  compromise to move forward, to protect our democracy, and to lift it up  as the beacon that it has been and needs to be not only for our own  citizens but for all the world.   How sad that day was as the world watched, as TVs showed them  America's citadel of democracy and of freedom invaded by its own  citizens.   Vote ``yes.'' It is the right thing to do.                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.
