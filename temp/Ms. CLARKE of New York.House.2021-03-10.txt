 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Kentucky for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise once again in support of the American Rescue Plan  Act. This monumental and comprehensive legislation will bring a  sustained critical relief to the American people: $1,400 in the direct  payments to the most economically distressed Americans, cutting child  poverty in half, $26 billion for emergency rental assistance, and $7.25  billion in new money for the PPP program.   New York City was the outbreak epicenter of the virus. We experienced  unprecedented loss and economic devastation. But the American Rescue  Plan; Brooklyn, New York; and the Nation can look forward to a future  beyond devastating pandemic.   No amount of gaslighting, alternative facts, fear-mongering, and  conspiracy theories will fool the American people. President Biden and  the Democrats to the rescue.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New  York for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1446, the Enhanced  Background Checks Act of 2021.   Under current Federal law, unlicensed sellers can sell guns at gun  shows, online, and person to person without conducting any background  check on the purchaser. This loophole has dangerous consequences for  our communities. In fact, up to 80 percent of firearms used for  criminal purposes are obtained without a background check.   I am reminded of my time on the New York City Council where I  witnessed the murder of my colleague and dear friend, Councilman James  E. Davis.   Just earlier this week, a gunman opened fire on two police officers  in my district, hitting one officer in the chest and another in the  leg. Guns are not manufactured in Brooklyn, New York.   Time and time again we have been shaken to the core and heartbroken  by the news of another shooting in our communities that we call home.
