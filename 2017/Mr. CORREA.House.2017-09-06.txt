 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  3440, the DREAM Act, in honor of DREAMer Marine Corporal Jose Angel  Garibay, the first from Orange County to be killed in combat in the  Iraq Desert.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands that the gentleman  from Oklahoma has not yielded for that purpose; therefore, the  unanimous consent request cannot be entertained.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York  (Mr. Espaillat) for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment No. 73  which is included in this en bloc package. My amendment would seek to  allocate $10 million for additional K-9 teams for Customs and Border  Protection.                                time  2330    Many legal drugs that come into our country enter through our  Nation's port of entries. Last year, CBP seized 3.3 million pounds of  narcotics. Trained canine teams were keys to these successes. Yet when  it comes to canine teams, U.S. border authorities are severely  understaffed.   I thank my colleagues for including my amendment in this package.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 643, line 11, after the first dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $100,000,000)''.        Page 646, line 3, after the first dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $100,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from California (Mr. Correa) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, which  seeks to allocate $100 million to procure additional ships for our  Coast Guard to interdict drugs headed to the United States by sea.   Last year was a record-breaking year for the U.S. Coast Guard in its  fight against drug trafficking. It seized 416,000 pounds of cocaine  worth almost $6 billion. This was the result of more than 250  individual interdictions in the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and eastern  Pacific Ocean.   Even with this record-breaking year, however, all of the cocaine that  was seized represents less than 10 percent of all attempted shipments;  and, of course, cocaine interdictions, cocaine shipments, are on the  rise.   I do commend the men and women of the U.S. Coast Guard for the great  work they do to stop drug trafficking to our country, yet the Coast  Guard lacks the resources to stop the known drug shipments into our  mainland.                                time  0030    During a Homeland Security hearing this year, the U.S. Coast Guard  commandant admiral, and I paraphrase him, said: Last year there were  almost 600 events that we just did not have enough ships or enough  planes to track or stop them in the seas. The admiral said: There were  almost 600 shipments in the high seas. They knew these ships were  carrying drugs, yet we did not have the ships or the assets to stop  them.   Vice Admiral Charles Ray went further to say: We need more cutters on  the water to help us do our job.   The Coast Guard, like many other government agencies, has endured  tough budget situations over the years, and they need to replace and  add new ships to fulfill their drug interdiction mission. This $100  million would allow the Coast Guard to procure two additional fast- response cutters.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would say that, on the contrary, this  money, this allocation of $100 million, represents additional support  for our border security, our high seas.   Back in my district, like across the country, we have a major spike,  an increase, in drug overdoses, deaths as a result of drug overdoses.  Our children are being harmed by these drugs that are coming into our  country. Our Coast Guard, our admirals of the Coast Guard, are saying  this is where the chinks in the armor are in terms of our national  defense of our country, of our borders, the high seas. This is not  speculation; these are facts.   Ships are coming into our high seas loaded with drugs. We do not have  the assets to stop them. Nothing could be further from the truth. On  the contrary, this $100 million, an additional two ships for the Coast  Guard, represents tons and tons of drugs to be intercepted in the years  to come, billions and billions of dollars stopped before they reach our  land.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again I would say that those folks that are  piloting those ships full of drugs coming into our country do not  deserve the opportunity to reach our shores. We have to stop them in  the high seas.   Just a few months ago, the Coast Guard was proposed for budget cuts.  Now they are barely--barely--keeping balance, meaning no budget cuts.  All I want to do with this amendment is give them additional resources  to stop drug shipments, known drug shipments, on the high seas before  they reach our shores.   Mr. Chair, I don't want to go back to California and say that I am  not doing everything we can do to stop those drugs from reaching our  children.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Correa).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.   Mr CORREA. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California  will be postponed.                    Amendment No. 77 Offered by Mr. Hunter    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 77  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.
