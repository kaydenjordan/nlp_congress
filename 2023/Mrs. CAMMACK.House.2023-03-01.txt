 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Erin  Jackson, Joey Mantia, and Brittany Bowe, the three speed skaters from  Ocala, Florida, who represented the United States at the 2022 Winter  Olympics and brought home gold and bronze.   It is not every day that you see a winter sport like speed skating  coming out of the Sunshine State, so it really is a particular honor to  be able to stand here and recognize the Olympians from my very own  district.   To Erin, a gold medalist, and Joey and Brittany, both bronze  medalists, you have made Florida's Third Congressional District and the  United States so proud during the Olympics. Your hard work, dedication,  and commitment to the American values of independence and self- determination are certainly worthy of celebration. We cannot wait to  see what you will continue to accomplish in the future.   To the Ocala community and the coaches and parents who have helped  these amazing athletes get to the top of their game, thank you. Of  course, not only to Erin Jackson, Joey Mantia, and Brittany Bowe but to  the entire Team USA, thank you for proudly representing the United  States on the world stage and demonstrating to countries all over the  world what it means to be an American.   Go Team USA.                       Honoring the Life of Kevin Morse     Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate and honor  the life of a dear friend, Kevin Morse.   As a husband, father to three sons, and friend to many, Kevin was a  man loved by all. Whether you needed a mechanic, engineer, plumber,  electrician, therapist, priest, or even a hug, Kevin would be there in  an instant. He lived to help others.   Kevin was a family man through and through, and he loved his wife and  kids more than anything in the world. As he watched his three boys grow  up into young men, he supported them all in their endeavors, attending  every basketball game and cheering them on from the bleachers as loud  as he could.   Now, when I say cheer them on, I mean he would beat the hell out of  the banisters and railings with his cane. At the time, I was cheering  for Metro State and could hear his endless banging up in the stands  even while down on the floor. By the end of the game, there were more  dents and scratches on the cane and the entire area around him. It was  kind of his signature.   He was a role model for his boys, and he raised them to be kind,  smart, and selfless. He served as the spiritual leader for his family  and his community, exemplifying what it means to be a man of faith. He  was gentle, patient, faithful, and forgiving, all the qualities of a  man who you would want in a friend.   I have known Kevin for many years, and the impact that he had on my  life is something that cannot be explained in words.   To his family, friends, and anyone who was lucky enough to have known  Kevin, I extend my sincerest thoughts and prayers during this difficult  time.   I am honored to recognize Kevin Morse and his incredible legacy here  on the House floor.                  Honoring the Service of Logan Catalanotto     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a student from my  district, Logan Catalanotto.   I hope I got that right, Logan. If I butchered it, I am so sorry. But  thank you, Logan, for your meaningful contribution to our community.   At just 17 years old, and a senior at Forest High School in Ocala,  Logan decided to make his Eagle Scouts project an upgrade to the State  Flag Commons area of the Ocala-Marion Veterans Memorial Park.   His troop, Scout Troop 72 of Ocala, has held events at the park over  the last 2 years, and Logan decided to give back to the community by  beautifying the memorial park.   The project, being an estimated $32,000 worth of upgrades, is one  that you typically don't get to see from someone as young as Logan, a  project that he initiated.   His service to the veteran community has not gone unnoticed by the  citizens of Ocala, as many have expressed great gratitude toward Logan  for his dedication to the project.   It is acts of benevolence like these that truly restore faith in  America's young people to spread kindness and do the right thing.   I could not be prouder of Logan for being a driver of positive  change, generosity, and patriotism.   Thank you, Logan, for your service to the veteran community and to  Florida's Third Congressional District.     Honoring the Lives and Service of Sergeant Noel Ramirez and Deputy                           Sheriff Taylor Lindsey     Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate, remember,  [[Page H1004]]  and honor the lives of two heroes from North Florida, Sergeant Noel  Ramirez and Deputy Sheriff Taylor Lindsey of Gilchrist County.   It was on April 19, 2018, that these young men lost their lives as  they were attacked and fatally shot while on a lunch break in Trenton,  Florida. Beloved by their family, friends, law enforcement, and members  of the local community, the legacy that these public heroes leave  behind will not soon be forgotten by either myself or those whose lives  were impacted by their incredible kindness.   As we approach the fifth anniversary of their tragic deaths, we will  forever honor their memories by saying their names.   As the wife of a first responder myself, what happened to these two  men is something to which our law enforcement officers are no  strangers. I remember the day we lost these heroes and recall the  heartbreak when we learned the news.   On April 18, and on countless other days when we mark the deaths of  our law enforcement officers, my resolve to support our men and women  in blue grows stronger. Each year during National Police Week, I visit  Noel and Taylor's names at the National Law Enforcement Memorial in  Washington, D.C., and will continue to remember them and their  sacrifices, as well as their families, to remember all that they have  given to Gilchrist County and our surrounding areas.    Please join me in honoring their families and friends, as well as our  heroes in uniform across the Sunshine State and the Nation.                         Congratulating Reggie Brown     Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate a constituent of  mine, Reggie Brown, for his induction into the Florida Agricultural  Hall of Fame.   Born and raised on a family farm in Alachua County, Reggie's  expertise and work in the industry is undoubtedly worthy of this  prestigious honor.   He has held numerous roles during his career, including those at the  University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences,  better known as IFAS, the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association, and  the Florida Tomato Exchange, where he served as the executive vice  president.   Reggie has become a prominent leader within the Florida tomato  industry for his efforts to combat unfair trade practices and work  toward improved food safety and fresh produce worldwide.   He is a champion for the horticulture industry, leading on numerous  fronts to protect domestic producers, family farms. Now, his  achievements have become the benchmark for the development of national  product safety guidance.   I am so honored to be recognizing Mr. Reggie Brown before this  Congress. I thank him for all that he has done for Florida's farmers,  ranchers, and producers.   Congratulations, Reggie.                                time  1345                             Honoring Tom Howard     Madam Speaker, I rise to honor a constituent of mine,  Mr. Tom Howard, who recently was honored with the We Honor Veterans  Volunteer Service Award for his extraordinary commitment to the local  community.   A veteran himself, Tom joined the Marine Corps in 1966 and served in  Vietnam in 1966 and 1967 and currently serves as a veteran volunteer  with Hospice of Marion County in Ocala. He has faithfully volunteered  nearly 2,000 hours of service since joining the organization in 2010  and is known for his dependability, his selflessness, and his  commitment to his fellow men and women in uniform.   Over the past 12 years as a volunteer, Tom has served as a skillful  teacher and leader of 50-plus veteran volunteers and has attended and  participated in nearly 300 veteran recognition services.   Additionally, during COVID-19, Tom performed recognition ceremonies  by phone, standing in driveways, garages, and by open windows, to  ensure that every veteran received their honor despite not being able  to meet in person.   For these acts of service and so much more, the National Hospice and  Palliative Care Organization honored Tom this year with the We Honor  Veterans Volunteer Service Award.   Tom, through his military service and volunteer efforts with Hospice  of Marion County truly represents what it means to act as a proponent  of benevolence and kindness and embodies the American spirit of giving  back to one's country and community.   Thank you, Tom, for all that you have done for your veterans from  Florida's Third Congressional District. It is an honor to be able to  recognize you here on the House floor before this Congress.                         Remembering Allen Singleton     Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and honor the  life of a firefighter/paramedic from my district, Mr. Allen Singleton,  who sadly passed away in late January of this year.   Allen was a 6-year veteran firefighter who joined the ranks of Marion  County Fire Rescue on September 12, 2016, where he was a proud member  of the Rolling Greens Station number 28 and he was a member of the  local SWAT Medic team, just like my husband. Our community was truly  fortunate and blessed to have experienced his service, but more  importantly his heart, for others.   As the wife of a firefighter and first responder, I understand the  courage and sacrifice that it takes every day to do this job and know  the challenges that our heroes face while serving our community. Allen  will forever be remembered by his colleagues and the fire family for  the unforgettable difference that he made and the lives he touched  during his many years of service in Marion County.   To Allen's family, know that the entirety of Florida's Third  Congressional District stands with you and behind you during this  difficult time. Our thoughts and prayers are with his friends, family,  and the entire Marion County Fire Rescue team as our community mourns  this great loss.                      Honoring the Life of Tripp Wooten     Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my deepest  condolences and to honor the life of a firefighter paramedic from my  district, Mr. Tripp Wooten, who tragically passed away in early January  of this year.   Tripp was a 14-year veteran firefighter who joined the ranks of  Marion County Fire Rescue on December 15, 2006. Prior to his hiring,  Tripp was a member of the 2006 Marion County Fire Rescue Career Academy  class.   He was a loving husband, father, son, brother, uncle, and friend to  everyone he crossed paths with. He possessed a sense of humor that  brightened the days of all who came into contact with him.   As the wife of a firefighter and first responder, I understand the  courage and sacrifice it takes every day to do this job, and I know the  challenges that you face in serving our community. I am certain that  the positive impact that Tripp made on the Marion County community at  large will never be forgotten.   On behalf of Florida's Third Congressional District, our thoughts and  prayers are with his family, friends, and the entire Marion County Fire  Rescue family as we mourn his loss. Tripp will forever be remembered by  his colleagues and the fire station family for the unforgettable  difference he made and the lives he touched during his 16-plus years of  service.                    Honoring the Life of Nickolas Tilliman     Madam Speaker, I solemnly rise today to honor the life  of Mr. Nickolas Tilliman, a member of the Alachua County Sheriff's  Department, who tragically passed away last month.   Nick was a loyal servant and protector of our community, serving  Florida's Third Congressional District as a deputy in Alachua County  and our Nation through his military service. After completing high  school, Nick joined the United States Navy as a gunner's mate.  Following his Naval service, he joined the United States Army Reserves.  He joined the Alachua County Sheriff's office in 2018, and he was then  deployed to Afghanistan. It is safe to say, he had a heart for service.   Upon returning from deployment, he returned to his service with the  sheriff's office where colleagues will remember the memes that he was  known for, as he would brighten someone's day, or when he would share  with a smile and a laugh, not callous, his ``#thoughtsfromthethrone.''   We will miss Nick.  [[Page H1005]]    Our heroes in uniform display the utmost courage and selflessness,  risking their lives every day in pursuit of protecting and keeping our  communities safe. Nick is one of these heroes. On behalf of Florida's  Third Congressional District, our thoughts and prayers are with his  friends, family, and the ASO as our community mourns his loss.             Honoring Ansil Lewis as the 2022 Veteran of the Year     Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of Florida's  Third Congressional District to honor Mr. Ansil Lewis as our 2022  Veteran of the Year. Each year, our office gives this award to a  veteran who has exemplified the utmost courage, sacrifice, and  benevolence throughout our local communities.    Mr. Lewis served as a sergeant major in the United States Marine  Corps from 1987 to 2017. While serving, he received the Bronze Star,  Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal, Navy and Marine Corps  Achievement Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, Joint Meritorious Unit Award,  Navy Unit Commendation, and the Military Outstanding Volunteer Service  Medal. That is impressive.   After years of military service, Mr. Lewis has continued to show his  dedication to our community as the past commandant of the Roy S. Geiger  Marine Corps League Detachment 1047, a proud member of the board for  Operation Barnabas, and the president of the Veterans Council of Clay  County.   From his distinguished military service to his organization of dozens  of events for our Nation's heroes, I can't think of anyone more  deserving of this honor. It is a privilege to recognize Sergeant Major  Ansil Lewis before this body for his honorable service to our Nation  and our community, and I hope his volunteer spirit will continue for  many years to come as well as inspire those who follow.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire of the time remaining?    Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Jim  Painter, who passed away following an unforeseen complication during  his yearlong battle with cancer.   Jim was a third-generation brick mason who devoted his life to the  masonry industry in Gainesville, Florida. The first of many jobs the  Painter family would work on at the University of Florida, one of Jim's  family's first projects was working on Williamson Hall on the UF  campus.   Over the course of 40 years with Painter Masonry, Jim worked  alongside his father, Abe, and his brother, Jerry, to set the standard  for quality masonry for commercial, industrial, and institutional  buildings at the University of Florida and across north central  Florida.   From 1990 to 1996, Jim served as a city commissioner in Gainesville  and as the mayor from 1993 to 1996. While he was mayor, Gainesville  earned the title of America's Most Livable City award. He gave his time  and talents to many organizations, including the Alachua-Bradford  County Workforce Development Board, the Gainesville Area Chamber of  Commerce, the Gainesville Elks Lodge, the Builders Association of North  Central Florida, the Florida Home Builders Association, and the Girls  Club of Alachua County.   A stranger to none, Jim was a public servant, a friend, and a  confidant to many. I know that I will miss Jim, and so many will miss  him, as well.              Congratulating the Hawthorne Girls Basketball Team     Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the hard work  of the Hawthorne High School girls varsity basketball team, this year's  1A State champions.   Former Florida Gator Cornelius Ingram led the Hawthorne Hornets to  the championship win over Wildwood this past Friday night. The game was  down to the wire, all the way until the final buzzer in the fourth  quarter. With a final score of 42-38, the Hornets were victorious.   This is not the first victory for Coach Ingram, who also led the  Hawthorne Hornets varsity football team to a State championship this  past fall. A former tight end for the Florida Gators, Ingram has had  tremendous success encouraging his teams and leading them to victory,  and we could not be more proud of their outstanding accomplishments on  the field and on the court.   Congratulations to the Hawthorne Hornets on the new trophy that they  will add to the growing trophy case that they continue to expand in  north central Florida.   Go Hornets.                     Congratulations to Senator Ben Sasse     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Senator Ben  Sasse for becoming the new president of the University of Florida.   Florida's flagship university came from humble beginnings. Being one  of the original two State universities, UF was created through the Land  Grant Act of 1862 and the Florida State legislature, combining four  existing institutions in Lake City, Gainesville, Bartow, and St. Pete  to establish the University of the State of Florida.   Now, UF is the gem in the crown that is our State's university system  and the fifth-ranked public university in the Nation.   Ben Sasse himself also comes from humble beginnings. He is the son of  a teacher and football coach who grew up in Plainview, Nebraska. He  worked hard in his youth, earning degrees from Harvard, St. John's  College, and Yale. Ben led a successful private sector career, then  went on to become one of the youngest college presidents at Midland  University back in his hometown, saving that institution from  insolvency. Answering the call for public service, Ben ran and won a  seat in the United States Senate, serving his State and country for 7  years.   Now, it is my pleasure to welcome him to the Gator Nation, a tight- knit community with worldwide reach.   Ben, we look forward to yours and the university's continued success.  As always, it is great to be a Florida Gator.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire of the time remaining?    Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Don Quincey,  an advocate for the industry and role model for future generations. Don  Quincey has an undeniable passion and dedication to the agricultural  industry, leading by his actions in business and in service.   Born in Gainesville, Don is a fifth-generation Florida cattleman.  Upon graduation from Cleveland High School, he felt called to serve in  law enforcement. But after 2 years of service, his unquestionable love  for the land and raising cattle brought him back to the family's feed  store and cow-calf operation. He was actively engaged in ownership and  operations from 1977 to 2003, when the store was eventually sold.                                time  1400    While supporting the family business, Don founded Quincey Cattle  Company in 1992, a diversified cattle feeding operation in Chiefland,  Florida. The operation has grown in size and scope to meet fellow  cattle producers' needs and goals, providing services to improve  marketability and options for Florida cattle. His commitment to  innovation has led to improved sustainability for the industry, with  approximately 80 percent of his commodity needs coming from within 20  miles of his ranch. That is pretty significant. For folks in  agriculture who know how difficult that is, that is a big deal.   His record of service and leadership is well-documented and  tremendous. Don is a lifelong supporter of FFA, Future Farmers of  America, and a founding member of the Florida Cattle Ranchers. He has  held all elected officer positions with the Florida Cattlemen's  Association and served on the board of directors for Drummond Community  Bank, Florida Beef Council, National Cattlemen's Beef Association, and  CattleFax.   He also has been recognized by the University of Florida's College of  Agricultural and Life Sciences with an award of distinction and the  National Cattlemen's Beef Association with the leadership award.   Don has been an advocate for mutually beneficial environmental and  agricultural policy--seeking to bridge the gaps between production and  regulation--as well as a member of the Suwannee River Water Management  District board for many years. He served  [[Page H1006]]  as chair for 9 of his 12 years at the district. During his tenure, he  initiated the district's cost-share program and was instrumental in  developing a water-use monitoring program to assist agricultural  producers with reporting actual water use instead of estimated data.   With lifelong roots in Florida's agriculture, carving out a niche in  the Florida cattle industry was not for Don's personal gain, but to set  the foundation for future generations to provide a safe, wholesome,  local Florida beef supply.   We are so glad to know Don and his family. We are proud and grateful  for all that he has done in service to north central Florida and our  farmers, ranchers, and producers.                       Gators Gymnastics SEC Champions     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the Florida  Gators' women's gymnastics team, this year's regular season SEC  champion. Florida's Super Seniors, including Leah Clapper, Savannah  Schoenherr, Halley Taylor, and Trinity Thomas now have a handful of  rings, claiming their fifth consecutive SEC title on Friday with a win  over number 12 Kentucky.   This is UF's 15th SEC gymnastic title and 5th consecutive title. The  gymnastics team joins volleyball and men's and women's swimming and  diving as regular season champions during this academic year.   During the SEC championship meet, Florida led on vault with season  bests by Leanne Wong and Sloane Blakely. Kayla DiCello led the Gators  on the balance beam, while DiCello, Trinity Thomas, and Wong boosted  the Gators' overall score on the uneven bars--a whole heck of a lot  more than most of us in this Chamber can do.   It is with tremendous pride that we say congratulations to the Gators  Gymnastics team, Coach Rowland, and the Super Seniors on a great  regular season. We look forward to cheering them on at the collegiate  NCAA championship that is soon to come. Go Gators.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin), my  good friend and colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
