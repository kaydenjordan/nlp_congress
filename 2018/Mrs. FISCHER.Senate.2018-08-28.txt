 Mr. President, today I wish to join my colleagues in  saying goodbye to our friend and mentor, John McCain.   As our country and the world grieves for his loss, we remember him as  he was: a father, husband, grandfather, a war hero, and a dedicated  public servant who loved this country.   We remember his extraordinary story and how the tragic and painful  experiences he endured gave him the uncommon strength we all knew so  well.   Most of all, I remember John for his passion. He was a fearless  advocate for American values and a champion of democratic ideals.   When I was elected to serve the people of Nebraska in this Chamber, I  became a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Serving on this  committee has been an honor, but one of the greatest privileges it  offered was the opportunity to work with John McCain.   As a senior member and chairman, Senator McCain set the tone for the  committee. We all benefited from his good instincts, his unfailing  energy, his unwavering values, and, of course, his sense of humor.   His leadership fostered an environment that led to bold reforms. He  embraced and encouraged the heated debates. But John knew how to unite  the committee, how to compromise, and how to refocus members on our  fundamental responsibility: providing for the defense of the Nation he  loved so dearly.   As much as John was an inspiration to us, he was truly a global  figure who took his message of liberty to some of the darkest regions  of the globe. All  [[Page S5987]]  around the world, people had such respect for John McCain. Traveling  with him, I witnessed firsthand the weight and authority his words  carried with foreign leaders. This strong global support reflects the  effect he had on this world and the legacy he leaves behind.   Last fall, Senator McCain addressed the brigade of midshipmen at the  U.S. Naval Academy. He said: ``My appreciation for those lessons and  for the friendships I made here bring me back often. So does my  gratitude for the life of adventure the Naval Academy prepared me for,  and for the privilege of being a bit player in the story of America  that the Navy made possible.''   John was not just a bit player in our Nation's story. He was a man  who served our country in war and peace with courage and honor.   This weekend, John will return to Annapolis for a final time, but  generations from now, Americans will still be inspired by his story,  that of a hero committed to his nation and willing to live a life of  service.   He has carried our Nation's highest ideals through the darkest of  times, and he remains an enduring example of selfless dedication to  country.   I know I join so many of my colleagues here in the Senate in sending  our love and prayers to Cindy and the rest of John's family, who  supported him every step of the way.   John McCain will certainly be missed here in the U.S. Senate.   Though he is no longer with us, his steadfast commitment to the  ideals of our Nation will not be forgotten here, across the country, or  around the globe.   Thank you.                            ____________________
