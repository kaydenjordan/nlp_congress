 Mr. Speaker, this week, the House is  considering a number of bills relating to the opioid public health  epidemic.   I serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee, and over the past year,  our committee has heard from experts. We have had numerous hearings on  all facets of the opioid crisis. We have gathered facts, listened to  witnesses, including those struggling with addiction; doctors;  providers; the Drug Enforcement Agency; and more. Plus, many families  and experts back home have informed us and encouraged the Congress to  act.   Last year, one loving father in my home district in Tampa, Florida,  came to meet with me to share his experience. He said:         Our son has been an addict for the last 5 years. During       that time, our family has discovered how impotent the       healthcare system, government system, insurance companies,       criminal justice system, and our family have been to combat       this disease.        Prior to our personal experience, we were like most       Americans who believed this was not our problem, but we were       saddened by those who experienced the crisis. In addition, we       cannot believe how futile and limited our resources and       efforts to help our son overcome this illness have been.        We still believe, although to a lesser degree, that the       people afflicted with this illness still hold the key to       unlocking their own happiness to managing this illness.       However, what is abundantly clear now is that the resources       necessary to provide even a remote chance for addicts to       achieve temporary or permanent remission must be       substantially increased. We have invested, personally, over       $100,000 trying to help our son.    His remarks echo what we heard from experts all across the board in  our committee, like Dr. Andrew Kolodny, director of Opioid Policy  Research at Brandeis University, who emphasized that treatment has to  be expanded exponentially, and it must be easy to access. ``We have to  build a new system in America that does not exist.''   Democrats have urged our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  join us in truly tackling the crisis. What became apparent in committee  and what is apparent through these small-ball bills on the floor this  week and next week is that Republicans still are not there. They are  not willing to adequately address this public health crisis. We need a  robust, long-term solution that truly meets the challenge of the opioid  crisis.   A consensus has emerged, and it is based upon these devastating facts  right now. Over 40,000 people are dying from an opioid overdose every  year. In my home State of Florida, we are losing about 5,700 people per  year to overdose. That was in 2016. That was a 35 percent increase from  the previous year.   The CDC says opioid overdoses have quadrupled since 1999. Only 10 to  15 percent of Americans suffering from opioid addiction are currently  receiving treatment.   Those numbers cry out for a meaningful, comprehensive approach. But  our Republican colleagues have failed to get there with us.   We have been through this before. In the late 1980s and early 1990s,  we were struggling with the HIV/AIDS public health epidemic. For many  years, the Congress was criticized for not adequately addressing the  crisis. There was a harmful stigma involved, just like there is for  opioid addiction.   But by the early 1990s, the Congress came together and adopted the  Ryan White CARE Act that provided resources all across the country in a  consistent fashion and provided funds to local communities and local  nonprofits to help us. The death rate from HIV/AIDS is dramatically  less.    This is what we have to do when it comes to opioids: provide that  comprehensive, long-term solution that simply isn't being demonstrated  in these small-ball, little bills that are nibbling around the edges.   Mr. Speaker, at the same time, it is very difficult to be proactive  in a meaningful way on the opioid crisis when Republicans and the White  House continue to drag us backward when it comes to affordable  healthcare.   Just last week, the Trump administration and the GOP launched a new  attack on Americans with preexisting conditions like opioid addiction.  They asked a Federal court to strike down the Affordable Care Act  preexisting condition protection. That is the bedrock protection  contained in the Affordable Care Act that says, if you have a cancer  diagnosis, Alzheimer's, or heart disease, an insurance company cannot  deny you coverage, and they cannot charge you exorbitant rates. The GOP  has never really been for that protection.  [[Page H5104]]    How are we going to adequately address the opioid addiction crisis  when they want to tear away affordable healthcare, including the  protection on preexisting conditions?   We need a robust solution here, a comprehensive solution. Otherwise,  this is simply nibbling around the edges.                            ____________________
