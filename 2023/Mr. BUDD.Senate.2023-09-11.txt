 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Lutheridge  Farm and celebrate its nearly six decades of success.   In 1965, brothers Ted and Ben Luther purchased the land where they  established the family-owned dairy operation today known as Lutheridge  Farm. For many years, Ted, his wife Dot, Ben, and his wife Margaret  worked diligently to grow the farm from a single cow to a herd of about  150 cattle. Word of their ranch began to spread, and in 1981, they were  named the Farm Family of the Year by their soil and water conservation  district. Due to their love of Jersey cows, the family became involved  in the American Jersey Cattle Association, with Ted ultimately being  presented its National Distinguished Service Award in 2006 after many  years of service as its president and member of its board of directors.   After Ted passed away in 2013, the cattle operation began to wind  down. However, desiring to keep the family business alive, his children  purchased Ben's shares of the farm to keep it running for a new  generation. Richard Luther and his wife Robin, along with Leigh Anne  Wetmore and her husband Mark, worked to continue the legacy of their  father and uncle. Ted's grandson Steven Wetmore returned to the family  farm to manage the operation with his wife Kira, where they were joined  by his cousins Jonathan and Lauren Luther. This new generation of  family farmers revived the ranch and diligently worked to expand the  operation. In 2016, they began selling dairy to local, family-owned  cheese manufacturers.   Although the family has recently decided to downsize the operation  due to rising costs, the family still provides fresh dairy to families  across the region. Bottled milk, both white and chocolate, is delivered  to local markets in Rowan, Iredell, Cabarrus, Davidson, and Davie  Counties.   Please join me in celebrating Lutheridge Farm's many years of  success. Small businesses are the backbone of our Nation's economy, and  it is family operations like Lutheridge Farm that enrich communities  for years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the members  of the 2023 Rowan Little League 10u Softball team for their recent  victory in the Southeast regional championship. After winning the North  Carolina State Championship, the team was provided the opportunity to  compete in the highest competition in the 10u system. Over the regional  championship weekend in late July, coaches Brett and Jacqueline Mulkey  and Greg Deal took the 12-member team to Clarksville, TN, where the  Rowan team demonstrated the hard work and sportsmanship its members had  developed throughout the entire season.
