 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 27.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  concurrent resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, this week the Senate has several  opportunities to make headway on important matters facing our country.   First, we will tend to a pending treaty protocol on the accession of  a new member to NATO and reaffirm the importance of the alliance to the  security of U.S. interests around the world. Then, we will consider yet  another of the President's well-qualified nominees to the diplomatic  corps. But while the Senate can take care of some of these matters on  their own, much of the pressing business of the American people  requires coordination with our colleagues across the Capitol.   Unfortunately, the only thing that seems to really inspire House  Democrats these days is their obsession with overturning the results of  the 2016 election.   In the weeks since the Speaker of the House gave in to her far-left  Members' demands for an impeachment inquiry, she and other prominent  House Democrats have insisted over and over and over that impeachment  will not stop them from making real progress on legislation.   They say their 3-year-old impeachment parade doesn't have to block  traffic and bring other important priorities to a standstill. That is  what they have been saying, but actions speak louder than words. We  have yet to see any actual indication that House Democrats intend to  make good on that commitment.   For months, we have heard the Speaker claim that she would like to  get to yes on the USMCA. We have heard that her caucus is ``making  progress,'' but nearly a year after this landmark agreement with Mexico  and Canada was announced, the most significant update to the North  American trade policy in a generation is still waiting for the House to  take action. Billions of new dollars in economic growth and 176,000 new  American jobs are still waiting on House Democrats.   And that is not all. So far, even something as completely basic as  funding our Armed Forces--funding our men and women in uniform--has met  the same fate. Democrats have elected to stall it and block it in order  to pick fights with the White House. Notwithstanding our bipartisan,  bicameral agreement to wrap up the appropriations process in good  faith, Senate Democrats voted a few weeks ago to block funding for the  Department of Defense. No critical resources for U.S. servicemembers,  no predictable planning process for our commanders, no pay raise for  our all-volunteer Armed Forces--none of that was allowed to travel  through the Senate because our Democratic colleagues just don't care  for the occupant of the White House.   Ironically, many of these same colleagues of ours have spent recent  days making loud pronouncements on U.S. foreign policy. By the sound of  their comments, it almost sounds as if they are coming around to  Republicans' long-held views on the necessity of American leadership  all around the world. But, once again, actions speak louder, and thus  far our Democratic colleagues have not even been willing to get past  partisanship for the sake of job No. 1--funding our military.   So this week we will offer our Democratic colleagues a clear test.  Are all the declarations that they are willing to work on important  legislation just empty talk or will Senate Democrats finally do their  part to move the appropriations process forward?   Soon we will vote on advancing a package of domestic funding  legislation. As I said last week, I am grateful to Chairman Shelby and  Senator Leahy for their continued conversations and hopeful they can  produce a substitute amendment that will fund a number of urgent  domestic priorities. Then, once we complete that work, we will vote to  move forward the funding for our national defense--two big votes, two  big votes, two big opportunities for our Democratic friends to show the  country whether their party's impeachment obsession leaves them any  room at all for the pressing business of the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at  the desk due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceedings.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the  distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a  resolution on documentary production by the Permanent Subcommittee on  Investigations, and ask for its immediate consideration.   Mr. President, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs recently  conducted an investigation into China's impact on the U.S. education  system. The Subcommittee has now received a request from the U.S.  Department of Education seeking access to records that the Subcommittee  obtained during the investigation.   In keeping with the Senate's practice under its rules, this  resolution would authorize the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of  the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, acting jointly, to  provide records, obtained by the Subcommittee in the course of its  investigation, in response to this request and requests from other  Federal or State government entities and officials with a legitimate  need for the records.                            ____________________
