 Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support  Mr. Barr's legislation, the Otto Warmbier North Korea Nuclear Sanctions  Act.   North Korea has continued to prove a dangerous and destabilizing  force to the northeast Asian region, as well as to the United States  and its allies. Its repeated missile tests, nuclear weapons tests, and  heinous human rights violations demand that the United States continue  its diplomatic and economic isolation campaign.  [[Page H8103]]    Today's bill is named for my constituent, Otto Warmbier, from  Wyoming, Ohio, in the greater Cincinnati area.   Otto passed away on June 19 after spending 18 months in detention by  the North Korean regime, the brutality of which was far beyond human  decency or civility. The pain and heartache endured by Otto, his  family, and his friends can never be undone or erased, but Congress can  continue to take action by passing H.R. 3898 today and imposing the  most far-reaching sanctions yet to be directed at North Korea.   There is no simple solution to countering such complex national  security threats, but it is critical that we utilize both economic and  diplomatic tools to hold hostile regimes like North Korea accountable  when they act repeatedly and aggressively against our interests, our  allies, our citizens, and our security.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly and sincerely urge support of this bill by  every Member of this Chamber.
