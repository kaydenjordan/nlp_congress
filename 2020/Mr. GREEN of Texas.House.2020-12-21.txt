 Madam Speaker, this bill will not end all the  suffering. However, it will ease the pain for many who are suffering,  with $25 billion for eviction prevention, $13 billion for food in the  form of SNAP, and $600 cash in pocket. It won't end all the suffering,  but it will ease much of the pain.   For this, I thank Chairman McGovern, Mr. Cole, and Ms. Shalala. Of  course, I am always honored to serve in the Congress of the United  States of America under the leadership of the Honorable Maxine Waters,  and I thank her for her $25 billion in rental assistance.
