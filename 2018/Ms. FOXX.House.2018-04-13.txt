 Mr. Speaker, there is no question that the Nation's  warfighters are among the bravest and most selfless people in the  world. It is fitting that grateful Americans often find a way to thank  our servicemen and -women for their defense of our Nation.   It is also important, though, not to forget the great sacrifices  children of our servicemembers make as well.   April is the Month of the Military Child, and during this month, we  celebrate and honor the incredible children of our servicemembers.   Many military children serve as America's youngest ambassadors abroad  when their parents are stationed overseas. They may also go long  periods of time without the day-to-day parent interactions that many  civilian children enjoy, such as meals together and bedtime stories.   I salute the children who, alongside their parents, bear countless  sacrifices to protect our country's freedoms.   This month and every month, these children deserve our gratitude.                            ____________________
