 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, there are various options available for  graduates of high schools across the United States. Some of them choose  to go to college or university, but even making that choice gives you a  lot of options.   There are basically two categories of schools, though, that I want to  address in this statement this morning. One category is called for- profit colleges and universities, and the other is the traditional not- for-profit colleges and universities, which would include your  community colleges and public universities and many not-for-profit,  private universities.   But I want to focus this morning on the for-profit colleges and  universities in the United States. People sometimes can't make the  distinction between which is which. Some of the big names in the for- profit industry include the University of Phoenix. That is one you  probably heard of. DeVry University is another one you might have heard  of.   There are some defining characteristics of these schools. They, of  course, are in business to make money, and they have a different  economic model than many of the other universities.   I have met the CEOs of for-profit colleges and universities and found  that in some cases they have limited or no experience when it comes to  education. They are investors. They are business people. The idea of  education is a secondary part of why they were chosen.   There is an important statistic--in fact, two statistics--that I want  to preface my remarks with, and these will be on the final, I might  add, for those who are following this statement.   The numbers 9 and 33--9 and 33. Why are they important? Nine percent  of postsecondary students go to for-profit colleges and universities--9  percent--but 33 percent of all the federal student loan defaults in the  United States are students from for-profit colleges and universities--9  percent of the students, 33 percent of federal student loan defaults.   What is going on here?   Well, what is happening here, unfortunately, is that many of these  students are signing up for the for-profit schools that they think are  legitimate colleges and universities, and, frankly, they are  dramatically overcharging them.   Every analysis we have gone through says that the tuition at these  for-profit schools far exceeds what students are likely to pay,  certainly, in a community college and in the case of many public  colleges and universities. So they have a big tuition bill to start  with, and they have poor results.   What kind of results? Students graduate believing that they are being  trained or educated to do a certain profession, and then they find out  that they can't do the job or they don't qualify for the job, or they  get so deeply in debt on the way to graduating, they give up and quit-- the worst of all possible outcomes.   So that is the preface on these for-profit colleges and universities.  I have come to this floor many times over the years to talk about this  industry because we treat it in the eyes of the public like higher  education across the board, and yet it is much, much different. It is  for profit as opposed to not for profit, and, frankly, the results of  that education leave a lot to be desired.   It has been more than 5 years since the for-profit giant Corinthian  College collapsed. Their economic model didn't work. For years,  Corinthian had lied, inflating its job placement rates and engaging in  high-pressure tactics to lure students into enrolling, often leaving  them with massive student loan debt and a diploma that didn't work to  find a job.   But Corinthian was not unique. As I have said many times, it turned  out to be the canary in the coal mine. Since Corinthian College, we  have seen the collapse of several other major predatory for-profit  colleges and universities. They include ITT Tech, Westwood, Education  Corporation of America, and Dream Center. Nearly every major for-profit  college company has been the subject of extensive investigations and  lawsuits for unfair and deceptive practices similar to Corinthian  College.   Check with the attorney general of your home State about that for- profit college and university, and, almost without fail, you will find  that they have been investigated for misleading and deceiving the  students who go to school at their universities.   I have long said that we shouldn't leave the students holding the bag  for the misdeeds of these institutions because, you see, we are  complicit. The Federal Government is part of the problem.   How do these schools reach the point where you can take out a Federal  student loan to attend? We accredit them. We recognize their  accreditation. We tell the world and the families and the students that  these are legitimate schools. Depending on that, these students who  sign up for a better experience, are often misled, deceived, and  overcharged. Ultimately, a third of them are in default on their  student loans because they can't pay them back.   There is a provision in the Higher Education Act known as borrower  defense. It gives the students the right to have their Federal student  loans discharged by the Secretary of Education if they have been  defrauded or subject to deception by these schools.   After Corinthian's collapse, this little known, rarely used provision  in the law became a hot topic. All of a sudden, here were large numbers  of students who had been defrauded and deceived by Corinthian College  and went deeply into debt, and now the college goes out of business.   It turns out that most of the hours they took can't be transferred  anywhere. It is worthless. They were defrauded, start to finish, and  now they are left holding the student loan bag.   Thousands of Corinthian students and other borrowers, mostly from  for-profit colleges, began applying for this borrower defense discharge  from the U.S. Department of Education. It was in the law. It led the  Obama administration to undertake a new rulemaking to update the  borrower defense regulation, which dated back to 1994, and to create a  standard process for dealing with the inundation and to attempt to  prevent future collapses.   Soon after taking office, Secretary Betsy DeVos and the Trump  administration delayed implementation of the Obama rule, despite the  Department's own inspector general saying that implementing the rule  would ``avoid costs to students and taxpayers that result from school  closures.''   Secretary DeVos said: I am not going to be a party to that. Her delay  was challenged in court. Her decision to delay this new rule was found  illegal by a Federal judge, after which the current rule went into  effect, and it remains in effect today. Secretary DeVos also announced  she would begin a new rulemaking to replace the current rule.   In late August, Secretary DeVos released her borrower defense rule,  the new rule which she wants to put in place. It actually guts the  borrower and taxpayer protections in the current borrower defense rule  and makes it nearly impossible for students holding this student loan  debt who have been defrauded to get relief.   How does she make it so hard?   It is estimated that the rule will provide $11 billion less in relief  to defrauded borrowers--students--than the current rule. Among other  things, the new Betsy DeVos rule increases the burden on these  defrauded students to gather and submit almost impossible amounts of  evidence to somehow prove their claim. Student borrowers will have to  provide evidence that the school intentionally harmed them.   Now, how are they supposed to do that?   The DeVos rule--the new one--requires borrowers to apply individually  rather than receiving automatic discharges when they are part of a  group of student borrowers who have been harmed by similar practices by  places like Corinthian. In other words, you are on your own. Get your  own lawyer. Lawyer up. Get some evidence together. Come see us, and  maybe we will be convinced.   Student borrowers who have been cheated are not exactly the  wealthiest group in America. They are often facing incredible financial  difficulties and deep emotional strain, with a mountain of debt and  nothing to show for it because of these for-profit schools. Now  Secretary DeVos wants them to be investigators and lawyers and get  their own relief one by one.  [[Page S6685]]    The DeVos rule also eliminates the current prohibition on class  action restrictions and mandatory arbitration clauses in enrollment.   What does that mean?   Under the current rule which Secretary DeVos wants to replace, you  could gather the other students from Corinthian College and work on  this together as a class action claim, share whatever expenses that  might be involved in proving your claim, and you couldn't be forced  into an arbitration where you are likely to lose. You could have your  day in court under the rule that Secretary DeVos wants to replace.   Class action restrictions and mandatory arbitration were used by  Corinthian and ITT Tech and others that required students to sign away  their rights to sue the school as an individual or as part of a class  as a condition of enrollment.   The DeVos rule prevents students from holding schools directly  accountable for their wrongdoing and seeking financial redress through  the courts. It gives students no other option than to seek relief from  taxpayers through borrower defense, but, as I just mentioned, it makes  that process almost impossible.   And if anyone doubts the devastating effect this rule will have on  the defrauded students' ability to get relief, just look at what  Secretary DeVos has done to date.   Since taking office Secretary DeVos has had the authority to  discharge hundreds of millions of dollars in student loan debt held by  hundreds of thousands of defrauded student borrowers. Instead, she has  allowed a backlog of more than 200,000 borrower defense claims from  virtually every State in the Nation--student borrower defense claims  coming from all 50 States--to build at the Department. She is sitting  on it. She is playing slow ball. She has not approved a single claim.  Although more than 200,000 claims are pending, she has not approved a  single claim in more than 1 year.   Here I want to show you what is behind this. In the few cases where  Secretary DeVos has been legally required to provide discharges, she  has done so with extreme displeasure.   Think about that. Using her authority to help defrauded borrowers get  a fresh start brings her extreme displeasure.   How do I know that?   She wrote it. Here is one of them. Recommendation to discharge. She  approves it, signs it, and puts down as a comment: ``with extreme  displeasure.''   Discharging a student loan from a for-profit institution that  defrauded borrowers, she is displeased to be forced to do such a thing.   She defied a Federal court order and was held in contempt for  continuing to collect from these students who had been defrauded by  Corinthian.   This is not a Secretary who rewrote the borrower defense rule to help  student borrowers. In September, I introduced a resolution in the  Senate to overturn the DeVos borrower defense rule; 42 of my colleagues  have cosponsored that resolution.   I plan to bring the resolution to a vote on the Senate floor where we  will only need a simple majority to pass under the expedited procedures  provided for in the Congressional Review Act. At that time, my  colleagues will have a choice. Will you stand with Secretary DeVos or  with the defrauded student borrowers in your State?   There is no doubt where the American people stand. In a 2016 New  America poll, the question was asked whether Americans agreed that  students should have their Federal student loan debt canceled if their  college deceived them, exactly what the borrower defense rule is about.   Seventy-one percent of Republicans said yes, 87 percent of Democrats.  On average, 78 percent of Americans understand it is fundamentally  unfair to penalize these students, having been defrauded by a school  that this U.S. Government said was doing business honestly and  professionally. When you break the numbers down, it is clear. The  overwhelming majority of people in this country stand by the students,  but not by Secretary DeVos.   I will stand with the defrauded students and the American people over  Secretary DeVos, and my colleagues in the Senate will get a chance to  vote. I hope they will, too.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr.  Booker), the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), the Senator from  Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and  the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.     I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr.  Booker), the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), the Senator from  Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and  the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.     I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from California (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Minnesota  (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the  Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 2922         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Rail Passenger Fairness       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         (1) Congress created Amtrak under the Rail Passenger       Service Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-158).        (2) Amtrak began serving customers on May 1, 1971, taking       over the operation of most intercity passenger trains that       private, freight railroads were previously required to       operate. In exchange for assuming these passenger rail       operations, Amtrak was given access to the national rail       network.        (3) In return for relief from the obligation to provide       intercity passenger service, railroads over which Amtrak       operated (referred to in this section as ``host railroads'')       were expected to give Amtrak passenger trains preference over       freight trains when using the national rail network.        (4) In 1973, Congress passed the Amtrak Improvement Act of       1973 (Public Law 93-146), which gives intercity and commuter       rail passenger transportation preference over freight       transportation in using a rail line, junction, or crossing.       This right, which is now codified as section 24308(c) of       title 49, United States Code, states, ``Except in an       emergency, intercity and commuter rail passenger       transportation provided by or for Amtrak has preference over       freight transportation in using a rail line, junction, or       crossing unless the Board orders otherwise under this       subsection. A rail carrier affected by this subsection may       apply to the Board for relief. If the Board, after an       opportunity for a hearing under section 553 of title 5,       decides that preference for intercity and commuter rail       passenger transportation materially will lessen the quality       of freight transportation provided to shippers, the Board       shall establish the rights of the carrier and Amtrak on       reasonable terms.''.        (5) Many host railroads have ignored the law referred to in       paragraph (4) by refusing to give passenger rail the priority       to which it is statutorily entitled and giving freight       transportation the higher priority. As a result, Amtrak's on       time performance on most host railroads is poor, has declined       between 2014 through 2019, and continues to decline.        (6) According to Amtrak, 6,500,000 customers on State-      supported and long-distance trains arrived at their       destination late during fiscal year 2019. Nearly 70 percent       of these delays were caused by host railroads, amounting to a       total of 3,200,000 minutes. The largest cause of these delays       was freight train interference, which accounted for more than       1,000,000 minutes of delay for Amtrak passengers, or       approximately 2 years, because host railroads chose to give       freight trains priority.        (7) Poor on-time performance wastes taxpayer dollars.       According to a 2019 report by Amtrak's Office of Inspector       General, a 5 percent improvement of on-time performance on       all Amtrak routes would result in $12,100,000 in cost savings       to Amtrak in the first year. If on-time performance on long-      distance routes reached 75 percent for a year, Amtrak would       realize an estimated $41,900,000 in operating cost savings,       with a one-time savings of $336,000,000 due to a reduction in       equipment replacement needs.        (8) Historical data suggests that on-time performance on       host railroads is driven by the existence of an effective       means to enforce Amtrak's preference rights:        (A) Two months after the date of the enactment of the       Passenger Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008       (division B of Public Law 110-432), which included provisions       for the enforcement of these preference rights, was enacted,       the on-time performance of long-distance trains improved from       56 percent to 77 percent and Class I freight train       interference delays across all routes declined by 40 percent.        (B) One year after such date of enactment, freight train       interference delays had declined by 54 percent and the on-      time performance of long-distance trains reached 85 percent.        (C) In 2014, after some of the provisions in the Passenger       Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 related to       enforcement of preference were ruled unconstitutional by a       D.C. Circuit Court, long-distance train on-time performance       declined from 72 percent to 50 percent, and freight train       interference delays increased 59 percent.        (D) The last time long-distance trains achieved an on-time       rate of more than 80 percent in a given month was February       2012.        (9) As a result of violations of Amtrak's right to       preference, Amtrak has been consistently unable on host       railroad networks to meet its congressionally mandated       mission and goals, which are codified in section 24101 of       title 49, United States Code (relating to providing on-time       and trip-time competitive service to its passengers).        (10) Amtrak does not have an effective mechanism to enforce       its statutory preference right in order to fulfill its       mission and goals. Only the Attorney General can bring a       civil action for equitable relief in a district court of the       United States to enforce Amtrak's preference rights.        (11) In Amtrak's entire history, the only enforcement       action initiated by the Attorney General was against the       Southern Pacific Transportation Company in 1979.        (12) Congress supports continued authority for the Attorney       General to initiate an action, but Amtrak should also be       entitled to bring a civil action before a Federal district       court to enforce its statutory preference rights.       SEC. 3. AUTHORIZE AMTRAK TO BRING A CIVIL ACTION TO ENFORCE                     IT PREFERENCE RIGHTS.         (a) In General.--Section 24308(c) of title 49, United       States Code, is amended, by adding at the end the following:       ``Notwithstanding sections 24103(a) and 24308(f), Amtrak       shall have the right to bring an action for equitable or       other relief in the United States District Court for the       District of Columbia, or in any jurisdiction in which Amtrak       resides or is found, to enforce the preference rights granted       under this subsection.''.        (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 24103(a)(1) of title 49,       United States Code, is amended, in the matter preceding       subparagraph (A), by striking ``of this subsection'' and       inserting ``and subsection 24308(c)''.

Res. 435         Whereas the General Security of Military Information       Agreement (GSOMIA) between the Republic of Korea and Japan is       crucial to safeguarding United States and allied interests in       Northeast Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region;        Whereas bilateral information sharing between the       Governments of the Republic of Korea and Japan is critical to       increasing trust and growing cooperation that advances shared       defense and security interests;        Whereas the Governments and people of Japan and the       Republic of Korea have made significant contributions to       advancing our shared defense partnership and promoting       trilateral cooperation;        Whereas defense cooperation among the United States, Japan,       and the Republic of Korea serves as a deterrent against       aggression from adversaries and external security threats as       well as against new and non-traditional challenges;        Whereas the suspension of GSOMIA directly harms United       States national security at a time when the Government of the       Democratic People's Republic of Korea is engaging in an       increased level of provocations, including 12 tests of over       20 ballistic missiles this year, including new types of       nuclear-capable land and sea-launched ballistic missiles;        Whereas the Governments of the People's Republic of China,       the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the Russian       Federation are seeking to capitalize on friction between the       Republic of Korea and Japan, and the resulting strain on       trilateral cooperation and on our bilateral alliances;        Whereas the Government and people of the United States       value the partnership of Japan and the Republic of Korea in       upholding regional security and prosperity, including by       safeguarding maritime security and freedom of navigation,       promoting investment and commerce, advocating for the rule of       law, and opposing the use of intimidation and force in the       Indo-Pacific; and        Whereas strengthening intelligence sharing is fundamental       to the future of trilateral cooperation, and to enabling the       Governments of the United States, Japan, and the Republic of       Korea to face the challenges posed by the Government of the       Democratic People's Republic of Korea's destabilizing       actions, the People's Republic of China, and other emerging       security threats: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the Senate--        (1) reaffirms the importance of the General Security of       Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) between the Republic       of Korea and Japan as a crucial military intelligence-sharing       agreement foundational to Indo-Pacific security and defense,       and specifically to countering nuclear and missile threats       from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea;        (2) underscores the vital role of the alliances between the       United States and Japan and the United States and the       Republic of Korea in promoting peace, stability, and security       in the Indo-Pacific region;        (3) highlights that friction between the Republic of Korea       and Japan only fractures the region and empowers its       agitators;        (4) urges the Republic of Korea to consider how to best       address potential measures that may undermine regional       security cooperation;        (5) encourages the Governments of Japan and the Republic of       Korea to take steps to rebuild trust and address the sources       of bilateral friction, insulate important defense and       security ties from other bilateral challenges, and pursue       cooperation on shared interests, such as a denuclearized       Korean peninsula, market-based trade and commerce, and a       stable Indo-Pacific region; and        (6) commits to strengthening and deepening diplomatic,       economic, security, and people-to-people ties between and       among the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.

(B) One year after such date of enactment, freight train       interference delays had declined by 54 percent and the on-      time performance of long-distance trains reached 85 percent.        (C) In 2014, after some of the provisions in the Passenger       Rail Investment and Improvement Act of 2008 related to       enforcement of preference were ruled unconstitutional by a       D.C. Circuit Court, long-distance train on-time performance       declined from 72 percent to 50 percent, and freight train       interference delays increased 59 percent.        (D) The last time long-distance trains achieved an on-time       rate of more than 80 percent in a given month was February       2012.        (9) As a result of violations of Amtrak's right to       preference, Amtrak has been consistently unable on host       railroad networks to meet its congressionally mandated       mission and goals, which are codified in section 24101 of       title 49, United States Code (relating to providing on-time       and trip-time competitive service to its passengers).        (10) Amtrak does not have an effective mechanism to enforce       its statutory preference right in order to fulfill its       mission and goals. Only the Attorney General can bring a       civil action for equitable relief in a district court of the       United States to enforce Amtrak's preference rights.        (11) In Amtrak's entire history, the only enforcement       action initiated by the Attorney General was against the       Southern Pacific Transportation Company in 1979.        (12) Congress supports continued authority for the Attorney       General to initiate an action, but Amtrak should also be       entitled to bring a civil action before a Federal district       court to enforce its statutory preference rights.       SEC. 3. AUTHORIZE AMTRAK TO BRING A CIVIL ACTION TO ENFORCE                     IT PREFERENCE RIGHTS.
