 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, S.J. Res. 32 would repeal the CFPB's small business  lending rule, which was required by Congress in section 1071 of the  Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The CFPB's  rule would simply require lenders to collect and report data on small  business lending. This data will help drive competition in the market,  lowering small business costs, and help combat discrimination.   I worked closely with my colleague, Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez,  who is the ranking member of the Small Business Committee, to ensure  that this provision was included in the Dodd-Frank Act because we both  knew how critical this data would be to helping small businesses.   Access to capital is a key challenge that many small businesses face.  For example, Goldman Sachs found that over 75 percent of small  businesses they surveyed were concerned about access to capital.  Research has also shown that minority-, women-, and LGBTQ+-owned  businesses are more likely to be denied loans and pay steeper interest  rates.    Access to capital is an issue for many family farms, which don't have  the same access that larger agricultural corporations have. In  addition, access to capital is an issue for our young people working in  the gig economy seeking to start a business of their own but too often  told ``no'' by banks.   Unfortunately, section 1071 of Dodd-Frank was not implemented for 13  years. In fact, small business owners had to sue the CFPB under the  Trump administration to force implementation of this rule.   One of the small business owners who sued the CFPB was ReShonda  Young, a Black woman who founded Popcorn Heaven, a small business  selling gourmet popcorn in Waterloo, Iowa. Ms. Young explained that she  was a victim of discriminatory lending practices, saying: ``In several  instances, there was just blatant discrimination, and in other cases, I  found out about it later on. And it wasn't just me.''   She further explained: ``I had a regular hourly income. My personal  expenses were pretty low, so it wasn't like I couldn't cash infuse from  my personal [income] if I needed to. My credit score was good, but I  couldn't get what I needed. . . . Enough of the disrespect. Enough with  the blatant disrespect. When a bank says, `We don't want your business  for any good reason. Why don't you move your account elsewhere?' it was  at that point, okay, something has to be done.''   The CFPB, under the leadership of a Trump appointee, settled the case  and agreed to a court-supervised timeline, resulting in the final rule  that the CFPB issued this year.   Now that the CFPB's rule has been finalized after all of these years,  so many other small businesses in Iowa, North Carolina, Texas,  California, and all across the country will be able to reap the  benefits of a more transparent lending marketplace that Ms. Young  should have had.   Specifically, the CFPB rule will allow small businesses to comparison  shop between lenders and see how much other small businesses are being  charged for their loans. This price transparency is essential to a  competitive and fair marketplace.   In designing the rule, the CFPB was mindful of its impact on  community financial institutions. For example, the rule completely  exempts lenders that originated fewer than 100 small business loans in  each of the 2 preceding years. This fully exempts more than 80 percent  of depository institutions, including 98 percent of credit unions. For  lenders that originated more than 100 loans, they would have more than  2 years before they would need to begin to comply with the rule in  2026.   Make no mistake, S.J. Res. 32 is just another part of Republicans'  relentless attack on the CFPB. They have erroneously claimed that the  CFPB is unconstitutional and unaccountable and have even gone so far as  to attempt to eliminate the agency altogether.                                time  0930    Our constituents disagree. A recent bipartisan poll found that 82  percent of  [[Page H6057]]  Americans, including 77 percent of Republicans, support the CFPB and  its mission.   I will highlight three main points about the CFPB small business  lending rule that this resolution would repeal. First, the data  collected under the rule is very similar to data collected under the  Home Mortgage Disclosure Act or HMDA.   This data collection under HMDA has been going on for decades,  successfully bringing much needed transparency to the mortgage market.  Despite misleading claims by Republicans, I want to be very clear that  small businesses are not--are not--are not required to provide  demographic information about their ownership under the rule. It is  completely voluntary.   I have to repeat that because too many on the opposite side of the  aisle are telling people that it is a mandate. It is not. It is  voluntary.   Second, this rule will help all small businesses thrive by providing  greater transparency that will drive competition in the small business  lending market ultimately increasing access to credit and lowering  interest rates for small businesses.   Third, as I mentioned earlier, we have seen how HMDA data from  mortgages have been instrumental to identifying discriminatory trends  like modern-day redlining. The CFPB's rule would similarly help prevent  discrimination in the small business lending market, giving our  regulators and the public another tool to identify discriminatory  trends.   Many of us also recall the challenges that too many small businesses  faced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, when Congress  stepped in to provide relief through the Paycheck Protection Program,  or PPP, the big banks that were tasked with implementing the program  chose to prioritize their concierge clients, including some Members of  Congress, leaving small businesses, especially those owned by people of  color, out in the cold.   It is perhaps not a coincidence that the same big banks who misused  PPP to the detriment of small businesses during the early stages of the  pandemic are now pushing for the passage of this Senate Joint  Resolution 32 opposing the CFPB, which would help them continue to  operate with a lack of transparency and avoid accountability.   However, the big banks are alone in their support for this misguided  resolution. In fact, more than 230 organizations representing small  businesses, family farmers, community leaders, and others strongly  oppose S.J. Res. 32.   There is a lot of talk in Congress about how we love small  businesses, how we support small businesses, but the proof of the  pudding is in the eating. Therefore, I urge Members on both sides of  the aisle to actually do something to help small businesses.   Stop talking about how you support small businesses when you know  they need access to capital that they don't have. We want to do  something real for small businesses. If you do, vote down this harmful  resolution.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez), the ranking member of  the Small Business Committee who has been working on the Small Business  Committee for over 30 years and served as the chair before the last  election and who has been fighting for small businesses all of her  career.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Mrs. Beatty), who is also the ranking member of the Subcommittee  on National Security, Illicit Finance, and International Financial  Institutions.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Ohio.    Madam Speaker, let me just say to the gentleman, your  arguments show that you are here to support the big banks who do not  want small business in the banks. They don't want to be bothered. As a  matter of fact, you try to be convincing that it is not voluntary, but  it is voluntary.   They are asked: Do you want to give this information? It is  voluntary, and you can't get away from that.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Garcia), who is also the vice ranking member of the Committee on  Financial Services.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib), the vice ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Housing and Insurance, who has been working on this issue for a long  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, we have these Members on the opposite side of the  aisle spending all of this time supporting the biggest, most profitable  banks in the country, yet these Members won't stand up for small  business lending. They don't want the data so that we can understand  what is going on and why people in this country, minorities in  particular, farmers, small farmers, family farmers, et cetera, can't  get loans.   In the last decade, these megabanks made so much money: J.P. Morgan,  $215 billion; Wells Fargo, $197 billion; Bank of America, $105 billion;  Citigroup, $93 billion. They repeatedly broke the law, even though they  were making all of this money. I want you to know they consider this  just the cost of doing business.   We have even more here when we take a look at some of the other banks  that paid fines instead of lending money. They would rather pay fines  instead of lending to small businesses. What kind of fines are we  talking about here? We fined them for all kinds of fraudulent activity.   In the last decade, megabanks made so much money, and then they  repeatedly paid fines. For example, the Bank of America paid $66  billion in fines. They could have been lending this to small  businesses. J.P. Morgan paid $43 billion in fines. They could have been  lending this to small businesses. Citigroup paid $19 billion in fines.  They could have been lending this to small businesses. Wells Fargo paid  $12 billion in fines.   Some of our Members want to say that we just want to shame these big  banks. Yes, I do because it is a shame that they are so profitable that  they do not want to spend time with small businesses. It takes up too  much time. Small businesses don't earn as much money for the bank, et  cetera. They don't even want them in their banks, and we have to do  something about that.   We are shining a light on the existing practices of lenders, and if  those lenders are charging minorities and small family farmers, et  cetera, exorbitant interest rates, there is no reason that we should  not get the transparency that we need to stop this.   I will tell you, one of the reasons you hear us being so passionate  over here is because the big banks don't need you to defend them. They  don't need you to stand up for them. You should be putting your time  and effort into what you can do about the small businesses.   I am not going to go into a lot of information. We have Members on  the opposite side of the aisle who felt they needed capital. When we  did PPP, they came to the government, competing with real small  businesses that could not get capital. Not only did they take out the  money, but they have been forgiven for it. They didn't have to pay it  back.   I am not going to talk about everybody, but I am going to mention  Marjorie Taylor Greene because she is everywhere talking about  everybody, claiming she is for small business. She took out $180,000,  and she has been forgiven.   I am not going to talk about the rest of them, some of my friends  over there, but I have a whole list of Members on the opposite side of  the aisle who took out PPP money and didn't need it, some of them as  rich as cream. They took this money, and they are not paying it back.  Then, they come in here and talk about why we should not have  transparency and do everything that we can for these small businesses  that are desperate for capital.   You can sing the song that you love small business all that you want.  You can have the Small Business Saturday with a big, fake kind of  operation on small business lending in your community, but it doesn't  do any good if they don't get the capital. They need the money. They  need to be treated fairly.   Yes, I want to shame the big banks. I want to shame them. You have  one of these banks that even took out false accounts, made up accounts,  and we had to stop them. We fined them, but do you know what? They are  too big to fail, and they keep doing what we are fining them for.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Yes, I am a political activist. I am an activist for the people who  send us here to represent them. I am an activist for the least of  these. I am an activist for small business. I am an activist for  veterans. I am an activist for children. I am an activist for  education, for better healthcare, and I am very proud of it.   I tell you, it is shameful for us to continue to be dominated and  controlled by the biggest banks in America, taking time on the floor of  the people's House to defend them and to vote  [[Page H6061]]  against the very people who send you to this House to represent them.  It is absolutely shameful.   It is time to get out from under the influence and control of the  biggest banks in America and stand up for the people who really need to  make these banks do what they should be doing rather than saying: No,  we are not going to comply with the law, and yes, we will pay the fines  because we are rich. We have so much money we can do that.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   When we started this debate, I mentioned ReShonda Young, who happens  to be a young, Black woman from Waterloo who had many challenges  getting a small business loan and sued the CFPB to complete the section  1071 rule. After CFPB settled the case with her, Ms. Young said: ``I am  just humbled to be part of the process. Sometimes we feel so small, but  this is one of those things that shows if we are willing to speak up,  we actually can make a difference.''   Ms. Young has since sold her business and is now working with other  investors to try to open up the first minority bank in Iowa, with the  goal of being certified as a CDFI, offering the kind of small business  loans to others that she had such a time obtaining.   Let me just tell you something. We support CDFIs, the community  development financial institutions. Why do we support them? Because  they could not get loans from the banks in America. Here we are, the  taxpayers, further trying to help small businesses by supporting these  community development financial institutions. They were developed  because small businesses couldn't get loans.   Then, on the opposite side of the aisle, we have people who are  opposing how we can support these small businesses by getting the  transparency that we need to have done. They would rather support the  biggest banks in America and have the taxpayers try to do something  about small businesses with CDFIs than give their small businesses an  opportunity.   I tell you, I don't know how they are going to vote on the other  side, but this issue is not going to go away. I tell you that the  constituents are going to learn in this country who is supporting small  businesses. All of this talk and this rhetoric about ``I love small  businesses,'' ``I support small businesses,'' will not continue to  work.   The fact of the matter is, small businesses are shutting down,  closing, because they don't have access to capital.   For all those Members on the opposite side of the aisle who took out  PPP loans that have been forgiven, you ought to be ashamed and not  oppose the CFPB from trying to protect these small banks, as the courts  have told them to do.                                time  1015    Madam Speaker, there is a lot more that can be said. We are going to  continue to unveil this information about who is simply spouting  rhetoric and who is actually doing something for small businesses.   It is unfortunate that we have to fight this hard. We have to do  everything that we possibly can because the banks don't want them in  their banks. They don't want to be bothered with them. They are too  small.   We have small businesses who only need $50,000 or $75,000 to improve  their technology to take their businesses to a place where they can  earn more money.   We can't even start to talk about startup capital. None of them get  startup capital. If they are able to convince anybody for a little  capital to expand their businesses, they will do that. Otherwise, small  businesses do not have the support of the Republicans in the House of  Representatives as it is seen here today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
