 Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise today in  celebration of the 35th anniversary of the Oakland Literacy Council.   Since the Oakland Literacy Council was formed in 1984, volunteers  have helped thousands of adult learners improve their literacy skills  with the simple method of one neighbor helping another.   The dedicated and trained volunteers of the Oakland Literacy Council  provide free basic literacy and English language instruction to adults  who live in Oakland County, Michigan.   For 35 years, the efforts of the Oakland Literacy Council have helped  residents, students, and workers improve their English language skills  so that they may communicate with their child's teacher, enhance their  skills for a GED or to become a citizen of the United States, and  improve their reading to receive promotions at work.   I commend the tireless work of the Oakland Literacy Council as it  continues to improve the lives of Oakland County residents and  strengthen the fabric of our southeastern Michigan community.                            ____________________
