 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, the legislation before us now, H.R. 1638, the Iranian  Leadership Asset Transparency Act, represents what the Republican  majority has become very good at doing, advancing bad public policy  while claiming to advance the public interest.   H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act, would  require the Secretary of the Treasury to report to Congress on the  estimated total assets under direct or indirect control of certain  senior Iranian leaders and other figures, along with a description of  how these assets were acquired and are employed, regardless of whether  such individuals are subject to U.S. sanctions.   Although increasing transparency into corrupt regimes is a laudable  goal, H.R. 1638 works counter not only to its own stated objectives,  but also U.S. national security interests.   First, the level of scrutiny that would be needed to produce a  credible report would place a very real strain on the Treasury  Department, diverting significant resources away from Treasury  investigators who are tasked with targeting conduct that is actually  sanctionable; implementing existing U.S. sanction programs; and  uncovering illicit conduct across the globe, including, importantly,  efforts to identify the web of business interests that continue to  enable North Korea to evade U.S. and international sanctions.   In addition to diverting scarce and critical resources, the bill's  required report will have little use as a compliance tool, given that  the most important parts would be classified, undercutting the  legislation's own stated objective to help make financial institutions'  required compliance with remaining sanctions more easily understood.   In fact, the creation of such a list, which would not be tied to any  prohibition or legal action, would more than likely create confusion  among the Office of Foreign Assets Control's regulated public and also  mislead companies to believe that the Treasury list replaces the due  diligence efforts that they should otherwise be doing prior to engaging  in business in Iran.   Moreover, because the report would be largely classified, the bill  would do little to draw the Iranian public's attention to the  corruption and unjust enrichment of their leaders, which is another  stated purpose of the bill. In fact, any classified portion would  inevitably be rejected by both the Iran regime and its people as U.S.  propaganda, and a predictable attack on the country's government by the  United States.   The true purpose of this legislation is to create reputational risk  for companies that might seek to do legitimate business with Iran. For  this reason, the bill would be a strategic mistake, as its report would  undoubtedly be seized upon by Iran as an intentional effort to  discourage international investment in Iran, which would be viewed by  Iran and likely by the major world powers who joined us in the JCPOA as  well as a violation of the expressed U.S. commitment under the nuclear  deal not to interfere with the full realization of the relief provided  to Iran under the accord.   When a nearly identical version of this bill was considered last  Congress, the Obama White House threatened to veto the bill, stating  that it would, ``endanger our ability to ensure Iran's nuclear program  is and remains exclusively peaceful.''   Moreover, the Obama administration cautioned that the report called  for in the bill would also compromise critical intelligence sources and  methods. On that score, I would also note that the reporting  requirement in the legislation calls for information about how  sanctions evasion and illicit conduct is practiced, and potential  countermeasures.   It seems far from prudent to give tips to our adversaries about how  we learn about their misconduct and how we plan to respond. This  legislation would have very limited practical utility, despite the huge  diversion of resources it would take to produce. It also fails to meet  its own stated objectives, including serving any usefulness as a  compliance tool.   Finally, the measure would also likely have a negative impact on the  continued viability of the nuclear deal, which is clearly a central  objective. I am hard-pressed to think of a single piece of legislation  that works so strongly against every single policy goal it claims to  advance. Few issues are more important to global peace and security  than preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. This bill would do  nothing to advance that goal. In fact, if enacted, it could do grave  damage to the important progress that has been made.   Mr. Chairman, I would urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to  the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck), who is a member of the  Financial Services Committee and who is my friend.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to  the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer), who is a longtime supporter  of diplomacy with Iran and a strong supporter of the nuclear deal.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I would like the author of this bill, Mr. Poliquin, and  perhaps the chairman of our committee, Mr. Hensarling, to answer the  question that I am about to propose, and that is this: We have allies  with us in this agreement. This is an agreement that was worked on for  a long time. We have Russia, China, Germany, England, and France. What  are our allies saying about our attempt to interfere with the  agreement?   What are they saying about whether or not we can be trusted to live  up to the commitments that we have made?   What are they saying about our attempts to add to, lengthen, and  create new, really, what have become obstacles to peace?   I would ask my friends on the opposite side of the aisle, as they  talk about targeting certain leaders--I don't know what leaders they  are talking about--and wanting to know about their assets and where  their assets came from and how they are being used, I ask my friends on  the opposite side of the aisle: Are you willing to do that for certain  leaders in our own country?   I just heard from one of the speakers, I believe it was Mr. Royce  from California, who identified the worth of one of the supposed  leaders. It seems to me that it did not nearly match the worth of many  of those who are in our Cabinet and who are in higher places in our  government. And I wonder what we are trying to do.   First, answer the question, if you will, about what our allies are  saying. And secondly, answer the question about disclosure as it  relates to those at the highest office in our country and those who are  serving in the Cabinet.   Also, when you talk about money laundering, answer the question about  the relationship between the leader of this country and Deutsche Bank,  that is known as a money laundering bank, that is involved with the  President of the United States.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the gentleman from Maine  (Mr. Poliquin) will give some information that I think is very  important to understand how this bill would work.   The gentleman who just spoke said that this has nothing to do with  the agreement. Then what is it you are adding to? What is it you are  trying to change or make better? If it has nothing to do with the  agreement, then why are we doing it?     I yield to the gentleman from Maine  to respond to that description of what this bill is all about.    Reclaiming my time, I thank you for  wanting to talk about something else, but I yielded to you to see if  you could help me with information about what was stated that the  gentleman who spoke before you said that this bill had nothing to do  with the agreement.    Is the gentleman prepared to respond  to the question that I have raised?   If you are going to talk about what this bill has to do with the  agreement, when the gentleman said it has nothing to do with the  agreement, then I yield to the gentleman from Maine.    Reclaiming my time, we know that  there are individuals who are sanctionable in the deal.   What I thought you were attempting to do is to expand that and to  identify more leaders and try and understand where the assets come  from, what they use them for, whether or not they are involved in money  laundering. But the gentleman said it had nothing to do with the deal.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    May I inquire as to how much time I  have remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I have here a  Statement of Administrative Policy from the previous President, where  he advised us when this bill came before the House before that it would  be vetoed by the administration.   I will read to you from one of the paragraphs in the veto message. He  said, in addition: ``This bill's required public postings also may be  perceived by Iran, and likely our Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action,  JCPOA, partners as an attempt to undermine the fulfillment of our  commitments, in turn, impacting the continued viability of this  diplomatic arrangement that peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran  from acquiring a nuclear weapon.''   If the JCPOA were to fail on that basis, it would remove the  unprecedented constraints on and monitoring of Iran's nuclear program,  lead to the unraveling of the international sanctions regime against  Iran, and deal a devastating blow to the credibility of America's  leadership and our commitments to our closest allies.   I think that is a very powerful statement. I do know that Iran is in  compliance. We have a very strict and strong monitoring program, and  they are in compliance.                                time  1545    So the questions become: If indeed they are in compliance, why would  we interfere with the plan? Why would we jeopardize this plan that has  been worked on with our strong allies in an attempt to try and find  another way to say that Iran must be scrutinized?   Everything in this plan has to do with discontinuing the development  of nuclear capability. I think we should respect the work that we have  done with our allies and discontinue all of these attempts to undermine  the deal that we have entered in with and caused our allies to distrust  us.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the  information that is being shared by my colleague, Mr. Poliquin. I am  going to yield more time to him to explain to me: The missiles that he  is describing in Iran, that are not a part of the deal, of the plan,  are they similar to the missiles that are being fired with nuclear  warheads from North Korea.  [[Page H9874]]         I yield to the gentleman from Maine.    Mr. Chairman, I said: The missiles  that he is referring to, that he is concerned about with Iran, that are  not a part of the plan, are they similar to the ballistic missiles that  are being fired from North Korea with nuclear warheads possibly on  them?    Are they more dangerous than the  missiles from North Korea?    Mr. Chairman, reclaiming       my time, I will tell Mr. Poliquin what difference it makes.   Here we are with threats from North Korea and the President of the  United States unwilling to be involved with diplomacy, who, rather,  would like to basically mimic and mock the leader of North Korea by  calling him ``Little Rocket Man,'' and by telling the Secretary of  State: Don't talk to him. It is no use to talk with him.   So here we have North Korea, who has already indicated that they have  missiles that will reach us right here in the United States, anywhere  in the United States, and Mr. Poliquin is telling me about his concern  about missiles in Iran that are not a part of the nuclear deal.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to  how much time I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a statement from J Street that  is in opposition to this legislation.                                                       J Street,                                                  December 12, 2017.      Members of the U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Members of Congress: J Street urges Members to oppose       H.R. 1638 and H.R. 4324, which would undermine or violate the       Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) on Iran's nuclear       activities.        J Street again urges Members to oppose the ``Iranian       Leadership Asset Transparency Act'' (H.R. 1638). As we noted       in our statement opposing the bill when it was introduced       last year, it risks harming the U.S. Government's ability to       ensure Iranian and third party compliance with the agreement       and to counter Iran's dangerous non-nuclear behavior by       redirecting and tying up the very USG personnel and resources       charged with those tasks.        J Street also urges Members to oppose the so-called       ``Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access to Finance Act''       (H.R. 4324), which is clearly intended to lead to a U.S.       violation of the JCPOA.        This bill would impose additional certification       requirements on the administration in order to carry out       current U.S. obligations related to commercial aircraft sales       under the JCPOA. These new obligations require the       administration to certify that Iran is not engaged in certain       non-nuclear activity, or issue a national security waiver       saying they'll allow the planes to be sold anyway. In other       words, it imposes new, unilateral terms for continuation of       the JCPOA that are unrelated to Iran's nuclear conduct.        It has been widely reported in connection with the       president's recent refusal to make the necessary       certification to Congress under the Iran Nuclear Agreement       Review Act that the president resents having to undertake       official actions to keep the United States in compliance with       the JCPOA. Proponents of this legislation clearly hope to       make use of the president's apparent resistance to taking       such steps by adding a new certification requirement that       they hope he will also fail to meet--thereby blocking the       sale of commercial aircraft and forcing a U.S. violation of       the agreement.        Anyone doubting that this is the point of the bill need       look no further than the first finding, which makes clear       that this bill is a gratuitously anti-Obama, anti-JCPOA       vehicle, and not a serious.     Mr. Chairman, I also include in the  Record a Statement of Administration Policy from the previous Obama  administration, which I read a paragraph from.                     Statement of Administration Policy             H.R. 5461--Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act         The Administration shares the Congress' goals of increasing       transparency and bringing Iran into compliance with       international standards in the global fight against terror       finance and money laundering. However, this bill would be       counterproductive toward those shared goals.        The bill requires the U.S. Government to publicly report       all assets held by some of Iran's highest leaders and to       describe how these assets are acquired and used. Rather than       preventing terrorist financing and money laundering, this       bill would incentivize those involved to make their financial       dealings less transparent and create a disincentive for       Iran's banking sector to demonstrate transparency. These       onerous reporting requirements also would take critical       resources away from the U.S. Department of the Treasury's       important work to identify Iranian entities engaged in       sanctionable conduct. Producing this information could also       compromise intelligence sources and methods.        One of our best tools for impeding destabilizing Iranian       activities has been to identify Iranian companies that are       controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC)       or other Iranians on the list of Specially Designated       Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List) to non-U.S.       businesses, so that they can block assets or stop material       transfers. This process is labor-intensive and requires the       judicious use of our national intelligence assets.       Redirecting these assets to preparing this onerous public       report would be counterproductive and will not reduce       institutional corruption or promote transparency within       Iran's system.        In addition, this bill's required public postings also may       be perceived by Iran and likely our Joint Comprehensive Plan       of Action (JCPOA) partners as an attempt to undermine the       fulfilment of our commitments, in turn impacting the       continued viability of this diplomatic arrangement that       peacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a       nuclear weapon. If the JCPOA were to fail on that basis, it       would remove the unprecedented constraints on and monitoring       of Iran's nuclear program, lead to the unraveling of the       international sanctions regime against Iran, and deal a       devastating blow to the credibility of America's leadership       and our commitments to our closest allies.        As we address our concerns with Iran's nuclear program       through implementation of the JCPOA, the Administration       remains clear-eyed regarding Iran's support for terrorism,       its ballistic missile program, human rights abuses, and       destabilizing activity in the region. The United States       should retain all of the tools needed to counter this       activity, ranging from powerful sanctions to our efforts to       disrupt and interdict illicit shipments of weapons and       proliferation-sensitive technologies. This bill would       adversely affect the U.S. Government's ability to wield these       tools, would undermine the very goals it purports to achieve,       and could even endanger our ability to ensure that Iran's       nuclear program is and remains exclusively peaceful.        If the President were presented with H.R. 5461, his senior       advisors would recommend that he veto this bill.     Mr. Chairman, we are opposed to this  bill not because we are not concerned about the security of our country  and security of our allies in the Middle East. The Members on the  opposite side of the aisle don't care any more than we care, but we  respect when our leadership and our country gets involved and  negotiates with another country, such as they have done with Iran, and  they come to some agreements. We would like our country to live up to  the agreement.   When we have included in that agreement a description of the  monitoring that will be done, and when that monitoring is being carried  out, and when it is represented to us by those that we have in charge  of that monitoring that that country, Iran, is in compliance, we  believe them. And when we trust our negotiators, when we trust our  country, when we trust our leadership, and Iran is in compliance, there  is no reason to try and undo the deal. There is no reason to come  behind the agreement and what has been negotiated and begin to think of  ways that they believe we ought to expand that agreement. We could, in  the Congress of the United States, come up with a new idea every day.  With all of the Members of this House, with all of the different  thoughts and, possibly, ideas, and everybody thinking they are smarter  than everybody else, we could come up with all kinds of plans to  interfere with that agreement.  [[Page H9875]]    But I would advise the Members of this House and the Members on the  opposite side of the aisle that they do not need to do this. This is a  bad idea. I would advise them to put faith in the negotiations that  have gone on and to accept the representations about compliance that we  are being given. We are being assured that not only is the monitoring  taking place, but Iran is in compliance.   So, again, I am so worried about our role in this country today and  the fact that our leadership is being diminished day by day because of  the way that our President and the White House is handling our  relationships with other countries. As a matter of fact, we see a  President that is endangering us and destroying relationships  constantly.   I mention that we have in this deal Russia, China, Germany, England,  and France. I asked the question: What are our allies in this agreement  saying about our attempts to interfere with the agreement? Do they  agree with them? Are they consulted? Are they unhappy about what is  being done?   I suppose they could do the same in their countries every day. They  could come up with new ways to interfere with the agreement. They could  begin to ask questions about us and why we are doing what we are doing.  They could even ask questions about why are we concerned about the  assets of those who are not sanctionable when we are not concerned  about the assets of our own President.   Mr. Chairman, this is Mr. Poliquin's bill. He wants to know about the  assets of leaders in Iran.   Has he seen his President's tax returns? Does he know about his  assets? Does he know about where they have come from? Does he know  about how they are utilized?   I don't think so.   So I think it is very, very important for us to do everything that we  can to have our allies trust us, to live up to the deals that we make,  not to ask more of others than we are willing to do ourselves, no.   We are not sponsors of terrorism. We are a people who have always  tried to avoid war. Unfortunately, we have engaged in it, and we know  that it is not the best answer to trying to deal with the problems that  we encounter around the world. I do believe that we honestly try to  avoid war and that we work for peace.   This is working for peace, and peace in the Middle East is one of the  most important goals that we should have. I see the opportunities for  that eroding every day.   So I would ask Mr. Poliquin to think about what he is doing. I  believe that his intentions are good, but I think it is a bad bill.   Mr. Chairman, I ask for a ``no'' vote on this bill. It is not needed.  I think it creates problems with our allies, and they begin to wonder  whether or not they can trust us. We are an honorable people and we are  leaders in the world, even though it is being questioned more and more.   Mr. Chairman, I ask Members to vote ``no'' on this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to  the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Himes), a senior member of the  Financial Services Committee and the Intelligence Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1  minute to the gentleman from Connecticut.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4324, the Strengthening Oversight of Iran's Access  to Finance Act, would impose a new and unilateral certification  requirement on the administration in order to meet current U.S.  obligations under the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint  Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, with respect to the sale and  financing of commercial passenger aircraft to Iran.   This certification requirement would call for the Treasury Secretary  to consider factors that fall well outside the scope of the nuclear  deal and beyond the specific conditions that the U.S. is allowed to  place on the license of commercial aircraft to Iran under the nuclear  accord.   By moving the goal posts on our commitments under the deal, H.R. 4324  clearly aims to force the United States into a violation of the  agreement. Under the Iran nuclear deal, the United States is broadly  committed to allow for the sale of commercial passenger aircraft and  related parts and services to Iran. This involves licensing the sale of  aircraft and related parts and services to Iran, including the  financing for such sales.   Under the JCPOA Annex II, the only condition on the U.S. commitment  is that licensed items and services must be used exclusively for  commercial passenger aviation. Moreover, the only allowable conditions  the U.S. can place on authorizations for the sale of commercial  passenger aircraft to Iran apply to the licensed aircraft themselves  and the use of such licensed aircraft, not on activities or services  provided that have no relationship to the licensed aircraft or related  goods or services.   Yet, H.R. 4324 would impose new conditions on the licensed sale of  aircraft to Iran, including, notably, the condition that the recipient  airline has not used nonlicensed aircraft for purposes other than  commercial passenger aviation. That is, under this bill, the  administration would have to certify that Iran is not engaged in  certain activity unrelated to Iran's nuclear conduct but also unrelated  to the use of the aircraft itself. If the Treasury Secretary is unable  to make such a difficult certification, the Secretary must then report  to Congress as to whether the Secretary intends to suspend, revoke,  amend, or approve, notwithstanding such noncertification, any license  facilitating the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran.    Supporters of the bill will likely note that the bill will not  require the Secretary of the Treasury to suspend or revoke an  authorization in the event that the Secretary is unable to make the  necessary certification, but the obvious political conclusion is that  the Secretary will be forced to revoke such license if the Secretary is  unwilling to make the certification.   As we have now seen, the President detests the fact that his  administration has to take affirmative steps to keep the deal in place,  and he refused to do so. In the case of the last recurring 90-day  congressional certification requirement, proponents of this bill  undoubtedly hope Trump will react the same way to these additional  certifications and block the sale of commercial aircraft, which is a  key element of the deal.   In a break from reason and logic, this legislation plays directly  into the hands of the President, who is desperate to find any pretext  to say that Iran is in violation of the deal or to force Iran to walk  away, and thereby, avoid having to take the blame for pulling the plug  on the deal.   But let me be clear. By seeking to render impermissible that which is  expressly permitted by the JCPOA, the legislation is clearly intended  to undermine the nuclear agreement.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to  the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Heck), a member of the Financial  Services Committee, so he can clear up some of the information that we  just heard.    I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from Washington.    Mr. Speaker, I would like everybody  to know we are not trying to shame anybody. If we were going to shame  someone, we would shame them and that party about connection to Russia.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Price), an ardent supporter of the Iran nuclear agreement.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to read a letter addressed to the Members of  Congress from a highly respected organization that is pro-Israel and  pro-peace advocacy. I am a member, and I look to the recommendations,  the advice, and  [[Page H9887]]  the assistance of this organization on all issues related to the Middle  East and related to Iran and related to Israel. It is known as J  Street, and I am a proud member and a proud participant.   J Street urges Members:         Oppose the so-called Strengthening Oversight of Iran's       Access to Finance Act, that is H.R. 4324, which is clearly       intended to lead to a U.S. violation of the JCPOA.        This bill would impose additional certification       requirements on the administration in order to carry out       current U.S. obligations related to commercial aircraft sales       under the JCPOA.        These new obligations require the administration to certify       that Iran is not engaged in certain nonnuclear activity or       issue a national security waiver saying they will allow the       planes to be sold anyway. In other words, it imposes new       unilateral terms for a continuation of the JCPOA that are       unrelated to Iran's nuclear conduct.        It has been widely reported in connection with the       President's recent refusal to make the necessary       certification to Congress under the Iran Nuclear Agreement       Review Act that the President resents having to undertake       official actions to keep the United States in compliance with       the JCPOA.        Proponents of this legislation clearly hope to make use of       the President's apparent resistance to taking such steps by       adding a new certification requirement that they hope he will       also fail to meet, thereby blocking the sale of commercial       aircraft and forcing a U.S. violation of the agreement.        Anyone doubting that this is the point of the bill need       look no further than the first finding, which makes clear       that this bill is a gratuitously anti-Obama, anti-JCPOA       vehicle and not a serious attempt to legislate on a       bipartisan basis on threats emanating from Iran.        No one who wants to see the JCPOA continue to be       implemented should support this bill.    Finally, Mr. Speaker, Dylan Williams, the vice president of  government affairs who signed this bill, said:         Congress just gave the administration powerful tools to       conquer other countries, support of the Assad regime when it       passed new sanctions on Iran, Russia, and North Korea a few       months ago that the President signed into law. Implementation       and assessment of the impact of that law should occur before       consideration of any new sanctions legislation.    Again, in addition to the supporters of this body who have worked  very hard to try and convince the Members of this body to be on the  side of peace, to try and get the Members to understand the seriousness  of undermining the JCPOA, the Members of this body who work very hard  for peace and who join with groups like J Street and advocate for peace  are trying to make sure that the United States stands up to its  agreements, understanding how this undermines our leadership in the  world.   If we sit down and we negotiate with other countries, as we have done  on the JCPOA, and they expect us to live up to the agreements and then  they hear that we have various Members of Congress with ideas of their  own putting together legislation that is supported by the opposite side  of the aisle, coming in not with one piece of legislation, not with two  pieces of legislation, but we don't know how many will continue if they  are successful in passing the legislation that they are putting before  us, if this continues, then I am certain that our allies will not trust  us. They will not want to negotiate with us on other deals that are  important to peace in this world. I would simply ask the Members on the  opposite side of the aisle to pay attention to highly respected,  credible organizations like J Street and take their advice about how to  give support to the JCPOA.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time I have left.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   On October 13, 2017, the Director General of the International Atomic  Energy Agency--that is, the IAEA, the U.N. nuclear watchdog that, since  January 2016, has been monitoring and verifying Iran's implementation  of its nuclear-related commitments--released a statement noting that,  ``At present, Iran is subject to the world's most robust nuclear  verification regime,'' confirming that Iran remains in compliance with  its JCPOA commitments.   The same day, President Trump announced that he had refused to  certify the national security value of the Iran nuclear deal, which  gave Congress 60 days to fatally undermine the agreement by re- introducing some or all of the suspended sanctions; although, Congress  did not do so.   Despite the fact that the President did not withdraw from the nuclear  accord, his disdain for the agreement has always been clear. In a  highly confrontational speech, President Trump forcefully denounced the  Islamic republic and attacked the deal for failing to curb Iran's  destabilizing regional activities, despite the fact the accord was  never meant to address every aspect of Iran's maligned activities. It  was always intended to focus on Iran's nuclear program.   As an arms control agreement, the deal has, so far, been successful.                                time  1830    Trump has threatened to upend the nuclear deal unless Congress amends  it to make its terms more restrictive. The President is looking to find  any rationale he can to walk away from the deal without having to take  the blame. This legislation is precisely what he has been looking for.   But American unilateralism, at this point, would be a disaster and  would make forging a common front against Iran nearly impossible in the  future. That is one way of ensuring failure at the outset of a  diplomatic effort to pursue a new multilateral agreement, would be to  violate an existing one with the same partners.   The President's insistence on renegotiating the JCPOA to extend the  duration of several of its constraints make inspections more intrusive  and expand its coverage to missiles. It is dangerous and unrealistic,  given that every other signatory of the agreement has objected to  changing its terms while Iran remains compliant.   If Congress passes this bill, it would give the administration the  path it needs to rip up the nuclear card without the constraints placed  on Iran by the deal. The administration's hostile attitude towards Iran  and stark absence of diplomacy will inevitably put the United States on  a path of escalation with Iraq. There is an obvious link with North  Korea here as well. Hopefully, at some point, the President may  determine that diplomacy has a role in managing the North Korean  nuclear missile challenges.   But America's ability to offer a credible, diplomatic path will be  seriously undermined if we cannot be trusted to stand by our agreement  dealing with Iran to destabilize regional activities. Its ambition to  remake large swaths of the Middle East in its image entails a broad  range of challenges. Without the JCPOA, however, those challenges  become even more daunting.   I urge my colleagues not to give up on our best chance of containing  Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons through peaceful means and to join me  in rejecting this terrible bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend  their remarks and to include extraneous material on the subject of my  Special Order.    Madam Speaker, for the past several  days, there has been an organized attempt to discredit and undermine  the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller. I rise today to speak on  behalf of many Members of Congress who believe Special Counsel Mueller  is doing a great job.   At this time, I am circulating a letter, and other Members of  Congress are joining me. This is a letter of support for Special  Counsel Mueller urging that he not be interfered with and that he is  allowed to continue this very important investigation in the interest  of the security of our country.   I will be circulating this letter for another 24 hours. However, at  this time, I would like to read the contents of the letter into the  Record. This, again, is a letter in support of Special Counsel Mueller.  The letter is addressed to the Honorable Rod J. Rosenstein, Deputy  Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice.   The letter reads as follows:         Dear Deputy Attorney General,        We write to express our support for the work of Special       Counsel Robert S. Mueller, III, and to urge you to ensure       that he be allowed to continue his investigation--unfettered       by political influence or threats to his authority--to its       natural and appropriate conclusion based on the law, the       facts, and the evidence.        The Special Counsel is Conducting a Methodical       Investigation, Yielding Results.        It is unimaginable that Republicans would seek to       intervene, discredit, obstruct, or terminate the special       counsel's investigation. Thus far, from every public       indication, it appears that Mr. Mueller is conducting a       thorough and methodical investigation. He and his       investigators have not sought, and instead avoided, the       public spotlight. His team has not leaked or hinted at       criminal allegations for which they have yet to develop       charges. Furthermore, the charges that have been filed to       date have been sufficiently strong and well founded as to       elicit guilty pleas from President Donald Trump's former       National Security Advisor, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn,       and a former policy adviser to Donald Trump's Presidential       campaign, George Papadopoulos.        The Appointment of a Special Counsel Was Necessary and       Proper.        As you know, pursuant to U.S. Department of Justice Order       Number 3915-2017, which you issued on May 17, 2017, Mr.       Mueller was appointed to serve as special counsel and       authorized to conduct an investigation into matters,       ``including any links and/or coordination between the Russian       Government and individuals associated with the campaign of       President Donald Trump; and any matters that arose or may       arise directly from the investigation; and any other matters       within the scope of 28 CFR 600.4(a),'' which includes       ``authority to investigate and prosecute Federal crimes       committed in the course of, and  [[Page H9897]]       with intent to interfere with, the special counsel's       investigation, such as perjury, obstruction of justice,       destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses.''                                time  1945         Your decision to appoint a special counsel to conduct such       an investigation was necessary and proper, given the U.S.       intelligence community's assessment that ``Russian President       Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at       the U.S. Presidential election, the consistent goals of which       were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic       process'' and that ``Putin and the Russian Government       developed a clear preference for President Trump''; the       obvious potential that individuals, who had served on       President Donald J. Trump's campaign, as well as individuals       currently serving as political appointees in the Trump       administration, could be targets of, or witnesses in, any       such investigation; and Attorney General Jeff Sessions       recused himself from ``any matters related in any way to the       campaigns for President of the United States.''        The Selection of Robert S. Mueller III to Serve As Special       Counsel Was Very Much Appropriate.        Under the circumstances described above, your selection of       Robert Mueller to serve as the special counsel to conduct the       investigation was an appropriate and commendable decision.       Mr. Mueller has earned a reputation as a nonpartisan,       professional investigator, making him an ideal choice to lead       the investigation into the highly important, complex, and       sensitive matters to which he has been charged. Mr. Mueller's       record demonstrates that he would not allow bias, influence,       or other extraneous considerations to impact his       investigation, and any suggestion otherwise is just not       credible.        Mr. Mueller is a former Director of the Federal Bureau of       Investigation, FBI, who was originally appointed by a       Republican President. He was vetted and, twice, unanimously       confirmed by the Senate. Specifically, when appointed in 2001       by President George W. Bush, Mueller was confirmed as FBI       Director by a vote of 98-0 in the Senate, and when Mueller       was nominated for a second term, in 2011, during President       Barack Obama's administration, he was again unanimously       confirmed in the Senate by a vote of 100-0.        Mr. Mueller has earned bipartisan support. Republican       Members of the Senate attested to Mr. Mueller's integrity and       professionalism during Mr. Mueller's confirmation hearings,       which took place on July 30 and 31, 2001. For example, with       regard to Mr. Mueller's nomination to serve as FBI Director,       then Senator, now Attorney General, Jeff Sessions stated:        ``It is great to see Mr. Mueller, nominated to take one of       the most important positions in our country. It is a position       that requires, in my view, serious experience, great       integrity, and a proven record of accomplishment. And you       have all of those things, Robert Mueller. When I was in the       Department of Justice, Robert Mueller's reputation was known       throughout the Department of Justice, and he was known not       for any political reason, but because he was recognized as a       professional's professional, a man whose skill at doing the       job assigned to him was second to none. There is no doubt in       my mind that there is no more professional prosecutor, no       more professional person in America with experience in the       Department of Justice, ready to handle the job of FBI       Director than Robert Mueller.''        Likewise, Senator Mitch McConnell stated: ``I believe Mr.       Mueller will provide strong and effective leadership. Mr.       Mueller has both impressive management and law enforcement       experience. He is well-schooled in avoiding the problems and       pitfalls inherent in criminal investigations and       prosecutions. Mr. Mueller is not `of' the FBI, and therefore       I believe institutional loyalty will not blind him to making       the hard'' decision he needs to make.        Senator McConnell also expressed his belief that Mr.       Mueller's commitment ``to vigorously enforcing the law       without regard to politics or partisanship.''        Speaker of the House Paul Ryan has also commented on Mr.       Mueller's lack of partisan bias. As reported in a July 24,       2017, Washington Examiner article, Speaker Ryan said: ``I       don't think many people are saying Robert Mueller is a biased       partisan. He's really, sort of, anything but.''        On October 11, 2017, Kenneth Starr, who was appointed in       1994 as the independent counsel who was tasked with       investigations involving President Bill Clinton and then       First Lady Hillary Clinton, commented on Robert Mueller and       the manner in which his investigation is proceeding. Mr.       Starr stated that Mr. Mueller is conducting his investigation       ``aggressively and professionally.'' Mr. Starr also stated:       ``We're not seeing `leaks' out of the investigation as far as       we know, and what we know of Bob Mueller and his background       is that he is someone of total, rock-ribbed integrity.''        Regulations Limiting the Removal of a Special Counsel Must       Be Followed.        Mr. Mueller must be allowed to complete his investigation       and should not be threatened with removal. However, a few       Republicans have indicated their support for Mr. Mueller, for       his ouster. Notwithstanding the overwhelming reasons for Mr.       Mueller to be allowed to continue and complete his       investigation, the rule of law demands that the Trump       administration follow executive branch regulations, which       restrict the circumstances under which a special counsel can       be removed. Specifically, 28 CFR 600.7(d) regarding the       removal or discipline of a special counsel provides: ``The       special counsel may be disciplined or removed from office       only by the personal action of the Attorney General. The       Attorney General may remove a special counsel for misconduct,       dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for       other good cause, including violation of departmental       policies. The Attorney General shall inform the special       counsel in writing of the specific reason for his or her       removal.''        Since Attorney General Sessions is recused, you, in your       capacity as acting Attorney General--that is, Mr.       Rosenstein--regarding Special Counsel Mueller's       investigation, are the only individual empowered to remove       Mr. Mueller under regulation. Furthermore, the regulation       clearly states that Mr. Mueller may only be removed for good       cause, which has not been demonstrated. The administration is       required to follow its own regulations and not remove Mr.       Mueller from his investigation.        Politically Motivated Challenges of Special Counsel Mueller       and His Investigation Must Not Be Allowed to Threaten the       Investigation.        Despite Special Counsel Mueller's investigation of       integrity, as attested to by these Republican leaders, and       despite the clear progress that Mr. Mueller is making in his       investigation, the rightwing media, some Republican Members       of Congress, and Donald Trump, himself, have attempted to       advance a false narrative that Special Counsel Mueller's       investigation is biased--this is what they say--and some have       advocated for Mr. Mueller's removal. On June 15, 2017,       referring in general terms to the Russia investigation,       President Trump stated on social media: ``You are witnessing       the single greatest witch hunt in American political       history--led by some very bad and conflicted people.''        In Congress, four Republican Members, led by Representative       Matt Gaetz and including former Representative Trent Franks,       who has now resigned amidst an Ethics Committee investigation       into his own conduct, have cosponsored a resolution calling       for Mueller to step down. Those Members have attempted to       advance baseless claims of the existence of a conflict due to       Mr. Mueller's previous service as FBI Director. Those       arguments do not have merit, and appear intended, at best, to       redirect the public's focus toward matters that are wholly       unrelated to the investigation to which Mr. Mueller has been       tasked. At worst, those arguments are intended to stop or       preemptively tarnish the perception of the special counsel's       work. The issues referenced in that Republican resolution       pertain to allegations against former President Bill Clinton       and former Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton related to       a 2009-2010 matter, which has nothing to do with Mr.       Mueller's directive to investigate ``links and/or       coordination between the Russian Government and individuals       associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.''        As quoted in a December 12, 2017, Politico article,       Representative Matt Gaetz stated that he told President Trump       that he was ``concerned'' that Mr. Mueller's investigation       ``was infected with bias.'' Representative Gaetz said the       President responded: ``That's why you guys have got to do       your job.'' Representative Gaetz further stated that he       informed the President that you would be testifying--that is,       Mr. Rosenstein--before the House Judiciary Committee on       December 13, 2017, in response to which Representative Gaetz       said President Trump ``encouraged us to exercise our       oversight responsibilities.'' This conversation, as described       by Representative Gaetz, suggests that President Trump is       encouraging the ring leaders of the recent criticisms against       Mr. Mueller in order to pressure you to affect the       investigation through the congressional oversight process.       That is unacceptable.        Some have alleged that Mr. Mueller's removal of a member of       this team, Peter Strzok, over text messages sent by Mr.       Strzok that were critical of President Trump suggests bias or       a lack of objectivity on the special counsel's team. However,       upon learning of the text messages, Mr. Mueller immediately       removed Mr. Strzok from the investigation. In reality, this       incident and Mr. Mueller's swift response demonstrates Mr.       Mueller's integrity as well as his desire and commitment to       conduct an investigation that is beyond reproach.        You must not allow the targets of the investigation, or       issues being investigated, to escape thorough independent       inquiry through the removal, or hindrance, of the special       counsel. We thank you, Mr. Rosenstein, for your careful       attention to this matter, and we stand ready to support you       in upholding the rule of law.    This, ladies and gentlemen, is the letter that I am circulating to  Mr. Rosenstein. This is the letter that is being signed on by other  Members of Congress. This is the letter that I will circulate for the  next 24 hours so that we will give Members the opportunity to sign on  to this letter.                                time  2000    This letter should be on your desk very soon.  [[Page H9898]]    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio, Representative  Marcy Kaptur, who signed up to speak here this evening.    Madam Speaker, I yield to  Representative Jackson Lee.    Madam Speaker, I thank both of the  Members of Congress who came down here this evening and shared in the  information that we are going to forward to Rod Rosenstein because it  is so important that we let him know that our special counsel has  support. We appreciate what he is doing and we are going to stand with  him.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
