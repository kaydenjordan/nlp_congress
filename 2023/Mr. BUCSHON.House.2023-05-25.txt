 Mr. Chair, I support Mr. Miller's amendment, which would  require the Attorney General to issue interim final rules to implement  this act 6 months after the date of enactment.   Fentanyl-related substances will still be permanently placed in  schedule I immediately. They should be placed there.   This amendment would accelerate the timeline for which the Attorney  General would be required to issue the interim final rule and,  therefore, speed up the implementation process.   I believe this amendment improves the bill and is necessary,  especially at a time when fentanyl has become the leading cause of  death for 18- to 45-year-olds.   I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment will provide clarity that  research conducted by the Department of Defense is included in the  research registration process outlined in the bill.   It also requires the Office of the Inspector General at the  Department of Justice to study and report on its findings.   The research provisions in the HALT Fentanyl Act align the research  registration process for schedule I drugs with those of schedule II.   This is imperative for the research community to better understand  how certain schedule I drugs affect people's health.   This amendment strengthens the bill, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on  this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment, and I  yield myself such time as I may consume.   First of all, I thank the gentlewoman for sharing her story. These  are stories from across America. I empathize with her story, and I am  thankful that her mother is in recovery.   Mr. Chair, this amendment would prevent the underlying bill from  taking effect until the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the  Attorney General each certify that this bill will lead to a reduction  in overdose deaths.   In 2021, nearly 108,000 people died of drug overdoses, 71,000 of  which were from synthetic opioids, including fentanyl or fentanyl- related substances. That equates to nearly 200 fentanyl-related deaths  per day.   This amendment is a poison pill that would allow the Biden  administration to indefinitely delay the permanent scheduling of  fentanyl-related substances, which means after the temporary scheduling  order expires at the end of 2024, if HHS or the AG has chosen not to  act, these fentanyl-related substances could become street legal.   Mr. Chair, I don't want to take that chance. Permanently placing  fentanyl-related substances into schedule I is the Drug Enforcement  Administration's top legislative priority.   The numbers are heartbreaking. We need to act now to pass the HALT  Fentanyl Act to keep fentanyl-related substances off our streets and  out of our communities.   In terms of further steps to address overdose deaths, I am glad the  Energy and Commerce Committee has led the way and will continue to do  so.   Last Congress, the House passed legislation with broad bipartisan  support to reauthorize many key use disorder and treatment programs.  This summer Energy and Commerce plans to examine the impact of the  SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, passed with broad bipartisan  support 5 years ago, to address the opioid crisis.   However, we don't need to wait. Let's pass the HALT Fentanyl Act now,  which adds fentanyl-related substances to schedule I upon passage  rather than ceding authority to the Biden administration on when this  should be effective.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, we need to implement the HALT Fentanyl  Act now. Any further delay, including the Biden administration slow- walking its implementation, is unacceptable. I again urge a ``no'' vote  on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Mills) having assumed the chair, Mr. Mast, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 467) to  amend the Controlled Substances Act with respect to the scheduling of  fentanyl-related substances, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________
