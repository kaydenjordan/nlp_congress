 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the  underlying bill. The bill, in fact, does weaken critical screening of  potential CBP officers, and our country actually should be working to  increase the security relative to CBP. CBP is essential. It is our  first line of defense to stop terrorists, to stop drugs, to stop  dangerous persons coming in, and we should not weaken our standards.   Now, the overwhelming majority of CBP officers are honest,  hardworking public servants. Crime and corruption has, however, been a  persistent problem for the agency. Numerous CBP officers have been  found to have strong connections to organized crime, including drug  cartels. They are in prison now.   In many cases, cartels try and infiltrate the CBP by recruiting  people to apply for CBP positions. This results in illicit drug  smuggling and other dangerous activities.   In 2015, the CBP Integrity Advisory Panel found that--and this is a  quote--``arrests for corruption of CBP personnel far exceed, on a per  capita basis, such arrests at other Federal law enforcement agencies.''   In 2016, this same panel observed that ``corrupt CBP law enforcement  personnel pose a national security threat.'' And it recommended that  the current polygraph test be expanded, not reduced.   Now, this bill allows for an exemption for local law enforcement and  former members of the Armed Forces from the polygraph requirement. For  example, if a polygraph has been taken in the prior 10 years, I think  it is a mistake to think that that will protect us.   In fact, the Inspector General at DHS, John Roth, advises against  this bill. He explained that the polygraph changes, including this  legislation--and this is a quote--``could put CBP at significant  risk.''   He says: ``While it may sound reasonable to say you could waive  requirements from former military personnel because they have passed a  polygraph, Border Patrol agents work in a different environment that is  not as controlled as the military.''   Now, it is important to note that, of the applicants for the CBP,  two-thirds fail the polygraph test. That may be a concern, but we ought  to be glad that people who are a risk are not actually hired by the  CBP.   I will just note that the Government Accountability Office advises  that, between 2005 and 2012, there were 2,170 reported incidents of  arrest of CBP personnel for misconduct. That is about one arrest a day  of CBP officials.   CBP's own Integrity Advisory Panel, and these are law enforcement  experts, outside law enforcement experts, concluded in 2015 that  ``there is data indicating that arrests for corruption of CBP personnel  far exceed, on a per capita basis, such arrests at other Federal law  enforcement agencies.'' And in its final report, that panel recommended  that the current polygraph testing be expanded to include  postemployment tests that are best practices at the FBI and agencies in  the U.S. intelligence service.   Now, I will just give you some examples that are real life examples  from CBP, and this is from the agency itself. These are individuals who  could be exempted.   An officer who, when faced with a polygraph, admitted possession of  approximately 100 videos and 10,000 still images of child pornography.   A police officer who admitted to sexual assault.    An Afghan veteran who had classified information that he  admitted he had taken out of theater.   An Army officer who would meet the criteria who admitted that he had  removed classified information from Iraq.   A police officer who admitted that he had smuggled marijuana into  detention centers.   It is not too big a burden to ask that applicants have a polygraph  test and be clean.                                time  1245    The Sinaloa cartel is recruiting people to apply to become CBP  officers. Our protection is to make sure that we completely screen  every single applicant so that the cartel is unsuccessful in  infiltrating our first line of defense at the U.S. borders.   So, with that, I know that the authors are well-intentioned, but this  is a serious mistake for the security of our country, and I urge  Members to vote against the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I do not at all question the intentions of  the proponents of this bill. I understand that the entire rationale is  to expedite hiring because of the vast number of vacancies. I do,  however, question the wisdom of this approach.   I think it is worth noting that, currently, two-thirds of the  applicants for CBP fail the polygraph test; and that is important not  as a barrier, but because that polygraph test reveals misconduct that  makes them ineligible.   Now, the current Department of Homeland Security inspector general,  John Roth, has expressed strong reservations about polygraph changes,  the waivers, and, specifically, about these bills. He indicates that we  need to identify other ways to make hiring more efficient ``without  sacrificing integrity and effectiveness.'' And, in fact, the DHS OIG is  currently auditing the CBP polygraph program, as is the GAO.   If you take a look at the bill, it allows for exemptions of the  polygraph to certain categories of people, one of which is law  enforcement officers who have undergone a polygraph examination as a  condition of employment within the past 10 years. Well, you know, there  was actually a Freedom of Information request on who flunked the  polygraph tests in the CBP, and what has come out is that people who  fall into this exemption admitted conduct that would make them  ineligible, including child pornography, smuggling of drugs, theft.   It is fine to say that this would only be used when you knew that  there wasn't a problem. The problem with that argument is sometimes you  don't find out what the problem is until you subject the applicant to a  polygraph or they know that they are about to be subjected to a  polygraph, in which case, they own up.   So the Border Patrol is to be honored; they do a great job for us.  But we know that the Sinaloa drug cartel is trying to recruit  applicants. The last thing we need is for them to succeed, for our sake  as well as for our brave men and women in the Border Patrol.    Mr. Speaker, I think this is a good solution to the  dilemma that faces us. We do have a hiring deficit in the Border  Patrol, but we cannot give up on the need to fully vet these people.   The independent inspector said that the polygraphs had stopped dozens  of applicants who have admitted to participation in human trafficking,  defrauding the government, and have links with cartels intent to  infiltrate CBP.   There has been, actually, a release from the Freedom of Information  Act of people who would be eligible for the exemption who admitted,  under the polygraph, to sexual assault, to child pornography, to taking  classified information from Afghanistan, to taking classified  information from Iraq, a sheriff's employee who engaged in theft, and a  police officer who was a smuggler. The Border Patrol cannot afford  this.   I think the gentlewoman's amendment actually preserves what we want,  and I would highly recommend that we approve it.
