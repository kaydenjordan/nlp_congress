 Madam Speaker, I am indeed happy, and I am thrilled  today to actually be here and cast my vote for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada  Agreement, or the USMCA. I can't tell you enough of what it will do for  our districts in northern Indiana.   The hardworking Hoosiers in Indiana's Second District are builders  and growers. We manufacture most of the RVs you see on the road and a  large portion of boats and trailers that you see on many lakes. We  manufacture auto parts and musical instruments. Our farmers put food on  the table, including corn, soybeans, pork, duck, eggs, and dairy  products. Mexico and Canada are key export markets for all of them and  the workers they employ.   It has been 25 years since NAFTA has been in force. Technology,  transportation, and consumer habits have all evolved; NAFTA, however,  stayed the same. Politicians promised the sky when it came to trade  agreements, but President Trump promised to modernize NAFTA, and,  unlike anyone else, he kept that promise with USMCA.   USMCA dismantles trade barriers that stood in the way of American  exports for so long. For farmers in my district, this means more dairy,  more poultry, and more eggs are heading to Canada. For manufacturers,  this means fewer paperwork headaches that slow down shipments and  prevent them altogether. For businesses of all sizes, types, and  shapes, this means e-commerce standards that promote fair competition  and that will be used as a standard in future agreements. For workers,  this means more jobs staying in the United States.   Robust enforcement ensures that the potential of the USMCA does not  evaporate overnight. The promises made by all sides will be promises  kept by all sides.   Madam Speaker, this day is long overdue, but I am so happy it is  finally here. Our economy is booming thanks to tax cuts and regulatory  reforms, and now USMCA will keep that momentum going. It will put more  money in workers' pockets, and it will help small businesses thrive.   It is a big win for President Trump and Ambassador Lighthizer, and it  is a big win for America.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this agreement.                                time  1145
