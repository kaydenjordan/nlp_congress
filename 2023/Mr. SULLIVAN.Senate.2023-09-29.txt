 Mr. President, I am on the floor again with my  colleague from Texas, Senator Cruz, trying once again to pass our Pay  Our Military Act.   I am not going to spend a lot of time explaining what we are trying  to do here since 48 hours ago we tried to do the same thing. We are, in  our conference, right now trying to get to a compromise, working  through things to make sure we don't have a government shutdown. It may  or may not happen. It is looking more likely, though.  [[Page S4809]]    As we get closer to that moment, the idea that we would leave the men  and women who protect this country uncertain about whether they are  going to get paid even though they are still going to deploy, they are  still going to be fighting all over the world, protecting this Nation-- so we are going to leave them out hanging, right?   So all we are trying to do is the most commonsense thing you could do  if you cared one bit about the troops of the United States, and that is  to say: Hey, we know you are worried. We know you are probably  deployed. We know your wife or spouse is back home worried about  whether you are going to get paid next week. You have a dangerous  mission you are going on tonight somewhere in the world. So we are  going to take that worry away from you because we care about you.   Now, granted, my colleagues might say: Well, what about the IRS  worker? What about the Department of the Interior worker?   No offense--there is a little bit of a difference, OK. There is a  little bit of a difference. We all know it. We should know it.   So as we get closer, this is the bipartisan solution that we all need  to undertake.   Here is the thing: As I said last week, when we had the identical  situation in 2013, 10 years ago--identical: a Democrat-controlled  Senate, a Republican-controlled House, a Democrat-controlled White  House--it was looking like there was going to be a shutdown. What did  everybody unanimously agree to? Hey, let's take the troops out of this.  Let's make sure the men and women who serve in our military are not  worried. Let's unanimously pass the Pay Our Military Act.   So, 10 years ago, we did that. I wasn't here, but I applaud everybody  who did that. Simple. Identical. Identical. So what has changed? I have  no idea what has changed.   It looks like my Democratic colleague is going to come down and  object and make some gobbledygook argument about appropriations or  ``Let's keep trying.'' The government is going to shut down tomorrow  evening. We are going to keep trying. But let's take one group of  Americans and say: Hey, we know you sacrifice more than anybody. We are  going to take that worry away from you. We did it 10 years ago in a  bipartisan way, so we are going to do it again.   The Presiding Officer knows. I guarantee you the Presiding Officer  agrees with this bill, as a veteran of almost 30 years, a naval  aviator. The Presiding Officer knows what it is like.   There are guys on aircraft carriers right now and women on aircraft  carriers flying F-18s, and their spouses back home are going: Hey,  honey, guess what. I don't think I am going to have money to buy  groceries next week.   That guy is getting ready to take off on some carrier in the  INDOPACOM region, and he has to worry about that? He has to worry about  that? She has to worry about that?   We can fix that right now--right now. We have done it before, and I  can't imagine my Democratic colleagues are going to come up and object  to this bill. I am starting to get mad. We don't want a government  shutdown, but we can protect certain people, for goodness' sake. If we  are not going to protect our troops and their families, I don't know  whom we should protect.   So maybe my colleagues are on the floor getting ready to say: You  know what, gee, Senator Sullivan, Senator Cruz, we relent. These are  good ideas. And you know why we know these are good ideas? Because we  all did this 10 years ago.   I have no idea why we didn't do it now.   I yield the floor and recognize my colleague from Texas.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Appropriations be discharged from further consideration of  S. 2835 and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; I  further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed  and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table.    Mr. President, I am going to try to keep this short  because the issues that we are debating here are not that complicated.   I agree with my colleague from Washington State. We are working  around the clock. We are in our conference right now trying to get an  amendment to bolster border security, that the whole country, by the  way, wants--Democrats, Republicans--the whole country wants that. So we  are working around the clock too.    And my colleague did misstate something. I actually voted to get on  this bill. I voted to get on this bill. So her statement about my vote,  she needs to check my vote the other day.   But be that as it may, once again, she says there is only one serious  solution. Well, this body has done this before. The Senator from  Washington State has done this before. On the eve of a shutdown in  2013, the Senator from Washington State voted for this bill. Every  Senator voted for this bill.   So when she keeps saying, ``Let's get real,'' I agree, let's get  real. Go look at your vote from 2013. You voted for this on the eve of  a shutdown.   I will remind my colleague from Washington State, in 2019, when there  was a partial government shutdown, focused on the Coast Guard which  wasn't getting paid and the Democrats blocked my bill to pay the Coast  Guard, she actually stated:         It is absolutely unacceptable that our Coast Guard families       went without their paychecks during the shutdown. We need to       make sure President Trump doesn't put them through this       again.    Well, I am going to put the Senator from Washington State's words  back at her: It is absolutely unacceptable that Coast Guard and other  family members went without paychecks during the shutdown. We need to  make sure it doesn't happen again. So vote for our bill.   Every time they object, the arguments of why they are objecting to  something they already agreed to 10 years ago get more tangled up. We  are all working to avoid a shutdown, but if it doesn't happen, let's  make sure the men and women who are risking their lives for our country  and their families know that they are going to get paid. That is all we  are asking. That is all we are asking.   And everybody in this body 10 years ago did this, including the  Senator from Washington State. And it is just beyond comprehension that  they are coming up with arguments now to not do this.   This isn't about politics. This is about supporting our troops at the  moment they really need it. And they are not doing it.   I yield the floor to my colleague from Texas.
