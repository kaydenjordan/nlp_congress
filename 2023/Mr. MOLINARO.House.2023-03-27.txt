 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the life  and legacy of Mrs. Linda Greenblatt, a beloved social studies teacher  who passed away on March 18 after decades of service to the Red Hook  Central School District.   As a former student of Mrs. Greenblatt, I can attest to the profound  impact she had in the classroom. She had a passion for teaching, and  her lessons made students excited about history and government.   What I admire most about her is that she saw the potential in every  student. She was the type of teacher who would allow students to do a  project if they weren't able to take the test. This individualized  approach helped students like me to realize their strengths and achieve  their goals.   I thank her, as do so many, for being one of the people who got me  interested in public service and helped me recognize at a very young  age that every person has significant strengths and abilities.   I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in honoring the memory of  Mrs. Linda Greenblatt. May her legacy continue to inspire future  generations of educators and students alike.                            ____________________
