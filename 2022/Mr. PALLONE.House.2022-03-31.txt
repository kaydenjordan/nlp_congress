 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1017, I call  up the bill (H.R. 6833) to amend title XXVII of the Public Health  Service Act, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to establish requirements with  respect to cost-sharing for certain insulin products, and for other  purposes, and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 6833.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Affordable  Insulin Now Act, which is critical to protecting more than 7 million  American patients who rely on insulin.   Today, one in four Americans who need insulin report either having  cut back or skipped doses because the cost is simply too high. That is  heartbreaking and unacceptable. No one should have to ration their  insulin to help reduce costs, risking their health and, in some tragic  cases, actually costing them their lives.   This bill will make insulin more affordable by capping the out-of- pocket cost for consumers in both Medicare and the private insurance  market at $35 a month. This will address the vast disparities between  what people pay for insulin in other countries as compared to the  United States.   Right now, Americans are paying more than 10 times the price for  insulin as people in other high-income countries. That is simply not  fair.   Right now, one out of every five Americans who depend on insulin have  out-of-pocket costs of significantly more than $35 per month. That is  unconscionable considering that insulin has been in use for over a  century.   I have heard my Republican colleagues contend that prices for insulin  are coming down but, in reality, prices are going up for the consumer.  The list prices set by the manufacturer, which patient cost-sharing is  based off of, keep going up. In fact, reports note that the average  retail price for insulin rose 54 percent--more than double--from 2014  to 2019.   Now, Madam Speaker, I continue to strongly support comprehensive  efforts to rein in the soaring costs of prescription drugs and  empowering Medicare to negotiate fair prices, but we cannot afford to  wait any longer to address the price of insulin.   I commend Representatives Craig, Kildee, and McBath for their  leadership and hard work in bringing this important legislation to the  House floor.   I urge my colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, to support this  lifesaving legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader, who, along with the rest of  the leadership, continues this effort to address affordability.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. Craig), the prime sponsor of the bill, who is constantly  working to address affordability issues for Americans.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo), chair of the Committee on Energy and Commerce,  Subcommittee on Health.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the chair of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce, Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Schrader), a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), a member of Energy and Commerce Committee.    Madam Speaker, I would inquire how much time is  remaining on each side.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Schrier), a member of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to gentlewoman from  Georgia (Ms. Bourdeaux).     Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman of New Jersey (Mr. Payne).    Madam Speaker, we are at a crucial moment in our  Nation's history, and Congress has the chance to reinvigorate our  economy and ensure that we can outcompete every other nation.   The America COMPETES Act will put us on a course to lead the pack in  creating the strongest and most advanced economy of the 21st century.  Today's actions move us one step closer to making this legislation a  reality.   Over the past 40 years, America's manufacturing sector has lost  market share to economic competitors like China. This decline in  manufacturing, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic, has led to severe  supply chain disruptions across our economy that have raised prices for  consumers.   As the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I would like to  highlight several important provisions in the America COMPETES Act that  will help reverse this trend, strengthen our economy, bolster our  Nation's supply chains, and ensure that more critical goods are made  right here in the United States.   The legislation invests $45 billion in grants, loans, and loan  guarantees to support supply chain resilience and manufacturing of  critical goods, industrial equipment, and manufacturing technology  right here in the U.S.   It also invests $52 billion for the CHIPS for America Act,  incentivizing private-sector investments in semiconductor fabrication.  This funding will help eliminate disruptions in the semiconductor  supply chain from abroad that have hurt American automakers, medical  supply chain companies, and manufacturers of heavy machinery.   The bill invests $3 billion to help build a domestic solar  manufacturing supply chain so we can aggressively counter China's  control of the solar chain that jeopardizes our energy security  interests. The bill also keeps our electric grid secure and resilient  in the face of evolving cybersecurity and physical security threats.   Madam Speaker, the America COMPETES Act also improves our medical  product supply chain and strengthens our Strategic National Stockpile.  During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were widespread  shortages of essential medicines, medical supplies, and some personal  protective equipment.   This legislation increases our domestic drug manufacturing base by  expanding the use of advanced and continuous manufacturing practices.  It also establishes a $1.5 billion supply chain manufacturing pilot  program that will help maintain domestic reserves of critical medical  supplies. It creates a $10.5 billion program that awards grants to  States to expand or maintain a State strategic stockpile of products  essential in the event of a public health emergency.   Finally, Madam Speaker, the America COMPETES Act will help innovate  our wireless supply chain and network security by funding the  deployment of cutting-edge technology and ensuring that next-generation  mobile wireless networks and technologies are safe and secure from  foreign adversaries.   Madam Speaker, for far too long, America has relied heavily on other  nations to manufacture critical goods essential to our economy. That  must come to an end as we work together to reinvigorate our  manufacturing base and create new, good-paying jobs here at home.    Committee on Energy and Commerce. H.R. 1218.
