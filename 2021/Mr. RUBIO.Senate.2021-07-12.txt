 Mr. President, the world and the country yesterday watched  these images out of Cuba. It is really unprecedented. In 62 years of  communist tyranny on the island of Cuba, we have never seen and there  has never been what now is up to 40 cities in which people took to the  streets--organically, unorganized, grassroots--to ask for the end of  that tyranny. And I think it is important for a lot of people that are  new to the issue to sort of understand what that means and what it is  all about.   I think the first lesson we need to take away from it is that  Marxism, socialism doesn't work. The way socialism, the way Marxism has  always worked--the way it has always empowered itself--is it goes to a  people and it immediately divides them. It says: There is the  suppressor class, and then there is this victim class. And these evil  oppressors--capitalists, in the case of socialism or traditional  Marxism--they oppress the victims. And what you have to do is you have  to give us the power in government to take care of these oppressors and  to go after these oppressors, and if you give us that power, we will  deliver you security and we will protect you from the oppressors. They  ask for security in exchange for freedom. That is always the price that  socialism asks for--security.   And what you wind up with is a country of people that hate each  other, and they are angry at each other. A significant portion of the  people in the country have to leave, have to flee, go to jail, because  they are the oppressor class. Their lives are destroyed. Their family  lives are destroyed.   But the socialism can't deliver the security. And when it can't  deliver the security, you don't get your freedom back. And, in fact,  when you start to complain about that, that is when the repression  comes.   Well, that is what happened in Cuba. Socialism and Marxism has done  to Cuba what it has done everywhere in the world that it has been  tried. It has failed. It has failed. They gave up their freedom. Or  they were told: Give up your freedom in exchange for a world-class  healthcare system.   It is not a world-class healthcare system. In fact, it is a  healthcare system that does not even have the ability to deal with  COVID at its very basic level.   They said: Give up your freedom for economic security.   What economic security? People are hungry, homes are crumbling, and  there is no economy. There is no real economy in Cuba.   Give up your freedom and you will have an education--free education  for everybody.   That education--No. 1, you are a doctor, but you can drive a taxicab  in Cuba and make more money. Or, No. 2, you get sent, forced to go,  overseas and work basically on slave wages, no pay--barely any pay at  all. It is basically human trafficking, as our own Department of State  found when it looked at the Cuban doctors' program and how it has been  abused.   So what has happened in Cuba is that socialism has failed. It has to  repress people who complain about it. You don't get your freedom back.   And like socialists always do, they have to find someone to blame.  And whom do they blame? No. 1, they blame anybody in the country who  doesn't agree with them. You are immediately a counterrevolutionary.  You are immediately a pawn of the imperialists. And, then, of course,  they always blame the United States.   The problem in Cuba for the regime is that the people aren't falling  for those lies anymore. They are not. The embargo, that is the first  thing they blame: It is the embargo. The embargo is causing all of  this.   Why aren't fishermen and farmers in Cuba allowed to fish or grow  things and sell it to people? It is not the embargo that keeps them  from doing that. It is the regime   Why can't Cubans own a small business? Why can't a Cuban do in Cuba  what they can do in Miami, what they can do in Washington, and what  they do in countries all over the world, and they can't do it in Cuba?  They can't open a small business. That is not the embargo that keeps  them from doing it. In fact, U.S. law allows us to trade and to do  commerce with small businesses that are independently owned by Cubans.  Do you know why Cubans can't own small businesses? It is not the  embargo. It is not the United States. It is the regime that doesn't  allow it.   People have seen these lies. How can they afford to build luxury,  four-star, world-class hotels for tourists, but they cannot afford to  deal with the crumbling homes that Cubans are living in, with roofs  literally falling in over their heads and with water leaking into  operating rooms at hospitals?   Look at what they do with the money. Oh, it is because you don't  allow more money to be sent. When an American or a Cuban American sends  money to their family members in Cuba--in the past, through Western  Union--the regime takes 10 percent off the top, and then they take  those dollars you sent and they force the Cubans to convert it into  worthless Cuban currency. They keep the dollars. And, then, guess what:  If you want to buy anything, you have to buy it from a government  store, and guess what the  [[Page S4821]]  government store sells things for? Dollars. That is not the embargo.  That is the Cuban regime that does that.   And who is it that is putting people in jail, gets your head cracked  open, and gets your door kicked out in the middle of the night? There  are 80 people missing today. At least 80 people disappeared overnight.  The families don't know where they are. That is not the embargo that is  jailing people. That is the regime.   And that is what I tell people. You can open up all you want. We can  pass a bill here that says: Open to Cuba--100 percent open. You can do  whatever you want--full, free trade. You can do whatever you want. At  the end of the day, the Cuban regime will control that opening. It is  not just what we want to do. It is what they want to do.   Do you want to do tourism? We tried that in 2015 with the Obama  changes, and do you know what they did? They said: Thank you. We love  the fact that you are coming here as tourists.   Guess what. All the tourist sites are owned by a holding company  named GAESA, controlled by the Cuban military. So everything comes  through their hands.   You want to send them food? That is great. Guess who gets it:  ALIMPORT, which is a government, military-owned agriculture company.  You can't sell it to a small grocery store in Cuba or even a food  wholesaler. It goes to the Cuban Government.   You want to send money? They take it. Do you know why? Because  socialism is about control, and all of these things--tourism, food,  money, medicine--it is all about control.   You want humanitarian aid? Let's get the Red Cross. Any of these  vetted NGOs in the world should be allowed to go into Cuba. They won't  allow it--A, because it is embarrassing to them. They have a world  class healthcare system. Why do they need humanitarian aid? But, B,  because they want to control it.   Send them vaccines, but if you put them in their hands--the  government, the regime--guess who gets the vaccine: the people who  behave; first, the regime elites and then the people who behave. If you  are not behaving and if you are not going along with what they want you  to do, you won't get a vaccine.   They will use any opening as a tool and as a weapon against their  people because that is what socialism does. That is what these Marxists  do in Cuba. They will use anything as a weapon against the people of  Cuba.   What can we do is what people want to know. No. 1, I hope that we  will all be clear about whose side we are on. You don't have to even  agree with anything I have said. What you should agree with is that  people everywhere in the world, including 90 miles from our shore,  should be allowed to go into the street, peacefully march, call for an  end of dictatorship, and not have their heads cracked open.   By the way, no one in Cuba has guns, except the military. So why are  these repressive forces walking around with these rifles and people are  getting shot? They are shooting people that literally are unarmed.   They should be able to do that, and it should be clear. We should be  clear in our language. We don't just condemn this tyranny. We condemn  this communist, this Marxist, this socialist tyranny. Call it for what  it is.   No. 2, we should make clear that nothing is going to change. There is  not going to be any sanctions changed as a result of this. On the  contrary, I hope the Biden administration will now announce that they  have finished their review of Cuba policy, and everything that is in  place is staying in place   To the extent we change policy, No. 3, I hope we make it a top  priority to allow the people of Cuba to have free, unfettered, and open  internet access. And the technology exists to do that with a satellite- based system. We should put the best minds to work on getting that done  because if the Cuban people have free and unfettered access to the  internet--the first thing the regime shut down yesterday was the  internet--they can communicate with each other, and they can receive  information and communicate with the world. Ninety miles from our  shore, you should be allowed to do that.   No. 4, for all of those who believe and have faith in the  international community--and I still hold hope that one day it will  work again--where is Spain? Where is the EU? Where are all these  countries that for years have given cover and protection to the Cuban  regime and condemned America? They should speak out clearly that what  is happening there is wrong and that repression is wrong. We should  rally that. We should use our position of strength and power in the  world and our influence in diplomatic circles to make that happen.   And, No. 5, I hope the President will be very clear with the regime  in Cuba that we will not tolerate them encouraging a mass migration  event--because I am warning you, this is what they do. They have done  it twice already. They step back and they say: Look, if you don't lift  sanctions, if you don't go back to the Obama-era policies, and if you  don't get rid of the embargo, it is inevitable that you are going to  have 50,000 people take to the ocean and head toward the United States.   They have used that against us twice. They did it in 1994, and they  did it in 1980 with the Mariel boat lift. President Biden needs to be  clear, whether it is through private channels or saying it publicly--be  abundantly clear that we will treat the encouragement of mass migration  toward the United States as a hostile action and act accordingly. That  cannot--cannot--be tolerated.   I want to close with this. I recognize that most of the Members of  this Chamber, most of the people here in Washington, and, frankly, most  of the people in the country do not pay attention to Cuba on a daily  basis. I get it. I really do. But if you are not following the issue of  Cuba, you can be forgiven for not knowing that what we are seeing, what  we saw yesterday, what we are seeing today, what happened recently-- none of this--was started by politicians. It wasn't started by me. It  wasn't started by anybody in Miami or in Florida. It wasn't started by  any think tank in Washington. It wasn't even started by political  activists inside of Cuba.   Do you know who started what is happening in Cuba? Artists, poets,  songwriters, writers, actors, musicians. They are the ones who started  it--the San Isidro Movement--because they came after them.   And there is a song. A lot of people don't realize it. There was a  song that came out earlier this year--a song that, by the way, if you  play in Cuba, you will go to jail. The song's name is ``Patria y  Vida.'' Now, the slogan of the Cuban regime is ``Patria o Muerte,''  meaning ``Fatherland or Death.'' This song played on that, and it says,  ``Patria y Vida,'' which means ``Fatherland and Life,'' instead of  ``Fatherland or Death.'' And the song is extraordinarily powerful  because it was written by people and sung by people who have lived this  reality and are living this reality. It so powerful. As I said, you  will go to jail in Cuba if you play it.   What the song basically says in its lyrics is: Why can't people think  in different ways and not be treated as enemies? Why is life so good  for party insiders and their families but there is no food for average  Cubans? There seems to be no embargo for the Cuban regime and their  family members. Why can you build luxury hotels while our homes are  crumbling? Why do Cubans have to suffer the indignities--the  indignities--the simple things like not being able to bathe with soap,  not being able to use deodorant, not having toothpaste--why do they  have to deal with these indignities? And who--the song also asks--who  told the regime that Cuba belongs to them and only them? Shouldn't it  belong to all 13 million Cubans?   The chorus I will read first in English, and then I will translate it  in Spanish, because it actually plays on ``dominoes.'' Dominoes is a  very popular game played by Cubans. It is played by everybody, but  Cubans, in particular. It is a big game there.   The chorus reads:   (English translation of statement made in Spanish is as follows:)   And how it translates is that it basically says:         It's over. Your 59--    Meaning 1959, the year that Castro took over--         But I have double twos.    And everyone knows that in the dominoes game, if, at the end of a  chain,  [[Page S4822]]  both dominoes, no one has any dominoes to put down, the game gets  locked, and you count numbers and count dots to see who won.   So it says:         It's over. Your 59, but I have double twos. It's over.       Sixty years with a domino game locked up for us.    Now, I know this is a very colloquial Cuban way of expressing it, but  this is incredibly powerful. The people in Cuba understood what that  means, and that means that all this ideology, all this stuff they talk  about, and all these lies of the regime that worked out really well for  them, people don't believe it anymore, and they are not afraid anymore.  Meanwhile, their lives are ruined. Young people in Cuba, artists in  Cuba who realize that the only country on this planet were Cubans are  not successful is Cuba, and they are tired of it, and we should stand  with them.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the  following article printed in the Record.   The material follows:                   [From the Daily Coach, June 30, 2021]                   Remembering a Florida Sideline Legend         Some major names have stalked the sidelines of South       Florida's high school basketball gyms over the years,       including Frank Martin, Anthony Grant and Shakey Rodriguez.       But few have done it with the sustained success of Dillard       Women's Coach Marcia Pinder.        She served 44 seasons on the bench, winning 996 career       games while guiding the Lady Panthers to 10 state titles,       according to the Miami Herald.        Pinder died last week. She was 70.        Beyond any of her in-game schemes or pre-game speeches,       Pinder was a trusted confidant to hundreds of teenaged girls       over the better part of five decades.        ``She was a mentor, an advocate, a second mom to many of       her players,'' Florida Rep. Omari Hardy wrote on Facebook.       ``She taught generations of young women how to excel on and       off the court, and it was in that lasting, personal impact       that she took the greatest pride.''        Pinder was named Florida Dairy Farmers Girls' Basketball       Coach of the Year five times over a six-year span beginning       in 2010 and received the prestigious Morgan Wootten Award for       Lifetime Achievement from the Naismith Basketball Hall of       Fame in 2017, according to the Herald.        She was inducted into the National High School Athletic       Association Coaches Hall of Fame in 2014.        Few high school coaches have won as many games as Pinder,       but based on the number of poignant tributes that flooded       social media following her death, it would seem safe to say       that not many have touched as many lives.        ``The epitome of mentorship, love, discipline and       leadership,'' tweeted Ole Miss Women's Coach Yolett McCuin.        ``She was more than just a Coach!'' Auburn Women's Coach       Johnnie Harris tweeted. ``She impacted the lives of many       people in many ways! She will always have a special place in       my heart!        Pinder's legacy serves as yet another pivotal reminder to       us as leaders that as much as we agonize over Xs and Os, our       bottom line, promotions or firings, what we'll be remembered       for most is the way we uplift our players and employees.  [[Page S4826]]         ``My biggest thrill,'' Pinder told the Herald in 2014,       ``comes from the girls getting into college and pursuing       their degrees. When you constantly see these players get to       college, it makes you feel good. You don't think about that       last loss or last win. Some of them have turned out to be       teachers and doctors. That is my Hall of Fame, right there.''        May Coach Marcia Pinder rest in peace.                            ____________________
