The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5901         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material about the measure before us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Information Technology Modernization Centers of  Excellence Program Act is the product of great bipartisan work between  Representative Ro Khanna and the ranking member of our committee, Mr.  Comer.   Since 2017, the Centers of Excellence have provided state-of-the-art  technical expertise to assist Federal agencies with their IT  modernization so that they can serve the American people more  effectively.   The program aims to leverage private-sector innovation and  centralized expertise to help the Federal Government improve its  services to the public, deploy cutting-edge technology, attract top  talent to its workforce, enhance its cybersecurity, and optimize the  data resources available to it.   Today, six Centers of Excellence support agencies in the strategic  competency areas of artificial intelligence, cloud adoption, contact  centers, customer experience, data and analytics, and infrastructure  optimization.   This bill would codify that program and to support agencies in  efficiently improving customer service, implementing cloud computing  systems and data management, optimizing IT infrastructure, and sharing  best practices and expertise.   As chairman of the Subcommittee on Government Operations with  responsibility for Federal IT modernization, I have kept a close eye on  this program since its inception, and I intend to keep a close eye as  it continues to put its mission and goals into practice.   I applaud the improvements made to the bill to ensure that assistance  is  [[Page H5073]]  provided to agencies by request on a reimbursable and transparent  basis.   I support the commonsense bill before us to modernize and improve the  functioning of the Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna), the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I think this is a good bill. I think as Mr. Khanna  indicated, it adds to the corpus of information technology legislation  where we are trying to modernize the Federal Government; we are trying  to retire legacy systems; we are trying to move to the cloud for cyber  reasons, for efficiency reasons, and to be of better service to the  American people.   I think this is another piece in that mosaic, and I urge its passage  by our colleagues here in the House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7340) to ensure that personal protective equipment and other  equipment and supplies needed to fight coronavirus are provided to  employees required to return to Federal offices, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7340         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Chai Suthammanont       Remembrance Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. TELEWORK, LEAVE, AND RETURNING TO WORK FOR FEDERAL                     EMPLOYEES.         (a) Issuance of Policies and Procedures by Agencies.--Not       later than 30 days before  [[Page H5074]]       the date on which an agency plans to reopen a facility and       after consultation with the Chief Human Capital Officer and       director of administration or the equivalent, the head of an       agency shall publish on the website of that agency a       reopening plan that details the procedures and policies       related to sending employees back to workstations during the       covered period that includes the following:        (1) The personal protective equipment that will be provided       by the agency, the additional cleaning protocols to be       implemented, and efforts to ensure social distancing at       worksites.        (2) The actions the agency will take to protect employees       who are required to work in locations outside of Federal       office buildings for activities such as audits and       inspections.        (3) The requirements that members of the public must meet       in order to enter Federal office spaces.        (4) A description of the proper contingencies for employees       who have a high risk of contracting coronavirus.        (5) Ensures the continuity of operations, including plans       to reverse reopening measures if there is a resurgence in       coronavirus cases in certain geographic areas.        (b) Inspectors General Review.--Not later than 6 months       after the date of the enactment of this section, the       inspector general for each agency shall submit to the       Committee on Oversight and Reform of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and       Governmental Affairs of the Senate a review on whether that       agency has provided adequate personal protective equipment       for the employees who are returning to a Federal office       location for the agency and published the policies and       procedures required pursuant to subsection (a).        (c) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Agency.--The term ``agency'' has the meaning given that       term in section 551 of title 5, United States Code.        (2) Covered period.--The term ``covered period'' means a       period during which a nationwide declaration of a public       health emergency by the Secretary of Health and Human       Services under section 319 of the Public Health Service Act       (42 U.S.C. 247d) is in effect.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material about the measure before us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Chai Suthammanont Remembrance Act would require each  Federal agency to publish online a plan to reopen the Federal office  building at least 30 days prior to the return of their workforce. The  legislation also requires agency inspectors general to report on  whether their agencies have, in fact, complied with the provisions in  this bill and provided adequate personal protective equipment for their  employees returning to office spaces.   This bill is named after my constituent who tragically lost his life  to coronavirus on May 26, 2020. Chai's picture is behind me. Chai was a  real human being. He wasn't a statistic. He left behind a family. He is  survived by four sons, his wife, and four grandchildren. He succumbed  on May 26, 2020.   Chai immigrated to the United States from Thailand when he was 17.  Throughout his life he was known for helping others.   When he first came to our country, he landed in the restaurant  industry at a famous jazz club in Greenwich Village in New York City,  where he made it among the first restaurants to offer health insurance  to its employees.   After retiring from that industry, Chai moved to the National Capitol  Region and returned to work as a Federal employee in the Marine Corps  Community Services Child Development Center in Quantico, Virginia. Chai  wanted to continue giving back to his adopted country. He was a proud  American citizen.   Chai was also a beloved employee working in the development center's  kitchen, preparing meals for the children of our Marine families. He  developed a unique handshake for each kid in the daycare, making each  child feel special and included.   At the beginning of this terrible pandemic, Chai's workplace was not  enforcing or taking proper precautions to protect its workers. On April  27, Chai worked his last full shift at the daycare kitchen as one of  his coworkers coughed repeatedly and looked very ill. There was no  protective equipment for the other employees, including Chai.   Sadly, soon after that, Chai was informed that the coworker had,  indeed, tested positive for coronavirus. Almost exactly 1 month later,  after 13 days on a ventilator, Chai died on May 26.   Let me be clear: This was an avoidable death. Had there been  protocols in place, had there been PPE in place and available to  employees like Chai, Chai would still be alive today, in my view.   Chai's widow, Christina, has worked with my office to make sure this  never happens to anybody else again.   I named the bill after Chai because, although the provisions in this  bill can no longer help him, they can help the millions of Federal and  contract workers who will reenter the Federal work spaces across the  United States.   This legislation is designed to save lives and protect those who  serve the American people.   We, as Members of Congress, have an absolute obligation to protect  the Federal workforce that keeps our country running, keeps our country  safe. We must ensure that Federal employees have the most accurate and  up-to-date information regarding agencies' reopening plans.   Currently, Federal agencies are failing to communicate with employees  across the board and other stakeholders about their coronavirus  practices and policies. As some agencies begin calling employees back  to Federal office buildings, many civil servants are receiving  incomplete or unclear instructions, leading to fear and uncertainty  about health.   I represent the third largest number of Federal employees of any  congressional district in America, but there are Federal employees in  every Federal congressional district. This bill matters and ought to  matter to every one of us and our constituents.   I refuse to sit idly by and risk more and more of our Federal  workforce being forced back to office buildings under superficial plans  with zero accountability. This bill simply includes the commonsense  provisions taken directly from the best practices recommendations of  the Government Accountability Office to communicate effectively with  the workforce and to ensure they have adequate PPE. The Trump Office of  Management and Budget had no concerns with this bill.   The least we can do for our Federal employees is to ensure the  Federal agencies they work for are being transparent with their plans  so that there is a level of reassurance and security before they are  called back physically to the workplace.   I wholeheartedly support this bill dedicated to my constituent Chai,  and I encourage every one of my colleagues to join me in doing the  same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Mrs. Miller, for her  kind remarks, and I certainly know they will be appreciated by his  widow, Christina.   Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers on this side, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my friends in the House, on a  bipartisan basis, to join with me in honoring Chai and preventing  further deaths and further infections from COVID-19 within the Federal  workforce and the Federal contract workforce. This is a prudent  measure, and, as I said, President Trump's OMB does not oppose this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 7496) to require Federal agencies to submit plans for  responding to any resurgence of COVID-19, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7496         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``COVID Preparedness,       Response, and Effective Planning for Advanced Requirements by       the Executive Branch Act of 2020'' or the ``COVID PREPARE Act       of 2020''.       SEC. 2. COVID-19 RESURGENCE PLAN.         (a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the head of each agency shall       submit to Congress an initial report detailing an action       plan, informed by research and best practices learned from       the onset of COVID-19 and previous presidentially declared       emergencies, for addressing the needs and mitigating and       eliminating the risks and challenges associated with any       resurgence in COVID-19 cases, that includes--        (1) agency priorities for preparing for and responding to       any resurgence of COVID-19, including continuity of       operations and fulfilling the mission of the agency;        (2) measurable goals specific to priorities and a time line       for addressing each priority;        (3) anticipated challenges to addressing priorities and how       the agency will address such challenges;        (4) how the agency will consult with Congress, the public,       State and municipal governments, and relevant stakeholders       while working remotely; and        (5) how the agency plans to issue relevant guidance to       entities under the jurisdiction of the agency.        (b) Subsequent Reports.--Not later than 60 days after the       date of the enactment of this Act, and quarterly thereafter       until the President ends the declared emergency, the head of       each agency shall submit to Congress a report that provides       an update of the details submitted in the plan under       subsection (a), including--        (1) the status of each priority;        (2) an explanation for any goal that has not been met       within the specified time frame; and        (3) any changes or updates to the plan.        (c) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Agency.--The term ``agency'' has the meaning given that       term in section 551 of title 5, United States Code.        (2) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several       States, the District of Columbia, each commonwealth,       territory, or possession of the United States, and each       federally recognized Indian Tribe.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure before us.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Brad Schneider and   John Katko  for their strong bipartisan work on this good-government bill.   Reflecting back on the outbreak of the pandemic, I think we can all  agree that our Nation and the Federal Government were not prepared for  what lay ahead. Conflicting safety and work-from-home guidelines caused  confusion across the Federal workforce. We didn't have a clear  understanding of how the virus spread or how best to respond to it, so  agencies managing offices and priorities across the country were left  to make their own best decisions as they saw it. Many agencies were not  telework-ready, and we did not grasp the sheer length of time that this  pandemic would last, let alone plan for it.   Now with the winter months approaching, the projections are grim. In  June, the University of Washington School of Medicine predicted 200,000  U.S. deaths by October, a number we had already passed by September 22.  Their model now predicts, sadly, the death rate will more than double  by the end of this year. In all likelihood, the worst is still to come.  But this time we can and must be prepared.   To make sure the Federal Government is ready for the challenges  ahead, the COVID PREPARE Act would require each Federal agency submit  to Congress an initial action plan for addressing and managing any  resurgence of coronavirus cases. The plans would use the important  lessons learned since the onset of the coronavirus crisis to develop  data-driven blueprints for anticipating and addressing any resurgence.  The bill also would require agencies to provide quarterly progress  reports to Congress.   Agencies should already be engaging in the strategic evidence-based  planning required by this bill, so compliance ought not to be  difficult. Adding this important step would maximize the impact of  these plans by ensuring transparency and accountability through  oversight.   It is more urgent than ever that Federal agencies ensure the  responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars while protecting their  workforces and the most effective pandemic response possible by  committing to a sound and transparent planning and preparedness  process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this thoughtful bill as a complement  to the bill we just passed, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do think it is important when we talk about Operation  Warp Speed and we talk about the promise of vaccines, that we remind  ourselves that not all vaccines are curative. In fact, many vaccines  exist to lessen the severity of the illness that could follow.   We are 100 years after the Spanish flu, and we still don't have a  cure for the flu. We have an annual vaccine to lessen the severity of  the illness should you get it and to prevent it in some cases, but not  a cure.   We have been grappling with AIDS for over 40 years. We don't have a  drug or a vaccine that completely cures AIDS.   So when we talk to the American public, we have to be careful about  the implied promise or explicit promise those of us in public life  make.   That is why I think Mr. Schneider's bill and Mr. Katko's bill is so  important. In the event we don't have a vaccine that is efficacious, we  need to have contingency planning.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Schneider), the author of this bill and my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I would just simply close by reminding  everybody that bad planning exacerbated greatly the severity and  duration of this pandemic. And if we have learned anything, we have  learned that we need to plan, we need to have a plan, and that is  certainly true with our Federal agencies.   I believe this bill is a commonsense bill that will add to our  capability to respond quickly in the event of a resurgence of the  coronavirus, and I urge its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
