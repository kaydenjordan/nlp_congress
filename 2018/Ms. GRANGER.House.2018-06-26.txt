 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 6157, and that I may include tabular  material on the same.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased to bring the Defense Appropriations bill for  fiscal year 2019 to the House floor for consideration.   Congress' number one responsibility is to provide for the defense of  this Nation. It is this bill that fulfills that most fundamental  constitutional duty.   Last year, General Dunford, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  said: ``The U.S. military's competitive advantage against potential  adversaries is eroding. Over the last decade, sustained operational  commitments, budgetary instability, and advances by our adversaries  have threatened our ability to project power and we have lost our  advantage in key warfighting areas.''   My approach to funding this bill is based on that statement. The  priorities funded in this bill not only stop the erosion, but also  enable our military to restore and increase the competitive advantage.  This is all possible because of the bipartisan budget agreement which  has allowed us to provide the necessary resources.   The fiscal year 2018 Defense Appropriation Act took the first step in  rebuilding our military by addressing the toll taken on readiness, and  began to make investments to improve our competitive advantage.    Building on the gains we made in 2018 and guided by the new National  Defense Strategy, the bill before you is the next critical step to  enable Secretary Mattis to build a more lethal, resilient, and rapidly  innovating joint force that can defeat the adversaries we face today  and those we will face in the future.   The bill also supports the Secretary's efforts to work by, with, and  through our allies and partners to help share the burden while  protecting America's interests around the world.   This bill reflects the advice the subcommittee received in hearings,  briefings, and meetings with Secretary Mattis, Chairman Dunford, the  leadership of the military services, the Intelligence Committee, and  other national security experts.   The bill provides a total of $675 billion to the Department for  fiscal year 2019. This is $19 billion above the fiscal year 2018 level  and is consistent with total funding level in the House-passed  authorization bill.   The bill provides full funding to address military personnel needs,  including: full funding for an additional 16,400 active, guard and  reserve soldiers, sailors and airmen. And full funding for the 2.6  percent pay raise for our troops.   The bill provides critical funding to repair and improve our military  readiness, including $1 billion over the request for training and  equipping our troops, including the National Guard and Reserve, and for  training, equipment, maintenance and spare parts, and base operations.   It includes $21 billion for depot maintenance to get our planes and  ships back in working order.   For procurement, the bill provides adequate funding to modernize the  force. Major investments include: increased funds for Strykers, Abrams  tanks, Humvees, and other ground mobility vehicles.   And to maintain air superiority, we provide increases for key  platforms such as the Joint Strike Fighter, Apaches, Lakotas, Ospreys,  Black Hawks, and C-130s.   We maintain our commitment to the National Guard and Reserve  components, providing $1.3 billion over the request, specifically for  their equipment needs.   For shipbuilding, we fund 12 Navy ships, 2 more than requested.   To ensure our technological edge against our adversaries, $95 billion  is included for research and development.   We keep our commitment to take care of our servicemembers and their  families by providing over $34 billion for defense health programs,  including $752 million over the request for medical research.   To address growing concerns on and around our military bases, we  include over $1.2 billion to address environmental remediation and  restoration.   For ongoing global war on terrorism operations, the bill provides  funding for additional intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance  for the warfighter, and $250 million for Ukraine.   Given the serious challenges and significant resources at stake, the  committee continues to exercise strong oversight over the Department to  ensure that our constituents' tax dollars are being spent wisely.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank my ranking member and partner, Mr.  Visclosky. His input has been invaluable. The bill before us is better  because of his involvement.   I also want to thank our full committee ranking member, Mrs. Lowey,  for her support for this important work done in this bill. Most  importantly, I want to thank my full committee chairman and the  previous subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Frelinghuysen), for his leadership and his support.   Sadly, this is the last Defense Appropriation bill that the chairman  will manage in Congress.                                time  1615    Throughout his service, he has shown an unwavering commitment to the  needs of our military and intelligence communities. I will miss his  wise counsel and steadfast commitment to the members of our military  services.   I want to thank all Members for their participation and input as we  put together this bill. The subcommittee received over 6,600 requests  from Members. The bill incorporates their ideas and recommendations,  and I thank them for their continued support.   I would like to personally thank our hardworking staff for helping  make this bill possible. On our majority staff: Jennifer Miller, Walter  Hearne, Brooke Boyer, B. G. Wright, Allison Deters, Collin Lee, Matt  Bower, Jackie Ripke, Hayden Milberg, Bill Adkins, Sherry Young, and  Barry Walker.   On our minority staff: Becky Leggieri, Jennifer Chartrand, and Chris  Bigelow. On my personal staff: Johnnie Kaberle, Jon Fay, and Spencer  Freebairn.   In closing, Mr. Chairman, the Defense Appropriations bill for fiscal  year 2019 is a great bill that takes the next critical step in  rebuilding our military.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from West  Virginia (Mr. McKinley) for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy.    Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, I appreciate the  gentleman's concern to provide adequate funding for arthritis research.  I am a strong supporter of funding in this area.   Each year, Congress provides funding for medical research through the  Defense Health Program. Arthritis research previously has received  millions of dollars in research grants.   I do appreciate his interest and engagement on behalf of our  warfighters. I agree to work with the gentleman from West Virginia on  this important topic.   Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                   Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Lowenthal     Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I  don't oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the STARBASE program supports programs to  improve the interests and skills of students in science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics. Military volunteers engage students  through experimental learning, and the program has a proven record of  success. As a result, the committee provided an additional $30 million  in the bill for the STARBASE program.   Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I  don't oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the National Guard Youth ChalleNGe Program  is a youth development program that works to improve the life skills  and employment potential of our youth through military base training  and supervised work experience. Like my colleague, I support this  important program.   This is why the bill includes $175 million to support the program. An  additional $6 million will allow the program to have a similar budget  to the FY18 level.   Mr. Chairman, I support the gentlewoman's amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, I share the gentleman's support of the  veterans who bravely served our country and were exposed to radiation  during nuclear weapons tests. Military commanders have numerous  personal military declarations, such as meritorious service medals,  commendation medals, and achievement medals available to appropriately  recognize members for their specific actions or sustained meritorious  service. However, recognizing these individuals for their sacrifice is  a very good idea; therefore, I support the gentleman's amendment.    I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Walberg) having assumed the chair, Mr. Poe of Texas, Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 6157)  making appropriations for the Department of Defense for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2019, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, the defense POW/MIA Accounting Office  performs tireless work to track, locate, and recover our fallen heroes,  and I thank them for their continued efforts.   Like my colleague, I support this important program. That is why the  bill includes $10 million above the budget request to accelerate  efforts to return our fallen heroes home where they belong.   An additional $10 million will allow the program to continue to be  successful; therefore, I support the gentleman's amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim the time in opposition,  but I do not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment would add to the $120  million for A-10 wings that has already been provided, as well as the  $79 million included in the Air Force budget request. The Air Force has  indicated to us that the additional funding in this amendment can be  executed upon contract award, which is expected by the middle of 2019.   Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept the amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

This funding will help  those efforts.   I appreciate the gentleman's concerns, and I accept the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's desire to  provide additional funding to research illnesses that affect veterans  of the Gulf war.   The committee is committed to ensuring that our servicemembers, their  families, and veterans receive the highest level of medical care  possible.   The committee already provides $21 million toward Gulf war illness  research in the bill. Research includes a close look at how service in  the Gulf war is linked to illnesses such as chronic fatigue, severe  muscle pain, persistent headaches, and others.   Mr. Chairman, I would be pleased to accept the gentleman's amendment  to provide additional funding in this area, and I reserve the balance  of my time.
