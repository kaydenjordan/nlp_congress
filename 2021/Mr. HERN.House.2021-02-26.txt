 Mr. Speaker, last year, every single COVID relief package  passed with bipartisan support and bipartisan input. This is not  happening today because the majority has chosen to abandon their calls  for unity without even making an effort. Sadly, it is the American  people who will bear the burden of this decision.   Components of this package were shoved through committees on strictly  partisan lines. One of my amendments asking that we prohibit taxpayer  dollars from going to people illegally in our country passed the Senate  with broad bipartisan support, but was rejected without a single  Democratic vote in our committee.   I know from experience that a hard-earned paycheck is infinitely more  valuable than anything from the unemployment office. We need to put  Americans back to work, make America tired again. That means we cannot  incentivize workers to stay out of the workforce.   Let's not waste any more taxpayer dollars than we have to.   Getting our students back in the classrooms should be a top priority  for everyone here. Not only does this bill not help return students to  the classroom, most of the education funds are not even allocated until  2022.   There is a lot we can do together, but I fear a one-sided process  will leave millions of Americans unaccounted for in this relief  package.                            ____________________
