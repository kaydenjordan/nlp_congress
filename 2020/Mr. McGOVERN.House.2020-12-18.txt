 Mr. Speaker, as the co-chair of the Tom Lantos Human  Rights Commission, as chairman of the Congressional-Executive  Commission on China, as someone who cares deeply about human rights and  democratic principles, and as a proud Member of this House, I rise to  express my deep concern about the damage being done to America's moral  authority by those who refuse to accept the legitimate outcome of  November's election and who continue to deliberately spread lies and  manufacture conspiracy theories that have no basis of fact in an  attempt to overturn the will of the American people.   As Americans, we see ourselves as a beacon to the world, as that  shining city upon the hill. We believe our political experiment, to  create a country united by ideals, rather than blood and soil, is  unique and exceptional.   We promote democracy as a pillar of our foreign policy, confident in  our own example. We say we are a nation of laws, not men.   Yet, since November 3, a widespread effort to overturn the results of  the presidential election have been openly endorsed by some high- ranking leaders and facilitated by the silence of many more.   For the record, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won by more than 7  million votes. They received 81 million votes, 51.3 percent of the  total cast. On Monday, President-elect Biden won 306 electoral college  votes, two more than President Trump in 2016.   There is no question that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won the  election resoundingly. Those who believe otherwise first alleged  massive fraud, then claimed election procedures were unfair. But when  granted the opportunity in courts of law to present evidence of fraud,  they couldn't do it.   There simply is no proof of fraud at any significant scale. The  attacks against voting by mail, signature matching, and the like,  notably selective to begin with, had mostly already been litigated.   Mr. Speaker, it is critically important that Americans trust our  elections. That is why credible claims of fraud or irregularities must  be investigated and corrective action taken. That has happened.   There have been multiple recounts. Three in Georgia alone. Those  seeking to overturn the election results have lost 59 times in courts  across seven States and twice before this Supreme Court.    At least 86 judges, many appointed by Republicans, have rejected at  least one post-election lawsuit. All three Supreme Court Justices  nominated by President Trump ruled against him.   Mr. Speaker, the fact is that the November elections were free and  fair. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said that  the election ``was the most secure in American history'' and ``there is  no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed  votes, or was in any way compromised.''   Attorney General Barr, of all people, said that the Justice  Department has uncovered no voting fraud ``on a scale that could have  affected a different  [[Page H7262]]  outcome in the election.'' I am using his words.   The election is over, yet President Trump still refuses to concede  and his allies continue to look for ways to throw out the votes of  millions of Americans.   Mr. Speaker, this is crazy. It is un-democratic and un-American, and  it degrades democracy in every corner of the world. If this were  happening in another country, our government would rightfully demand  that the results of free and fair elections be respected.   Mr. Speaker, some may criticize my remarks today because I objected  to certifying the electoral college results in 2017. So let me be  clear. I do not oppose using established constitutional procedures. I  object when those procedures are not used to further the truth or to  undermine it.   In 2017, eight U.S. intelligence agencies--eight--said that Russia  had engaged in an unprecedented attempt to interfere in our elections  in favor of Donald Trump. I sought the kind of assurance about the  security of the 2016 election that has already been provided for 2020.  It was not forthcoming.   Mr. Speaker, America's institutions will survive the test of the last  few weeks. Due to the quiet courage and commitment of thousands of  volunteer election workers, local and State election officials--some  facing threats and intimidation--and the integrity of our courts, the  clear choice of the people will be respected. But I worry that we are  becoming what we condemn elsewhere.   Democracy is not guaranteed. Each of us has to choose democracy every  day in the way we conduct our politics. Either we choose to enforce  democratic rules of the game or we don't. Either we choose to accept  the losses alongside the wins or we don't. Either we choose to tell the  truth or we don't.   Mr. Speaker, today I urge my colleagues to proceed with caution. If  our politics belie our values, we will be lost at home and ignored  abroad.   I believe we are an exceptional country. Let's act like it.                            ____________________
