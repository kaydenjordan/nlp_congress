 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the late Dr.  Jonathan Holloway on becoming the first African American president of  Rutgers University. Rutgers is getting a leader with exceptional  credentials.   Currently, Dr. Holloway is the provost and chief academic officer at  Northwestern University. He oversees the school's academic priorities,  annual budget, and faculty appointments.   Previously, Dr. Holloway served as the dean of Yale College, the  undergraduate school of Yale University. Before that, he was the Edmund  S. Morgan Professor of African American Studies, History, and American  Studies at Yale University.   Dr. Holloway was appointed to the post on January 21, after a search  that included more than 200 candidates. He will start the new position  on July 1.   Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Dr. Holloway. He will be a  welcome addition to an outstanding university.                            ____________________
