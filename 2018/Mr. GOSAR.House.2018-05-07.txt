 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentlewoman  from Arizona, the Honorable Debbie Lesko, be permitted to take the oath  of office today.   Her certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to her election.    Mr. Speaker, Debbie Lesko has dedicated years of her life  to public service, starting back in 2009, when she took the oath as a  State legislator from Arizona, and then serving as a member of the  Arizona Senate from 2015 to earlier this year.   Her commitment and dedication to the people of Arizona will continue  as she joins the House of Representatives and upholds her  constitutional oath. The oath is a reminder to all of us standing here  today that our duty is to support and defend the Constitution of the  United States.   I look forward to working together with our newest colleague to find  commonsense solutions to the problems our Nation faces.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).
