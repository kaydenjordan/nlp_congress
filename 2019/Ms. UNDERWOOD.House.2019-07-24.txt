 Madam Speaker, 64. That is the number of robocalls  that the average Illinoisan has received in 2019 alone, over 1 billion  total. Nationwide, half of all calls to cellphones are robocalls.   Yesterday, in my staff meeting, our discussion of floor consideration  of the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act was literally interrupted by two  different robocalls.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman and ranking member on behalf of  myself and my community in Illinois' 14th Congressional District for  their hard work to bring this commonsense, bipartisan, and incredibly  important bill to the floor.   Robocalls aren't just annoying; they can be dangerous. They are used  by fraudsters and unscrupulous debt collectors to scare hardworking  Americans to fall for their scams.   I am so proud to cosponsor the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act. This bill  ensures that consumers can block calls they don't want, with no extra  charge. It ensures that every call Illinoisans receive is verified by  caller ID, and it strengthens enforcement against scammers and robocall  operators.   I am especially glad the bill includes a provision to require the FCC  to establish a Hospital Robocall Working Group to ensure that robocalls  don't threaten hospitals' ability to provide timely, lifesaving care.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support the bill.
