 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mrs. Ella  LeJoyce Sojourner Fowler, a devoted mother, loving wife, community  leader, and an inspiring mentor. Mrs. Fowler sadly passed away on July  5 at the age of 83.   Born in Mississippi, Mrs. Fowler moved to Akron as a child. She  attended Akron Public Schools and eventually graduated from John R.  Buchtel High School.   Mrs. Fowler shared a passion for improving the health of our  communities that was expressed through an illustrious nursing career,  caring for northeast Ohioans at Barberton Citizens Hospital and City  Hospital.   In 1961, Mrs. Fowler married Pastor Dr. Ronald J. Fowler, and  together, they built up the Arlington Church of God. Mrs. Fowler was  actively engaged in the life and work of the church, serving over the  years as a member of the choir, a Sunday school teacher, a member of  the medical board and diaconate board, as well as first lady for 39  years.   Mrs. Fowler's faithfulness, grace, and kindness were an inspiration  to many, including myself.   I extend my deepest condolences and prayers to Dr. Ronald J. Fowler,  Mrs. Fowler's loving husband, as well as her children, Cynthia,  Christine, Ron, and Florence.   Mrs. Fowler has certainly left a mark on the Akron community, and her  memory will continue to be lifted up in prayer.                            ____________________
