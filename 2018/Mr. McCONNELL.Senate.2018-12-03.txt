 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Con. Res. 55, submitted  earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution  be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Con. Res. 56, submitted  earlier today.   The clerk will report the concurrent resolution by title.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 56) providing for the       use of the catafalque situated in the Exhibition Hall of the       Capitol Visitor Center in connection with memorial services       to be conducted in the rotunda of the Capitol for the late       George Herbert Walker Bush, 41st President of the United       States.    There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  concurrent resolution.    I ask unanimous consent that the concurrent resolution  be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the cloture vote on the McNamee nomination  occur at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, December 5. I further ask unanimous  consent that the congressional review period for S.J. Res. 64 be  extended until December 14.    On Friday, the 94-year journey of George Herbert  Walker Bush came to a close. At once, Americans from all walks of life  began paying tribute to this great patriot and giving thanks for his  fearless heroism in wartime skies; for his dedicated, expert service at  the highest levels of government, in one essential role after another;  for his loving fatherhood of a great family.   I am not the first to observe that George Bush seemed like the  ``greatest generation'' distilled into a single life  [[Page S7252]]  story--the immense contributions in both wartime and peacetime, the  stunning bravery paired with quiet humility, the belief that devoted  service is not cause for special praise but simply each citizen's duty.   The ``greatest generation'' achieved all-American accomplishments and  exhibited all-American virtues. And it may be just that no one did that  as fully as our 41st President. Even in the ranks of this remarkable  generation, he will stand out forever as one of its most especially  remarkable sons. George Bush was the best of the best.   Months after Pearl Harbor, our future President celebrated his 18th  birthday and high school graduation by enlisting in the Navy. He was  still a teenager when he got his wings--the youngest naval aviator.   He was only 20 on that fateful day in September 1944. He was piloting  one of four Avenger bombers aiming to take out a Japanese radio tower.  His plane was hit. The engine caught fire, and the cockpit began  filling with smoke, but George Bush kept his steady hands on the  controls. Rather than turn tail, he and his crew went right on with  their mission. Only after he had released the bombs--and successfully  damaged his target--did he finally bail out over the Pacific. With a  steady hand on the controls, more worried about doing his duty for  others than about himself, George Bush stayed the course.   According to one biographer, that was a key phrase for him. It  concluded a list of core principles he once laid out in a letter to his  mother. Here is what he said:         Tell the truth. Don't blame people. Be strong. Do your       best. Try hard. Forgive. Stay the course.    Year after year, post after post, George Bush stayed the course, and  he helped his country do the same. Through the fog of war in the  Persian Gulf, when international order needed defending, America's  Commander-in-Chief led just as steadily as he had in that smoking  cockpit almost 50 years earlier. And in between the Pacific and the  Presidency, he steered us straight through countless challenges as a  Congressman, Ambassador to the United Nations, Envoy to China, CIA  Director, and Vice President.   Serving capably in just one or two of these posts would ensure any  citizen's place in American history, but George Bush served in all of  them and always with excellence. On the homefront, President Bush was a  warrior for hope, optimism, and opportunity. As President, he paved the  way for education reform and signed legislation to give disabled  Americans a better shot. Overseas, he was a talented diplomat and  powerful champion of our interests.   It was on his watch that the Cold War finally ended. The free people  of Europe threw off the shackles of communism. But President Bush knew  America should not kick up our heels and enjoy a holiday from history.  We fought and won the gulf war in order to make something perfectly  clear to allies and enemies alike: It had to be right, and not might,  that filled the void. We needed, he said, ``a world where the rule of  law supplants the rule of the jungle.'' And his leadership moved us  towards such a world.   Through global change, domestic turmoil, and economic  transformation--whether in jobs that he had passionately sought out or  in other assignments he dutifully accepted--George Bush kept us on  course. He wasn't a dramatic or revolutionary leader. He didn't  advertise radical change. He never quite seemed at home in the  spotlight. Instead, he offered humility and a servant's heart. He  aspired to govern his country well, preserve what was good, and improve  things where possible. He wanted to keep us flying high and challenge  us to fly a little higher. He led us as he seemingly did everything in  his life--with grace and kindness that seemed almost unbelievable,  given all that he had accomplished.   Daring aviator. Chief spy. Wartime President. You would think this  must be a tough and gruff guy, but it is the man's good cheer and  generous spirit that stand out most of all in our national memory. He  was a prolific hand-writer of notes and letters. He freely changed his  own plans to make life easier for his staff or for the Secret Service  detail. I saw recently that, some years after his Presidency, he  couldn't even bring himself to simply turn down a reporter's request  for an interview without crafting a warm, apologetic, full-page letter  explaining his rationale.   His decency and attentiveness to others was a credit to his  upbringing. But it wasn't only habit; it was principle. This is a man  who said this in his inaugural address:         In our hearts, we know what matters. We cannot hope only to       leave our children a bigger car, a bigger bank account. We       must hope to give them a sense of what it means to be a loyal       friend; a loving parent; a citizen who leaves his home, his       neighborhood, and town better than he found it.    Looking beyond the day's drama. Issuing a deep moral challenge.  George Bush set the bar high. His country listened because we saw him  meet those standards himself.   George Bush's gifts were many, but some gifts were greater than  others. George Bush and Barbara Pierce met at a Christmas party in  1941. He described her to his mother as ``the niftiest girl at the  dance.'' Weeks after he returned from the war, they were married. ``I  have climbed perhaps the highest mountain in the world,'' he would  write much later, ``but even that cannot hold a candle to being  Barbara's husband.''   Their love story would grow to include six children. It would span  great joys and tragic loss. It weathered the challenges of the  spotlight. In every chapter, George Bush served as comforter and  counselor. He cared for loved ones with a dedication that never ceased  to amaze them.   So much for the myth of the starched Episcopalian New Englander.  George Bush was no stoic. In fact, he developed his own teary-eyed  reputation as a founding member of what the Bush family calls ``The  Bawl Brigade.'' That is b-a-w-l.   He was considerate, empathetic, and kind, and the Bushes passed on  these values to their children. They nurtured a family of leaders whose  contributions have enriched this country even more.   Few men so powerful would have even thought to call for a kinder,  gentler nation. Even fewer could have lived it themselves.   His words literally lifted our spirits. His example inspired us. A  quarter of a century after George Bush left the Oval Office, his legacy  continues to directly inspire not just ``a thousand points of light''  but millions of volunteers who serve others.   So in war and peace, in public and in private, in high office and in  family moments, George Bush stayed the course--the ``greatest  generation,'' indeed.   The grand heroism that saved our Nation, the quiet diligence that  built it up, and the basic goodness that sustains it--all in one.   Today, the U.S. Senate joins the Nation and the Bush family in  mourning and in prayer.   We are also joined in gratitude.   We are thankful that God gave this country George Bush and Barbara,  thankful that they built such a loving family, and thankful that they  may now be reunited--their great love story perfected in the light of  His grace.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 2:30 p.m.,  Tuesday, December 4; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and the Senate be in a period of morning business, with  Senators allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each for debate only.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous order,  following the remarks of the Democratic leader.
