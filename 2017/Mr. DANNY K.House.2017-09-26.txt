 DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Chair, following the wisdom of Frederick Douglass, who said it  is easier to build strong families, strong children, than to repair  broken men, I introduced my first bipartisan home visiting bill over a  decade ago, in 2005. Since 2005, home visiting has been uniquely  bipartisan--until today.   Research is clear. Home visiting makes kids and families stronger,  healthier, and safer. In my home State of Illinois, MIECHV improved  program coordination, reinforced the emphasis on proven models, and  expanded availability of services. Unfortunately, the majority's  approach has rejected bipartisanship and made timely reauthorization of  home visiting less likely.   H.R. 2824 presents substantial cuts to home visiting and threatens  the effectiveness of services for vulnerable children and families.  Equally bad, the rule under which we are considering this bill  conditions home visiting help to vulnerable families on harming seniors  and persons with disabilities. Although we are not voting on that  provision today, the rule we are considering this bill under makes it  an inescapable part of it.   I join with over 110 civil rights, disability, and aging agencies to  strongly oppose the Republican effort to pay for home visiting services  that strengthen vulnerable children by stripping certain low-income  seniors and those with severe disabilities of basic income they need to  survive.   H.R. 2824 also is inconsistent with bipartisan Senate legislation  introduced last week, which rejected the most controversial and  problematic changes in H.R. 2824 in order to keep what works.   So what should the House have done instead of H.R. 2824?   826 organizations urged the House and Senate leaders to ``reauthorize  this important program for 5 years, with a doubling of funding from  $400 million, annually, to $800 million, annually, to allow States,  territories, and Tribes to expand these services to more children and  families.'' Yet H.R. 2824 fails to increase funding by even one penny.   Currently, MIECHV dollars serve only about 6 percent of eligible  families and less than 50 percent of eligible Tribes. I tried to offer  a fully paid-for alternative to double funding for home visiting over 5  years without harmful policy changes but was not allowed a vote in  committee or on the floor.   One of the most harmful policy changes is a new ``State match''  requirement, which would be in addition to the ``maintenance of  effort'' requirement already in law. Just as with their failed  healthcare bill, this Republican bill pushes their fight to make States  pay more for services, while harming vulnerable children and families  as collateral damage. There is no doubt that the State match in this  bill will reduce home visiting in many States and Tribes, cut services,  and harm families.   The Republican bill further undermines successful home visiting by  changing it from a program to improve child development and parent- child relationships to a failed jobs program. Defining a core outcome  of MIECHV as increased employment and earnings will gut Federal home  visiting. Not one--not one--of the evidence-based models is a job  training program. Not one.   This bill says, if any program wants to improve economic self- sufficiency, it shall include employment and earnings. Further, the  bill applies stringent, unrealistic outcome standards.   H.R. 2824 is failure by design for home visiting. Later today, I urge  my colleagues to support Congressman Pascrell's amendment to strike  this change.   After a decade of bipartisan efforts to increase Federal funds for  home visiting, I am deeply saddened that H.R. 2824 now is the House  Republican priority list for cutting funding, reducing services, and  undermining the infrastructure that so many have worked to build. I  unequivocally oppose this harmful bill and its discriminatory pay-for,  joining the good company of the NAACP, the American Academy of  Pediatrics, Justice in Aging, National Women's Law Center, and the Arc  of the United States, to name just a few.   I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 2824 so that we can move quickly  on to a bipartisan approach which builds on home visiting's  considerable strength.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1400     DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin).

Madam Chair, I yield myself the  balance of my time to close.   Madam Chair, we know that home visiting works. There is no doubt  about it. It is evidence based. Nobody has spoken anything that one  would say it was not needed. It works for families and children in  communities across our country. We agree about that on a bipartisan  basis.   So we should not be here today debating a partisan bill, a bill that  home visiting experts say poses a risk to the program's survival. We  should be moving forward on a bipartisan bill without policy changes  that might shut down home visiting in some communities or set it up for  failure.   I hope that my colleagues will vote for the amendments being offered  today that will improve the bill, but I also have some concerns about  the State match.   No matter what we say, think of States and territories that have just  been devastated by the floods and hurricanes. It is going to be very  difficult for them to come up with the match money to keep some  programs alive.   So I hope that my colleagues will vote for the amendments being  offered today that will improve the bill. I regret that there will not  be enough of them to make this the bill that we had hoped it would be.   Madam Chairwoman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded  vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.    DAVIS of Illinois.  Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote. A recorded vote was  ordered.
