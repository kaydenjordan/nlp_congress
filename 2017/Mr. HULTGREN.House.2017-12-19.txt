 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Hensarling for  his continued work on this, and I also want to thank my colleague and  friend from Missouri, Blaine Luetkemeyer, for his important work on  this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a cosponsor on this legislation because  it is an important bill for regional banks in Illinois, but also around  the country.   The Financial Services Committee has spent a significant amount of  time debating which banks should qualify as so-called community banks  and regional banks when determining how to legislate regulatory relief.   I have to agree that, as a bank starts getting larger, it starts  looking less and less like a community bank. But both Republicans and  Democrats have agreed that asset size should not be the sole  characteristic for determining a bank's riskiness to the financial  system.   There are a number of banks that have successfully made use of the  traditional community bank business  [[Page H10224]]  model of deposit taking and lending that have grown in size. Some have  grown substantially, and now they are able to serve more than one  community.   Congress should not punish these financial institutions with an asset  threshold that even Congressman Barney Frank described as arbitrary.  Our policies should encourage low-risk relationship lending so  communities can benefit from institutions of different sizes. At a  minimum, we should provide the banking regulators some flexibility to  determine which institutions with assets over $50 billion pose higher  risk to the financial system.   In addition to the outstanding community banks in my district, my  constituents also look to regional banks like BMO and Discover when  they are trying to find best rates on mortgages, car loans, credit  cards, or their student loans.   Discover Financial Services, which has its headquarters just outside  my district in Riverwoods, Illinois, has a simple business model that  includes credit cards, student loans, home equity lending, and a number  of deposit products that you would expect from a Main Street financial  institution. This is the only business Discover is in. Nothing they do  is comparable to what you might see in one of the big money center  banks.   So why did Congress mandate that this bank be automatically  designated as systemically important? The current law is arbitrary and  subjects banks to the same standards as trillion-dollar global  systemically important institutions.   Automatically designating these institutions as systemically  important unnecessarily increases the cost of lending and makes it more  difficult for my constituents to achieve their financial goals.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support the Systemic Risk  Designation Improvement Act of 2017.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, because I believe in truth in labeling, truth in  titling, truth in the style of legislation, Mr. Speaker, I believe that  this bill should be appropriately styled the Big Bank Bonus Bill.   As a matter of fact, Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that this  bill be styled the Big Bank Bonus Bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair cannot entertain the gentleman's  request.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am sorry?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair cannot entertain that request as  the majority manager has not yielded for that purpose.   Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. A UC request.   Mr. Speaker, my friends on the other side have said much about Barney  Frank.   Chairman Frank was a dear friend of mine. I knew him well. I still do  know him well. Mr. Speaker, Chairman Frank has not endorsed this bill.  The language that they have used would lead an unsuspecting person to  conclude that Chairman Frank supports this piece of legislation. He  does not.   I have in my hand a letter from Chairman Frank. I will read a portion  of it. He indicates:         H.R. 3312 significantly increases the need for subjective       judgment by the regulators and very much weakens the ability       of financial institutions to rely on clear rules to guide       their decisionmaking.    Mr. Speaker, without question, Chairman Frank does not support this  legislation.   My friends have made much to-do about the term ``arbitrary and  capricious,'' a threshold that is arbitrary. What is more arbitrary  than reducing the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent,  which you just did? What is more arbitrary than reducing the individual  tax rate from 39.6 percent to 37 percent, which you just did?   You are the masters of arbitrary and capricious numbers. That bill  that you just passed is flush with arbitrary and capricious numbers.   Mr. Speaker, I would suggest that they examine their thoughts about  arbitrary and capricious before we continue, because I have more to say  about arbitrary and capricious numbers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Sarbanes), my colleague.
