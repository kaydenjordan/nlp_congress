 Do you believe, in your opinion, that the       President of the United States demanded that President       Zelensky undertake these investigations?         Is it correct no one on this planet told you       that Donald Trump was tying this aid to the investigations?       Because, if your answer is yes, then the chairman is wrong,       and the headline on CNN is wrong. No one on this planet told       you that President Trump was tying aid to investigations, yes       or no?        Ambassador SONDLAND. Yes.         So you really have no testimony today that ties       President Trump to a scheme to withhold aid from Ukraine in       exchange for these investigations?        Ambassador SONDLAND. Other than my own presumption.    Mr. Counsel PURPURA. When he was done presuming, assuming, and  guessing, Ambassador Sondland finally decided to ask President Trump  directly. What does the President want from Ukraine?   Here is the answer.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador SONDLAND. President Trump, when I asked him the       open-ended question, as I testified previously, ``What do you       want from Ukraine?'' his answer was ``I want nothing. I want       no quid pro quo. Tell Zelensky to do the right thing.'' That       is all I got from President Trump.    Mr. Counsel PURPURA. The President was unequivocal. Ambassador  Sondland stated that this was the final word he heard from the  President of the United States, and once he learned this, he text- messaged Ambassadors Taylor and Volker: ``The President has been  crystal clear--no quid pro quos of any kind.''   If you are skeptical of Ambassador Sondland's testimony, it was  corroborated by the statement of one of your colleagues, Senator  Johnson. Senator Johnson had also heard from Ambassador Sondland that  the security assistance might be linked to the investigations. So, on  August 31, Senator Johnson asked the President directly whether there  was some kind of arrangement where Ukraine would take some action and  the hold would be lifted.   Again, President Trump's answer was crystal clear.         No way. I would never do that. Who told you that?    As Senator Johnson wrote: ``I have accurately characterized his  reaction as adamant, vehement, and angry.''   They didn't tell you about Senator Johnson's letter. Why not?   The Democrats' entire quid pro quo theory is based on nothing more  than the initial speculation of one person--Ambassador Sondland. That  speculation is wrong. Despite the Democrats' hopes, the Ambassador's  mistaken belief does not become true merely because he repeated it many  times and, apparently, to many people.   Under Secretary of State David Hale, George Kent, and Ambassador  Volker all testified that there was no connection whatsoever between  security assistance and investigations.   Here is Ambassador Volker.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          You had a meeting with the President of the       United States, and you believe that the policy issues that he       raised concerning Ukraine were valid, correct?        Ambassador VOLKER. Yes.         Did the President of the United States ever say       to you that he was not going to allow aid from the United       States to go to Ukraine unless there were investigations into       Burisma, the Bidens, or the 2016 elections?        Ambassador VOLKER. No, he did not.         Did the Ukrainians ever tell you that they       understood that they would not get a meeting with the       President of the United States, a phone call with the       President of the United States, military aid, or foreign aid       from the United States unless they undertook investigations       of Burisma, the Bidens, or the 2016 elections?        Ambassador VOLKER. No, they did not.    Mr. Counsel PURPURA. The House managers never told you any of this.  Why not? Why didn't they show you this testimony? Why didn't they tell  you about this testimony? Why didn't they put Ambassador Sondland's  testimony in its full and proper context for your consideration?  Because none of this fits their narrative, and it wouldn't lead to  their predetermined outcome.   Thank you for your attention.   I yield to Mr. Sekulow.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Majority Leader McConnell,  Democratic Leader Schumer, House managers, Members of the Senate, let  me begin by saying that you cannot simply decide this case in a vacuum.   Mr. Schiff said yesterday--I believe it was his father who said it-- you should put yourself in someone else's shoes. Let's, for a moment,  put ourselves in the shoes of the President of the United States right  now.   Before he was sworn into office, he was subjected to an investigation  by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, called Crossfire Hurricane. The  President, within 6 months of his inauguration, found a special counsel  being appointed to investigate a Russia collusion theory. In their  opening statement, several Members of the House managers tried to, once  again, relitigate the Mueller case.   Here is the bottom line: This is part 1 of the Mueller report. This  part alone is 199 pages. The House managers, in their presentation, a  couple of times referenced a ``this for that.'' Let me tell you  something. This cost $32 million. This investigation took 2,800  subpoenas. This investigation had 500 search warrants. This had 230  orders for communication records. This had 500 witness interviews--all  to reach the following conclusion.   I am going to quote from the Mueller report itself--it can be found  on page 173--as relates to this whole matter of collusion and  conspiracy: ``Ultimately,'' in the words of Bob Mueller in his report,  ``the investigation did not establish that the campaign coordinated or  conspired with the Russian Government in its election interference  activities.''   Let me say that again. This, the Mueller report, resulted in this-- that for this: ``Ultimately, the investigation did not establish that  the campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian Government in  its election [-related] interference activities''--this for that.   In his summation on Thursday night, Manager Schiff complained that  the President chose not to go with the determination of his  intelligence agencies regarding hard interference and instead decided  that he would listen to people he trusted and he would inquire about  the Ukraine issue himself. Mr. Schiff did not like the fact that the  President did not apparently blindly trust some of the advice he was  being given by the intelligence agencies.   First of all, let me be clear. Disagreeing with the President's  decision on foreign policy matters or whose advice he is going to take  is in no way an impeachable offense.   Second, Mr. Schiff and Mr. Nadler, of all people--because they  chaired significant committees--really should know this, and they  should know what is happening.   Let me remind you of something: Just six-tenths of a mile from this  Chamber sits the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, also known as  the FISA Court. It is the Federal court established and authorized  under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to oversee requests by  Federal agencies for surveillance orders against foreign spies inside  the United States, including American citizens.   Because of the sensitive nature of its business, the court is a more  secret  [[Page S573]]  court. Its hearings are closed to the public. In this court, there are  no defense counsel, no opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, and no  ability to test evidence. The only material the court ever sees are  those materials that are submitted on trust--on trust--by members of  the intelligence community, with the presumption that they would be  acting in good faith.   On December 17, 2019, the FISA Court issued a scathing order in  response to the Justice Department inspector general's report on the  FBI's Crossfire Hurricane investigation into whether or not the Trump  campaign was coordinating with Russia. We already know the conclusion.  That report detailed the FBI's pattern of practice, systematic abuses  of obtaining surveillance order requests, and the process they  utilized.   In its order--this is the order from the court. I am going to read  it. ``This order responds to reports that personnel of the Federal  Bureau of Investigation provided false information to the National  Security Division of the Department of Justice, and withheld material  information from the NSD which was detrimental to the FBI's case in  connection with four applications to the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Court.''   When the FBI personnel misled NSD in the ways that are described in  these reports, they equally misled the Foreign Intelligence  Surveillance Court.   This order has been followed up. There has been another order. It was  declassified just a couple of days ago.         Thanks in large part--    The court said--       to the . . . Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department       of Justice, the Court has received notice of material       misstatements and omissions in the applications filed by the       government in the above-captioned documents. . . . DOJ       assesses that with respect to the applications in--    And it lists two specific docket numbers--       . . . 17-375 and 17-679, ``if not earlier, there was       insufficient predication to establish probable cause to       believe that [Carter] Page was acting as an agent of a       foreign power.''    The President had reason to be concerned about the information he was  being provided. Now, we could ignore this. We could make believe this  did not happen. But it did.   As we begin introducing our arguments, I want to correct a couple of  things in the record as well. That is what we are doing today. We  really intend to show for the next several days that the evidence is  actually really overwhelming that the President did nothing wrong.   Mr. Schiff and his colleagues repeatedly told you about the  intelligence community assessment that Russia was acting alone,  responsible for the election interference, implying that this somehow  debunked the idea that there might be, you know, interference from  other countries, including Ukraine. Mr. Nadler deployed a similar  argument, saying that President Trump thought ``Ukraine, not Russia,  interfered in our last Presidential election.'' And this is basically  what we call a straw man argument.   Let me be clear. The House managers, over a 23-hour period, kept  pushing this false dichotomy that it was either Russia or Ukraine but  not both. They kept telling you that the conclusion of the intelligence  community and Mr. Mueller was Russia alone with regard to the 2016  elections.   Of course, that is not--the report that Bob Mueller wrote focused on  Russian interference, although there is some information in letters  regarding Ukraine, and I am going to point to those in a few moments.  In fact, let me talk about those letters right now.   This is a letter dated May 4, 2018, to Mr. Yuriy Lutsenko, the  general prosecutor for the Office of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine.  It was a letter requesting that his office cooperate with the Mueller  investigation involving issues involving the Ukraine Government and law  enforcement officials. It is signed by Senator Menendez, Senator Leahy,  and Senator Durbin.   I am doing this to put this in an entire perspective. House managers  tried to tell you that the importance--remember the whole discussion-- and my colleague Mr. Purpura talked about this--between President  Zelensky and President Trump and the bilateral meeting in the Oval  Office of the White House, as if an Article of Impeachment could be  based upon a meeting not taking place in the White House but taking  place someplace else, like the United Nations General Assembly, where  it, in fact, did take place.   Dr. Fiona Hill was quite clear in saying that a White House meeting  would supply the new Ukrainian Government with the ``legitimacy it  needed, especially vis-a-vis the Russians,'' and that Ukraine viewed  the White House meeting as a recognition of their legitimacy as a  sovereign state. But here is what they did not play. Here is what they  did not tell you. And I am going to quote from Dr. Hill's testimony on  page 145 of her transcript. These are her words. This is what she said  under oath:         It wasn't always a White House meeting per se, but       definitely a Presidential-level, you know, meeting with       Zelensky and the President. I mean, it could've taken place       in Poland, in Warsaw. It could have been, you know, a proper       bilateral in some other context. But, in other words, a White       House-level Presidential meeting.    That can be found on page 145.   Contrary to what Manager Schiff and some of the other managers told  you, this meeting did, in fact, occur. It occurred at the U.N. General  Assembly on September 25, 2019.   Those were the words of Dr. Hill's that you did not hear.   This case is really not about Presidential wrongdoing. This entire  impeachment process is about the House managers' insistence that they  are able to read everybody's thoughts, they can read everybody's  intentions even when the principal speakers, the witnesses themselves,  insist that those interpretations are wrong.   Manager Schiff, Managers Garcia and Demings relied heavily on  selected clips from Ambassador Sondland's testimony. I am not going to  replay those. My colleague Mr. Purpura played those for you. It is  clear. We are not going to play the same clips seven times. He said it.  You saw it. That is the evidence.   Ms. Lofgren said that, you know, numerous witnesses testified that-- and this is the quote--``that they were not provided with any reason  for why the hold was lifted on September 11,'' again suggesting that  the President's reason for the hold--Ukrainian corruption and burden- sharing--were somehow created after the fact. But, again, as my  colleague just showed you, burden-sharing was raised in the transcript  itself.   Mr. Schiff stated here that, just like the implementation of the  hold, President Trump provided no reason for the release. This also is  wrong.   In their testimony, Ambassadors Sondland and Volker said that the  President raised his concerns about Ukrainian corruption in the May 23,  2019, meeting with the Ukraine delegation.   Deputy Defense Secretary Laura Cooper testified that she received an  email in June of 2019 listing followups from a meeting between the  Secretary of Defense Chief of Staff and the President relating  specifically to Ukrainian security assistance, including asking about  what other countries are contributing. Burden-sharing. That can be  found in Laura Cooper's deposition, pages 33 and 34.   The President mentioned both corruption and burden-sharing to Senator  Johnson, as you already heard.   It is also important to note that, as Ambassador David Hale  testified, foreign aid generally was undergoing a review in 2019. From  page 84 of his November 6, 2019, testimony, he said the administration  ``did not want to take a, sort of, business-as-usual approach to  foreign assistance, a feeling that once a country has received a  certain assistance package, it's a--it's something that continues  forever.''   They didn't talk about that in the 23-hour presentation.   Dr. Fiona Hill confirmed this review and testified on November 23,  2019--I am going to again quote from page 75 of her testimony--that  ``there had been a directive for a whole-scale review of our foreign  policy--foreign policy assistance, and the ties between our foreign  policy objectives and that assistance. This had been going on actually  for many months.''   So multiple witnesses testified that the President had longstanding  concerns and specific concerns about Ukraine. The House managers  understandably--understandably--ignore the testimony that took place  before their own committees.  [[Page S574]]    In her testimony of October 14, 2019, Dr. Hill testified at pages 118  and 119 of her transcript that she thinks the President has actually  quite publicly said that he was very skeptical about corruption in  Ukraine. And then she said, again in her testimony, ``And, in fact,  he's not alone, because everyone has expressed great concerns about  corruption in Ukraine.''   Similarly, Ambassador Yovanovitch testified that they all had  concerns about corruption in Ukraine, and, as noted on page 142 of her  deposition transcript, when asked what she knew about the President's  deep-rooted skepticism about Ukraine's business environment, she  answered that President Trump delivered an anti-corruption message to  former Ukrainian President Poroshenko in their first meeting in the  White House on June 20, 2017.   NSC Senior Director Morrison confirmed on November 19, 2019, at page  63 in his testimony transcript, that--this was during the Volker,  Morrison public hearing--that he was aware that the President thought  Ukraine had a corruption problem--his words, again--and he continued,  ``as did many others familiar with Ukraine.''   According to her October 30, 2019, testimony, Special Advisor for  Ukraine Negotiations at the State Department, Catherine Croft, also  heard the President raise the issue of corruption directly with then  President Poroshenko of Ukraine during a bilateral meeting at the  United Nations General Assembly, this time in September of 2017.   Special Advisor Croft testified she also understood the President's  concern that ``Ukraine is corrupt'' because she has--these are her  words--tasked to write a paper to help then NSA head McMaster, General  McMaster, make the case to the President in connection with prior-- prior--security assistance.   These concerns were entirely justified. When asked--again, a quote  from Dr. Hill's October 14, 2019 hearing transcript, `` . . . certainly  eliminating corruption in Ukraine was one of if not the central goal of  [U.S.] foreign policy?''   Does anybody think that one election of one President that ran on a  reform platform who finally gets a majority in their legislative body  that corruption in Ukraine just evaporates?   That is like looking at this--it goes back to the Mueller report. You  can't look at these issues in a vacuum. Virtually every witness agreed  that confronting corruption is at the forefront of U.S. policy.   Now, I think there is some other things we have to understand about  the timing. This again is according to the testimony of Tim Morrison in  his testimony. This is when President Zelensky was first elected, and  these are his words. There was real ``concern about whether [he] would  be a genuine reformer'' and ``whether he would genuinely try to root  out corruption.''   It was also at this time, before the election, unclear whether  President Zelensky's party would actually be able to get a workable  majority. I think we are all glad that they did, but to say that that  has been tested or determined that corruption in Ukraine has been  removed, the Anticorruption Court of Ukraine did not commence its work  until September 5, 2019, 121 days ago--4 months ago. We are acting as  if there was a magic wand, that there was a new election and everything  was now fine.   I will not--because we are going to hear more about it--get into some  of the meetings the Vice President had. You will hear that in the days  ahead.   Manager Crow said this. What is most interesting to me about this was  that President Trump was only interested in Ukraine's aid--nobody else.  The U.S. provides aid to dozens of countries around the world, lots of  partners and allies. He didn't ask about any of them, just Ukraine.   I appreciate your service to our country, I really do. I didn't serve  in the military, and I appreciate that, but let's get our facts  straight.   That is what Manager Crow said. Here is what actually happened.  President Trump has placed holds on aid a number of times. It would  just take basic due diligence to figure this out. In September 2019,  the administration announced that it was withholding over $100 million  in aid to Afghanistan over concerns about government corruption. In  August 2019, President Trump announced that the administration and  Seoul were in talks to substantially increase South Korea's share-- burden sharing--of the expenses of U.S. military aid support for South  Korea.   In June, President Trump cut or paused over $550 million in foreign  aid to El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala because those countries  were not fairly sharing the burden of preventing mass migrations to the  United States.   In June, the administration temporarily paused $105 million in aid to  Lebanon. The administration lifted that hold in December, but one  official explained that the administration continually reviews and  thoroughly evaluates the effectiveness of all U.S. foreign assistance  to ensure that funds go toward activities that further U.S. foreign  policy and also further our national security interests, like any  administration would.   In September 2018, the administration canceled the $300 million in  military aid to Pakistan because it was not meeting its  counterterrorism obligations.   You didn't hear about any of that from my Democratic colleagues, the  House managers. None of that was discussed.   Under Secretary Hale, again, in his transcript said that, quote, aid  has been withheld from several countries ``across the globe'' for  various reasons.   Dr. Hill similarly explained that there was a freeze put on all kinds  of aid, also a freeze put on assistance because, in the process at the  time, there were an awful lot of reviews going on, on foreign  assistance. That is the Hill deposition transcript.   She added--this was one of the star witnesses of the managers--she  added that, in her experience, stops and starts are sometimes common in  foreign assistance and that the Office of Management and Budget holds  up dollars all the time, including the path for dollars going to  Ukraine in the past. Similarly, Ambassador Volker confirmed that aid  gets held up from time to time for a whole assortment of reasons.   Manager Crow told you that the President's Ukraine policy was not  strong against Russia, noting that we help our partner fight Russia  over there so we don't have to fight Russia over here. Our friends are  on the frontlines in trenches and with sneakers. This was following the  Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014, ``the United States has stood by  Ukraine,'' and those are your words.   Well, it is true that the United States has stood by Ukraine since  the invasion of 2014. Only one President since then took a very  concrete step. Some of you supported it. That step included actually  providing Ukraine with lethal weapons including Javelin missiles. That  is what President Trump did. Some of you in this very room--some of you  managers--actually supported that.   Here is what Ambassador Taylor said that you didn't hear in the 23  hours. You didn't hear this. Javelin missiles are `` . . . serious  weapons. They kill Russian tanks.''   Ambassador Yovanovitch agreed, stating that Ukraine policy under  President Trump actually got stronger, stronger than it was under  President Obama.   There were talks about sanctions. President Trump has also imposed  heavy sanctions on Russia. President Zelensky thanked him.   The United States has imposed heavy sanctions on Russia. President  Zelensky thanked him.   Manager Jeffries said that the idea that Trump cares about corruption  is laughable. This is what Dr. Hill said. They didn't play this--`` . .  . eliminating corruption in Ukraine was one of, if the central goal of  U.S. foreign policy'' in Ukraine.   Let me say that again. Dr. Hill testified that ``eliminating  corruption in Ukraine was one of, if [not] the central goal of U.S.  foreign policy [in Ukraine].'' If you are taking notes, you can find  that in the Hill deposition transcript 34:7 through 13.    Dr. Hill also said that she thinks:       . . . [T]he President has actually quite publicly said that       he was very skeptical about corruption in Ukraine. And, in       fact, he's not alone, because everyone has expressed great       concerns about corruption in Ukraine.    Ambassador Yovanovitch--they didn't play this. She also said ``we all  had concerns.''  [[Page S575]]    National Security Director Morrison confirmed that he ``was aware  that the President thought Ukraine had a corruption problem, as did  many other people familiar with it.''   I am not going to continue to go over and over and over again the  evidence that they did not put before you because we would be here for  a lot longer than 24 hours, but to say that the President of the United  States was not concerned about burden sharing, that he was not  concerned about corruption in Ukraine, the facts from their hearing  established exactly the opposite.   The President wasn't concerned about burden sharing? Read all of the  records.   And then there was Mr. Schiff saying yesterday, maybe we can learn a  lot more from our Ukrainian ally.   Let me read you what our Ukrainian ally said. President Zelensky,  when asked about these allegations of quid pro quo, he said:         I think you read everything. I think you read the text. We       had a good phone call.    These are his words.         It was normal. We spoke about many things. And so, I think,       and you read it, that nobody pushed me.    They think you can read minds. I think you look at the words.   I would yield the balance of my time to my colleague, the deputy  White House counsel Pat Philbin. He is going to address two issues.   We are going to try to do this in a very systematic way in the days  ahead. No. 1, involving issues related to obstruction--because this  came at the end of theirs, so I want to do this in a sequence, as it  relates to some of the subpoenas that were issued. He is also going to  touch on some of the due process issues, since it was at the end of  theirs and is fresh in everybody's minds.   Mr. Chief Justice.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, Majority Leader  McConnell, Democratic Leader Schumer: Good morning. As Mr. Sekulow  said, I am going to touch upon a couple of issues related to  obstruction and due process, just to hit on some points before we go  into more detail in the rest of our presentation.   I would like to start with one of the points that Manager Jeffries  focused a lot on toward the end of the presentation yesterday relating  to the obstruction charge in the second Article of Impeachment because  he tried to portray a picture of what he called ``blanket defiance,''  that there was a response from the Trump administration that was  simply: We won't cooperate with anything, we won't give you any  documents, we won't do anything, and it was blanket defiance really  without explanation. That was all there was. It was just an assertion  that we wouldn't cooperate.   And he said, and I pulled this from the transcript, that President  Trump's objections are not generally rooted in the law and are not  legal arguments.   That is simply not true. That is simply not true. In every instance,  when there was resistance to a subpoena, resistance to a subpoena for a  witness or for documents, there is a legal explanation and  justification for it.   For example, they focused a lot on an October 8 letter from the  Counsel for the President, Pat Cipollone, but they didn't show you the  October 18 letter, which is up on the screen now, that went through in  detail why subpoenas that had been issued by Manager Schiff's  committees were invalid because the House had not authorized their  committees to conduct any such inquiry or to subpoena information in  furtherance of it. That is because the House had not taken a vote to  authorize the committee to exercise the power of impeachment to issue  any compulsory process. I am going to get into that issue in just a  moment.   Not only was there a legal explanation--a specific reason for every  resistance, not just blanket defiance--every step that the  administration took was supported by an opinion from the Department of  Justice in the Office of Legal Counsel. Those are explained in our  brief, and the major opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel is  actually attached in our trial memorandum as an appendix.   Mr. Jeffries and other managers also suggested that the Trump  administration took the approach of no negotiation, a blanket refusal,  and no attempt to accommodate. That is also not true. That is also not  true. In the October 8 letter that Mr. Cipollone sent to Speaker  Pelosi, it said explicitly: ``If the Committees wish to return to the  regular order of oversight requests, we stand ready to engage in that  process as we have in the past, in a manner consistent with well- established bipartisan constitutional protections and a respect for the  separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution.''    It was Manager Schiff and his committees that did not want to engage  in any accommodation process. We had said that we were willing to  explore that.   The House managers have also asserted a number of times--this came up  in the first long night when we were here until 2 as well--that the  Trump administration never asserted executive privilege--never asserted  executive privilege. I explained at the time that that is technically  true but misleading--misleading because the rationale on which the  subpoenas were resisted never depended on an assertion of executive  privilege.   Each of the rationales that we have offered--and I will go into one  of them today: that the House subpoenas were not authorized--does not  depend on making that formal assertion of executive privilege. It is a  different legal rationale. The subpoenas weren't authorized because  there was no vote, or the subpoenas were to senior advisers to the  President who are immune from congressional compulsion, or the  subpoenas were forcing executive branch officials to testify without  the presence of agency counsel, which is a separate legal infirmity  again supported by an opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel at the  Department of Justice.   Let me turn to the specific issue of the invalidity of the subpoenas  because they weren't supported by a vote of the House authorizing  Manager Schiff's committee to exercise the power of impeachment to  issue compulsory process.   Manager Jeffries said that there were no Supreme Court precedents  suggesting such a requirement and that every investigation into a  Presidential impeachment in history has begun without a vote from the  House, and those statements simply aren't accurate.   There is Supreme Court precedent explaining very clearly the  principle that a committee of either House of Congress gets its  authority only by a resolution from the parent body. United States v.  Rumely and Watkins v. United States make this very clear. And it is  common sense. The Constitution assigns the sole power of impeachment to  the House of Representatives--to the House, not to any Member and not  to a subcommittee--and that authority can be delegated to a committee  to use only by a vote of the House.   It would be the same here in the Senate. The Senate has the sole  power to try impeachments. But if there were no rules that had been  adopted by the Senate, would you think that the majority leader himself  could simply decide that he would have a committee receive evidence,  handle that, submit a recommendation to the Senate, and that would be  the way the trial would occur, without a vote from the Senate to give  authority to that committee? I don't think so. It doesn't make sense.  That is not the way the Constitution assigns that authority, and it is  the same in the House.   Here, there was no vote to authorize the committee to exercise the  power of impeachment. And this law has been boiled down by the DC  Circuit in Exxon Corp. v. FTC to explain it this way: ``To issue a  valid subpoena, . . . a committee or subcommittee must conform strictly  to the resolution establishing its investigatory powers.''   There must be a resolution voted on by the parent body to give the  committee that power. And the problem here is, there is no standing  rule. There was no standing authority giving Manager Schiff's committee  the authority to use the power of impeachment to issue compulsory  process. Rule X of the House discusses legislative authority. It  doesn't mention impeachment. That is why, in every Presidential  impeachment in history, the House has initiated the inquiry by voting  to give a committee the authority to pursue that inquiry.   Contrary to what Manager Jeffries suggested, there has always been,  in  [[Page S576]]  every Presidential impeachment inquiry, a vote from the full House to  authorize the committee, and that is the only way the inquiry begins.   There were three different votes for the impeachment of President  Andrew Johnson--in January 1867, in March 1867, and in February 1868.   For President Nixon, Chairman Rodino of the House Judiciary Committee  explained--there was a move to have them issue subpoenas after the  Saturday Night Massacre, and they determined that they did not have  that authority in the House Judiciary Committee without a vote from the  House, and he determined, as he explained, that ``such a resolution has  always been passed by the House. . . . It is a necessary step if we are  to meet our obligations.''   There has been reference to investigatory activities starting in the  House Judiciary Committee in the Nixon impeachment prior to the vote  from the House, but all that the committee was doing was assembling  publicly available information and information that had been gathered  by other congressional committees. There was never an attempt to issue  compulsory process until there had been a vote by the House to give the  House Judiciary Committee that authority.   Similarly, in the Clinton impeachment, there were two votes from the  full House to give the House Judiciary Committee authority to proceed:  first a vote on resolution 525 just to allow the committee to examine  the independent counsel report and make recommendations on how to  proceed and then a separate resolution, H. Res. 581, that gave the  House Judiciary Committee subpoena authority.   At the time, in the House report, the House Judiciary Committee  explained:         Because the issue of impeachment is of such overwhelming       importance, the committee decided that it must receive       authorization from the full House before proceeding on any       further course of action. Because impeachment is delegated       solely to the House of Representatives by the Constitution,       the full House of Representatives should be involved in       critical decisionmaking regarding various stages of       impeachment.    Here, the House Democrats skipped over that step completely. What  they had instead was simply a press conference with Speaker Pelosi  announcing that she was directing committees to proceed with an  impeachment inquiry against the President of the United States.   Speaker Pelosi didn't have the authority to delegate the power of the  House to those committees on her own. So why does it matter? It matters  because the Constitution places that authority in the House and ensures  that there is a democratic check on the exercise of that authority and  that there will have to be a vote by the full House before there can be  a proceeding to start inquiring into impeaching the President of the  United States.   One of the things that the Framers were most concerned about in  impeachment was the potential for a partisan impeachment--a partisan  impeachment that was being pushed merely by a faction--and a way to  ensure a check on that is to require democratic accountability from the  full House, to have a vote from the entire House before any impeachment  can proceed. That didn't happen here. It was only after 5 weeks of  hearings that the House decided to have a vote.   What that meant, at the outset, was that all of the subpoenas that  were issued under the law of the Supreme Court cases I discussed--all  those subpoenas were invalid, and that is what the Trump administration  pointed out specifically to the House. That was the reason for not  responding to them, because under long-settled precedent, there had to  be a vote from the House to give authority, and the administration  would not respond to subpoenas that were invalid.   The next point I would like to touch on briefly has to do with due  process because we heard from the House managers that they offered the  President due process at the House Judiciary Committee. Manager Nadler  described it as that he sent the President a letter--the President's  counsel a letter--offering to allow the President to participate, and  the President's counsel just refused, as if that was the only exchange,  and there was just a blanket refusal to participate.   Let me explain what actually happened. I should note before I get  into those details that there was a suggestion also that due process is  not required in the House proceeding and that it is simply a privilege,  but that wasn't the position Manager Nadler has taken in the past. In  2016, he said:         The power of impeachment is a solemn responsibility,       assigned to the House by the Constitution, and to this       committee by our peers. That responsibility demands a       rigorous level of due process.    In the Clinton impeachment in 1998, he explained:         What does due process mean? It means, among other things,       the right to confront the witnesses against you, to call your       own witnesses, and to have the assistance of counsel.    Now, I think we all know that all of those rights were denied to the  President in the first two rounds of hearings--the first round of  secret hearings in the basement bunker where Manager Schiff had three  committees holding hearings and then in a round of public hearings to  take the testimony that had been screened in the basement bunker and  have it in a public televised setting, which was totally unprecedented  in any Presidential impeachment inquiry--in both the Clinton and the  Nixon inquiries. For every public hearing, the President was allowed to  be represented by counsel and cross-examine witnesses.   But the House managers say that is all right because when we got to  the third round of hearings, after people had testified twice, then we  were going to allow the President to have some due process. But the way  that played out was this: First, they scheduled a hearing for December  4 that was going to hear solely from law professors. By the time they  wanted the President to commit whether he would participate, it was  unclear--they couldn't specify how many law professors or who the law  professors were going to be, and the President's counsel wrote back and  declined to participate in that.   But at the same time, Manager Nadler had asked what other rights  under the House Resolution 660--the rules governing the House inquiry-- the President would like to exercise. The President's counsel wrote  back asking specific questions in order to be able to make an informed  decision and asked whether you intend to allow fact witnesses to be  called, including the witnesses who had been requested by HPSCI Ranking  Member Nunes; whether you intend to allow members of the Judiciary  Committee and the President's counsel a right to cross-examine fact  witnesses; and whether your Republican colleagues on the Judiciary  Committee will be allowed to call witnesses of their choosing. Manager  Nadler didn't respond to that letter. There wasn't information  provided.   We had discussions with the staff on the Judiciary Committee to try  to find out what were the plans and what were the hearings going to be  like. The way the week played out, on December 4, there was the hearing  with the law professors--the first hearing before the Judiciary  Committee--and on December 5, the morning of December 5, Speaker Pelosi  announced the conclusion of the entire Judiciary Committee process  because she announced that she was directing Chairman Nadler to draft  Articles of Impeachment. So the conclusion of the whole process was  already set.   Then, after the close of business on the 5th, we learned from the  staff that the committee had no plans, other than a hearing on December  9, to hear from staffers who had prepared HPSCI committee reports. They  had no plans to have other hearings, no plans to hear from fact  witnesses, and no plans to do any factual investigation.   So the President was given a choice of participating in a process  that was going to already have the outcome determined--the Speaker had  already said Articles of Impeachment were going to be drafted--and  there were no plans to hear from any fact witnesses. That is not due  process. That is why the President declined to participate in that  process, because the Judiciary Committee had already decided they were  going to accept an ex parte record developed in Manager Schiff's  process, and there was no point in participating in that. So the idea  that there was due process offered to the President is simply not  accurate.    The entire proceedings in the House, from the time of the September 4  press conference until the Judiciary Committee began marking up  Articles of  [[Page S577]]  Impeachment on December 11, lasted 78 days. It is the fastest  investigatory process for a Presidential impeachment in history.   For 71 days of that process, for 71 days of the hearing and taking of  depositions and hearing testimony, the President was completely locked  out. He couldn't be represented by counsel. He couldn't cross-examine  witnesses. He couldn't present evidence. He couldn't present witnesses  for 71 of the 78 days. That is not due process.   It goes to a point that Mr. Cipollone raised earlier. Why would you  have a process like that? What does that tell you about the process?   As we pointed out a couple of times, cross-examination in our legal  system is regarded as the greatest legal engine ever invented for the  discovery of truth. It is essential. The Supreme Court has said in  Goldberg v. Kelly, for any determination that is important, that  requires determining facts, cross-examination has been one of the keys  for due process.   Why did they design a mechanism here where the President was locked  out and denied the ability to cross-examine witnesses? It is because  they weren't really interested in getting at the facts and the truth.  They had a timetable to meet. They wanted to have impeachment done by  Christmas, and that is what they were striving to do.   Now, as a slight shift in gears, I want to touch on one last point  before I yield to one of my colleagues, and that relates to the  whistleblower--the whistleblower, whom we haven't heard that much  about--who started all of this. We know from a letter that the  inspector general of the intelligence community sent that he thought  the whistleblower had political bias. We don't know exactly what the  political bias was because the inspector general testified in the House  committee in an executive session, and that transcript is still secret.  It wasn't transmitted up to the House Judiciary Committee. We haven't  seen it. We don't know what is in it. We don't know what he was asked  and what he revealed about the whistleblower.   Now, you would think that before going forward with an impeachment  proceeding against the President of the United States, that you would  want to find out something about the complaint that had started this,  because motivations, bias, reasons for wanting to bring this complaint  could be relevant. But there wasn't any inquiry into that.   Recent reports, public reports suggest that, potentially, the  whistleblower was an intelligence community staffer who worked with  then-Vice President Biden on Ukraine matters, which, if true, would  suggest an even greater reason for wanting to know about potential bias  or motive for the whistleblower.   At first, when things started, it seemed like everyone agreed that we  should hear from the whistleblower, including Manager Schiff.   I think we have what he said.
