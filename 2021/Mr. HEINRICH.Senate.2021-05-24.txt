 Mr. President, it is my honor to recognize the  life of Dr. Peter B. Lyons, a steadfast and selfless public servant,  who over the course of an unparalleled and distinguished career at Los  Alamos National Laboratory, the U.S. Senate, the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission, and the U.S. Department of Energy, made numerous  contributions to the field of nuclear physics, to the State of New  Mexico, and to our country's nuclear energy community.   In 2010, Dr. Lyons was confirmed as the Assistant Secretary for  Nuclear Energy at the U.S. Department of Energy. As Assistant  Secretary, he focused on incorporating modeling and  [[Page S3332]]  simulation into all programs through the Nuclear Energy Advanced  Modeling and Simulation Program, advancing the management of used  nuclear fuel through the development of the Strategy for the Management  and Disposal of Used Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Waste, and  leading the Nuclear Energy Group that established the Small Modular  Reactor Licensing Technical Support Program for a new generation of  safe, reliable, low-carbon nuclear energy technology. Under his  leadership, the Nuclear Energy University Program also expanded its  successful work supporting universities in the United States as they  prepared the next generation of nuclear engineering leaders.   Prior to his leadership at the Department of Energy, Dr. Lyons served  for 4\1/2\ years on the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and for 8 years  as an invaluable member of U.S. Senator Pete V. Domenici's staff, when  Senator Domenici was the chairman of both the Senate Energy Committee  and Appropriations Energy and Water Development Subcommittee. He and  Senator Domenici focused on broadening the use of nuclear energy in its  safest configuration as a critical way to reduce dependence on other  forms of energy that contributed to climate change.   For nearly 30 years, Dr. Lyons worked as a nuclear physicist at Los  Alamos National Laboratory. He served as Director for Industrial  Partnerships, Deputy Associate Director for Energy and Environment, and  Deputy Associate Director for Defense Research and Applications. At Los  Alamos, he also spent a decade supporting nuclear test diagnostics and  served as the Chairman of the NATO Nuclear Effects Task Force. He  published more than 100 technical papers and held three patents related  to fiber optics and plasma diagnostics. He was also elected to the Los  Alamos School Board for 16 years, a true reflection of his broad  dedication to public service.   Dr. Lyons received his undergraduate degree in physics and  mathematics from the University of Arizona and his doctorate in nuclear  astrophysics from the California Institute of Technology. He was a  fellow of the American Nuclear Society, ANS, a fellow of the American  Physical Society, and recipient of the Eisenhower Award for  distinguished service from the ANS.   Behind all of these extraordinary achievements and vital  contributions to our country lay a humble, kind, and profoundly decent  person. All who knew Dr. Lyons, or ``Pete,'' as he insisted his friends  and associates call him, will never forget his kindness, his  thoughtfulness, and his willingness to help everyone who approached  him. Even as he fought the cancer that eventually took his life, he  retained his optimistic nature and his great sense of humor.   My thoughts are with all of Pete's family, friends, and colleagues as  they mourn his loss and reflect on all that he accomplished in his  life.                            ____________________     Madam President, it is a deep honor to recognize  the life of an extraordinary New Mexican, Dr. Armin Rembe of Los  Ranchos. The first oncologist-hematologist in Albuquerque, Dr. Rembe  served countless numbers of patients in New Mexico delivering  lifesaving care over a long and successful medical career.   Originally from Seattle, WA, Dr. Rembe developed a lifelong love for  his adopted home State of New Mexico. He studied everything he could  about New Mexico's rich history and culture. He also became a  preeminent collector of Spanish colonial art and served for years as a  judge at the annual Spanish Market in Santa Fe.   With his wife of 58 years, Penny, Dr. Rembe developed his second  career after retiring from medicine as an organic farmer and steward of  Los Poblanos Historic Inn and Organic Farm in Los Ranchos. The historic  property was designed by the renowned architect John Gaw Meem and sits  amid 25 acres of lavender fields, cottonwood trees, and formal gardens  in the Rio Grande Valley.   For 45 years, Dr. Rembe and Penny worked tirelessly to grow the  successful and dynamic mission of Los Poblanos as a gem of historical  preservation, a venue with world-class hospitality, and a working  organic farm that keeps the tradition of agriculture in the Rio Grande  alive while minimizing the use of precious water resources.   Above all else, Dr. Rembe was proud of his family. My thoughts are  with his beloved wife, Penny, their four children, Emily, Armin, Jay  and Matthew, and their eight grandchildren, as they grieve this loss  and remember a life well-lived.                            ____________________
