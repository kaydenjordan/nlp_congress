 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Mayor Dane  Haygood of Daphne, who recently retired after 8 successful years in  office.   The Jubilee City is truly a jewel of southwest Alabama, and as  Baldwin County has experienced the fastest growth in Alabama in recent  years, Daphne has led the way. No city could experience such rapid  growth while retaining its sense of community without good stewardship,  and Mayor Haygood deserves a tremendous amount of credit for his 8  years of steady leadership.   With Mayor Haygood at the helm, Daphne was one of the chief  beneficiaries of the past decade of economic expansion in our region.   Mayor Haygood can leave office knowing that Daphne is well positioned  to continue on the path to prosperity. I congratulate Mayor Haygood and  his family, and I look forward to seeing what the future has in store  for them in the years ahead.                           Recognizing David Baker     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Mayor David Baker of  Semmes on his many years of service. Mayor Baker recently left the  mayoral office after a distinguished and diverse history of service to  his community.   Since Mayor Baker began serving as city councilman for Semmes in  2011, he has always been a highly visible and accessible public  servant. While in office, Mayor Baker has overseen a period of growth  and annexation, and Semmes is well prepared to continue its growth and  meet new challenges.   A proud graduate of the University of South Alabama in Mobile, Mayor  Baker retired as an officer in the United States Army after 20 years of  honorable service. Since becoming an educator in 2003, countless high  school students in the community have benefited from his wise  instruction.  [[Page H5871]]    I have every confidence Mayor Baker will remain involved in the  community, and I wish him and Alice the best in the days ahead.                         Congratulating Terry Downey     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Terry Downey  upon his recent retirement. Since his election in 2016, Mayor Downey  has guided Bayou la Batre through a series of significant challenges,  including several severe hurricanes and the recent pandemic.   Bayou la Batre has a unique heritage as a diverse home with the  fishing and seafood processing industries, and Mayor Downey's  leadership helped Bayou la Batre weather the storms and protect the  livelihoods and culture of its residents. The city is well-prepared to  continue handling whatever else may come its way.   I thank Mayor Downey for his service, and I join the people of Bayou  la Batre in wishing him all the best in the next stage of his life.                                time  1015                 Congratulating Jimmy Lyons on His Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Jimmy Lyons upon his  retirement as director and CEO of the Alabama State Port Authority.   Over more than two decades, Jimmy's creative, forward-thinking  leadership led to transformative growth at one of Alabama's premier  assets.   Jimmy's steady stewardship guided the port authority during economic  highs and lows. Despite a range of challenges, the port has thrived  under his leadership.   With him at the helm, the port is now one of the fastest growing  container terminals in the country. It has added a steel terminal and  has vastly expanded its ability to load and unload automobiles, and  those are just a few examples.   Jimmy also played a critical part in securing upgrades at the port  and in the channel that allow a higher number of increasingly large  ships from around the globe to use the port with growing ease.   While he will be missed, the Alabama State Port Authority, and  Alabama's economy, are better positioned for future success than they  have ever been because of Jimmy Lyons. I wish him the best in his well- deserved retirement.               Honoring the Lives of William and Euber Collins     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the lives of two  dear friends who recently passed away, William and Euber Collins.   William, known by most as Monty, passed away at 90 years old on  November 2, only 1 day before his wife, Euber, who was 88. They were  married a remarkable 68 years.   After meeting and falling in love at the University of Alabama, Monty  and Euber married and found their way to Mobile. Their close  partnership enabled them to raise four wonderful children and Monty to  have a long, successful career, culminating in his retirement from the  First National Bank of Mobile.   After his retirement, Monty served as a field representative for my  predecessor, Sonny Callahan, and served two terms as a member of the  Alabama House of Representatives.   Throughout their marriage, Monty and Euber maintained a remarkable  level of engagement and service to Mobile.   Monty and Euber leave behind a legacy of love for each other, their  family, and their community that will be difficult to match in its  intensity and longevity. They will be deeply missed and fondly  remembered.   My heartfelt condolences go out to their family.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Donna Givens  [[Page H5876]]  upon her retirement after a long and accomplished career at Baldwin  EMC.   Donna's community involvement and professional accolades have led me  and many others to call her the Queen of Baldwin County.   I do not bestow that designation lightly. I have known and worked  with Donna for many years, dating back to my time in the Alabama State  Senate two decades ago. She was a force even then, and her level of  service and influence in southwest Alabama have only grown.   She is recognized across the region for being an asset to Baldwin EMC  and their thousands of customers as well as the community at large.   I wish Donna my sincerest best wishes in her retirement. I have no  doubt she will remain a fixture in the community she so humbly and ably  serves.                            ____________________
