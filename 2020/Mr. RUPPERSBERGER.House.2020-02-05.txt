 Madam Speaker, this week, we recognize Gun  Violence Survivors Week across our country. In my district alone, there  have been 331 gun-related deaths and 716 injuries, including seven mass  shootings over the last 7 years.   There are two sides of the coin when it comes to ending gun violence.  Implementing commonsense gun safety measures that a vast majority of  Americans support must be our top priority. At the same time, we have  to begin addressing the root cause of gun violence in our communities,  which is a revolving door phenomenon. Victims of gun violence are  caught up in the drug wars, the culture of retaliation, and disrespect.   In fact, the rate of violent reinjury at most of the Nation's trauma  centers is as high as 45 percent. One of the leading risk factors for  violent injury is prior violent injury.   While these victims are recuperating in the hospital, they are a  captive audience. They are confined to bed, if only for a few days.  This offers us a window of opportunity where we can offer support when  they most need it.    I am in the process of finalizing bipartisan, bicameral legislation  with my colleague Congressman Kinzinger from Illinois, and our measure  creates a new grant program to provide the victims of gun violence, who  often become repeat victims of predators themselves, with the resources  they need to stop this vicious cycle. This might include bus money,  clothes for a job interview, or some groceries. Often, victims need  help finding an affordable apartment or getting off drugs.   Violence intervention programs, like the ones that our bill will  support, work. They reduce recidivism and hospital readmissions, jail  time, and unemployment. This is why my previously introduced bill was  endorsed by organizations such as the NAACP, the Fraternal Order of  Police, and the American College of Surgeons.   The University of Maryland's Shock Trauma Center has been rated the  top trauma center in the world. They support our troops in Iraq and  Afghanistan. They do research as it relates to all sorts of trauma.  Shock Trauma is led by Dr. Tom Scalea, with the great doctors, nurses,  and aides who work in that great institution. They have implemented  this program that I am talking about here today, and let me tell you,  it works.   I am excited to reintroduce my bill so we can work on lowering the  rates of firearm deaths throughout the country.                            ____________________
