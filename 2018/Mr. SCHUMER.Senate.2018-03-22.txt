 Mr. President, I have a few items I would like to  address this morning, but first I would like to recognize our dear  friend from Mississippi, the senior Senator, who will be delivering his  farewell speech today.   Senator Thad Cochran has served in this body for decades with a sense  of dignity, decorum, and respect for his colleagues. That was always  appreciated but never confused for lack of fierceness or conviction.  When his issues were on the line, Senator Cochran fought for  Mississippi as hard as any Senator. After all, he was first bitten by  the political bug in his run for head cheerleader at Ole Miss, and he  shares that distinction with Trent Lott. So if you want to be a Senator  for Mississippi, join the cheerleading squad for Ole Miss. Of course,  for New Yorkers, we like Eli Manning too. Senator Cochran never stopped  being a cheerleader for Mississippi.   Chairman Cochran and I certainly had our differences. The chairman  once said:         I don't call a lot of news conferences. I just don't see       that as a necessary part of my responsibilities.    Well, we will agree to disagree on that one, but there are many  things we have in common, and there is a particular part of his legacy  I admire.   After Hurricane Katrina buffeted his State, he convinced the  recalcitrant lawmakers to deliver aid to the gulf coast--far exceeding  the administration's request--and he did it by working Members on his  side of the aisle and across the aisle behind the scenes. That is how  he earned the nickname the ``quiet persuader.'' It is a skill I greatly  respect after going through something similar when Hurricane Sandy hit  my home State of New York.   At the time, Chairman Cochran was the ranking member on the  Appropriations Committee. He and his staff were extraordinarily helpful  throughout the process. Ultimately, Senator Cochran voted for the Sandy  relief bill when many of his colleagues opposed it. I will never forget  that.   Under his stewardship of the Appropriations Committee, we have just  completed the text of an omnibus spending bill, which I will address in  a moment. Once the bill passes, it will be a fitting legacy that  Senator Cochran will retire with another bipartisan accomplishment  under his belt.   I wish him and his family the best, and I thank him for his  distinguished service to the State of Mississippi, to his beloved  country, and to the U.S. Senate. He will be missed in the Senate.                         Omnibus Appropriations Bill    Mr. President, I am pleased to say the four congressional leaders  have reached an agreement on the omnibus spending bill that is now  public. It didn't happen until last night. It took a long time. There  were painstaking weeks of negotiations, more than a few of which we  went past the midnight hour. Before I go further, I want to thank  Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan, and their staffs, Leader Pelosi and her  team, Chairman Cochran, Vice Chairman Leahy, the Appropriations  Committee staff, and many others for all the hard work that went into  this bill.   It certainly doesn't have everything Democrats want, and it contains  a few  [[Page S1887]]  things Democrats aren't thrilled about. The same is true of our  Republican friends. That is true of all compromises. If each of us  stood on our hind legs and said ``If I don't get everything I want, I  am voting no,'' we would be totally paralyzed, and that happens far too  often in this body, but on this appropriations bill, this omnibus,  somehow that didn't happen. There was a remarkable spirit of give-and- take in the room.   Overall, we Democrats are very happy with what we have been able to  accomplish on a number of very important priorities to the middle class  in America: infrastructure, education, opioid treatment, mental health,  childcare. For nearly a decade, the middle class in this country has  suffered from a needless and self-imposed austerity, limiting  investment of all of the things that create good-paying jobs and  improve the working conditions of Americans, improve the lives of  Americans. This spending bill, this spending agreement, brings that era  of austerity to an unceremonious end and represents one of the most  significant investments in the middle class in decades.   So many of the middle class are frustrated, and they don't know why.  Well, one of the reasons is quietly, but unfortunately and quite  decisively, this Congress cut back on the very ladder that helps the  middle class climb in education, in infrastructure, in healthcare. It  was cut and cut and cut. The help that the Federal Government has given  to the middle class since the progressive era of the early 1900s was  taken away quietly but decisively. It is back. It is going to help  middle-class people stay in the middle class. It is going to help those  aspiring to the middle class climb that ladder and get there. It is  really a good thing, and I am excited about it.   As the Republican leader mentioned, it robustly funds our military,  giving our men and women in uniform the resources they need; it also  improves our ability to respond to wildfires; it makes a critical  downpayment on election security; it provides a reliable pathway for  the essential infrastructure projects in our country; and it makes an  incremental but important progress on the issue of gun violence--a  debate this Congress must resume soon.   Again, that era of austerity, which so hurt middle-class Americans,  is coming to an unceremonious end because this bill respects one of the  most significant investments in the middle class in decades. For these  reasons, I am confident this agreement will pass both Houses of  Congress; hopefully, with comfortable margins; hopefully, in a  bipartisan way.   Again, I thank the Republican leader for his part in reaching this  agreement, and I look forward to passing this legislation as soon as  possible.             China and Protecting American Intellectual Property    Mr. President, now on a final issue, while we are talking about  agreement and bipartisanship, I don't agree with President Trump on a  whole lot, but today I want to give him a big pat on the back. He is  doing the right thing when it comes to China.   For many of us, since Senator Graham and I went and visited China  over a decade ago, we have watched China rapaciously take advantage of  America, American jobs, American workers, and America's intellectual  property. China is ruthless in how they go after us. They do it  quietly. They do it with a smile. Unfortunately, previous Presidents-- Democratic and Republican--just stood by as China did what it did to  us.   President Trump is exactly right when, this afternoon, he will  propose a plan designed to punish China for its most flagrant trade  abuses.   I have called for such action for years and have been disappointed by  the inactions by both President Bush and President Obama. I am very  pleased this administration is taking strong action to get a better  deal on China because China has stolen and extorted the intellectual  property of American companies for years without repercussion.   Our intellectual property is our family jewel. The American way of  openness, of thinking, of debate has created the kind of place where  great thinkers come, think of great ideas, and those ideas are often  translated into millions of middle-class, good-paying jobs. China knows  this, but China is not a free and open society. To achieve the kind of  gains and advancements in technology, in biomedical science, and so  many other things, they have to steal what we do sometimes by buying  our companies, sometimes by cyber theft, sometimes by just these joint  ventures, and they tell American firms: You can only come to China if  you give away your intellectual property. China is taking huge  advantage of us.   Intellectual property is the lifeblood of emerging industries and the  good-paying jobs they provide. The American advantage of intellectual  property is one of the main things that will keep us No. 1 economically  in this century but not if we allow it to be stolen and taken advantage  of, and the country that does that more than any other is China.   As I said, intellectual property is the lifeblood of emerging  industries and the good-paying jobs they provide, so it is impossible  to overstate the cost of IP theft to our economy and our workers. This  sentence pains me, and I think about it often: GEN Keith Alexander, a  four-star general, nonpolitical, was in charge of cyber security in  America, and here is what he said: China's theft of our intellectual  property is ``the greatest transfer of wealth in history.'' We are  letting them do it. The crown jewel of America, our free and open  society that allows great thinkers to create great ideas and products,  they steal it, and we do nothing. It is one of the things that  aggravates me more than most others. Finally, President Trump is doing  something, unlike his predecessors, so I commend him.   The WTO--they have been grossly inadequate for this problem. We  cannot continue to ignore flagrant cheating by China, whether WTO likes  it or not. So the administration's announcement today is a leap  forward. If this new push is going to be successful, we need our allies  to work with us--Germany, Italy, France, Britain, open and free  societies, unlike China. They know their stuff is being stolen too.  Join with us. If we are a united, strong front against Chinese  activities on intellectual property, we can force them to change their  ways, but they will not do it by persuasion; they will not do it by  smiling; and, frankly, they will not do it by diplomacy when some of  our diplomats come in and say: We need China for this thing; ignore the  economic theft; ignore the economic disadvantage. So I support what the  President is doing.   When it came to the tariffs on steel and aluminum, I supported the  thrust, I supported the President's instinct, but it wasn't focused  enough on China and hurt too many of our other allies, like Canada,  where we have a trade surplus. I hope the President corrects his  thinking on that, but, here, this is aimed at China and one of the ways  China hurts us the very most. It is smart. It is good. I salute our  Trade Rep Lighthizer for pushing this issue; I salute our Commerce  Secretary Ross for pushing this issue.   By the way, to help support the administration's efforts to crack  down on China, we will fully fund the USTR's trade enforcement fund at  $15 million in the omnibus. So let's make sure China starts playing by  the rules, and intellectual property is certainly at the top of the  list. Today's announcement by the President will be a great start in  that direction. Democrats, Republicans, Americans of every ideology and  every region of the country should support these actions.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I had the privilege to speak at some  length about Thad in leader remarks, but I wanted to add one point. I  know my colleagues are waiting.   Another trait of Thad's, which has made him so successful, is that he  has a long memory and knows how to work the legislative process. I  remember, after the devastation of Katrina, Thad came over to me and  talked to me about the need for so much, including a rail line that was  somewhat controversial in the southern part of the State. He convinced  me that it was desperately needed, and I voted for it.   Well, the wheel always turns, and 6 years later, we were devastated  by Sandy. We needed all the help we could get, and I went to Thad. I  didn't have to say a thing. He said: I remember what you did for me. I  am going to help you all the way with Sandy, and he did.   This is just one of many great traits about this man and why he was  so amazingly successful for the country and, most of all, for his  beloved State of Mississippi. He made people want to help him and help  his State, even though we don't have--as the Senator from Maine has  said, our States are so different. We wanted to help each other, and we  are bound by it.   Thad, you are a great man and a great example to all of us on how to  conduct ourselves. We will miss you here in the Senate but wish you  God's speed in whatever else you do.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will  object.   I just want to make clear that I am sympathetic to the goals my  friends from Wisconsin and Indiana are trying to accomplish. In fact,  the Senate has already passed a version of this bill once and dedicated  time to work on the outstanding issues to get a good compromise and  pass it into law and pass it into law quickly.   I believe we all support the goals of safety and increasing access of  investigational drugs for terminally ill people, but the key is we need  to ensure there are safety mechanisms in place when we do this. A  significant part of that is making sure the FDA is part of the process.  They already have an expanded access program. We need to ensure that we  are not increasing the risk of patient harm or endangering clinical  trials so lifesaving drugs can continue to be developed and people have  access to them.   So I assure my colleagues that we will work together to get something  done, and done quickly, because this is an important issue. People who  have terminal illnesses deserve every opportunity and chance at  survival, and I look forward to working with my colleagues and moving  forward on the Senate bill.   With that, Mr. President, I object.
