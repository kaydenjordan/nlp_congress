 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the Denham-Costa amendment makes permanent  authority of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to enter cost recovery  agreements for evaluation and processing of permits for public utility,  natural gas companies, and railroad carriers.   The goal of this policy known as section 214 is to modernize the  evaluation of permits to ensure critical infrastructure projects can be  delivered to the public.   This policy can benefit the Central Valley, Napa, Sonoma, and other  disaster stricken areas by allowing them to rebuild faster so families  can turn on their lights and cool their homes.   I urge support of its passage, and I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Costa), my cosponsor.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
