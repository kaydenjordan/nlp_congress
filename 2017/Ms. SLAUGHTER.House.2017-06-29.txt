 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Sessions) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, all of us mourn the death of Kate Steinle, tragically  shot and killed in San Francisco in 2015. Indeed, there isn't a parent  anywhere who doesn't worry constantly about the well-being and the  health and the safety of a child. And we all know, even though we may  not have lost our own, we have deep sympathy with those who do. But as  the Cato Institute has outlined, the legislation before us today would  not have prevented that tragedy.   As the Cato Institute has said, the alleged shooter ``did not end up  in San Francisco due to lax border security, and the case actually  shows the opposite. In recent years, Border Patrol caught him each time  he attempted to cross.''   He was only in the city because the U.S. Justice Department failed to  do its job, and that is why Cato has called this bill, ``a waste of  Federal resources.'' Let me say that again, Mr. Speaker, that these are  the words of the Cato Institute, a group founded by the well-known  conservative Charles Koch. Cato could not have been more clear when  they said it this week: ``Kate's Law would not have helped Kate.''   Now, our country has listened as President Donald J. Trump called  Mexican immigrants ``criminals, drug dealers, and rapists.'' The public  has watched him promote the formation of a deportation force to tear  apart immigrants from their families and sign an executive order  directing Federal resources toward the construction of a wall along the  border between the U.S. and Mexico, where there is one mostly already  that has not done that much deterring, but that is despite the fact  that Federal spending on border security over the last few years has  been at the highest level that our country has ever seen. It seems the  majority has now taken a page from the President's playbook, apparently  trying to turn his dangerous rhetoric into law.    It is shameful that they are prioritizing a bill that is completely  unnecessary, since current law already imposes adequately severe  penalties for illegal reentry, including enhanced penalties for  criminal offenses. It is already covered, Mr. Speaker, but we do have  something we need to fill the afternoon since the health bill failed.  All the while, the majority is ignoring the many, many, many major  issues facing the Nation today.   Now, I know, and we all know, that the bill wasn't the only thing  they were hoping to ram through here before we adjourned for the  district work period. They also hoped to pass their healthcare repeal  bill so quickly before leaving town that the American people wouldn't  notice; but, frankly, even as I say that, they have noticed, as I  understand now, that the approval rating for that bill is 12 percent.  They have noticed. I think what they have noticed is that they are  going to kill Medicaid.   The reason they wanted to do this in a hurry, repeal healthcare  first, was in order to fulfill their tax bill promise of corporate tax  cuts as well as tax cuts for the richest people in the United States.  They wanted to take from the health bill, the expanded Medicare money,  $80 billion to pay for tax cuts. The devastation that that would  create, I think most American people understand it.   If they have a loved one in a nursing home, that means that, since 64  percent of the cost of nursing care is borne by Medicaid, that they  would very likely have to bring the person home.   It means that 22 million people would lose their health insurance.  You know, we just say that, ``22 million people.'' Let me put that  number in some perspective. That number, 22 million, is more than the  population of Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, New  Hampshire, New Mexico, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Rhode Island,  South Dakota, Vermont, Washington, D.C., West Virginia, and Wyoming  combined. That is pretty impressive, isn't it?   In February, our President Trump said: ``Nobody knew healthcare could  be so complicated.'' Well, Mr. Speaker and Mr. President, those of us  on our side who worked for more than a year to craft the Affordable  Care Act knew that very well. I was chair of the Rules Committee at the  time, and just the Rules Committee heard from 46 different Members of  Congress over the course of three meetings which, together, lasted more  than 20 hours, one of them a full Saturday of hearings.   So, together with the work done by the other committees of  jurisdiction, the healthcare reform law received such a thorough  vetting--and I want to get this on the record because I hear all the  time it was written behind closed doors and strange people and nobody  knew what it was and that we were all surprised. Nothing could be  further from the truth.   Bill Kristol proclaimed on FOX News: ``This is the most thoroughly  debated piece of legislation in my memory in Washington.''   I feel like I need to say that again, but I won't take the time, but  how important it is. But those of us who were there knew it. We knew  how many committee meetings were held on this legislation.   On the bill you are talking about from your side, the majority side,  not a single committee has heard it. I wager that the vast majority of  the Republicans--who deserve to see it--have not even seen that bill,  and that is a tragedy. We do not operate the United States of America  that way.   So, Mr. Speaker, there is no comparison between the open, the  transparent, and lengthy process that we went through to craft the  Affordable Care Act--which, by the way, was written by experts--and  what the majority is trying to do with this disastrous repeal bill.   And while I am at it, so many times when I was doing the rule on the  repeal bills--and, you know, repeal and replace, repeal and replace. We  know now that all those 7 years and those more than 60 votes that we  paid for while we are running the House, that all this time there was  no replacement. They still don't have a replacement. If that wasn't a  hoax on the American people, I don't know what was. But the process we  are seeing now is defined by backroom deals and secrecy and a complete  disregard for regular order.   And I understand that, between now and tomorrow afternoon, there will  be a lot of big deals changing hands so that we won't know next week  what is there anyway, but we wait to see the new CBO score and see what  that says.   Nearly every President since Theodore Roosevelt tried to enact  healthcare reform. That is a long time. Teddy Roosevelt tried it and  many  [[Page H5310]]  Presidents after him. But after decades of failed attempts and false  starts, President Obama, working with a Democratic Congress, was  finally able to deliver.   The majority should work with us again. We are willing to do that.  And what we would really like to see you do is take the ACA and the  problems that it has and let's work together and improve that law,  which has already been in effect now for a number of years, since 2014,  and we could just move ahead and get on with things that are terribly  important to us.   We wish that you would do that instead of trying to dismantle it. If  it were dismantled, it would disrupt the markets. It would harm the  sick and disproportionately impact those in nursing homes.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), the distinguished ranking member of the  Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 2  minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 2  minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 2  minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I inquire if my colleague has more  speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump campaigned on the promise of bringing  jobs back home and removing barriers to job creation. But despite these  promises, President Trump's budget does the complete opposite. It cuts  job training programs by 39 percent, and its draconian spending cuts  would lead to massive job losses.   My colleagues will be happy to hear that I have an amendment that  will ensure that the President keeps his promise of bringing jobs back  home.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Pascrell's Bring Jobs  Home Act, H.R. 685.   H.R. 685 will close a tax loophole that rewards companies for moving  jobs overseas, while providing a tax credit to companies that move jobs  back to the United States.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Chaffetz). Is there objection to the  request of the gentlewoman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) to discuss our proposal.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is the 38th closed rule allowing no amendments that  House Republicans have brought to the floor this year alone, and it is  only June. At this rate, the majority is well on its way to becoming  the most closed Congress in history.   Regular order seems to be a thing of the past under this leadership,  with bills coming to the House floor, as these two are, for a vote  without even going through the committee process. The immigration bills  we considered this week didn't even go through regular order. The  disastrous healthcare repeal bill, which would impact one-sixth of the  Nation's economy, didn't get a single hearing, and hardly anybody saw  it.   No experts were ever called to discuss its impacts, and it was jammed  through the Chamber last month without even a score from the  nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office outlining its costs or its  impacts. The Senate has also completely bypassed the committee process.   I was proud to bring the Affordable Care Act, as I said earlier, to  the House floor in 2009, as chair of the Rules Committee. That process  couldn't have been more different.   Let me remind those watching today that the House held 79 bipartisan  hearings and markups on health insurance reform in 2009 and 2010.  During this time, House Members heard from 181 witnesses from both  sides of the aisle, considered 239 Democratic and Republican  amendments, and accepted 121 of them.                                time  1330    That process was entirely different from what we go through today. In  fact, a lot of the Members of the House are really cut out of most of  the process. The idea of getting an amendment is really pretty rare.   The legislation we consider here should be able to withstand  scrutiny, but, more and more, the Nation's business is done in the  dark, or by a few people.   Let's get out of the back rooms, Mr. Speaker, and let legislators of  both parties do their job under an open process. That is what the  Speaker promised when he took the gavel, and it is what all the books  and Rules of the House of Representatives desire, and it is certainly  what the American people deserve.   Mr. Speaker, we should not consider a bill that would cost tens of  millions of people to lose health insurance, and not consider the anti- immigration bills before us today.   So I am going to urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, on the  rule, and the bill, and hope for better days.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair  will reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on  the question of adoption.
