 Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Darien Police Officer David Horton of Ludowici,  Georgia, who sadly passed away at the age of 45. David was a respected  and honored member of his community.   After graduating from law enforcement training in 2014, he began his  career with the Long County Sheriff's Office.   David had a heart for service and was awarded numerous accolades  during his time in law enforcement. As an agency DUI Hero award winner,  David was the definition of protect and serve.   He was not only a dedicated law enforcement officer but also a  devoted father and citizen who was loved and respected by many.   I am thankful for David's lifetime of service and commitment to his  community. I know his legacy will be forever treasured.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
