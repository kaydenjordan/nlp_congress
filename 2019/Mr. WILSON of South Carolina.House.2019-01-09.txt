 Mr. Speaker, South Carolinians today  will celebrate the inauguration of Governor Henry McMaster, Lieutenant  Governor Pamela Evette, and Attorney General Alan Wilson, along with  all of our other constitutional officers.   After serving 2 years as Governor succeeding Governor Nikki Haley,  Henry McMaster enters his first full term. He has dedicated his life to  serving our citizens. Best wishes to Henry, First Lady Peggy, and their  two children, Henry, Jr., and Mary Rodgers.   The Governor's running mate, Pamela Evette, is a successful business  leader to serve as Lieutenant Governor. Her husband, David, and  children, Amanda, Joseph, and Jackson, will make a positive difference.   Our oldest son, Alan, was sworn in for a third term today after  becoming the youngest attorney general in the Nation in 2011. Our  family is very grateful for his and his wife Jennifer's success, with  our grandchildren, Michael and Anna Grace.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
