 Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Jim Halvorson of the Montana Board of Oil and Gas  Conservation for his dedication to Montana and his 32 years of public  service.   Raised near Pendroy, MT, Jim graduated from the Montana School of  Mines, better known today as Montana Tech University. After years of  work in both Wyoming and Colorado, Jim made his way back home to the  Treasure State and went on to begin his career with the Montana Board  of Oil and Gas Conservation. He started out as a petroleum geologist  and was eventually appointed as Administrator. Jim's role included  administering Montana's oil and gas conservation laws, promoting  conservation, and overseeing oil and gas exploration and production in  the State.   As Jim enters into retirement, he can rest assured that he has made a  lasting impact on Montana's oil and gas industry. He will now have the  opportunity to enjoy the fruits of his labor as he plans to spend more  time in the great outdoors, whether that be fishing or enjoying time  with his wife of 40 years, Diana.   It is my honor to recognize Jim Halvorson for his dedication to the  Montana Board of Oil and Gas Conservation and for his 32 years of  public service to the great State of Montana. Jim, thank you for your  many years of public service and your commitment to preserving our  State's oil and gas reserves. I wish you all the best in your  retirement. You make Montana proud.                            ____________________
