 ROE of Tennessee asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute.)    ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, today, I rise to  celebrate and pay tribute to my hometown of Johnson City, Tennessee,  for its sesquicentennial.   In 1856, entrepreneur Henry Johnson opened a railroad station and a  commercial business, Johnson's Depot. Just 13 years later, in 1869,  Johnson City was founded, holding its first election on January 3,  1870, when voters elected Mr. Johnson as the city's first mayor.   Today, Johnson City boasts a diverse economy, attracting national and  regional companies while also supporting countless small business  owners. The city is home to three major hospitals; to the James H.  Quillen VA Medical Center, which serves more than 170,000 veterans; and  to East Tennessee State University, recognized for the highly regarded  Quillen College of Medicine and Gatton College of Pharmacy.   The city has become a thriving community of more than 66,000  residents, and I look forward to what is in store for Johnson City over  the next 150 years. I doubt that I will be there.   Madam Speaker, I will include in the Record a more complete statement  of Johnson City's history.                            ____________________     ROE of Tennessee:        H.R. 547.
