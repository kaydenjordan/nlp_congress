 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to highlight the action of the  bipartisan Congressional Steel Caucus.   Earlier this week, the Steel Caucus leaders and 47 other members of  the caucus sent a letter to the Biden-Harris administration that  expressed our strong support for the continuation of section 232 steel  tariffs and quotas.   The letter noted how we work hand-in-hand with industry and labor  organizations and that we recognize the negative impact that unfair  trade and global steel overcapacity have had on my district and the  Nation over the years.   These steel tariffs and quotas, which were implemented to protect our  national security, have resulted in significant reductions in imports.  We must continue to do all we can to ensure that our Nation supports  the domestic steel industry and our American steelworkers.   I look forward to continuing to engage with the Steel Caucus members,  all of my colleagues, and the Biden-Harris administration to ensure  that the American steel industry remains the foundation of our national  economy and our national security.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 447, the  National Apprenticeship Act of 2021.   It is my distinct honor to be a member of the House Education and  Labor Committee, and I am encouraged to see the consideration of this  critical piece of legislation as a priority before the House so early  in the 117th Congress.   Labor organizations and their apprenticeship programs are the  backbone of northwest Indiana's economy. Time and time again, I have  worked hand in hand with labor, civic groups, and faith-based  organizations to get people who need a career into a union  apprenticeship program.   For the past 15 years, as an administrator of emergency financial  assistance, I have sat across the desk of neighbors, friends, and  constituents who have an urgency for opportunity to provide for their  families. This legislation creates life-changing economic  opportunities. These types of programs are invaluable to provide all  individuals with a lifelong skill set, a job that pays a family- supporting wage, a safe working environment, and secure retirement.   I appreciate the legislation that aims to increase diversity and  equitable access for women to apprenticeship programs so that all  individuals can have access to good-paying jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this, and I ask my colleagues to join me in  supporting this legislation and the dignity of all workers.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support from the  International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and  Reinforcing Iron Workers.           International Association of Bridge, Structural,             Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers,                                  Washington, DC, February 1, 2021.      Hon. Robert Scott,      Chairman, U.S. House Committee on Education and Labor,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Scott: On behalf of the 160,000 members of       the International Association of Bridge, Structural,       Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers (IW), I write to       endorse H.R. 447, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2021.        The original National Apprenticeship Act was enacted during       the Great Depression and it helped struggling Americans by       offering them an opportunity to learn a skilled trade while       earning a middle-class wage. That was over 80 years ago, and       a lot has changed since then. H.R. 447 is needed to update       the law to reflect a 21st century economy and labor force       ready to work during these unprecedented times.        Investing in our country's workforce by expanding the       registered apprenticeship program is needed now more than       ever. With record-high unemployment numbers across the       country, registered apprenticeships offer people the       opportunity to learn a high skilled trade while earning a       family-supporting wage. H.R. 447 will not only strengthen       current registered apprenticeship programs but also create       programs to meet the demand.        The IW supports H.R. 447 and asks all the members of the       Education and Labor Committee to vote for this bipartisan       bill without any harmful amendments.            Sincerely,                                                         Eric Dean,                                                 General President.                                time  1015
