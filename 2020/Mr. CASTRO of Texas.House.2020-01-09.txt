 Mr. Speaker, in the last few days, the American  people have been unwillingly taken to the brink of war at the direction  of this administration.   Through reckless actions, the White House has unified the Iranian  public, alienated our partners in Iraq and Europe, undermined the fight  against ISIS, and left the United States more isolated than before; all  in just 1 week, and without the consent of this Congress.   This is a grave and serious moment in our country.   Two days ago, our brave men and women in uniform came under fire from  22 Iranian missiles, in harm's way because of their Commander in Chief.   Every American owes a debt of gratitude to our military for its  courage and sacrifice. For that reason, a decision that risks troops'  well-being must only be made thoughtfully and with the informed consent  of the public and this Congress.   As a Member of Congress, my biggest priority is to protect the safety  of the American people, at home and abroad. This can only be done by  defending Congress' constitutional authority over declaring war.   For that reason, I urge us to support this resolution.
