 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in  morning business.    Mr. President, when I listened to the speech by Senator  McConnell, the Republican leader, about Afghanistan, it transported me  back in history to October of 2002, when I was a U.S. Senator  representing the State of Illinois, just days away from a reelection  campaign, and we faced a historic vote here in the U.S. Senate. The  vote was whether or not we would invade Iraq; whether the United States  would give the President the authority to send American forces to Iraq.  There were 23 votes against that invasion. I was 1 of them, 22  Democrats and 1 Republican.   I can remember that night so well. It was late, past midnight, when  the vote was finally taken. But we had previously taken another vote,  and although I had voted against the invasion of Iraq, I saw the  invasion of Afghanistan as a different story. We believed that Osama  bin Laden and al-Qaida, responsible for 9/11, were in Afghanistan. And  the story was--the story line, and I bought it completely--if we don't  tell people like Osama bin Laden that there is a price to pay for  attacking America and killing 3,000 innocent people, who are we, and  who will be the next attacker?   So I voted. I voted for the invasion of Afghanistan and believed that  was the right thing to do at that moment in history. That vote passed  unanimously here in the Senate. There was only one dissenting vote in  the House of Representatives, Congresswoman Barbara Lee of California.  Virtually everyone else--everyone else, both political parties--voted  for the invasion of Afghanistan.   I will tell you, there was not a single Senator or Congressman who  would have stood up that evening on that vote and announced ``I am  prepared to vote for the longest war in American history,'' because  that is what we ended up voting for.   It was our belief that if we came into Afghanistan, we could stop  using this country as a haven for terrorism and we could help escort  them into the 21st century.   Well, after 20 years, after thousands of Americans gave their lives  and thousands more were critically injured, after the spending of  trillions of dollars in Afghanistan, we learned a bitter lesson. Our  willingness was not enough. The people in Afghanistan have to be  prepared to embrace change for it to happen.   We had to create an army in Afghanistan, a security force. It  virtually didn't exist. The warlords had their military, and they were  for sale, usually, to the highest bidder. And we were trying to create  a national security force. We were trying to create a nation, which was  quite a challenge.   I am not going to dwell on what happened, the bitter disappointments.  But when I hear Senators come to the floor saying, ``Isn't it a shame  that we are leaving Afghanistan? They are going to descend into chaos  and many, many problems,'' my question to them is: So what would you  have us do? Continue  [[Page S3388]]  with the troops risking their lives in Afghanistan for another 20  years, for another trillion dollars?   Not me. I believe we have reached a point where we have to do  everything we can to help Afghanistan really progress into the 21st  century. Yes, I feel a personal obligation to the men and women who  risked their lives for our troops.   For those who are opposed to or unaccepting of the notion of refugees  coming to the United States, for goodness' sake, let us have the  character to stand behind those Afghan men and women who risked their  lives for our soldiers and who are now probably marked by the Taliban  for death themselves. Yes, I would open our doors to them. They gave  their lives for our men and women, and we should never forget it. I  hope my friends on the other side of the aisle who have strong feelings  about immigration would at least realize that these individuals are  critically important to our role in history and our message to the rest  of the world when we seek their assistance.                                   S. 1260    Mr. President, this week we are going to consider a critically  important bill that will help secure America's role as a global leader  in science and technology. The investments that the United States  Innovation and Competition Act of 2021 makes in innovation will help  ensure our prosperity and national security. It supports American  research and development and will help to grow America's industrial and  manufacturing base by investing in clean energy, cyber security, and  biotechnology.   I thought a few years ago, reflected on the fact that I served in the  House and Senate, there have been moments, particularly important  moments that didn't receive the recognition they deserved, and one of  them was a bipartisan decision by several legislators: John Porter, who  was a Republican Congressman from Illinois; Senator Arlen Specter, a  Republican Senator from Pennsylvania; and Senator Tom Harkin, a  Democratic Senator from Iowa. Back in the day, they made a decision to  try to double the research budget for the National Institutes of  Health--quite an undertaking. I have seen a lot of things come and go  with the Congress, and that I thought was as ambitious as it gets.   They did it. They ended up doubling the NIH budget and received some  recognition for it, but far less than what they deserved.   So I went back out to the National Institutes of Health and spoke to  Dr. Francis Collins, whom we are lucky as Americans to have in that  position leading that great Agency. I said: Dr. Collins, I remember  those days with Specter and Harkin and Porter. What can we do now, our  generation, to help you at the National Institutes of Health? I don't  think I can double the budget. I wish I could. But what can I do?   He said: Senator, if you could persuade Congress to give us 5 percent  real growth every year--real growth over inflation--we will light up  the scoreboard. These researchers will stay on the job. They won't  worry about whether next year there is going to be funding. And you are  going to see some remarkable things occur.   I said I will set out to do that. I knew at the time that I needed  help. So I turned to Patty Murray on the Democratic side, who has been  our leader at the HELP Committee and on the Appropriations Committee.  And we then turned to Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, Republican leader  of the subcommittee, as well as Lamar Alexander, our retired friend  from the State of Tennessee.   So the four of us came together, and in a span of 5 or 6 years, we  took the NIH budget from $30 billion to $40 billion, just at the right  moment. We didn't anticipate COVID-19, but here it came, challenging  us: Are we ready? Can we develop a vaccine in a timely fashion?   And, thank goodness we could, because of the investment that we had  made as a Congress and the American people in this Agency. It paid off.  Not only did we save lives in the United States; we saved lives around  the world, and we will continue to because of that good work.   I came to believe that that was critically important and went to the  Department of Energy, sitting down with the Secretary, 5 or 6 years  ago, and told him the story about our commitment to NIH. And I said:  You know, I guess it is conceivable that we will do research that will  lead to some treatment of Alzheimer's and dementia. We know that it is  picking up speed, unfortunately, because people are living longer.   He said: Do you have any idea what Agency of government is  responsible for creating electronic means of monitoring this sort of  change in our brains, the change that leads to Alzheimer's?   I said: No, I don't.   He said: Well, it is the Office of Science in the Department of  Energy.   And I thought to myself: Durbin, you should have known better. It  isn't just the NIH. There are Agencies all around our Federal  Government that are doing research that complement one another. So I  came up with the notion to take that NIH model of 5 percent real growth  and start applying it to all the other research and innovation Agencies  of our Federal Government.   This bill we are considering this week, this United States Innovation  and Competition Act, acknowledges that and makes the investment in  research. I will tell you, I can't think of anything we can do that is  more bipartisan and will be accepted by the American people than the  knowledge that we are going to continue to encourage and subsidize, if  you will, scientists and researchers to move us forward in innovation  and technology.   This bill increases funding for the National Science Foundation and  the Department of Energy. That is going to spur research. It is going  to help at universities around my State and all around the Nation, and  it has been a priority, as I mentioned, for years.   But one important way we can compete economically in the world is by  boosting support for domestic manufacturing and strengthening our  domestic supply chain. The legislation that we are considering this  week does that exactly: $52 billion to boost our semi-conductor  manufacturing capabilities. This includes $10.5 billion for  semiconductor research and development; $2 billion for legacy chip  production to support the auto industry; $2 billion for research,  testing, and workforce development for semiconductor needs at the  Department of Defense; $500 million for coordination with foreign  government partners to support international semiconductor supply  chains. And importantly, this bill also ensures the payment of  prevailing wages on construction projects that are supported by this  funding.   Many semiconductor manufacturing jobs already pay more than typical  manufacturing jobs, and they should, but the workers who will help  build the facilities won't necessarily benefit from that unless we  ensure the same standards that we apply to other federally funded  construction projects apply here.   Research shows us that providing prevailing wage boosts worker  productivity and provides good value to taxpayers Several studies have  found that construction costs are not affected by prevailing wage  rates. It is our goal to compete with China and other nations, and  China, unfortunately, has morally abhorrent labor practices. Let's do  better. Let's show them and the world that we can do better.    In 1990, the United States produced 37 percent of the world's  semiconductors. That was 30 years ago--30 years ago, 37 percent. It is  12 percent today. What a dramatic decline. We want to turn that around.   Now there are some who question us, who question whether the United  States should invest in this kind of technology on semiconductors. I  call them the second-place finishers. They decided that the United  States can have a solid second-place finish from this point forward. I  couldn't disagree more.   This Nation can lead by example and investment, and that is what this  bill does. And those who are against it have to explain why giving  dominance in this critical industry to another country, whether it is  China or any other nation, is in the best interest of the growth of the  United States and in the best interest of the next generation of  American workers.   We are already facing a global shortage in microchips that led to  layoffs in my State and in many other places. Illinois has been a  leader in auto manufacturing, and I believe it will be in the  [[Page S3389]]  future, as well, thanks to dedicated workers like those at the  Stellantis plant in Belvidere, IL, who assemble the car known as the  Jeep Cherokee.   Unfortunately, that plant had to shut down just a few weeks ago. Why?  A global shortage of semiconductors. Earlier this month, Stellantis  announced as many as 1,640 employees of the plant will be laid off in  July because of the shortage. A similar story at Ford's Chicago  assembly plant that has 5,800 workers--this plant was idled through  April, with shutdowns extending into May.   We are not seeing this only in Illinois. It has been estimated as  many as 3.9 million fewer vehicles will be produced this year because  of the semiconductor shortage. Last month, in the State of Kentucky-- Kentucky--Ford announced the temporary shutdown of its Louisville  plant, impacting more than 8,000 of its employees. And Ford's  Louisville Assembly Plant, which employs nearly 4,000 workers, is  expected to close through mid-July.   GM halted production lines in Tennessee and Kansas and at several  other facilities this spring.   The news of these layoffs and plant closures underscores the urgent  need for Congress, on a bipartisan basis, to address this microchip  shortage. And the good news is that we have a real opportunity to pass  legislation that will offer help to these workers and families. These  investments in the CHIPS Act will not only address our immediate market  needs but help to ensure that manufacturers don't face shortages in the  future.   This funding will help support jobs through the entire supply chain-- from construction of new facilities to manufacturing and development of  chips, to workers in the auto industry who depend on this supply.   This bill makes a strategic investment that will help to counter the  growing threat caused by the rapid development of China's economy. I  hope my colleagues will join me in supporting these important  provisions to boost our domestic supply chain and support American  jobs. Or we can defeat this measure. We can decide it is too much  money, spending it at the wrong time. That is part of the second-place  finish club, which you might find in the U.S. Senate. I don't want to  be a part of it. I believe in the brains and the brawn of American  workers. I believe they are productive people and that our researchers  can lead the world, as they have over and over again, if we trust them  and we invest in them.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, are we now moving to a cloture vote on  Kristen Clarke?    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2  minutes equally divided for debate in support and opposition to Ms.  Clarke.    Mr. President, it is significant that on this day, this  anniversary of the death of George Floyd, that we are considering one  of the key appointments in the Biden administration to be Assistant  Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to consider the  historic importance of this moment and to support this well-deserving  and experienced person to serve our Nation in this capacity. I urge my  colleagues to vote aye.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15  minutes before the rollcall vote.    Madam President, it was 1 year ago today. It was a street  corner in the city of Minneapolis, the corner of 38th and Chicago  Avenue. For 9 minutes and 29 seconds, Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis  policeman, knelt on George Floyd's neck. As he knelt on his neck, he  stared into a camera with a look that haunts me to this day. Those 9  minutes and 29 seconds took George Floyd's life and changed America's  national conversation about law enforcement. Those 9 minutes and 29  seconds sparked a global movement and compelled us to bear witness to  the reality of racial injustice in our country.   In this Senate we are in a privileged position to face that reality  and to continue America's long, sometimes bitter march toward equal  justice under the law. That is why I rise today in support of Kristen  Clarke's nomination to be Assistant Attorney General for the Civil  Rights Division of the Department of Justice.   It is worth noting the history of this position. The Civil Rights  Division is one of the most important components of the Justice  Department. The Attorney General's Office has existed since 1789. The  Justice Department itself was not created until after our Civil War.   During the days of Reconstruction, after that war, our Nation  resolved to take new steps to form a more perfect Union through the  13th Amendment's abolishing slavery, the 14th Amendment's guarantee of  due process and equal protection, and the 15th Amendment's protection  of all citizens' fundamental right to vote.   The Department of Justice was created after the passage of those  amendments and entrusted with the responsibility to defend the rights  of Americans, particularly the newly emancipated, formerly enslaved  Americans.   Given the Department's immediate imperative to protect and preserve  civil rights, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed Amos Akerman to be  the first Attorney General to lead this new Department. Why? He had  extensive experience in prosecuting voter intimidation as the U.S.  attorney in the State of Georgia.   More than 150 years later, the Civil Rights Division of the Justice  Department now is entrusted with that constitutional responsibility.  The Division enforces Federal statutes prohibiting discrimination based  on race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability,  religion, national origin, and citizenship status.   And just as President Grant appointed a legal expert with a breadth  of experience to lead the newly formed Justice Department in 1870,  today, President Joe Biden has chosen Kristen Clarke to take up the  mantle as the head of the Civil Rights Division. With her breadth of  experience defending the civil rights of all Americans, Kristen Clarke  is singularly qualified to lead this Division, particularly at this  moment in history.   Kristen Clarke will be the first Senate confirmed woman of color to  do so--the first.   When I listen to the caricatures that are portrayed on the floor of  the Senate about this woman, I find it hard to believe they are talking  about the Kristen Clarke that we met in open Senate hearings.   We know what happened to the Civil Rights Division under President  Trump. Under President Trump and Attorneys General Sessions and Barr,  the Civil Rights Division was devastated. Over the past 4 years, the  Division rescinded guidance protecting transgender students, prohibited  the use of consent decrees for local police departments that had  engaged in systemic misconduct, and abandoned the prior legal positions  supporting Americans' fundamental right to vote.   I believe America needs a Civil Rights Division that vigorously  defends the civil rights of all Americans. Kristen Clarke is the legal  expert we need to restore and reinvigorate the Civil Rights Division.   You wouldn't know it from the characterizations on the other side  about her experience, but, notably, she is a veteran of two of its  sections. She began her legal career defending voting rights in the  Voting Section and later prosecuted hate crimes in the Division's  Criminal Section. She personally  [[Page S3396]]  understands the key role the Division's line attorneys play in  protecting civil rights.   Since leaving the Civil Rights Division, Ms. Clarke has continued  defending civil rights in State government and national civil rights  organizations. First, Ms. Clarke co-led the NAACP Legal Defense and  Educational Fund's voting rights work, litigating voting rights cases  under the Voting Rights Act and the National Voter Registration Act.  Then she served as a civil rights official for the New York State  Attorney General's Office, where she played a key role in launching a  religious rights initiative to address faith-based discrimination.   When you listen to those assignments and the fact that this woman was  chosen to head these divisions, how can it possibly square with some of  the caricatures that have been drawn on the floor today about who she  is?   Most recently, Ms. Clarke was chosen to lead the Lawyers' Committee  for Civil Rights Under Law. Those of us who follow this closely know it  is one of the most preeminent civil rights groups in America. During  her tenure, the Lawyers' Committee has taken on a huge caseload and  doubled in size to address the most pressing civil rights issues of our  time, including hate crimes.   Here is the part that I want to make a special emphasis on. Both  Vanita Gupta and Kristen Clarke have extensive endorsements from law  enforcement organizations. Yet, when they were characterized on the  floor of the Senate by their critics, they were characterized as haters  of police and law enforcement. It just mystifies me how Senators can  come to the floor knowing these organizations and believe that these  two women have hoodwinked them into believing that they support law  enforcement. The women and men in law enforcement aren't pushed around  and aren't easily deceived. They have endorsed these two women, and  today we address Kristen Clarke's nomination because of the records  they have written, not over a period of days or weeks or months but  years and in some cases decades, that they have written.   Consider this statement from Sheriff David Mahoney from Dane County,  WI, recently stepped down from the National Sheriffs' Association.   Let me quickly add, the National Sheriffs' Association is a powerful  organization, and it is one that isn't pushed around by any  politicians.   Sheriff Mahoney wrote--and I want to quote his words after some of  the outrageous charges that have been made against Ms. Clarke this  afternoon. Sheriff Mahoney wrote: ``Building trust between law  enforcement and communities is essential for law enforcement to  effectively serve all members of our community. It is with this in mind  that I strongly support Kristen Clarke. Ms. Clarke has built trust in  every stage of her career.''   Does that sound like someone who wants to defund the police? Do you  think that this Sheriff Mahoney from Dane County in Wisconsin would say  that about someone who wants to defund police?   He went on to say: ``When she was a federal prosecutor as a young  attorney, she gained the trust of federal agents and domestic violence  survivors and crime victims. When she was the Chief of the Civil Rights  Bureau in the New York State Attorney General's office, she built trust  among New Yorkers to protect their rights, and with the Lawyers'  Committee, she gained the trust of hate crimes victims and survivors.''   She has so many endorsements from law enforcement groups and from  prosecutors. I am not going to read them all into the Record.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have letters of support  for Ms. Clarke printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                           National Organization of               Black Law Enforcement Executives, January 30, 2021.       Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard J. Durbin,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitchell McConnell,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Grassley,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer, Minority Leader McConnell,       Chairman Durbin, and Ranking Member Grassley: The National       Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE)       formally acknowledges the work and commitment to service that       has been exhibited by Ms. Kristen Clarke. She is a long-time       partner of NOBLE and the recipient of our 2016 Civil Rights       Justice by Action Award.        Ms. Clarke has displayed the qualities of leadership,       empathy, excellence, and persistence in supporting and       defending the U.S. Constitution while ensuring equal       protection and justice for all Americans. This has been       exhibited countless times in roles such as President of the       Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and Manager of       the Civil Rights Bureau of the New York Department of Law.        It is NOBLE's belief that Ms. Clarke will help to ensure       the delivery of its mission which is to ensure equity in the       administration of justice in the provision of public service       to all communities, and to serve as the conscience of law       enforcement by being committed to Justice by Action.        In closing, this correspondence acts as a formal       endorsement of Ms. Kristen Clarke as the next Head of the       U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division.            Sincerely,                                                Dwayne A. Crawford,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                  Major Cities Chiefs Association,                                                   February 3, 2021.      Hon. Lindsey Graham,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Graham and Ranking Member Feinstein: The       Major Cities Chiefs Association, a professional organization       of police executives representing the largest cities in the       United States and Canada, is proud to endorse President       Biden's nominations of Lisa Monaco to serve as Deputy       Attorney General, Vanita Gupta to serve as Associate Attorney       General, and Kristen Clarke to serve as Assistant Attorney       General for Civil Rights.        The Department of Justice (DOJ) has been tasked with       addressing a complex set of issues, including police reform,       criminal justice reform, violent crime, and domestic       extremism. The team President Biden has nominated is       immensely qualified for this responsibility. The nominees       have decades of experience serving in senior leadership roles       within DOJ, other elements of the justice system, the private       sector, civil rights and civil liberties organizations, and       other key stakeholder groups. This experience will be       invaluable as they work to tackle the many challenges facing       DOJ.        In conversations with MCCA leadership, the nominees       listened intently to our concerns and expressed a desire to       collaborate closely with the MCCA. They indicated that open       lines of communication and MCCA input are critical in       addressing shared priorities such as advancing constitutional       policing, improving officer health and wellness, and       combatting the rise in violent crime currently occurring       across the country.        President Biden's DOJ nominees also made it clear that they       neither support defunding the police nor believe that doing       so will bring about the change our communities are calling       for. They pledged to work closely with the MCCA to support       and amplify the efforts already underway by many local law       enforcement agencies to develop and implement policies and       practices that are fair, equitable, transparent, and build       trust and legitimacy with all members of the community.        The MCCA believes these nominees will be effective leaders       and valuable partners for local law enforcement agencies. On       behalf of the MCCA membership, I respectfully request the       Committee act swiftly and support the nominations of Ms.       Monaco, Ms. Gupta, and Ms. Clarke.            Sincerely,                                                    Art Acevedo,                                   Chief, Houston Police Department,      President, Major Cities Chiefs Association.                                   ____                                            Hispanic American Police                                    Command Officers Association,                                                   February 6, 2021.

Grassley,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer, Minority Leader McConnell,       Chairman Durbin, and Ranking Member Grassley: The Hispanic       American Police Command Officers Association (HAPCOA) wishes       to support and recommend the nomination of Ms. Kristin  [[Page S3397]]       Clarke to the position of Head of the US Department of       Justice Civil Rights Division.        HAPCOA is the oldest and largest association of Hispanic       American command officers from law enforcement and criminal       justice agencies at the municipal, county, state, school,       university and federal levels.        HAPCOA's mission is to ``empower the future of law       enforcement'' by assisting law enforcement, criminal justice       and community organizations nationwide in their efforts to       recruit, train, mentor and promote qualified Hispanic       American men and women committed to a career in the criminal       justice arena and to the communities in which they serve and       protect.        HAPCOA acknowledges the work ethic and commitment of Ms.       Clarke and believe that she will be an effective leader as       the next Head of the DOJ Civil Rights Division.            Sincerely,                                                     Anthony Chapa,      Executive Director                                   ____                                     Dane County Sheriff's Office,                                                     April 29, 2021.

Durbin,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Grassley,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader Schumer, Minority Leader McConnell,       Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member Grassley: I write to       express my strong support for Kristen Clarke, the President's       nominee to serve as Assistant Attorney General of the Civil       Rights Division.        I serve as the Sheriff in Dane County, Wisconsin. I was       first elected to this position in 2006 and have served four       terms in office, and have over 40 years of service in law       enforcement. Our office serves the city of Madison, the       capital of Wisconsin, and its surrounding cities and towns. I       also serve as President of the National Sheriffs'       Association, an organization I hold in very high regard.        Building trust between law enforcement and communities is       essential for law enforcement to effectively serve all       members of our community. This overarching value is a bedrock       principle that has guided my stewardship of the Sheriff's       office, and is shared by law enforcement leaders all across       the country. This bedrock value is also important to federal       law enforcement leaders, who partner with state and local law       enforcement to promote public safety and build public trust.        It is with this in mind that I strongly support Kristen       Clarke, the President's Civil Rights Division nominee. Ms.       Clarke has built trust at every stage of her career. When she       was a federal prosecutor as a young attorney, she gained the       trust of federal agents and domestic violence survivors and       crime victims. When she was the Chief of the Civil Rights       Bureau in the New York State Attorney General's office, she       built trust among New Yorkers to protect their rights to       practice their faiths, to allow for language access, and to       protect against discrimination at work. When Ms. Clarke left       government service to lead the non-profit Lawyers' Committee       of Civil Rights Under Law, Ms. Clarke gained the trust of       hate crimes victims and survivors, to ensure that they could       obtain justice against their perpetrators.        As a tireless advocate for those who have been targeted by       inequality, hate, and discrimination, Ms. Clarke is exactly       the type of person who should be charged with guarding and       enforcing this country's core federal civil rights laws. She       is an exemplary lawyer and leader who possesses the       character, qualifications, and commitment to lead the Civil       Rights Division.        I urge you and your colleagues to support Ms. Clarke's       nomination.        Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                                  David J. Mahoney,                                   Sheriff, Dane County, Wisconsin.     The point I am trying to make is this: At this moment in  history, filling this Division, the Civil Rights Division, on the  anniversary of George Floyd's murder on the streets of Minneapolis, we  are choosing the first woman of color in the history of the United  States to head this Division. It is a historic choice. It shouldn't be  trivialized by those who want to paint a caricature of this woman not  even close to the truth. It shouldn't be trivialized by ignoring the  many endorsements she rightfully received because of her good life's  work, having spent her entire career defending the civil rights of all  Americans.   Ms. Clarke is the right person for the job. President Joseph Biden  believes that. The Attorney General believes it, and I believe it as  well. At a time when we have seen an appalling rise in hate crimes, we  need someone with her experience to head this Division.   I urge my colleagues to take note of the continued need for the Civil  Rights Division to do its important work 150 years after its creation.  Given that need and Ms. Clarke's breadth and depth of experience, I  urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of her nomination.   I yield the floor.                          Vote on Clarke Nomination     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1812         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
