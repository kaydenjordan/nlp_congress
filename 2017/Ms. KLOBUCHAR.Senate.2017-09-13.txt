 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, I rise to discuss a very important  amendment that has broad support. That is the Klobuchar-Graham  amendment on election cyber security. It is an amendment that Senator  Lindsey Graham and I are working to include in the National Defense  Authorization Act. Senator McCain is supportive of this bill, and I  understand why he is, and that is because he understands that our  election infrastructure is a major part of our national security. If we  can allow foreign countries to influence our elections, to hack into  our local, State election equipment, then we do not have a secure  America.   As we know, recent reports show there were 21 different States in  which Russians attempted to hack into their actual election software  and their equipment. This is not the focus on fake news right now. This  is not the focus on emails. This is a focus on actual attempts to hack  into State election equipment. It is very straightforward, and that is  why there is bipartisan support to pass this amendment to help States  to simply strengthen their election equipment. This is not a partisan  amendment. Some that come before this body are. As you will soon find  out, this has broad support on the Republican side. I am asking my  colleagues to help me pass it, to overcome the objections from one  Senator.   First of all, I would like to thank my colleagues Senator Lindsey  Graham,  [[Page S5266]]  Senator Kamala Harris, and Senator Lankford for their work on this  important issue. Senators Harris and Lankford have been working with  us, with Senator Graham and me, and I really appreciate their work on  this issue.   Senator Schumer mentioned this bill in his remarks yesterday. He said  securing our election infrastructure is a top priority, and I am  thankful he is a champion for this amendment. As I mentioned, Chairman  McCain and Ranking Member Reed, who are the two top Senators on the  Armed Services Committee--that should matter--I appreciate their work  for our Nation's defense and their work on the NDAA and the fact that  the legislation today includes an important provision championed by  Senator McCain. That provision says it is the policy of the United  States to defend against and respond to cyber threats to our democratic  system, to our system of democracy.   Senator McCain understands that election security is national  security. They are forever intertwined. If the people of this country  do not have the freedom to have their say in who should be elected-- Democrat, Republican, Independent--then we have a breach to our  national security. That is why we have such broad support to simply  authorize State grants so they can upgrade the security of their  election equipment.   I am here to fight for a vote, a simple up-or-down vote--which, yes,  I am well aware this will pass--but a simple up-or-down vote, supported  by this amendment, both Members who lead this committee. Our election  systems have been under attack. They have been under attack, and it  will happen again.   If this body wants to sit here and pretend it didn't happen, pretend  not to believe 17 intelligence agencies and everything else, that is up  to them, but I am not going to go home and tell my constituents I  didn't try everything I could to get this amendment included.   According to the Department of Homeland Security, Russian hackers  attempted to hack at least 21 States' election systems in 2016. Earlier  this year, we also learned that Russia launched cyber attacks against a  U.S. voting software company and the emails of more than 100 local  election officials.   Last month, the Chicago Board of Elections reported that names,  addresses, birth dates, and other sensitive information from about 1.8  million registered voters were exposed.   U.S. national security officials have been sounding the alarms that  our voting systems will continue to be a target in the future. The  former Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, recently  testified that Russia will continue to interfere in our political  system. As Senator Rubio noted, maybe one time it was one party and one  candidate and the next time it will be another. This is what former  Director James Clapper said:         I believe Russia is now emboldened to continue such       activities in the future both here and around the world, and       to do so even more intensely. If there has ever been a       clarion call for vigilance and action against a threat to the       very foundation of our democratic political system, this       episode is it.    Vigilance--that is what this is all about.   In order to safeguard future elections, State and local officials  must have the tools and resources they need to prevent hacks and  safeguard election infrastructure from foreign interference. They don't  need those resources in 2025, they need these resources now.   The next Federal election is just 419 days away. No, we cannot wait  another year to do this. We cannot wait 2 years to do this. We cannot  see if some of our States that have less money and less resources are  able to do this on their own. This is a national issue. Four hundred  and nineteen days might sound like a lot of time to some people, but it  isn't. It takes time for State and local election officials to come up  with plans for their best practices, to shore up their cyber security,  to buy new election equipment, to hire cyber experts to make sure their  systems are secure.   Do you want to go vote and not know if the Russians are hacking into  your elections, into your data, and finding out your address and whom  you voted for? I don't think so. Time is of the essence, if we want to  improve election cyber security ahead of 2018 and 2020. That is why I  am fighting so hard for a vote on this amendment. It is that simple. If  we do not act now, we leave State election officials--the people on the  frontlines of our democratic process--without the resources they need  to combat cyber attacks. That is not just wrong, that is  unconscionable, and it is against the very principles of our  Constitution. We are supposed to be a government for the people, by the  people, not by a foreign entity.   In order to protect our election systems, we need to do three key  things. First, we need to bring State and local election officials,  cyber security experts, and national security personnel together to  provide guidance to our States on how they can best protect themselves  from cyber attacks.   Just try to picture a local official in Deep River Falls, MN, or  Lanesboro, MN. Are they supposed to have the most updated data on how  they protect their elections and what they are supposed to do? No, they  need guidance from the Federal Government. Those recommendations should  be easily accessible so that every information officer and election  official in the country can access them. Many State officials I have  talked to feel as though they are in the dark about threats to our  election system. That can't continue.   We need our national security officials to be sharing information  about the potential for attacks with State officials in real time. By  the way, a lot of those States that were hacked into still don't know  it. They still don't have the information. I was just talking to  Senator Warner, ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, about  this, and that information still is not out there as it should be. So  this means creating a framework for information sharing that acts as an  alarm system against cyber intruders. We put alarm systems in our homes  but not on our election equipment. Our amendment would establish that  alarm system.   Second, the Federal Government must provide States with the resources  to implement the best practices developed by States and cyber security  experts. A meaningful effort to protect our election systems will  require some resources. I think most Americans would agree with me when  I say that protecting our democracy from foreign cyber attacks will be  money well spent.   Think about the money we put into our national defense. It is  important. We want to have a strong defense. We want to have those  aircraft carriers. Think about that and how important that is and how  much money that costs, and then just think about these ballot boxes in  local places where, literally, a foreign entity can just hack in--like  that   Finally, we need better auditing of our elections. That means voter- verified paper ballot backup systems in every State. This is  fundamental to protecting our elections and improving public confidence  in the reliability of elections. Our amendment would accelerate the  move to paper ballots--a backup--by providing States with the resources  they need to get there. In short, our amendment would help States block  cyber attacks, secure voter registration logs and voter data, upgrade  election auditing procedures, and create secure and useful information  sharing about threats.   This is a bipartisan amendment. I keep saying that because so often  this discussion of the elections has turned partisan on both sides.  This is bipartisan. I am doing this with Senator Graham, and we are not  alone. Senator Harris of California and Senator Lankford of Oklahoma  are also pushing for the Senate to do its job and address election  cyber security. Representative Meadows, the leader of the House Freedom  Caucus, and Democratic Congressman Jim Langevin introduced companion  legislation in the House--the leader of the Freedom Caucus. Why do you  think they are interested in this bill that I am doing with Lindsey  Graham? Because they believe in the idea that States should be able to  have their own elections, and it shouldn't be federalized. They believe  we should have safe and secure elections.   There is strong bipartisan support for this effort outside the Halls  of Congress as well. Dozens of former Republican national security  officials are pushing for the Senate to pass this amendment. They have  written op-eds, called their representatives, and  [[Page S5267]]  worked to inform the public about the need to take action now. Michael  Chertoff, who served as Secretary of Homeland Security under President  George W. Bush, published a piece this month in the Wall Street Journal  calling on Congress to take action. He noted that our amendment, the  Klobuchar-Graham amendment, would address the cyber security challenge  in a way that is ``fiscally responsible, respectful of states' policy- making powers, and proactive in dealing with the most pressing  vulnerabilities.''   Bruce Fein, a former Reagan Department of Justice official said ``the  amendment would enormously strengthen defenses against cyber-attacks  that could compromise the integrity of elections in the United States  and undermine legitimacy of government.''   A bipartisan group of former national security officials sent a  letter to Senate leadership pushing for a vote on this amendment. They  noted that attacks on U.S. voting systems threaten the most basic  underpinnings of American self-government. These attacks are growing in  sophistication and scale.   States administer elections. If you talk to a local election  official--and I have done this throughout my State--you will find out  they are adamant about protecting States' rights in this area. Guess  what. No surprise--we have their support too. A bipartisan group of 10  Secretaries of State sent a letter urging the Senate to pass this  amendment. They want this amendment to pass because it would provide  vital resources to States to support the growing security demands of  our Nation's election infrastructure.   The National Association of Counties, a group that unites America's  3,069 counties--these are county governments big and small that serve  people on the grassroots level, that know what it means to be having  people sitting at those election booths, doing their job for little  pay, just making sure that we have free American elections. They  support this too. They need resources and cyber expertise, and they  need them now.   Our decentralized election system is both a strength and a weakness.  It is a strength because we have multiple systems and all of our  information isn't in one place. Right? So if there is a hack in Ohio,  maybe you don't have a hack in Minnesota. If there is a hack in one  State, one city, maybe you don't have it in another. But we don't want  to have a hack anywhere.   American elections are increasingly an easy target because, on the  other hand, many local election systems are using election technology  that is completely outdated. Forty-three States rely on electronic  voting or tabulation systems that are at least 10 years old.   Think about it. We want to have these decentralized elections. That  is what we want, but we simply have to make sure that when citizens are  voting in both State and Federal elections for Senator, for Governor,  for their local mayor, for their school board, their State's election  equipment is safe and secure. That is where we come in. We don't run  their local elections. I think a lot of Americans wouldn't want us to  run their local elections, but what we do is make sure that elections  are safe because those hackers over there in Russia or wherever they  are--the thousand people who were operating in that warehouse to try to  influence our election--don't know jurisdictional boundaries. Right?  They will commit crimes across State lines, across county lines, across  Federal lines, across international lines. They don't care. So we have  to allow our State and local elections and the people who run them to  be as sophisticated as the Russians who are trying to break our backs.  That is what this is about.   The fact that we have so many security experts supporting this, so  many local election people supporting this, and the fact that Senator  McCain is more than happy to have this included in his bill because he  sees it as a national security issue--how can one Senator stand up and  say no to this amendment? That is what the American people should be  asking. Local election officials are the place to start. They are  passionate about keeping the Federal Government out of State elections,  and they support our amendment because it strikes the balance that our  Federal system demands when it comes to the administration of  elections.   Despite the strong bipartisan support for this amendment--again, I  ask the people or person that is blocking this vote to allow this bill  to go forward. I am simply outraged by this. I think this is an  embarrassment to this body if we allow this to continue. Republican and  Democratic Senators support this amendment. Cyber security experts  support this amendment. Republican and Democratic major national  security officials support this amendment. The Freedom Caucus supports  this amendment. This is a bipartisan amendment in the House, so why is  it being blocked? I actually can't tell you. It is not one of those  things where someone says: Oh, it isn't worth putting millions of  dollars into this. No, when you look at all the money we are spending  on other forms of defense, this is dwarfed by that. No one can actually  in good faith say that is the reason, and they are actually not saying  that is the reason. They are giving me no reason.   I think they need to come out and tell us why they are against  securing our elections. I think the American people deserve an answer  for that.   The integrity of our election system is the cornerstone of our  democracy. The freedom to choose our leaders, knowing with full  confidence that those leaders were chosen in free and fair elections,  is something that Americans have fought and died for since our country  was founded. That is why our country came into existence. We didn't  want to have another country control our citizens' economy. We didn't  want them to control where they went to school. My relatives came over  from Slovenia and other places because they wanted to be able to choose  where their kids went to school. That is the freedom of voting, and  that is what this amendment is about.   Members standing in the way of this bipartisan amendment to protect  our election infrastructure are literally committing malpractice on our  Constitution. They will have to explain to the American people and to  the Freedom Caucus and all the supporters we have across the aisle why  they didn't just stand up, why they didn't just do something, why they  stood idly by and ignored the warnings of our intelligence officials.  Do you know what? They are not going to, next summer, be able to say: I  guess I was wrong. I will do something now.   It will be too late then. This is the time to authorize this and then  to get the money in place by the end of the year. It is the only legal  way we can do this.   When it comes to our election infrastructure, we are only as strong  as our weakest link. A threat to one county, to one city, to one  State's election infrastructure is an assault on our entire system  because it fundamentally threatens the very foundation of our political  system. We must be a united front in fighting against those who  interfere with our democracy, and we must do everything in our power to  prevent foreign interference from ever happening again.   In the 21st century, our adversaries will continue to use cyber  warfare. Everyone knows that. Anyone who has had an account at a store  hacked into, anyone who has had someone get into their account with  spam or send them some fake address, a fake link--everyone knows this  is happening. In the 21st century, our adversaries will use cyber  warfare, and we need to be prepared to defend our networks against this  growing threat to our democracy, especially the most fundamental part  of our political system: our elections.   Our attitude must be to roll up our sleeves to get this done. Whoever  is blocking this bill better come forward and explain why because the  American people are going to demand an answer now, but they are really  going to demand an answer when things go bad.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Toomey). The Senator from Montana.                              Western Wildfires
