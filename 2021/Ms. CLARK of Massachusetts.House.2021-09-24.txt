 Madam Speaker, it is the Constitution  that says women have the right to make their own decisions regarding  their bodies. It is the Constitution that gives people the right to  make a decision about abortion with their families, their doctor, and  in accordance with their faith.   But for over 50 years this right has been under attack. And today we  say there is no room in that decision for politicians, there is no room  for bounty hunters. This decision resides with people, with women.   Today, we will pass the Women's Health Protection Act, and we will  say clearly: This right is now enshrined in law, and we are not going  back.
