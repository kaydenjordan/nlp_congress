 I thank the gentleman from Georgia, Mr.  Carter, for yielding me time to speak on this important issue.   Mr. Speaker, it is fitting that my first address on the House floor  is about a subject that is important to me and so many people in my  district.   As a Navy veteran and a primary care nurse practitioner, I am well  aware of the challenges that our servicemembers face in the healthcare  arena.   Over the past few weeks, I have heard from countless concerned  constituents who are unable to get their medications from their local  pharmacy because the pharmacy is no longer in the TRICARE network.   It is not just TRICARE members who are being affected by this change.  I recently talked to a constituent who owns a small pharmacy on  Virginia's Eastern Shore.    They are at risk of losing a significant percentage of their business  because the reimbursement rates issued from TRICARE are now too low to  be sustainable for pharmacy owners.   I was sent to Congress to help the people of Virginia's Second  District in any and every way that I can.   This new contract helps absolutely no one. In fact, it does just the  opposite.   Our military and military families need to remain strong to be  effective. It is our job to ensure their needs are met and their health  is prioritized. Make no mistake; this TRICARE contract does neither.   I strongly urge TRICARE to return to the negotiating table and ensure  military members and their families can receive their medications, and  our pharmacies are fairly compensated.
