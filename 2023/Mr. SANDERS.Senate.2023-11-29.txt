 Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about the awful  situation in the Middle East. As you know and the American people know,  there have been five wars--five wars--in the last 15 years between  Israel and Hamas.   How do we end the current one and prevent a sixth war from happening  sooner or later? How do we balance our desire to stop the fighting with  the need to address the root causes of this conflict?   And here is the sad truth--and it really is a very sad truth. For 75  years, diplomats, well-intentioned Israelis and Palestinians, and  government leaders all over the world, including Presidents of the  United States, have struggled to bring peace to this region. And during  that time, among many other things, an Egyptian President and an  Israeli Prime Minister were assassinated by extremists.   Do you know why? Because they tried to bring peace to the region.  This is an incredibly difficult and complicated issue, and nobody has  any simple solution to it.   As one of the first Members of Congress to call for a humanitarian  pause to the bombing, I have been very encouraged to see that pause  finally happen over the last 5 days and to see its extension earlier  this week. That is a very positive development.   This temporary cease-fire has brought some relief to Gaza and to the  families of the more than 100 hostages released so far. The break in  fighting has let an average of 200 trucks per day to enter Gaza,  carrying desperately needed food, water, medical supplies, and the fuel  necessary to distribute aid, pump water, and run hospitals and  bakeries.    While this is only 40 percent--and people must recognize this, before  the war, there were 500 trucks coming in a day, and now, there are  200--it is still a very substantial improvement over where we were a  few weeks ago.   It seems to me that our job now is to keep working to extend this  window further and to get more aid in and to get more hostages out-- more aid in, more hostages out. Right now, critical talks are under way  that will hopefully provide the United Nations the time it needs to  establish a sustained humanitarian operation that can meet people's  basic needs and provide shelter and medical care. And let us be clear:  The needs in Gaza are beyond enormous.   For those of us who want not only to bring this war to an end but to  avoid future ones, we must first be clear-eyed about the facts. On  October 7, Hamas--a terrorist organization--unleashed a brutal attack  against Israel, killing about 1,200 innocent men, women, and children  and taking more than 200 hostages.   No one--no one--in the U.S. Senate, no one in Congress, denies that  Israel has the right to respond to that murderous attack.  Unfortunately, however, under the leadership of its rightwing Prime  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is under indictment for corruption and  whose Cabinet includes outright racists, Israel unleashed what amounts  to almost total war against the Palestinian people.   Israel's widespread bombing has left nearly 15,000 people dead--that  is in a 7-week period--15,000 people dead, two-thirds of whom are women  and children. And tens of thousands of others were wounded.   Israel's military campaign, up to this point, according to U.N.  estimates, damaged or destroyed 45 percent of the housing in Gaza--45  percent--and displaced nearly 1.8 million people. The Israeli attacks,  up to this point, have killed 109 United Nations workers and left  millions of Gazans on the brink of starvation, lacking medical care,  electricity, or fuel.   This is a humanitarian catastrophe that risks, among other things,  igniting a wider regional conflagration. We all want this horror to end  as soon as possible. To make progress, however, we must grapple with  the complexity of this situation.   First, Hamas has made it clear, before and after--after--their  October 7 attack that its goal is perpetual warfare and the destruction  of the State of Israel. Several weeks ago, a spokesman for Hamas told  the New York Times:         I hope that the state of war with Israel will become       permanent on all the borders, and that the Arab world will       stand with us.    Let me repeat it. This is the Hamas spokesman:         I hope that the state of war with Israel will become       permanent on all the borders and that the Arab world will       stand with us.    So that is the first point.   The second point is that, if we go back a little bit in history, we  understand that Israel has done nothing in recent years to give hope  for a peaceful settlement--maintaining the blockade of Gaza, deepening  the daily humiliations of occupation in the West Bank, and largely  ignoring the horrendous living conditions facing Palestinians. Massive  poverty existed in Gaza before October 7. Something like 70 percent of  the young people in Gaza were unemployed.   How is that for a reality in terms of despair and hopelessness? Those  are the conditions that existed before the Israeli attack.   Needless to say, I do not have all of the answers to this never- ending tragedy. But for those of us who believe in peace and for those  of us who believe in justice, it is imperative that we do our best to  provide Israelis and Palestinians with a thoughtful response that maps  out a realistic path to addressing the reality we face today.   Let me just give you a few of my thoughts as to the best way forward  and how the United States can rally the world around a moral position  that moves us toward peace in the region and justice for an oppressed  Palestinian population.   To start with, in my view, we must demand an immediate end to  Israel's indiscriminate bombing, which is causing and has caused an  enormous number of civilian casualties and is in violation of  international law.   The main point here is: Israel is at war with Hamas, not with the  Palestinian people. Israel cannot bomb an entire neighborhood just to  take out one Hamas lieutenant. That is simply not acceptable and not  something the United States should be complicit with.   Further, we must extend the humanitarian pause that exists right now  so that the United Nations has the time to safely set up the  distribution network needed to prevent thirst, starvation, and disease,  to build shelters, and to evacuate those who need critical care.   Once again, we are looking at an unimaginable humanitarian crisis,  and the U.N. is going to need as much time as it can get to try to help  people in desperate need. This window will also allow for talks to free  as many hostages as possible. And I think we all would like to see  every hostage returned to their loved ones. This extended pause must  not precede a resumption of a discriminate bombing. Israel will  continue to go after Hamas, but it must dramatically change its tactics  to minimize civilian harm.   If long-suffering Palestinians are ever going to have a chance at  self-determination and a decent standard of living, there must be no  long-term Israeli reoccupation and blockade of Gaza. If Hamas is going  to be removed from power--as they must be--and Palestinians given the  opportunity for a better life, an Israeli occupation of Gaza would be  absolutely counterproductive and would benefit Hamas. Imagine Israeli  soldiers all over an occupied Gaza. For the sake of regional peace and  a brighter future for the Palestinian people, Gaza must have a chance  to be free of Hamas. There can be no long-term Israeli occupation.   To achieve the political transformation that Gaza needs--and Gaza  desperately needs a political transformation--new Palestinian  leadership will be required as part of a wider political process. And  for that transformation and peace process to take place, Israel must  make political commitments that will allow for Palestinian leadership  committed to peace to build support. What I think people all over the  world want to see and what  [[Page S5679]]  the people of Gaza want to see is leadership that will take care of  their needs, provide for them, allow them self-determination, not  leadership in perpetual warfare with Israel.   Israel must also guarantee displaced Palestinians the absolute right  to return to their homes as Gaza rebuilds. And I am very concerned by  some of the remarks we hear from Israel, from some Israeli leadership,  questioning that basic right of people to return to their communities.   People who have lived in poverty and despair for years, as people in  Gaza have, cannot be made permanently homeless. Israel must also commit  to end the killings of Palestinians in the West Bank and freeze  settlements there as a first step to permanently ending the occupation.   Those steps will show that peace can deliver for the Palestinian  people, hopefully giving the Palestinian Authority the legitimacy it  needs to assume administrative control of Gaza, likely after an interim  stabilization period under an international force.   Finally, if Palestinians are to have any hope for a decent future,  there must be a commitment to broad peace talks to advance a new two- state solution in the wake of this war.   The United States, the international community, and Israel's  neighbors must move aggressively toward that two-state goal. This would  include dramatically increased international support for the  Palestinian people, including from wealthy Gulf States. It would also  mean the promise of full recognition of Palestine pending the formation  of a new democratically elected government committed to peace with  Israel.   Let us be clear--and I think this is the main point that I want to  make this evening--that we should be clear that all of this is not  going to happen on its own. Left alone, sad to say, Israel is not going  to bring this about.   Prime Minister Netanyahu's Likud Party was explicitly formed on the  premise that ``between the Sea and the Jordan [River] there will only  be Israeli sovereignty.'' And the current coalition agreement  reinforces that goal. This is not just ideology. This idea that Israel  has the right to control everything between the sea and the Jordan  River, that is just not ideology. The Israeli Government has  systematically pursued this goal.   The last year saw record Israeli settlement growth in the West Bank  where more than 700,000 Israelis now live in areas that the United  Nations and the United States agree are occupied territories. They have  used state violence to back up this de facto annexation.   Sadly, tragically, since October 7, the United Nations reports that  at least 208 Palestinians, including 53 children, have been killed by  Israeli security forces and settlers. This cannot be allowed to  continue.   Mr. Netanyahu has made clear where he stands on these critical  issues. Now is the time for us to make clear where we stand on these  issues. And the truth is that if asking nicely worked, we wouldn't be  in the position we are today. Asking nicely just is not going to bring  about the kinds of changes that are needed.   The only way these vital and necessary changes will occur is if the  United States uses the substantial leverage we have with Israel, and we  all know what that leverage is. For many years, the United States has  provided Israel with substantial sums of money, with close to no  strings attached. Currently, we provide $3.8 billion a year to Israel,  no strings attached.   President Biden has asked for $14.3 billion more on top of that sum  and asked Congress to waive normal, already limited oversight rules.  This blank check approach must end. The United States must make clear  that while we are friends of Israel, there are conditions to that  friendship and that we cannot be complicit in actions that violate  international law and our own sense of decency. That includes an end to  indiscriminate bombing, a significant pause to the bombing so that  massive humanitarian assistance can come into the region, the right of  displaced Gazans to return to their homes, no long-term Israeli  occupation of Gaza, an end to settler violence in the West Bank and a  freeze on settlement expansion, and maybe, most importantly, a  commitment to broad peace talks for a two-state solution in the wake of  this war.   Over the years, people of good will around the world, including  Israelis and Palestinians, have tried to address this conflict in a way  that brings justice to the Palestinians and security for Israel. Israel  is entitled to security, to be free of terrorist attacks.   Now, I and some other Members of Congress have tried over the years  to do what we could. Obviously, painfully, we did not do enough. Now,  we must recommit to this effort. The stakes are just too high to give  up. It is clear that Netanyahu and his extreme rightwing government are  not going to do this on their own, which is why the United States must  use its leverage to force these necessary changes and push hard for a  wider political process that leads to a two-state solution.   These should be the conditions of our solidarity, including in the  supplemental spending bill, which we will soon be considering.   Israel is a longtime friend and ally of the United States, and I  respect that, but when there is this level of destruction and bloodshed  and when tens of billions of dollars have been requested, it is more  than reasonable for the United States to have a say in where our  taxpayer dollars go and how they are spent. This is money that comes  from the taxpayers of the United States.    Israel has an absolute right to defend itself, but it does not have  the right to use American taxpayer funds in violation of international  law or with little regard for civilian casualties. Now, I know that  when we use the word ``conditioning,'' people become very alarmed. Oh  my God, terrible idea. Virtually every dollar that we appropriate has  conditions attached to it. If you are on food stamps tonight, you have  got conditions. If you are on unemployment, you have got conditions. If  you are on section 8 housing, you have conditions. We have conditions  on everything. We don't give away money. We say you have to be eligible  for it; this is what you have got to do; these are the requirements.  That is conditioning.   Conditioning, in fact, has been, for a long time, seen as a key to  U.S. policy regarding foreign governments, including Israel, not a new  idea. The United States has routinely conditioned aid on countries,  including Ukraine, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt, to name a few. Presidents  Carter, Reagan, H. W. Bush, and Clinton, all conditioned aid to Israel  to secure changes in their policies.   President Reagan actually suspended certain arms deliveries and  threatened to stop all military aid due to Israel's war in Lebanon.  That is a condition, a pretty strong condition. Sending $14.3 billion  to Netanyahu's government on top of the $3.8 billion we provide every  year and the billions of arms the United States has already provided  with no strings attached would be a huge mistake, out of step with  longstanding U.S. policy, and not something I believe that the American  people want to see.   I have laid out what I believe some of these conditions should be,  and that is an end to the indiscriminate bombing that we have seen, a  guarantee that displaced Palestinians will have the right to return to  their homes, no long-term occupation or blockade of Gaza, a freeze on  the West Bank settlements there, and a commitment to broad peace talks  for a two-state solution.   Those are some of the conditions that I think we have more than a  right to demand when we provide money to Israel.   Finally, let me end this on a personal note. There is no question  that people all over this country have strong disagreements on the war  and some of the issues that I have been discussing tonight, and that is  what is part of the democratic process. And in a democracy like ours,  it is natural that these issues be debated, and people have different  points of view.   But what we cannot do, under any circumstances, is turn to violence  because of our differences--not to violence and not to bigotry. And I  have to say that, tragically, in my home State of Vermont, in the city  that I live, a city of 40,000 people, Burlington, VT, we have  experienced this form of violent hate.   And just as I am sure you know, 3 days ago, three young men, lovely  young men going to college, celebrating Thanksgiving in Burlington,  [[Page S5680]]  VT, were shot, and one of them is in very serious condition. So as we  all hope and pray for the recovery of Hisham and Kinnan and Tahseen,  the three young men who were shot, and we await the findings of the  investigation into this terrible act, let me say this again loudly and  clearly: Hate has no place in my State of Vermont or anyplace else in  America. With Islamophobia, anti-Arab hate, anti-Semitism, and racism  on the rise in this country, we must--must--come together and remain  resolute in our commitment to fighting all forms of bigotry and  intolerance.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
