 Mr. Speaker, I want to get one thing straight for our  Members on the other side of the aisle. The only shutdown that we are  in favor of is a shutdown of the woke indoctrination in our military,  the shutdown of the infection of socialism propagated by the other  side, and a shutdown of the bloated government spending and the  overreach of regulation in America.   Now, on to my main point.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn, in the strongest terms  possible, the blatant attacks on the Second Amendment from the Governor  of New Mexico.   We saw with COVID unprecedented government overreach that infringed  on the rights of millions of Americans.   Let me be crystal clear, Mr. Speaker: There is no such thing as a  state public health emergency exception in the U.S. Constitution.   The Second Amendment is a God-given right to the American people. We  will not sit idly by as the people of New Mexico have their rights  trampled by an unhinged lunatic.   Throughout history, countless populations have been rendered  vulnerable due to their inability to defend themselves from both  external and internal threats.   Our Founding Fathers, with great foresight and understanding of  history's lessons, enshrined the right to bear arms not only as a  protection from foreign invaders but also as a safeguard against  potential domestic tyranny.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 684 and push  back against the attacks on we the people's God-given rights.
