 Madam President, today, I have joined Senators Manchin,  Risch, Cardin, Boozman, and Hirono in introducing the Compacts of Free  Association Amendments Act of 2023. In the House of Representatives,  Congressmen Westerman, Grijalva, McCaul, and Meeks are introducing  identical legislation.   This legislation renews the compact agreements between the United  States and the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands,  and the Federated States of Micronesia, commonly referred to as the  Freely Associated States.   This legislation will protect American interests in the Pacific and  block  [[Page S5342]]  China's efforts to expand its influence. The Compacts of Free  Association give the United States exclusive military authority over  the Freely Associated States' lands and waters. This authority  guarantees that our military can operate bases on the islands and deny  access to any potential adversaries in the region. This is critical  because Chinese aggression in the region is an ever-present danger.   China is expanding its power in the Indo-Pacific and is threatening  the Freely Associated States. China is actively trying to upset the  security and power dynamic in the region and threaten Taiwan. In March  of this year, the outgoing President of the Federated States of  Micronesia outlined Chinese attempts to undermine his country's ties to  the United States through bribery and threatening public officials.  China has also tried to use aggressive and coercive actions against the  economies of the Republic of Palau and the Republic of the Marshall  Islands by threatening their tourism and fishing industries.   Today's introduction is a positive step. The House Natural Resources  Committee intends to mark, up this legislation in order for it be  included in the National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA. The Senate  has already included language in the NDAA supporting renewal of the  compacts. One important issue that is not addressed in this bill is how  the legislation will be paid for. The question of a spending offset  needs to be addressed as the bill makes its way through the legislative  process.                            ____________________     Madam President, today, I have joined Senators Manchin,  Risch, Cardin, Boozman, and Hirono in introducing the Compacts of Free  Association Amendments Act of 2023.
