 Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from  Washington to talk about the challenge that women both here in the  United States and across the world are facing from the excesses of this  administration.   What we have seen time and again is that the Trump administration has  exhibited a dangerous obsession with rolling back women's reproductive  rights here in the United States and abroad. Just in the past 14 months  in office, this administration has launched a multipronged and  aggressive assault on women's rights. One of President Trump's first  acts in office was to reinstate and greatly expand the global gag rule,  which prohibits U.S. funding for international women's health  organizations that so much as mention abortion. What they did was to  say that this is not going to just affect those organizations but any  health organization that the United States puts funding into. This  action will cause a significant increase in unsafe abortions and  maternal deaths across the developing world. The administration has  proposed budgets that would eliminate all Federal funding for Planned  Parenthood, and, going even further, would prohibit States that on  their own would direct Federal funds to Planned Parenthood for those  same health services. They would prohibit States from doing that.    Most recently, the State Department reportedly removed data on  reproductive healthcare from its annual human rights report. So is the  idea that if you don't give people access to data, then it doesn't  happen? The administration instructed career employees at the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention to remove words such as ``fetus,''  ``diversity,'' ``evidence-based,'' and ``science-based'' from their  official vocabulary.   Well, if we are not basing decisions at the CDC on evidence-based and  science-based data, then what are we basing it on? As Senator Murray  says, they are basing it on ideology. Well, that is a lousy way to make  a decision about where to put our healthcare money.   This administration has even attacked women's access to birth  control, issuing new rules that allow almost any company to opt out of  the birth control benefit in the Affordable Care Act.   Simply put, you cannot support women's empowerment unless you support  women's access to family planning. Recently, the United Nations  Population Fund's ``Family Planning 2020'' report explained why women's  access to all healthcare services, including abortion, is so vital both  to women's advancement and to their country's economic development. The  report says:         Every woman and girl must be able to exercise her basic       human right to control her own reproductive health. Access to       safe, voluntary family planning is fundamental to women's       empowerment. It's also fundamental to achieving our global       goals for a healthier, more prosperous, just, and equitable       world.    The report goes on to say:         Rights-based family planning programs have a greater ripple       effect than almost any other development investment, from       saving lives and improving health to strengthening economies,       transforming societies, and lifting entire countries out of       poverty. It is the surest path to the future we want.    Well, I couldn't agree more. Study after study demonstrates that  access to comprehensive healthcare services is closely correlated to  the economic success of women and their families. By contrast, lack of  access to basic healthcare services, including family planning  counseling and all birth control options, is a major factor in  perpetuating the dangerous, life-threatening cycle of poverty.   Now, I think it is really ironic that those who seek to outlaw  abortion do so under what they say is the pro-life banner. I think it  is ironic because we know from experience that outlawing abortion  doesn't end abortion, it simply drives it into the shadows and unsafe  conditions. Like many in this Chamber, I remember the days before 1973,  when abortion was against the law. An estimated 1.2 million women each  year resorted to illegal abortions, typically performed in unsanitary  conditions by unlicensed practitioners and often resulting in  infection, hemorrhage, and even death. Just about every woman of my  generation has a story about a friend or an acquaintance who had to  resort to this kind of risky, dangerous abortion or who thought she had  to resort to that.   Well, I don't think we want to go back to those days. We know that  right now in the United States, we have the lowest level of abortions  that we have had since 1973. That is a success that is directly  attributed to the increased access to contraception that is in the  Affordable Care Act.   We know that again and again, studies have found that policies to  limit or ban abortion outright have the unintended consequence of  dramatically increasing abortion overall. Conversely, when family  planning services are accessible, the rates of unplanned pregnancies  and abortion go down. Again, according to the Guttmacher Institute, we  are seeing success in terms of reducing the number of abortions and  unintended pregnancies.   Now, what we have seen internationally is that the global gag rule  has had especially lethal consequences. It denies access to safe  abortions and, in doing so, it dramatically increases abortions  overall. A Stanford University study of implementation of the global  gag rule during the George W. Bush administration found that the number  of women having induced abortions more than doubled in countries that  were most impacted by the policy.   Today, in Nigeria--which is the one country we have data on to date,  based on the expansion of the global gag rule in the Trump  administration--health workers on the ground estimate that because of  the administration's new global gag rule, there will be an additional  660,000 abortions in Nigeria from now through 2020, and that could  result in nearly 10,000 additional maternal deaths.   The Trump administration claims it wants a smaller government. The  President ran on a platform promising to get the government out of  people's lives. Yet it is doing everything possible to inject the  government and law enforcement into some of the most intimate,  difficult, and personal decisions a woman has to make.   This is not only insulting, but it is condescending to all women. We  don't need guidance from the government for an adult. We need to be  able to consult those we choose to consult and make  [[Page S1704]]  our own decisions about the healthcare we need.   To take away women's access to full reproductive health services,  including abortion, is demeaning and unacceptable. We cannot allow the  Trump administration to turn back the clock and put women's lives at  risk.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
