 Mr. Speaker, we have been whisked here this morning in one  of the grave challenges of our lifetimes.   Usually, in March, we talk about brackets. Well, the brackets this  morning are clear. Those brackets are about the health of the American  people and the economic security of the American family.    This is not about corruption. This is not about military conflict.  Certainly, it is not about malfeasance.   Our country is weathering an unprecedented public health crisis that  demands an unprecedented response from the United States Government. I  am really proud of the critical solutions our Ways and Means Committee  colleagues and I contributed to this legislation.   This legislation could be called the families' health and economic  security stabilization act because that is what we are doing this  morning, providing stability.   The healthcare workers on the front lines of this crisis are being  pushed to their limits, both financially and physically. They need more  masks, tests, ventilators, and beds to combat this virus. This  legislation will help them secure these fundamental resources with $100  billion in funding for hospitals and our healthcare system.   As we work to protect the health of all Americans, we are also  focused on the health of our economy. Just yesterday morning, we  learned that this week's unemployment claims skyrocketed by over 1,000  percent.   As we face this record economic challenge, families need benefits  that will allow them to cover essential expenses like food, rent, and  medication. From the beginning of this crisis, Ways and Means Democrats  have understood that expanding unemployed benefits must be a top  priority.                                time  0920    The additional $600 per week in unemployment benefits that we fought  for is the least we can do to help those who, through no fault of their  own, find themselves without a paycheck. Similarly, the direct infusion  of $1,200 in cash for American adults whom we fought for will help  families through these challenging times.   We also fought to include provisions to shore up the financial health  of small business and other struggling employers. We were adamant about  the inclusion of the employee retention credit because we know that the  American economy will bounce back from this, and employers who take  action to keep their employees on the payroll should be rewarded.   This legislation is the product of two very different sides coming  together to protect the health and financial security of all Americans  in the face of this crisis.   I thank the many Members on both sides of the aisle, and the Capitol,  who have worked to get us to this bill this morning. I also thank my  Ways and Means Committee staff who have been working around the clock  since this crisis began and have provided the committee and the  Congress with unparalleled technical expertise and counsel. They  deserve our appreciation.   We are facing this grave enemy in COVID-19. It is dark and uncertain  times that we are witnessing today, but that is why we are here. We are  here to fight for things that matter to America, to prioritize their  health and economic well-being.   We have a responsibility to take this bold action this morning so  that our economy will keep going for workers and small business and to  give families the peace of mind they can depend upon so that their  government can help keep them whole in this crisis.   That is what we did in this bill. There will be a phase four, which  will be real stimulus as opposed, I think, to the stabilization effort  we make today.   We wish our colleagues and the American people the best at this time.  Take care of one another.   But I fully support this legislation being passed in a timely manner.  That means this morning.
