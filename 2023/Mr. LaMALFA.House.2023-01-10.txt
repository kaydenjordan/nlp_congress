 Mr. Speaker, as we have observed, Western States are  receiving much welcomed rainfall and snowpack. Indeed, some of the side  effects are flooding and there are many mudslides that are affecting  communities and transportation corridors.   This is on the heels of short rainfall years for at least the last 3  years. This year, rainfall numbers are good. They are at a pace where  they are at their historical average or a little above in some areas.  This is historical average long-term over non-drought years.   The last 3 years have seen dire water supplies for many people and  allocations for farmers. In 2019, our lakes in California were  basically full. You may recall in 2017, in my district, Lake Oroville  had the spillway collapse due to lack of maintenance and checking its  integrity over the years, but it was plumb full, 101 percent full, in  2017.   Our water projects in California were designed with the idea that  they withstand 5 years of drought. With Lake Oroville being full as  recently as 2019 and Lake Shasta nearly full as well, how is it that  our State water projects and our Central Valley projects which are run  by the Bureau of Reclamation--being at these high levels--that Lake  Oroville, for example, in 2021, only 2 years after being full, was  basically so low on water that for the first time in the history of  that lake it did not make hydroelectric power because the water levels  were so low.   Lake Shasta, in 2022, an unprecedented cut in water supply, including  to its neighbor right there in Shasta County, Anderson-Cottonwood  Irrigation District, received zero allocation because they couldn't  deliver enough water to make it worth their while. In over 100 years of  the existence of that district, this is the first time that they did  not get to irrigate it.   These two dams were designed to withstand 5 years of drought, being  full as recently as 2019. We had one running out in 2021 and the other  basically being useless almost to agriculture in 2022, with drastic  cuts all up and down the Sacramento River system.   What is going on here?   What is the State Water Project doing on the Feather River side, et  cetera?   What is the Federal Bureau of Reclamation and CDP doing on the  Sacramento River side that has changed?   They are not doing everything they can to hold water, even in drought  years, that they could be holding. Why?   It is a mystery. We have the opportunity right now with these high  flows. We have areas of California right in the Sacramento Valley that  are being flooded out. They are running the pumps that are at the south  end of the delta at about 18 percent on the State side and about 67  percent--not so bad--on the Federal level instead of taking full  advantage of running those pumps as hard as they can and taking this  excess water and relieving some of the flooding and putting it into a  reservoir that will help our whole State withstand possible drought in  the future.   Is this a drought year?   No, not as defined by lack of rainfall, as indeed we are at average,  or we are above average in some areas. With the projection in January  for a lot more rain coming, we might have a full normal water year or  above. That would be good.   Our leaders in government in the agencies don't seem to feel the same  urgency. At the same time they are talking that we have flood  emergencies, they are still maintaining we have drought emergencies-- not with this kind of rainfall.   Yes, we have low-lake problems, but that isn't how you define a  drought. That is how you define lake management. That is how you define  water management. It is not helping. We need to be running, at least,  those two sets of pumps at 99 percent or 100 percent at the delta and  filling up the San Luis Reservoir and allocating water to those  recharge basins so the subsidence we are having in the San Joaquin  Valley that everybody is worried about wouldn't be happening.   No, they want to just keep chugging along the way they are doing,  especially on the State side. This is a disservice to all water users  in California. At the same time, they don't really see a whole lot of  need to cut back on environmental water that is very dubious in nature,  if it is helping fish in the delta or anywhere else.   Indeed, they need a change of attitude at all of these levels of  water management. These agencies don't seem to be on the side of  growing food. I always bring this poster along so people can understand  how much of their food is grown in California, a high percentage of  these crops that only come from California that Americans consume.   If it is not grown in California, either you are not going to have it  or you are going to have to import it from somewhere else.   Look at this: walnuts. Walnuts are having a devil of a time right now  in their market. Tomatoes. If you want tomato paste for your pizza and  your pasta, where is it going to come from? We are going to have to  import all this stuff.   We need to have a much stronger and much smarter water policy, and  that starts right in California, and it benefits the whole country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, victims of disaster don't need to be  hassled by government, especially by new taxes.   The 2018 Camp fire in California was the deadliest and most  destructive in our State's history. The Fire Victim Trust was set up to  compensate these people for their loss and help them rebuild their  homes and their lives. However, these fire victims had to deal with the  possibility that some of their settlement money and money for  attorney's fees that they would pay would be taxed as income by the  IRS.   To prevent the further victimization of these folks who lost so much  already, Representative Thompson and I have introduced a bill to exempt  payments from the Fire Victim Trust from being taxed by the IRS.   The bill received bipartisan support in the House and Senate, but was  not included in the end-of-session vehicle last year, unfortunately.  So, getting this bill passed and signed into law is very important and  right.   The survivors need this money to help get their lives going again.  They don't need the government as a partner in the middle taking their  cut. It is essential we act quickly so that they can get back to their  lives and get the dollars moving toward rebuilding their homes and  whatever it is they need from having suffered this already.                            ____________________
