 Mr. Speaker, after spending most of my life in the  business world, I have seen firsthand how immigrants bring immense  contributions to American business. Whether it is a CEO of a Fortune  500 company or the frontline worker who has kept our workers safe  during the COVID-19 pandemic, immigrant workers, entrepreneurs, and  leaders drive our economy.   Immigrants bring revolutionary new ideas to our country. Immigrants  create jobs. Immigrants inspire innovation that pushes us forward as a  country, keeping us on the cutting edge of technology and medical  advances.   As the Speaker often says, ``diversity is our strength, unity is our  power.''   Immigrants bring their diverse experiences and ideas to our country,  to our economy, and make it better. Our Nation would be foolish to take  them for granted.                            ____________________
