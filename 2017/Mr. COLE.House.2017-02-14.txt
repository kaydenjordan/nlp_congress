 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 99 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 99         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 428) to       survey the gradient boundary along the Red River in the       States of Oklahoma and Texas, and for other purposes. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on       any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Natural Resources; and (2) one motion to       recommit.        Sec. 2  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 42) disapproving the rule submitted by the Department of       Labor relating to drug testing of unemployment compensation       applicants. All points of order against consideration of the       joint resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the joint resolution are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the joint resolution and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Ways and Means; and (2) one motion to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, last week, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule for consideration of two important measures. First, the  resolution provides for consideration of H.R. 428, the Red River  Gradient Boundary Survey Act. The rule provides for 1 hour of debate,  equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the  Natural Resources Committee, and provides for a motion to recommit.   In addition, the resolution provides for consideration of H.J. Res.  42, providing for congressional disapproval of a rule issued by the  Department of Labor with regard to drug testing. The rule provides 1  hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  member of the Ways and Means Committee, and provides for a motion to  recommit.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 428 is a product of months of negotiation between  the States of Texas and Oklahoma and the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache  Tribes in my district. I am happy to have been able to work with my  friend Mr. Thornberry to come up with a fair and equitable solution  which all interested parties have agreed to.   As you may know, the Red River serves as the State line separating  Oklahoma and Texas. Over time, the river has moved, as much as a mile  in some areas, causing landowners' properties to be affected. Instead  of working to resolve this, for nearly a century, the Bureau of Land  Management, BLM, has been unwilling to survey a small portion of the  Federal land along a 116-mile stretch of the Red River between Oklahoma  and Texas. H.R. 428 would direct the survey to be completed, using the  gradient boundary survey method that was mandated by the Supreme Court,  so that ownership of the land, which has been under dispute, can be  effectively resolved.                                time  1315    In addition, Mr. Speaker, the rule provides for the consideration of  another Congressional Review Act resolution, which would overturn a  Department of Labor rule related to drug testing for those applying for  unemployment insurance.   In 2012, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act made a  number of reforms to the unemployment insurance program, including  overturning a 1960s-era Department of Labor ban on the screening or  testing of unemployment applicants for illegal drugs. The 2012  provision allowed, but did not require, States to test unemployment  insurance applicants who either, one, lost their jobs due to drug use  or, two, who were seeking new jobs that generally required new  employees to pass a drug test. Unfortunately, after 4 years and a now  finalized rule, States are no closer to being able to implement this  sensible policy. Instead, because of the Department of Labor's  overreach, three States which have enacted necessary State law changes  to implement this commonsense policy are actually now precluded from  moving forward with this sensible, bipartisan policy.   Mr. Speaker, most States already limit unemployment insurance  benefits or individuals who refuse to take or fail an employer drug  test or who have previous employment issues with drugs. We should  empower States, employers, and prospective employees who are looking  for work and overturn this onerous regulation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the rule and the underlying  legislation.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Obviously, the gentleman and I have some disagreement here, but let's  talk for a minute about the form of what we are doing.   The gentleman is correct in that this rule covers two different  pieces of legislation that don't have anything substantive in common.  However, the legislation itself will be debated separately. We will  have one debate on the Oklahoma-Texas issue, which involves the  boundary between those two States and the tribal interests that are  also intimately part of that. We will have a separate debate on the  rule. That is the appropriate way to proceed. There is no reason to  have a separate rule for each one of these debates, but it is  appropriate, as the gentleman suggested, to have two different debates  because they are two different subjects.   I am going to disagree with him--and I am probably being parochial in  this sense--for, if you live in Oklahoma, we actually think the border  between Oklahoma and Texas is pretty important. This is an issue that,  frankly, was dealt with legislatively last year. This body did not vote  out the bill. I actually opposed it last year because it did not take  care of the tribal interests involved and they had not been suitably  dealt with. We amended the bill. Actually, I should say it was brought  up, but it was not taken up by the Senate. We changed it, but we kept  working for many months. Chairman Thornberry is the person who deserves  most of the credit here of trying to bring the parties together.   Also, just by way of explanation so everybody is clear, this does not  settle the issue. This doesn't force anything on the Federal Government  or the two States or the tribes. It simply creates a common database.  The two States have been asking for a complete survey of the contested  area for many years. The BLM has refused to do that. You simply can't  sort through this problem of a shifting border--set well over a century  ago--with conflicting tribal interests if you don't have a common set  of data here. So that is all that is being done here.   I can assure you that, certainly, the tribes in question would not  have consented to go forward if they had thought they were having a  solution imposed on them. What they think they are getting is a  database that will allow them to determine exactly what their interests  and rights here are and, hopefully, negotiate that with the two States  in question; but, if necessary, they will litigate the issue.                                time  1330    So we see this as a reasonable effort to bring parties together where  there is a great deal of confusion through nobody's fault. And we think  the BLM has been lax here and, frankly, may well be claiming things  beyond its authority. But the survey, again, will hopefully take care  of that. So I hope that eases the concerns that people have.  [[Page H1147]]    In terms of the drug rule, we see this as an issue where Congress  made its intent in 2012 very clear, that is, we wanted States to have  options to make these decisions for themselves. We think the Department  of Labor rule made that more, rather than less, difficult.   We can argue over the merits of any individual treatment of people  that have used illegal drugs or what the appropriate testing measure is  or whatever. I happen to think those decisions are best made at the  State level where you have got interested parties that are more  knowledgeable about local conditions than us dictating a one size fits  all. So we just simply disagree on that.   Finally, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings) mentioned some  concerns about the speed with which we are acting and also the form  with which we are acting. The form, frankly, is basically dictated by  statute.   The Congressional Review Act dictates the manner in which we can  bring these items on rules to the floor, the timetable which we can  operate under. If we alter that over here, then, frankly, we lose  privilege status in the Senate and the chances of succeeding actually  diminish pretty greatly.   We think, in this case, the issues are pretty clear. These aren't  really things that need to be amended. We need to decide whether or not  the regulation is appropriate or not. If you think it is, you should  vote in favor of keeping the regulation as it is and against this  effort.   If, on the other hand, you would like to see decisionmaking devolve  down to the States and where we think better decisions will be made,  then, you should vote in favor of the rule and the underlying  legislation.   So, again, I don't think these issues are overly complex. I do think  this is an important time to deal with them. Again, we have a limited  period of time on the Congressional Review Act. We have a certain  format. We think we are abiding within both that timeframe and that  format.   On the Oklahoma-Texas border issue, it is a knotty issue. It has been  around for decades. There have been multiple efforts to deal with it.  Most of them have faltered because we have not had the various parties  arguing from a common database as to what their positions are. We have  asked the Bureau of Land Management repeatedly to survey the affected  area. They decided they didn't want to do that.   In this case, Congress says: Look, we have two sovereign States and  three sovereign Indian tribes here that have a concern. We want them to  be able to work it through. We want them to draw on a common set of  data. So we are going to essentially make sure that that happens and  hopefully we can avoid a protracted court case between the States and  the Indian tribes and actually resolve an issue that needs to be had.   There are literally thousands of people along this border that are  not certain whether or not they own the land that they have actually  been farming, in some cases, for generations. There are three Indian  tribes that have historic rights to this land that predate, frankly,  the existence of Texas as a State and certainly the existence of  Oklahoma as a State. They want to make sure their mineral rights issues  and their land issues are appropriately handled, and they want to  preserve their rights going forward if they want to litigate. Again,  they need this kind of data to make those sorts of determinations.   I commend the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry). I, again, look  forward to working with my good friend from Florida (Mr. Hastings) on  these issues.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Actually, I listened with a great deal of interest to the debate from  my friends on the other side. None of it had very much to do with the  rule or with the underlying legislation that we are going to discuss  shortly, so I don't pretend to be an expert on the issues.   I do point out, simply in passing, that it really is up to the  President of the United States as to whose advice he or she wants to  take. Frankly, you know, to say that there aren't ``political people on  the National Security Agency,'' with all due respect to a Chief of  Staff that I admire profoundly, I think Leon Panetta is one of the  great Chiefs of Staff to ever serve any President, but I would tell you  that he is a pretty political guy. He was in this body, and one of his  jobs was to help make sure the President of the United States was  reelected. So there was a political dimension to what he did.   I don't know Mr. Bannon. I have never met him. I don't pretend to be  familiar with him or his thinking. I do know that he is a valued  adviser to the President of the United States. And if the President of  the United States is going to seek advice from somebody--and it may be  in these areas of national security--frankly, personally, I would  prefer them to be part of the National Security Council, simply to have  the educated debate of some of the very best professionals that we have  and so that their opinion, when they advise the President, is fully  formed. Again, I see this as the President's decision, not some  enormous departure.   On occasions, Mr. Axelrod, who was not a chief of staff who was  primarily a political counsel, did sit in on national security meetings  at the request of the President. So, again, we can have this argument.  I am not sure it is particularly relevant to the legislation. But at  the end of the day, I want anybody advising the President of the United  States--and he gets to make that choice--to get the best information  they can possibly receive so that that advice is well-informed.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Carter), who is here to offer some important thoughts about some of the  issues that are involved in the underlying legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I just want to point out for the record, Mr. Speaker, that actually  this rule that we are trying to repeal, the measure we are trying to  instate, doesn't force drug testing on anybody; and that is not going  to happen in any State, unless the people in the State decide that that  is something they want to do. I am quite content to let people in any  State make that decision.   I think in my State, I am pretty certain that the people who I am  privileged to represent would be very upset if they thought somebody  was receiving unemployment compensation while they were on drugs,  because they think  [[Page H1149]]  that is going to make it pretty hard for that person to ever get back  into the workforce, and they want to be able to identify that. They  don't want to incentivize it.   Other people may have a different opinion, and that is legitimate. It  is a big country. That is why our Founding Fathers adopted a Federal  system, so I wouldn't begrudge another State that saw it differently.   What we are trying to avoid here is a one-size-fits-all or this body  and any administration dictating to every State what they ought to do.   Frankly, I would suggest that my good friend's remarks suggest that  is the concern, that they actually want to decide in Oklahoma what we  would do. We are not trying to decide in Connecticut what our friends  would do. We are just thinking this ought to be down to the States.   That was the intent of Congress. When this was written, it was to  empower the States to allow them to pursue policies they thought were  appropriate. Frankly, if they do that and they pursue different  policies, which they may well, we may actually learn something out of  this. Again, that is part of the genius of our system, having 50  different laboratories out there.   But let's not have a bureaucracy decide that it will circumvent the  will of the Congress of the United States and write a rule that is  clearly meant to undo the intent of a legislation that was passed  across this floor with bipartisan support.   Again, we just disagree on the issue, but, for the record, we are not  trying to impose our beliefs. We are trying to let every State do what  that State thinks they ought to do.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am certainly prepared to close if my friend  is.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out again that, while my friend is  correct, we have two different pieces of legislation under a single  rule, and those legislations, as my friend points out, are not  particularly related. As a matter of fact, they are not related to one  another in any way. Each piece of legislation will receive a separate  debate and a separate vote on the House floor. There was simply no  reason to have two rules when one would suffice for two bills that  basically need to come into the same format, in our view.   I also point out that, when we are talking about the vote under the  Congressional Review Act, we are actually following a form prescribed  in statute, and we are moving at a pace that the law dictates and that,  frankly, is necessary in order to retain the privileged status of the  legislation in the United States Senate. So nothing unusual here, other  than we are actually being pretty productive and undoing a lot of rules  that, frankly, we think were misguided and rushed into the final days  of the last administration.   My friends are free to disagree with that, but I think the issues are  pretty clear, pretty easy to decide, and don't require a great deal of  amendments.   On the Oklahoma-Texas issue, and that is something I know a little  bit about since it affects my district, last year, when we considered  this legislation, we actually did have an amendment. It was my  amendment, and my amendment that probably made it unacceptable in the  Senate. But I was indulged by my chairman of the Rules Committee, and  for the very important reason that we actually make sure that the  tribes have an opportunity to be at the table. In this case, they do.   Mr. Thornberry has worked very hard, and so there is no dispute  between the delegations in Oklahoma, the delegations in Texas, the  interests of the various Indian tribes. Everybody agrees that we need a  common set of information, a common survey that we can all trust to,  frankly, work out the differences here that have multiplied over a  century as the border has literally shifted. So that is the appropriate  thing to do. We don't need a lot of amendments on that.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to encourage all Members to support  the rule. H.R. 428 is a fair and equitable solution which all  interested parties have agreed upon and which can provide certainty  that many landowners have sought along the Oklahoma-Texas border.   In addition, H.J. Res. 42 undoes a regulation that should have never  been made in the first place. By preventing implementation of this  regulation, we can ensure that those actively looking for work are  provided with the support necessary to reach that goal.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to take a point of personal  privilege. This is the last time my good friend and my staff member,  Mr. Waskiewicz, will be on the floor with me. He has been with me for  6\1/2\ years. He has made a smart career move and is moving on to the  Budget Committee, a more august position.   But I have had the good fortune, as I know my friends have and we all  have, to have very many wonderful staff members over the years. I have  never had a better staff member than Steve Waskiewicz, never had a  better friend, never had a harder worker, never had anybody who was  more selfless in putting the interests of our office and the  constituents whom we are privileged to represent ahead of all else. So  I want to commend and thank him publicly and on the record for his  wonderful service.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
