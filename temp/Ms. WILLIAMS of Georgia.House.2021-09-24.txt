 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  reproductive freedom; for the people I met while working for Planned  Parenthood who had to travel across State lines just to get the care  that they need.   The relentless assault on abortion in State legislatures and  courtrooms has nothing to do with health or care. It is about scoring  political points on the backs of those most marginalized.   It might be Texas first, then Mississippi, then my home State of  Georgia where, as we speak, another despicable abortion ban is having  its day in Federal court right now.   We can't leave the right to safe and legal abortion to the whim of  States. Congress must ensure that everyone, no matter their ZIP Code,  can make decisions about their health and families freely.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the  Women's Health Protection Act.
