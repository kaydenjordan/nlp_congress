 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor my good friend, Scott  Kimbriel, who died on August 12 after a year-long struggle with  prostate cancer.   I met Scott sometime before kindergarten and we stayed close for  almost 60 years. He used to come over and work on our farm while we  grew up, and over many decades our friendship remained strong as we  moved across the country.   At his core, Scott was a gifted entrepreneur and businessman. He was  able to learn from his mistakes and relentlessly marched forward. He  was a giver, able to exercise so much compassion with absolutely no  strings attached because it was simply the right thing to do for his  friends. I was better off for having known Scott.   In 2019 the American Cancer Society estimates over 174,000 people  will be diagnosed with prostate cancer. Over 31,000 of those diagnosed  will die from the disease. I, myself, am a cancer survivor.   Right now the National Cancer Institute, which is located in my  district is working on prevention, detection, and treatment of prostate  and other cancers. But we are leaving so much on the table. We need to  invest more in research. We need to invest more in innovative solutions  that could save lives like Scott's.   In Congress we must be determined and unified to eradicate cancer and  eliminate the heartache that it brings so many families across our  great country.   Scott Kimbriel was a special person, and it hurts knowing I can no  longer pick up the phone and hear Scott's ever cheerful voice answer,  ``DT.'' But instead of looking in the rearview mirror, Scott would want  us to look out the front window thinking about how we could support  those in the future who might suffer from this horrible disease.   I know I am committed to this fight, and I ask my colleagues to join  me in this fight.                            ____________________
