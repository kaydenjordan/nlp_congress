 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the 192  student teams that participated in my district's Congressional App  Challenge making it the largest competition in the history of the app  challenge. I want to thank and congratulate our winner, Walnut High  School senior, Hudson Kaleb Dy, on his impressive app to create an  affordable earthquake detection system using old smartphones.   STEM educational opportunities help our students learn the skills  needed to get good-paying jobs, boost our Nation's competitiveness, and  tackle some of the most pressing health and security challenges facing  our Nation and our world.   I have been a very proud supporter to promote STEM opportunities as  co-chair of the Congressional App Challenge, and I am thrilled that  this year over 9,000 students participated across 335 congressional  districts from coast to coast creating over 2,700 apps.   Mr. Speaker, I will always be a loud voice for educational  opportunities for our students.        Honoring the Life of U.S. Army Private First Class Jang Ho Kim     Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of U.S.  Private First Class Jang Ho Kim from Placentia, a city in my 39th  Congressional District. Jang Ho was a Valencia High School graduate who  made the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq.   His found possessions included his watch, dog tag, and a coin he  always carried with him with a Bible verse Ephesians Chapter 6, Verse  12:         For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against       principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the       darkness of this age, against the spiritual forces of evil in       heavenly places.    His legacy of courage and service lives on through his loved ones,  others he inspired, and all those who share his story.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the California delegation for backing my bill to  designate a Placentia Post Office in his honor, and I urge my  colleagues to support this bill when it comes up for a vote today so we  can preserve his story for years to come.                            ____________________
