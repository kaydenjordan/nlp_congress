 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues in strong  support of H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act.   I have been fighting for working families for 3 decades now, from the  State House in North Carolina, to here in the U.S. House. I led the  successful effort in my State to raise the State's minimum wage in 2006  from $5.15 to $6.15 an hour. Then, in 2009, the Federal Government  raised the wage to $7.25. That was 12 years ago, and the minimum wage  hasn't increased since. Only the cost of living has increased.   Folks working full-time earning the minimum wage aren't making enough  to feed their families, and that is not acceptable. No one working  full-time should live in poverty. Working hard is not enough if you  don't make enough.   That is why I am a proud supporter of H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage  Act. The Raise the Wage Act would increase wages for over 150,000  people in my district in North Carolina. It is not just good for  workers; it is good for the economy.   Unlike the GOP tax cut, which benefited corporations and the wealthy,  this bill will put money in the pockets of hardworking Americans, who  will spend it in the local economy.   My friends on the other side of the aisle will use outdated,  misleading data to say that it will kill jobs. But the most  comprehensive and recent research shows no job loss in cities that have  already raised the wage to $15.   The American people are with us on this. A vast majority support  raising the minimum wage.   You already know folks can't survive on $7.25. We don't have to do  that in Congress. My folks on the other side of the aisle, you are  making six figures. Can you survive on $7.25?   I urge my colleagues, do what is right because it is right. America  needs a raise. Join me in voting for this bill. Give the American  people a long overdue raise.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 100 economists in  support of the $15 minimum wage.             [From the Economic Policy Institute, Feb. 6, 2019]         Today, workers who earn the federal minimum wage make $7.25       an hour--about 29 percent less per hour than their       counterparts made 50 years ago (after adjusting for       inflation) We can afford to pay the lowest-paid workers in       America substantially more than what their counterparts were       paid a half century ago Workers produce more today from each       hour of work with productivity nearly doubling since the late       1960s.        We, the undersigned, support gradually increasing the       minimum wage to $15 by 2024, and then indexing it to median       wages to protect against future erosion. We also support       gradually phasing out the outdated subminimum wage for tipped       workers, which has been frozen at $2.13 since 1991.        This policy would directly lift the wages of 28.1 million       workers by 2024. Another 11.6 million workers whose wages are       just above the new minimum would likely see a wage increase       through ``spillover'' effects, as employers adjust their       internal wage scales. The vast majority of employees who       would benefit are adults--disproportionately women--in       working families, who work at least 20 hours a week and       depend on their earnings to make ends meet.        A $15 minimum wage by 2024 would result in $121 billion in       higher wages for 39.7 million low-wage workers, which would       also benefit their families and their communities. Since       lower-paid workers spend a large share of their additional       earnings, this injection of wages would modestly stimulate       consumer  [[Page H7101]]       demand, business activity, and job growth. Further, modest       and infrequent minimum wage increases are directly       responsible for growing inequality between the bottom and the       middle class; this minimum wage increase would provide a       significant and much needed boost to the earnings of low-wage       workers. And, because it would be indexed to growth in median       wages, it would ensure that the wage floor keeps up with       growth of middle-wage workers going forward.        The last decade has seen a wealth of rigorous academic       research on the effect of minimum wage increases on       employment, with the weight of evidence showing that previous       modest increases in the minimum wage had little or no       negative effects on the employment of low-wage workers. It is       time to support a bolder increase to address the fact that       wages for workers at the low end of the labor market have       continued to stagnate. Even if the growth of aggregate work       hours for low-wage workers were to slow somewhat, workers who       work less could still break even, or come out ahead, in terms       of annual earnings. Since as many as 10 percent of the       lowest-wage workers leave or start jobs every month, any       decrease in the number of full-time equivalent jobs will mean       that some workers will take more time finding a new job, or       will work fewer hours. But many of these workers may still       see their annual earnings rise because of their wage       increase.        The benefits of gradually phasing in a $15 minimum wage by       2024 would be far-reaching, lifting pay for tens of millions       of workers and helping reverse decades of growing pay       inequality. The benefits of a $15 minimum wage in 2024 for       workers, their families, and their communities far outweigh       the potential costs. Of course, the minimum wage is just one       of many policies designed to help low-wage workers. We       believe that an increase in the minimum wage should be       accompanied by complementary policies such as an expanded       Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), enhanced safety net,       increased job training, and policies to generate full       employment.
