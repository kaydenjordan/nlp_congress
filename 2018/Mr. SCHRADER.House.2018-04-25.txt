 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following  letters from the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association,  United Power Trades Organization, and the National Electrical  Contractors Association.                                                          NRECA,                                      Arlington, VA, March 14, 2018.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Ranking Member, Committee on Natural Resources, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva: On behalf       of America's electric cooperatives, I write to express strong       support for H.R. 3144 to require federal agencies responsible       for the management of the Federal Columbia River Power System       (FCRPS) to operate the hydropower system in a manner       consistent with the current operations plan.        Fifty-four rural electric cooperatives in seven Western       states receive reliable federal hydropower from the FCRPS.       For this reason, NRECA opposes actions that bring continued       uncertainty to the FCRPS and the Bonneville Power       Administration's (BPA) future hydropower operations. For       decades, there has been uncertainty over the operations of       existing hydropower in the Pacific Northwest due to federal       regulations, court orders and other administrative decisions.       This continued uncertainty to the FCRPS continues to affect       BPA's future power generation, rates and reliability in the       region, and in turn the cooperative systems that depend upon       it for reliable and affordable electric service to their       communities.        The FCRPS is paramount to power generation in the Pacific       Northwest, and to California, Nevada, Wyoming and Montana.       The FCRPS is the largest source of clean, renewable       electricity in the Pacific Northwest. It encompasses 31       multi-purpose federally-owned dams along the Columbia and       Snake Rivers and accounts for nearly 40 percent of total U.S.       hydroelectric generation. Its hydropower not only provides       energy for baseload needs and peak times, but also serves as       a backup generation source for intermittent wind and solar       power. This gives the Pacific Northwest and our cooperatives       an environmental edge unmatched elsewhere in the country--as       a non-CO2 emitting resource. But due to the long-      standing litigation surrounding the FCRPS for Endangered       Species Act-listed salmon and steelhead, there continues to       be uncertainty over BPA's future hydropower operations.       Specifically, BPA's fish and wildlife mitigation program       continues to be a significant cost driver which adversely       affects our cooperatives' abilities to provide affordable       electricity.        Since 1978, BPA has committed nearly $15.9 billion to       support Northwest fish and wildlife recovery. BPA's fish and       wildlife mitigation program is the largest in the nation, and       quite possibly the world. Each year, cooperatives and       ratepayers fund BPA's habitat restoration efforts to open       valuable habitat in the Columbia River estuary and       tributaries, add water to streams, and support cool water       temperatures. In 2012, BPA directly invested more than $450       million to address the impacts of federal dams. These       activities included protecting land and water habitat,       implementing projects across the Columbia River Basin, and       supporting better fish passage. Specifically, BPA has made       huge long-term investments in large-scale structural and       operational changes to further improve existing fish passage       routes as well as to provide new, safe passage structures to       these dams.        Therefore, by upholding the 2014 Supplemental Biological       Opinion, H.R. 3144 appropriately balances environmental and       economic demands while also protecting existing hydropower       resources in the Pacific Northwest. For these and other       reasons, NRECA urges support for H.R. 3144 in committee and       swift advancement to the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                   Jim Matheson,                                             National Rural Electric      Cooperative Association.                                   ____                                                        United Power                                             Trades Organization,                                  West Richland, WA, March 22, 2018.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Raul Grijalva,      Ranking Member, Committee on Natural Resources, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva, I am       writing on behalf of the United Power Trades Organization       (UPTO) to express our support for H.R. 3144 which requires       federal agencies to manage the Federal Columbia River Power       System (FCRPS) in accordance with the 2014 Supplemental       Biological Opinion (Bi-Op). UPTO represents over 600 blue       collar employees that work at the U.S. Army Corps of       Engineers dams on the Columbia-Snake River system.        Our organization is made up of not only maintenance       personnel, but power plant operators who are responsible for       operating the lock and dam facilities in accordance with the       Bi-Op. I have been one of those operators for over 30 years       and have personally seen the improvements made at our       facilities that have greatly improved fish survival. It is       very frustrating when outside interests persuade judicial       orders that change the way we operate to the detriment of       fish survival.        Contrary to misinformation that has been widely reported,       spilling water over the dams has not been the primary reason       for increases in fish survival through the Columbia-Snake       River system. There have been many reasons that fish survival       has improved including habitat restoration, better oceanic       conditions and summer flow augmentation. But a major reason       for improved  [[Page H3546]]       fish survival is the transportation program. Fish entering       the generating turbine intakes are directed by rotating       screens into bypass channels to fish collection facilities       where they are loaded on to barges and given a free ride to       below Bonneville dam where they are released back in to the       river. Fish transported by barge are five times more likely       to survive than those that traverse the river.        Spilling water over the dams not only costs the taxpayers       millions in lost power generation, but is actually       detrimental to fish survival. Fish that pass through the       spillgates are not collected for transport by barge, thus       less likely to survive than those that are collected. In       addition, the more water that is spilled over the dams, the       more supersaturation of nitrogen in the water occurs       resulting in gas bubble trauma to juvenile fish. More spill       just doesn't make sense in that it is costly economically,       doesn't help the fish, and can even be detrimental to fish       survival.        H.R. 3144 is important in that it continues programs and       operating procedures that have been proven extremely       successful in migrating fish survival. The Bi-Op is working       and making changes make absolutely no sense. Fish returns are       higher than what they were prior to the first dam built on       the Columbia-Snake river system and, although hatchery fish       are returning in large numbers, natural fish returns are up       as well too. Fish survival through the Columbia-Snake River       dams are at levels that meet or exceed those on rivers that       don't have dams. The current Bi-Op is the most science-based,       comprehensive and expensive effort to restore an endangered       species in the nation. $1.6 billion have been invested in new       technologies and, when operated according to the Bi-Op, have       proven that the dams and fish can co-exist.        Continuing to operate the dams according to the Bi-Op is       imperative for continued high rate of survival for migrating       fish. H.R. 3144 requires that continuity and is therefore       imperative to the continued high survival rate of migrating       fish. UPTO urges support for H.R. 3144 in committee and swift       advancement to the House floor.            Sincerely,                                               Jack W. Heffling,                                                          President,      United Power Trades Organization.                                   ____                                                 National Electrical                                         Contractors Association,                                       Bethesda, MD, April 21, 2018.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan: On behalf of the National Electrical       Contractors Association (NECA), I am writing in strong       support of pending energy legislation being considering by       the House. NECA urges Members to vote yes on H.R. 3144--To       provide for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power       System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a specified       period of time, and for other purposes, introduced by       Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers.        NECA is the nationally recognized voice of the $160 billion       electrical construction industry that brings power, light,       and communication technology to buildings and communities       across the U.S. NECA's national office and its 119 local       chapters are dedicated to enhancing the industry through       continuing education, labor relations, safety codes,       standards development, and government relations. NECA is       committed to advocating for a comprehensive energy policy       that addresses all available opportunities for energy       exploration and independence.        The benefits of this legislation are clear: job creation,       energy independence, and economic growth. NECA greatly       appreciates the hard work that Representative McMorris       Rodgers put into writing this important legislation. This       will be included in the NECA Legislative Report Card for the       115th Congress. We urge all members to vote yes.        Thank you for your consideration of our views.            Sincerely,                                    Marco A. Giamberardino, MPA,                                                 Executive Director,                                                Government Affairs.     Mr. Speaker, it is time to put science back in the  decisionmaking process for Oregon and Pacific Northwest salmon recovery  strategy. Rather than having the courts dictate the best way to balance  Northwest fish recovery and the region's power needs, we should let the  experts in U.S. Fish and Wildlife, Bonneville Power, NOAA, and NMFS  lead the way. H.R. 3144 allows that to occur.   Rather than having fish policy decided by lawsuit, it simply lets the  experts do their job. Quite simply, it will allow the Federal Columbia  River Power System to be managed according to the 2014 Obama  administration-approved biological opinion until a new BiOp can be  completed in 2020.   U.S. Fish and Wildlife, BPA, NOAA, and NMFS have spent years  developing recovery plans to restore habitat, encourage fish passage,  and manage this fishery. Their hard work was summarily thrown out by  the court in favor of continued litigation. In fact, a third--yes, a  third--of our power bills in the Northwest is dedicated to fish  recovery.   We have been diligent. Bonneville ratepayers have stepped up time and  again. We have made strides, despite battling the effects of climate  change, ocean acidification, and overfishing by foreign nations. Some  things we can control, some things we cannot--like sea lion  depredation, we can.   Despite the scientific evidence and warnings from Washington and  Oregon Fish and Wildlife biologists that say sea lions likely account  for at least 20 percent or more of adult salmon loss in the Columbia  River system, we are not doing anything about it. Even our Governors  agree we need to address this, and these are Democratic Governors.  Let's deal with that instead of one injunction after another demanding  more spill over the tops of the dams, which, as we have heard, is not  based in good science.   This latest order will cost $40 million to $50 million, with the jury  out on its effectiveness as to juvenile survival and subsequent adult  return. Let's at least get some scientific data to see if this is a  good idea. H.R. 3144 would allow that to happen.   BPA is at a crossroads. Natural gas is abundant, very inexpensive,  the primary reason a lot of our coal plants are being phased out. But  its low cost, coupled with more and more demands for fish mitigation,  now threaten to eliminate our clean, renewable hydropower system that  accounts for 50 percent of the electricity in the Northwest.   BPA simply cannot absorb more spill requirements with subsequent loss  of power generation and revenue without having to curtail the very fish  mitigation recovery programs the litigants want that have been helping  to recover our endangered salmon. BPA is becoming quickly uncompetitive  due to these escalating costs.   If they go away, what happens? It means more natural gas, more fossil  fuels. It makes no sense, if your goal is balancing smart, scientific- based fish recovery with clean renewable energy, to put BPA out of  business and eliminate local control that the Pacific Northwest has had  on determining its own future.   The entire Northwest delegation, Republican and Democrat, worked  together on this. We would like to continue to do so. We need to stop  this constant litigation. Let the scientific experts steeped in fish  recovery do their job.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 3144.
