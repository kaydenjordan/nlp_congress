 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I further ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call with respect to the cloture motion for the motion  to proceed to Calendar No. 58, S. 1260, be waived.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to  finish my remarks prior to the upcoming vote.    Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon to  talk about two issues of vital importance to the United States and the  world.   First, I want to say a few words about the current violence  paralyzing Israel and the Palestinian territories, but then I want to  spend the bulk of my remarks on the future of nuclear proliferation in  the Middle East.   First, here in America, our hearts are breaking for Israelis and  Palestinians.  [[Page S2539]]  The images are just bone-chilling--rockets and interceptors streaking  across the night sky, parents huddled with their children as air raid  sirens ring out, tragic images of innocent Israeli and Palestinian  civilians, including children, injured or killed in the blasts.   For many Americans who are turning on the news this week, it might  appear that the events of the last few days erupted almost overnight.  While tensions are now reaching a fevered and deadly pitch, this  cataclysm has been long in the making and no party, including the  United States of America, has completely clean hands.   Zero-sum politics have driven both the decision making of the  Netanyahu government and Palestinian leadership, to the extent that  there is such a thing as Palestinian leadership. Those decisions have  led us to this crisis.   Over and over, Prime Minister Netanyahu has pushed Israeli  settlements further into territory historically considered reserved for  a future Palestinian State. The Israeli Government, increasingly  reliant on rightwing, zero-sum political constituencies for its  survival, also stepped up campaigns to remove Palestinians from areas  in East Jerusalem as a means to undermine the Palestinian claim to that  section of the ancient city as the capital of a future state.   The spark that lit the match of the existing conflagration was the  Israeli effort to remove Palestinian families from their homes in the  East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah and replace them with  Israeli settlers.   In February, the Israeli court ordered Palestinian families in that  neighborhood to vacate their homes by May 2 or they would be forcibly  removed. Protests began, spread to other cities in Israel with large  Arab populations, while the Palestinian families awaited a final ruling  from the Israeli Supreme Court.   As these protests spread and grew in size, Israeli police adopted  some tactics that we have seen on display here in the United States--an  overly securitized approach that only escalated rather than defused the  tension. Those crackdowns led to more protests and more clashes and a  cycle that continued and continued.   Then Israeli security forces stormed Islam's third holiest site in  Jerusalem during Ramadan prayers. Now, the Israelis contend that they  were responding to a rock thrown from Palestinians inside. The  Palestinians argue it was the other way around. But whatever happened,  at the end of that night, more than 330 Palestinians and 22 Israelis  had been injured.   The story of the Palestinians' conduct over the last decade is just  as important in understanding the roots of the existing crisis. Fatah,  the main political party representing Palestinians, has failed the  people it represents. Ripe with internal conflict and corruption, Fatah  lost its mandate to govern Gaza in 2006, when Hamas, an internationally  recognized terrorist organization, beat Fatah in parliamentary  elections there that year.   Hamas refuses to recognize the right of Israel to exist and advocates  for the armed rebellion of Palestinians against Israel. Fatah, under  pressure from Hamas to take more extreme positions, spent most of the  last decade refusing any and all chance to negotiate with the Israelis,  preferring to sit on the sidelines and nurture grievances. They were  unable to deliver any real economic benefit to the people under their  charge in the West Bank, and the resulting desperation of Palestinians  fed this grievance culture even more.   In response to those events I mentioned at Al Aqsa, Hamas and its  allies in Gaza started firing rockets into southern and central Israel.  Since that day, thousands of rockets have landed inside Israel. These  rocket attacks were then responded to by an Israeli Government that has  begun its own assault inside Gaza, and as we sit here today, hundreds  of Palestinians inside Gaza, including children, have been killed.  Although there have not been as many casualties in Israel because of  the defense-security relationship with the United States, Israelis have  been killed as well.   The Israelis were wrong to pursue settlements and evictions as a  deliberate means to undermine a future Palestinian state. These  policies might have helped hold together Netanyahu's political  coalition, but they helped to feed a sense of hopelessness amongst  Palestinians and their future.   The Palestinian leadership was wrong to perpetuate an anti-Israeli,  anti-Semitic narrative as a foundation of their hold on power. They  were wrong to choose grievance over diplomacy.   But the United States, over the last 4 years, played a role too.  President Trump rejected America's historic role as a broker for peace  and reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. He chose a side  unconditionally, and his alliance with Netanyahu and his rejection of a  Palestinian state drove the two parties further apart and turned the  temperature up. Trump pursued a path to intentionally create division  rather than healing. Those 4 years of America's absence from its  traditional post of mediator is also a big reason we are here today.   There is going to be time to talk about the big picture--to talk  about what went wrong and how American policy needs to change toward  Israel and the West Bank and Gaza--but right now, our focus needs to be  laser-like on deescalation, on a cease-fire. Hamas must stop its rocket  attacks. They are war crimes. They are indiscriminate. They do nothing  to help the Palestinians in East Jerusalem or anywhere else. Israel  needs to stand down its military campaign as well. They have to take  off the table a ground invasion of Gaza. Israel possesses a  disproportionate military power. That is why, during the 2014 invasion  of Gaza, 2,000 Palestinians died compared with fewer than 100 Israelis.  But when children die in Gaza, it does nothing to secure Israel. In  fact, it does the opposite. It just provides further fuel to this  furnace of grievances.   So I am glad that the administration is sending Deputy Assistant  Secretary Amr to the region, that he is there. It is critical that we  also get a formal U.S. Ambassador to Israel in place as quickly as  possible. But the United States needs to be pressing for a cease-fire.  The United States can't afford to simply allow for this escalation to  continue. That is not in Israel's best interest, and that is not in  America's best interest. My hope is, in the conversations that are  happening today between the Biden administration and the Netanyahu  government, that they are talking about the terms to bring this  violence to an end.   Now, as to the second topic, I recently spent 5 days in the Middle  East last week. I came back just before this recent spate of violence  began in Gaza and Israel. During the 5 days I was in the Middle East, I  crossed paths with a bunch of Biden officials who were making stops  throughout the region, and I can report that, in setting aside the  conflict in Israel--something that is pretty hard to do right now-- there is some real positive news to bring back from the Gulf.   The 4-year-long rift between Qatar and its Gulf neighbors is healing.  There is now a new diplomatic energy behind cease-fire talks in Yemen,  and the Saudis and the Iranians are in direct talks for the first time  in years. All of this--I was repeatedly told by leaders in the Middle  East--is happening because President Biden has made clear that  deescalation is going to be rewarded and supported by the United  States--a stark departure from the Trump administration.   Now, this is good news, but the bad news quickly follows, and it is  this: If the United States does not reenter the Iran nuclear agreement,  all of this nascent progress is going to be at risk.   Joe Biden ran on a promise to reenter the Iran nuclear agreement. He  made this commitment because he knew that this agreement was critical  to American security. With Iran's nuclear program curtailed and  inspectors allowed to comb every inch of the country to look for signs  of a secret enrichment program, the world could breathe a sigh of  relief in knowing that, for all of Iran's other malevolent behaviors  and policies, at least we knew that they were not developing a nuclear  weapon.   The achievement of the deal also brought together a set of really  unlikely bedfellows--the United States and Europe but also Russia and  China. On Iran policy, with this coalition of regular adversaries, it  was intact at the end of the Obama administration. It was ready to be  picked up by President Trump to confront Iran's ballistic  [[Page S2540]]  missile program or their support for regional proxy forces like  Hezbollah, but Trump went in a different direction. Instead of building  on the Iran deal, he decided to put to test the theory of its  opponents. That theory is this: that if the United States imposed  unilateral, crippling sanctions on Iran, leaders in Tehran would limp  to the negotiating table, cowed and willing to put all of the issues-- nuclear enrichment, missiles, human rights, proxy support--up for  discussion. That is what Obama's critics said he should have done, and  those critics cheered when Trump took their advice.   What happened, of course, was a policy cataclysm. Trump imposed the  sanctions, and our partners, instead of following America's lead,  effectively took the Iranian side, even helping Iran work around our  sanctions. Making matters worse, when Trump sent word to the Iranians  of our 12 demands, they refused to talk. Instead, they did the  opposite. They ratcheted up their bad behavior. They sent more support  to the Houthis in Yemen. They restarted dormant parts of their nuclear  program, reducing their breakout time to a weapon from just over a year  to just under 3 months, and they resumed attacks on American forces in  the region, both directly and through proxies.   Here is a pretty simple way to take a look at the success of the  maximum pressure campaign. One element of the Iran nuclear deal was a  commitment by Iran to reduce their enriched uranium stockpile. You can  see, in the years leading up to the deal, there is a dramatic  escalation in the amount of enriched uranium the Iranians are holding.  Then immediately upon the deal's being reached, it plummets. Yet here  is the bad news: As soon as the maximum pressure campaign is unveiled  by President Trump, those numbers start to creep back up again.   One chart explains to you the effect of Trump's maximum pressure  campaign. It was a spectacular failure and definitive proof that the  alternative approach, cheered by the Iran deal's opponents--keep the  sanctions in place until Iran totally capitulates--was a fantasy.  Instead, the situation has empowered the more hardline wing of an  already hardline regime who is prepared to perpetually operate a  resistance economy and blame the United States for the nation's  suffering.   Yet now those same critics of the nuclear agreement are back, and  incredibly, despit the writing inked on the wall during the past 4  years, their argument hasn't changed a bit. Just keep doing what Trump  did, and this time it will work, they say. They suggest that getting  back into the nuclear deal, as Biden pledged during the campaign, isn't  enough. They want a new deal that includes a resolution to all of  Iran's bad acts, but unless we are prepared to invade Iran and demand  unconditional surrender--news flash: We are not--then that  comprehensive, soup-to-nuts deal is a neoconservative fantasy. It  doesn't exist in real life.    In real life, the achievable result is a restart of the nuclear  agreement. The good news is that this result in 2021 might have an even  greater peace dividend than when it was executed the first time in  2015.   This brings me back to my trip to the region. I heard this story,  while I was there, of how quickly talks on healing the Gulf Cooperation  Council rift matured as soon as Biden won the election. Countries that  were at one another's throats throughout the Trump administration were  suddenly coming to terms with one another. While conflict and bullying  and score-settling--Trump's calling cards--were rewarded during his  term, countries quickly realized that diplomacy and deescalation would  most quickly win favor with President Biden.   In Oman, I heard how the Saudis were suddenly much more willing to  make additional concessions in Yemen and how the Houthis were now more  likely to trust the United States as an interlocutor. In Jordan, the  King talked to us about how an Iraqi Government was now more welcoming  than ever of help from places other than Iran, and he spoke of Jordan's  new overtures to a Baghdad Government in its looking for a more diverse  set of allies. And everyone in the region, at every stop, buzzed about  these talks, these dialogues, between the Saudis and the Iranians.  Reports suggest that these two countries wanted to talk during the  Trump administration but were discouraged from doing so.   This momentum toward peace is encouraging, but it is so fragile, and  one major setback, one major, unexpected diplomatic hiccup, could turn  all of this progress around. I worry that this hiccup could be the  failure of America and Iran to get back into the nuclear agreement. If  the talks fail and the Biden administration is forced to implement  Trump's Iran policy for the next 4 years, complete with these  unilateral crippling sanctions, it is easy to see how all of this  progress in the Gulf could disintegrate. The so-called Iranian  moderates would head back to Tehran with no deal and be defeated in the  upcoming national elections. A harder line government, much less prone  to diplomacy, would choose to scuttle peace talks in Yemen, end the  outreach to the Saudis, and work like mad to make sure that their  proxies in Iraq take power in the upcoming parliamentary elections.  This could convince the Saudis to double down militarily in Yemen and  open up new fissures in the Gulf.   Listen, maybe I am wrong. Maybe this is an overly apocalyptic vision  of what would occur if the nuclear negotiations go south, but I fear  that it is more accurate than fantastical that the stakes might be that  high, which brings me, finally, to our negotiations in Vienna. If the  consequences of success are so promising and if the ramifications of  failure are so dire, then what has to happen to guarantee a good  outcome? And I will end here.   First, the structure of the talks is deeply problematic, and that is  the Iranians' fault. They are insisting on this shuttle diplomacy when  we should be talking directly to them.   Second, countries in Iran's neighborhood that were hostile or neutral  to the talks in 2015 suddenly have their eyes wide open to the benefits  of getting back into the deal, so we should make sure that our partners  in the Middle East who have the ear of the Iranian Government or the  Supreme Leader are applying the appropriate pressure and letting Iran  know that their relationships in the region are at risk if Iran fails  to get back into the deal.   On our side of the ledger, we need to be willing to be creative. Now,  of course, any restart of the nuclear agreement is going to require the  United States to drop the sanctions Trump applied to Iran's economy-- that had the same impact as the Obama-era nuclear sanctions.   Yet here is the point I want to make: What about the other sanctions  that Trump layered on top of the economic sanctions? For example, it  should be expected that the Iranians would want us to lift Trump's  designation of its primary military force, the IRGC, as a terrorist  organization. This wasn't strictly a nuclear sanction, but it was  certainly a key part of Trump's maximum pressure campaign, and it was  specifically designed to try to bring Iran back to the negotiating  table on a nuclear program.   In evaluating the wisdom of peeling back these noneconomic sanctions,  it is important to remember that they were all completely feckless.  These sanctions had no impact. In fact, their only impact was to worsen  Iran's behavior, so lifting them would have no practical negative  impact.   Just as importantly, lifting this particular designation, the one  example I am posing to you today, is a rather technical exercise under  the U.S. statute, and it actually doesn't prevent us from sanctioning  the truly bad actors in the Iranian military. For example, our  sanctions on some of their most brutal interrogators--the IRGC's  interrogators--would all stay in place even if we lifted that blanket  IRGC designation.   This is just one example of a Trump-era sanction whose erasure would  have little to no practical impact. There are many more, but I use this  example to show how weighing the equities, the benefits, of getting  into the deal are going to be far greater than the imaginary benefits  of keeping many of Trump's noneconomic sanctions.   Now, let me be clear. If the sanctions like this are removed,  opponents of the deal are going to cry bloody murder in that they are  going to accuse Biden of giving more than Obama gave, but this is the  exact trap that Trump was trying to set for his successor. He applied  [[Page S2541]]  sanctions on Iran in connection with the pullout of the nuclear deal,  but he called them nonnuclear sanctions, hoping the next President  would be caught in this sticky web. President Biden shouldn't be bound  by Trump's tortured sanctions logic.   But, just as importantly, let me assure you that no matter the  particulars or the details of the agreement to restart the nuclear  deal, the deal critics are going to oppose it, no matter what. They  opposed it in 2015. They are going to oppose it again.   What we should really be worried about is Trump's Iran policy  becoming, by accident, permanent, and this is what is likely to occur  if the Vienna talks fail. Iran will continue to speed up its nuclear  research program, the maximum pressure will continue, and a chill will  be delivered to the deescalation momentum in the region.   But on the other hand, reentering the deal, while effectively already  priced into a Biden electoral victory, will be seen as a diplomatic  victory, at a perfect time to score a win for diplomacy, and the Middle  East countries who have found new affection for a U.S.-Iran agreement  will exhale.   Now, I am not naive. I understand the Middle East has still dozens of  intractable crises, and the events of the last few days in Israel and  Gaza are a reminder of the grave challenges that are still there. But  the overall mood of deescalation in and around the Gulf is real, and it  is much better than the old incentive structure for escalation.   So I see these roots of positive change slowly, quietly growing, and,  right now, the best way for the United States to nurture those grass  shoots is to restart the Iran nuclear agreement.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
