 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, in his victory speech and in his  inauguration address, President Biden pledged to be a President for all  Americans. He said:         I pledge to be a President who seeks not to divide, but to       unify. Who doesn't see Red and Blue states, but a United       States. And who will work with all my heart to win the       confidence of the whole people.    He reiterated that sentiment at his inauguration stating:         On this January day, my whole soul is in this: Bringing       America together. Uniting our people . . . uniting our       Nation.    It is a sentiment that I honor. As I said the day after the  inauguration, if President Biden can truly be a President who governs  for all Americans and who respects all Americans and who works to win  the confidence of the whole people, he will have done our Nation a  great service.   But it is not enough to talk about unity. It has to be matched with  action. Too many of the President's actions so far have been more  calculated to appeal to the far-left wing of the Democratic Party than  to unite Americans. In his 2 weeks in office, the President has signed  off on a long list of Executive actions, many of which read like a wish  list of leftist priorities.   In a nod to the far-left environmental wing of the Democrat Party,  the President issued a new moratorium on oil and gas leasing on Federal  lands and called a halt to the Keystone XL Pipeline, even though we are  a long way from significantly reducing or eliminating our need for oil  and natural gas.   Domestic oil and gas production is essential to maintaining an  affordable and reliable energy supply here at home. Halting new oil and  gas drilling could jeopardize the stability of other affordable energy  supply and will definitely jeopardize American jobs supported by this  industry.   As for the Keystone XL Pipeline, stopping this project--which I would  point out is well underway--is nothing more than a symbolic gesture.  America will still need reliable sources of oil, and a modern pipeline  is a cleaner way to transport.   Keystone XL has been through multiple exhaustive environmental  reviews, and, on top of that, its builder has committed to fully  offsetting its operations with $1.7 billion in renewable energy  purchases. The oil trains, trucks, and other pipelines still moving  crude oil today aren't doing that. In fact, Canadian Prime Minister  Justin Trudeau, a staunch liberal, included the pipeline in Canada's  clean energy plan.   It is also worth noting, in addition to eliminating an  environmentally responsible means of transporting oil, canceling the  pipeline project will cost thousands of jobs, which is particularly  unfortunate given the many jobs that have been lost during this  pandemic. On day one of his Presidency, President Biden effectively  fired 2,000 pipeline workers and told another 9,000 never to show up.   Then, of course, there is the President's order halting construction  of the border wall on our southern border. The Biden administration has  plans for sweeping immigration reform but does not seem to be placing  much of an emphasis on border security. Instead, they have reduced the  wall to a symbol of the Trump administration and chosen to satisfy  immigration activists by halting construction without offering adequate  alternate ways to secure our borders against the flood of illegal  immigration or drug and human trafficking and other criminal activity.   Then, of course, there is the President's decision to overturn the  Mexico City policy, which prevents taxpayer dollars from being used to  fund abortions in other countries. The majority of Americans do not  believe in unrestricted abortion. A new poll released last month showed  a majority of Americans do not want their tax dollars going to fund  abortions, yet the President has acted to ensure that American tax  dollars can go to fund overseas abortions whether Americans want them  to or not.   In addition, this administration has given every sign that it intends  to pursue a radically pro-abortion agenda that is out of step with the  views of the majority of Americans.   Last week, the New York Times published an editorial urging the  President to slow down the Executive orders and to embrace  policymaking. The Times correctly pointed out that permanent  legislation on issues like immigration is better for the country than  wild policy shifts between administrations, and the Times urged the  President to focus  [[Page S418]]  less on Executive orders and more on legislating.   The editorial noted the President's pledge to seek unity and that on  the campaign trail he ``often touted his skill at finding compromise,  and his decades as a legislator, as reasons to elect him over Mr.  Trump.''   Now is the time for the President to show that he does really mean to  live up to his inaugural pledge and to unify our Nation. That means not  just talk, but action. It means working with lawmakers of both parties  to develop legislation, not pushing exclusively Democrat measures. It  means urging Democrat congressional leaders to actually negotiate with  Republicans instead of trying to force through an agenda that lacks the  support of half or more of the country. It means focusing less on  checking off the priorities of the far left and more on actually  representing the views of the majority of Americans.   The President has a chance to genuinely unify our Nation, but he will  have to decide whether or not he wants to take it.                                S. Con. Res. 5    Mr. President, yesterday, I came down to the floor to talk about  Democrats' decision to pursue a partisan budget resolution designed to  pave the way for a partisan COVID relief measure, despite the fact that  Congress has produced five--five--prior COVID relief packages and  appropriated trillions of dollars on an overwhelmingly bipartisan  basis.   Republicans put forward several ideas to improve the measure: an  amendment to protect small businesses hit hard by the pandemic from  sudden tax increases; an amendment to ensure that schools actually  open, especially after teachers receive the vaccine; an amendment to  ensure that States deal honestly and transparently with the tragic  COVID deaths that had happened at certain nursing homes; an amendment  to protect healthcare workers who travel to other States to help during  the pandemic from getting surprise tax bills from those State as a  thank-you note.    I would like to think the Democrats would support some of these  amendments. My amendment to protect healthcare workers is based on  legislation I advanced that has received strong bipartisan support,  although it has been opposed by a handful of States, like the  Democratic leader's, that aggressively tax mobile workers.   So far Democrats have not shown much of an inclination to entertain  Republican ideas, no matter how much they would help address the  effects of the pandemic. Democrats have indicated that they may allow a  handful of amendments that enjoy some Republican support, but that  doesn't change the essentially partisan character of this undertaking,  which is designed to allow Democrats to pass the legislation that they  want on an entirely partisan basis.   Will we see political amendments on the floor during this process?  Sure, we will, from both parties.   Democrats have chosen a political maneuver instead of seeking to  replicate the bipartisan success we had with COVID bills like the CARES  Act. We did five--five--COVID bills while we were the majority at the  60-vote threshold, which is required for most legislation here in the  Senate, but with bipartisan support. Here we are in a purely partisan  legislative exercise on the floor of the U.S. Senate. So yes,  Republicans will offer some political amendments, but we will also  offer COVID-related amendments the Democrats should support if they  truly want to deliver help to those in need.   It is deeply disappointing that Democrats are heading down this  partisan path. If they really wanted to govern for all Americans, they  would work with Republicans to pass yet another bipartisan COVID bill.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment  No. 52 be called up, as modified, and reported by number.    Mr. President, one significant thing we could do to  provide genuine relief to Americans is to address the tax situation  facing remote and mobile workers, like the medical professionals who  travel from other States to help during the COVID crisis who now may be  facing a surprise big, fat tax bill.   Mobile workers generally have to file tax returns in multiple States,  as tax rules often differ, and with COVID, many employers had their  employees begin working from home, presenting a possible tax problem  for workers who live in a different State than the one they work in.   This amendment would address these challenges. It would create a  uniform standard for mobile workers, codify the prepandemic status quo  for remote workers, and establish a special 90-day standard for  healthcare workers and others who traveled to another State to help  during the pandemic and to ensure that these workers don't face an  unexpected tax bill.   I would ask that we adopt the amendment.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio, and I would  ask that this amendment be adopted by voice.                    Vote on Amendment No. 52, As Modified     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    I yield back time.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.   Is there a sufficient second?   There is a sufficient second.
