 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 382) condemning the rise of antisemitism and  calling on elected officials to identify and educate others on the  contributions of the Jewish American community, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 382         Whereas the Senate and House of Representatives have       recognized many heritage months that celebrate the various       communities that form the mosaic of the United States;        Whereas through recognizing and celebrating heritage       months, we learn about one another, honor the richness of the       diversity of the United States, and strengthen the fabric of       society in the United States;        Whereas Jewish American Heritage Month has its origins in       1980, when Congress enacted a Joint Resolution entitled       ``Joint Resolution to authorize and request the President to       issue a proclamation designating April 21 through April 28,       1980, as `Jewish Heritage Week' '', approved April 24, 1980       (Public Law 96-237; 94 Stat. 338);        Whereas on April 24, 1980, President Carter issued the       proclamation for Jewish Heritage Week, and in that       proclamation, President Carter spoke about the bountiful       contributions made by the Jewish people to the culture and       history of the United States;        Whereas Congress has played a central role in recognizing       Jewish American Heritage Month since the Senate and the House       of Representatives passed resolutions in 2006 and 2005,       respectively, urging the President to proclaim the national       observation of a month recognizing the Jewish American       community;        Whereas since 2006, Presidents Bush, Obama, Trump, and       Biden have all issued proclamations for Jewish American       Heritage Month, which celebrates Jewish Americans and       encourages all people of the United States to learn more       about Jewish heritage and the contributions of Jewish people       throughout the history of the United States;        Whereas we recognize the significance of Jewish American       Heritage Month as a time to celebrate the contributions of       Jewish Americans to the society and culture of the United       States;        Whereas people of the United States celebrate the rich       history of Jewish people in the United States and the more       than 350-year history of Jewish contributions to society in       the United States;        Whereas the United States has long served as a haven for       Jewish people escaping from oppression in search of liberty,       justice, and tolerance;        Whereas the Jewish American community dates back to 1654,       when a group of 23 Jewish people, fleeing persecution at the       hands of the Portuguese Inquisition, fled Brazil and found       refuge in what is now New York City;        Whereas Jewish Americans have established deep roots in       communities across the United States, and served their       neighbors and the United States as loyal and patriotic       citizens, always grateful for the safe harbor that the United       States has provided for them;        Whereas the Jewish American community has since grown to       over 6,000,000 people, representing approximately 2 percent       of the population of the United States in 2023;        Whereas Jewish Americans have served in government and the       military, won Nobel prizes, led universities and       corporations, advanced medicine and philanthropy, created and       performed in enduring works of performing and visual art,       written great novels, become emblems of justice as members of       the Supreme Court of the United States, and so much more;        Whereas Jewish Americans have been subjected to a recent       surge in antisemitism as the Anti-Defamation League's (ADL)       2022 Audit of Antisemitic Incidents tracked 3,697 antisemitic       incidents in the United States, representing a 36-percent       increase from 2021 and the largest number on record since the       Anti-Defamation League began tracking antisemitic incidents       in 1979;        Whereas the rise in antisemitism is being felt by ordinary       people in the United States, as a report by the American       Jewish Committee revealed that--        (1) 89 percent of Jewish respondents believe antisemitism       is a problem in the United States; and        (2) 4 in 10 Jewish Americans reported changing their       behavior in at least 1 way out of fear of antisemitism;        Whereas over the course of the past decade, Holocaust       distortion and denial has grown in intensity;        Whereas a 2020 survey of all 50 States on Holocaust       knowledge among Millennials and Generation Z, conducted by       the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany,       found a clear lack of awareness of key historical facts,       including--        (1) 63 percent of respondents did not know that 6,000,000       Jews were murdered during the Holocaust; and        (2) 36 percent of respondents thought that ``two million or       fewer Jews'' were killed;        Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investigation has aggregated       2021 hate crime data showing that Jewish people remain the       single most targeted religious minority in the United States;        Whereas the most effective ways to counter the increase in       antisemitic actions are through education, awareness, and the       uplifting of Jewish voices, while highlighting the       contributions that Jewish Americans have made to the United       States; and        Whereas as the strength of a society can be measured by how       that society protects its minority populations and celebrates       their contributions, it is altogether fitting for the United       States to once again mark the month of May as Jewish American       Heritage Month: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) calls on elected officials, faith leaders, and civil       society leaders to condemn and combat any and all acts of       antisemitism;        (2) takes all possible steps to ensure the safety and       security of Jewish American communities; and        (3) calls on the Executive Branch and civic leaders to       identify and educate the public on the contributions of the       Jewish American community     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H. Res. 382, the bill now under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Jewish American Heritage Month, first proclaimed by  George W. Bush in 2006 and by each successive President since,  recognizes the great contribution that the Jewish community has given  to this country since its founding. Recognizing this month is  particularly important because of the rise of anti-Semitism over the  last few years.   Recently, Mr. Speaker, the Judiciary Committee heard testimony  regarding anti-Semitism and the violence that has now erupted.   In our hearing, Barry Borgen told the committee about attacks on his  son in New York City. Joseph Borgen was targeted simply for wearing his  yarmulke and was beaten by several individuals for nothing other than  being recognized as an observant Jew. He was kicked, punched, hit, and,  in fact, pepper sprayed by his attackers in a horrific attack simply  because of his faith.   At this time around the world, we see the rise of anti-Semitism.  America for more than half a century, for almost a century, has become  the beacon of freedom for the world. In that time, we have had to show  the world that anti-Semitism has no place in America and should have no  place in the rest of the world.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to associate myself with the ranking member's statements. I  have served, as long as I have served, with the gentleman from New  York. Mr. Nadler has been a leader on this, and this is a bipartisan  issue, one that each year we are honored to come before this Congress  and renew our statement of solidarity with this community that has, in  fact, as the gentleman said, grown in numbers, mostly because they have  been persecuted around the world.   This year is no exception. As we speak, the President of Ukraine is  being called a Nazi in order to diminish who he is and his faith. It is  only in this kind of a world where you can use terms like that as a  Russian head of state in order to try to diminish somebody duly  elected.   As I said in my opening statement--and I will say it again and again  every chance I get--if America does not lead in crushing anti-Semitism  and denouncing it, the rest of the world will take it as it is okay to  do. We cannot ever again allow what we saw in World War II. We cannot  ever again turn a blind eye to the growth of anti-Semitism here or  around the world. I stand with my colleague from New York in saying  that is more essential this year than ever before.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, much will be said on this floor today about anti- Semitism, and it should be, but let us not fail to expand the  deliberation on why we have a Jewish American Heritage Month. We don't  just have it to combat anti-Semitism. We have it as an awareness of the  great contribution that the Jewish community has given to this country  from before its birth through today in education and culture, and of  that culture, how much the American people do not know about the  richness of the family traditions and the like that the Jewish  community brings to us.   It is often said, maybe just in passing, that we are a Judeo- Christian society, but many people miss that that small minority  represents a great part of who we are as a nation.   As we observe this month, we need to observe this month recognizing  the amazing contribution that, as Representative Debbie Wasserman  Schultz said, we, in fact, are talking about 2 percent of the  population who does far more than you would begin to believe 2 percent  can do, Mr. Speaker.   I want to make sure that we all understand that the importance of  this month is the importance of the contribution of this community to  our society for over 200 years.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this should be the kind of resolution that would be a  given, but it is never a given until you say it and say it and say it  again.   We say--and we must say--``never again'' about the Holocaust, but we  also must say that anti-Semitism has no place in this great country of  freedom.   Mr. Speaker, you cannot have freedom of religion unless you have  freedom of all religions, and freedom of religion isn't simply that I  can practice my religion and denounce the other or that I can have  slurs about the other. Religious freedom is the acceptance that we have  a God or the right to not have a God, and in so doing, we must accept  the other person's limited changes.   There is so little difference between the beliefs of the Jewish  community and the beliefs of all of America that those differences  should unite us in their smallness rather than divide us.   America, like every country in the world, needs to get to know its  neighbor. This is the month in which we get to know our neighbor.   Mr. Speaker, if you are fortunate enough to have a Jewish neighbor or  a Jewish friend or someone who can help you understand the richness of  their culture and their religion, then you are very fortunate. If you  are not, then you need to seek one out.   That is why we are doing this here today, because it doesn't happen  without being said and said again. We say, one last time, never again  to anti-Semitism in America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this resolution, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
