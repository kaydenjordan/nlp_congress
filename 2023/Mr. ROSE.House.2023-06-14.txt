 Madam Speaker, today I rise in opposition to President  Biden's and the extreme Green New Deal Democrats' attempts to ban gas  stoves and cooking appliances. I rise in support of H.R. 1615 and H.R.  1640, which would extinguish this egregious abuse of power.   Madam Speaker, natural gas stoves are currently the preferred cooktop  appliance for nearly 40 percent of American households. In fact, nearly  187 million Americans use natural gas because it is a relatively  affordable and reliable source of energy.   As Americans have been facing the gripping reality of surging prices  for almost everything, thanks to the reckless and out-of-control  spending of President Biden and Congressional Democrats, the last thing  they need is to be forced to spend an additional $1,068 per year from  using only electric appliances.   During debate, Democrats will say, and have said that no one is  trying to take away your gas stoves. That couldn't be any further from  the truth.   In fact, a recent CNN headline read: ``New York becomes the first  state to ban natural gas stoves and furnaces in most new buildings.''   While discussing gas stoves in January of this year, Consumer Product  Safety Commissioner Richard Trumka, Jr., said: ``Any option is on the  table,'' meaning that banning gas stoves was certainly a potential  option.   A month later, in February, seemingly following the Consumer Product  Safety Commission's lead, the U.S. Department of Energy issued a  proposed rule that, if finalized, would set maximum annual energy  consumption standards for electric and gas cooking tops manufactured  and sold into commerce.   This proposed rule would have an estimated cost of $183.4 million for  manufacturers that will need to comply with the new standards. Somehow,  the administration tentatively concluded that the new standards would  be ``technologically feasible and economically justified.''   Give me a break.   Now, Madam Speaker, gas stoves in my home State of Tennessee may not  be as common as they are in some other States. Given our relatively  affordable electricity rates and our historical reliance on other forms  of energy, Tennessee's use of gas stoves accounts for only 20.4 percent  of households in our State. But even though only one in five Tennessee  households use a gas stove, the Tennessee State legislature passed, and  the Governor signed into law, legislation that prohibits local  governments from banning gas stoves. As a result, no localities in the  Volunteer State have pursued this ill-guided policy.   All of this to say, Americans should be allowed the freedom to make  this decision for themselves. The last thing they need is the Federal  Government coming into their kitchen and telling them what appliances  they should be using. Not only is it extremely costly and ineffective  but it is another step toward becoming a socialist nanny state.   Lastly, Green New Deal Democrats in favor of banning gas stoves claim  that it will save the environment and help reduce greenhouse gas  emissions. The truth is that homes with natural gas appliances emit 22  percent less CO2 than all electric homes.   Madam Speaker, let's call this what it is: a blatant overreach and  abuse of power by Green New Deal Democrats and the power-hungry Biden  administration.   Thankfully, House Republicans are taking action to protect America's  freedom to choose for themselves whether a gas stove is the best choice  for their needs by passing H.R. 1615, the Gas Stove Protection and  Freedom Act, and H.R. 1640, the Save Our Gas Stoves Act.   It is a shame that we have to take these types of actions to push  back against an overly aggressive regulatory state led by the Biden  administration.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, the Securities and Exchange Commission--not  the social and environmental commission--has proposed a rule that would  require small farmers in America who sell their products to large,  [[Page H2902]]  public companies to potentially have to calculate and report their  total climate-related risks, including their emissions.   This proposed rule would upend the entire agricultural economy and  impose a tremendous added cost to farmers who put food on our tables  and subsequently to all of us who eat that food.   Congress never gave the Securities and Exchange Commission the  authority to enact regulations regarding the environment or climate,  but the Biden administration has been adamant about carrying out their  progressive agenda nevertheless.   That is why we are working to put an end to out-of-control government  and Washington bureaucrats by passing the REINS Act.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in voting ``yes'' on  this legislation so that Congress can go back to being the necessary  check on these rogue officials just as our Founders intended.                            ____________________
