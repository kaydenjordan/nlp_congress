 Mr. Speaker, I oppose H.R. 38, the Concealed  Carry Reciprocity Act.   While I am opposed to restricting law abiding citizens' access to  firearms, I feel that this bill does not adequately address many of the  requirements that states have instituted in passing their own concealed  carry laws.   I am a big supporter of concealed carry and was the lead author of a  bill in 1991 in the State Senate to create local concealed carry. The  way this bill is written would strip many protections that are  currently afforded to Texans.   Texas has many requirements for a person to be able to get that  license including live-fire training. As a state, we also bar convicted  domestic abusers and those convicted of violent crimes and stalking.  Under this bill, an individual who had committed those crimes could  conceal carry their weapon in Texas if they got their permit from a  neighboring state that lacked these requirements for concealed carry  like Mississippi. It is for these reasons that I do not support this  bill as it is currently written.   If we are going to create a federal reciprocity standard for  concealed carry it should be a standard that takes into account many of  the protections individual states have created. I would proudly vote in  support of a bill that addressed these standing issues.
