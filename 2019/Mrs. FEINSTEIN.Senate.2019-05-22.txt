 Mr. President, I wish to speak about the wonderful  spirit and dedication of Ellen Tauscher, who was taken from us far too  early on April 29, 2019. She was a one of a kind of person and very  special to me.   Ellen is survived by her daughter Katherine, who is an amazing young  woman. I have seen her through some of the most difficult days and she  has an equanimity and an ability second to none. Ellen's sisters Sally  and Kathy and brother Jack provided very strong family support to her,  especially at the end. She is truly loved.   Ellen touched so many lives, and anybody who has worked with her, had  dinner with her, drank a little California wine with her knows the  special person she is.   Ellen was one of the first women and the youngest woman ever at the  age of 25 to become a member of the New York Stock Exchange in 1977.   I was president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors at that  time, and I can tell you, being a woman on the Stock Exchange at that  time was a very big deal.   Ellen was to go on to work in finance for 14 years as a successful  investment banker and bond trader.   A few years after she moved west, Ellen gave birth to her pride and  joy, the wonderful Katherine Tauscher. As a new mother herself, Ellen  struggled to find good childcare, and she used that experience to  create the ChildCare Registry, a service to help parents check  backgrounds of childcare centers.   You see, that was how she was. When she saw a problem, she worked out  a solution. When Ellen Tauscher put her mind to something, there was no  stopping her. Achievement was a given.   Ellen ran for a seat in Congress in 1996. The newly created district  was conservative, and few people thought it would go to a Democrat, but  Ellen appealed to moderates on both sides of the aisle, and success, I  always thought, was a given. She went on to win that seat and hold it  for 12 years.   As a Member of Congress, Ellen made a name for herself as a centrist,  someone who could work both sides of the aisle. Her colleagues, many of  whom attended the memorial service earlier this week at the National  Cathedral, knew she would always do what was best for her district and  for the country.   Ellen sat on the House Armed Services Committee and became chair of  the Strategic Forces Subcommittee. Not necessarily what you would  expect from an elementary education major from New Jersey, but Ellen  was a real force.   She developed an expertise and substantial knowledge in arms control,  nonproliferation, and nuclear weapons. It was a good fit since her  district was home to Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.   That expertise and the ability to be effective in a critically  important post was a big reason why then-Secretary of State Clinton  selected her and President Obama nominated her to be Undersecretary of  State for Arms Control and International Security.   One of Ellen's biggest accomplishments in that role was shepherding  the negotiations over the New START Treaty and helping with its  ratification through the Senate in 2010.   As a matter of fact, it was at her suggestion that former Senator Jon  Kyl and I went to Geneva under the auspices of the Senate National  Security Working Group to observe the negotiations and meet with the  Russian and U.S. delegations. Ellen was so proud of the treaty, and so  are we.   She proved just how strong she was during this most difficult period.  She did much of her work on the treaty while suffering from esophageal  cancer, but she never let it slow her down. When she retired from the  Federal Government, a new world would open.   She was appointed by Governor Jerry Brown to the University Of  California Board Of Regents, she chaired California's Military Advisory  Council, and she served as vice chair of the Atlantic Council's  Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security.   Just last year, she showed she was still a player in California  politics, working with Katie Merrill to create a Political Action  Committee called Fight Back, and that was just what Ellen did.   Ellen was brilliant. She was warm and loyal to her country, her  family, and her friends, and she had a wonderful sense of humor. I saw  this constantly over a glass of wine and dinner in Washington. She was  always ready with something that made friends smile and even laugh.   She was, for me, a best friend, and that will never change. Thank  you.                            ____________________
