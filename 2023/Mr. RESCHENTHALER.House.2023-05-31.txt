 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Rules  Committee for being generous in yielding me this time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and in support of  the underlying legislation.   Today, the House is taking historic steps to address our Nation's  out-of-control debt. This House Republican win rescinds $28 billion in  unobligated COVID funds. It cuts over $2 trillion in government  spending. It reins in the executive branch, and it rejects the  President's extreme $5 trillion in proposed tax increases.   Further, this legislation will help lift Americans out of poverty and  grow our economy by cutting red tape and streamlining energy and  infrastructure projects.   H.R. 3746 also includes an important provision championed by House  Republicans, and that is to complete the Mountain Valley Pipeline. MVP  is near completion, but the last 14 miles--there are just 14 miles  left--are being held up by extreme radical, far-left judges.   When completed, this pipeline will help reduce costs for hardworking  Americans in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia. It will  simultaneously help the economies of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and West  Virginia with thousands of construction jobs and millions of dollars in  royalty payments, just in Pennsylvania alone. It will be $150 million a  year in royalty payments just to Pennsylvania alone, and it will lead  to direct investment in rural communities.   Mr. Speaker, I support the rule and the underlying legislation. I  urge my colleagues to do the same.
