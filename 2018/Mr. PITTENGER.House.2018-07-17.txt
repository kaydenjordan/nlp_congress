 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  House amendment to the JOBS and Investor Confidence Act. This bill that  was cosponsored with my good friend, Keith Ellison from Minnesota, is  part of 32 combined bills.    Our bill, the Credit Accuracy and Inclusion Act, will allow 100  million Americans to gain better access to credit. That is what this  bill is all about. Just think about it: an individual now can take  their rent payment, their car payment, and their utility payment and  use that to apply toward increasing their better credit application to  the credit reporting agencies.   Mr. Speaker, I commend this bill. This is important for our economy,  and it is important for the American people to be able to go out in the  market and acquire what they need to acquire in homes and cars to build  their own wealth.   So I thank the leadership, I thank Mr. Hensarling, and I thank Ms.  Waters for her leadership in this bill, and I commend them for this  bipartisan effort.
