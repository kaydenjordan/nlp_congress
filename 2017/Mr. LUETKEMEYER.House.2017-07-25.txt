 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Buck) for his help in quickly bringing this resolution to the  floor.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and the  underlying resolution, which would block the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau from denying the American people the use of  arbitration as a means to resolve consumer complaints.   Since the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,  consumer costs have gone up and access to financial products has been  severely restricted. In some cases, access has evaporated altogether.   The Bureau's arbitration rule is proof of what we have said for  years: the CFPB does not operate in the best interest of American  consumers. It does not protect the American people, their access to  financial products, or their ability to achieve financial independence.   Take as evidence the CFPB's own study on arbitration. It shows that  just 13 percent of class action suits actually provided a benefit to  consumers, with an average payout of $32. Let me say that again: an  average payout of $32.   Arbitration, on the other hand, provides an average of more than  $5,000--let me say that again: over $5,000--to the aggrieved parties.   Again, these figures come from the Bureau's own analysis, their own  study. The fact that they cannot somehow justify this rule in the name  of consumer protection should offend every single person on this floor  today, Madam Speaker.   Simply put, this rule is anticonsumer. It hurts the very people the  CFPB purports to protect. It is yet another example of the Washington- knows-best attitude that makes the American people so mad.   This is also why Congress has the oversight tools granted under the  Congressional Review Act. In this instance, it is time for Congress to  intervene on behalf of the people we represent.   We have argued about the CFPB in the past, but the reality is that  this rule, in particular, will have devastating consequences for  American consumers. It should serve as a dramatic wake-up call for the  need to restrain what is the most powerful and  [[Page H6231]]  unaccountable government agency in the history of our Nation.   I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus) and Chairman  Hensarling for their steadfast leadership on this very important issue.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues for their support on the rule and  the underlying measure.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this resolution which would  block the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from denying the  American people use of arbitration as a means to resolve consumer  complaints.   I went to the CFPB website last night, and the first thing I saw  read: ``We are the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a U.S.  Government agency that makes sure banks, lenders, and other financial  companies treat you fairly.''   If we handed out grades to government agencies based on their ability  to meet a mission statement, the CFPB would most decidedly receive an  F. That is because the Bureau's arbitration rule does absolutely  nothing to ensure that consumers are treated fairly. In fact, this rule  is proof of what House Republicans have said for years: the CFPB does  not operate in the best interests of the American consumers.   The Bureau's own study, which we have cited several times already and  will continue to cite, shows that arbitration helps consumers and that  the alternatives are far less successful.                                time  1545    Mr. Speaker, the truth of the matter is that this rule is  anticonsumer. It hurts the very people the CFPB is supposed to protect,  and it is yet another example of Washington bureaucrats looking out for  their friends instead of the American people.   Today, this body will cast a vote to ensure U.S. consumers are  treated fairly and that they have the tools necessary to get the best  possible settlement in their case.   Mr. Speaker, if the CFPB can't adhere to a simple mission statement  and provide actual consumer protections, Congress will do it for them.   I want to again thank Chairman Hensarling and the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus) for their leadership on this issue and so  many more issues that impact consumers.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California.

Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. McEachin), a member of the House Armed  Services Committee.   Mr. McEACHIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this resolution, which would stack the  deck against hardworking families, small businesses, and nearly any  group or individual who needs financial services.   Mr. Speaker, universal access to fair and impartial courts is a  principle that is enshrined in both the Sixth and Seventh Amendments of  our Constitution. It is the cornerstone of our justice system. Without  that access, we cannot hold bad actors accountable; families and small  businesses suffer; justice is denied.   Forced arbitration clauses protect the powerful by denying Americans  their day in court. Big corporations have enormous leverage. They offer  essential services and have few competitors.   For many consumers, having a cell phone or a checking account means  accepting arbitration. Often there are no other options.   The CFPB has sought to correct that injustice. The Bureau's  arbitration rule ensures that those who are wronged by a financial  institution have meaningful recourse. At Wells Fargo and elsewhere,  recent events have shown why that recourse is essential.   When our courts are out of the picture, accountability can slip;  cutting corners becomes less risky and more attractive.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to oppose this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright), a member of the Committee  on Appropriations and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Capuano), a Member who is outraged by  the attack on consumers by the opposite side of the aisle.    Mr. Speaker, that is what arbitration is all about,  to allow the individual to defend himself.  [[Page H6277]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I am now prepared to  close, and I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, today we have heard Democrats speak about the importance  of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's rule to stop forced  arbitration clauses in contracts for consumer financial products and  the harm that would result from this joint resolution to repeal the  rule.   Forced arbitration clauses severely limit consumers' legal rights and  prevent groups of consumers from holding financial institutions  accountable for wrongdoing. The Consumer Bureau's rule helps to ensure  that financial institutions are held accountable and fully protects the  legal rights of consumers, including servicemembers and veterans.   The majority has shamefully moved to nullify the Consumer Bureau's  good work in a move that ultimately enables financial institutions to  get off the hook when they commit wrongdoing, with less redress for  consumers.   Studies have shown that forced arbitration favors big business and  results in less compensation for American consumers who have been  abused or defrauded, if they receive any at all.   This resolution steamrolls over the Consumer Bureau's sensible rule  without regard for the harm that will result for American consumers and  families. This is also despite the broad support for the rule from  consumer advocacy, civil rights, and faith-based groups, legal  scholars, and advocates for servicemembers.   Congress must not curtail the legal rights of consumers, must not  repeal the Consumer Bureau's forced arbitration rule. Vote to protect  consumer rights. Vote to fully restore the American principle of right  to trial by jury. Vote ``no'' on H.J. Res. 111.   Mr. Speaker, I would simply like to say that I keep hearing my  colleagues talk about how fast consumers are taken care of under the  arbitration rule. Yes, because they are getting railroaded.   As I mentioned, they are in the back room without representation.  These are people who have been forced to sign these arbitration  agreements, not even knowing that they signed them.   Most people who go out now to get a credit card or to get a loan of  some kind, they are forced into these agreements and they don't even  know it. They are shocked and surprised when they cannot join with  others who have been ripped off in class action lawsuits.   So don't pay attention to all of the information that you have  received from the opposite side. Remember that the banks and big  businesses win 93.1 percent of the time, not consumers.   Whose side are you on? Are you on the side of consumers or are you  protecting big business?   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling), the chairman of the Financial  Services Committee, and I think we are going to have some answers to  those important questions that the ranking member just asked.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling), the chairman of the Financial  Services Committee, and I think we are going to have some answers to  those important questions that the ranking member just asked.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
