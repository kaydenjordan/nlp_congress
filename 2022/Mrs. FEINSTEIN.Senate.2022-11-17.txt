 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the  Respect for Marriage Act.   I was proud to introduce this bill earlier this summer with Senators  Baldwin, Collins, and Portman. I am greatly encouraged by yesterday's  bipartisan vote of 62 to 37 to advance the bill and continue moving  this important legislation forward.   The Respect for Marriage Act would guarantee legal protections for  millions of marriages in the United States by repealing the  discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act and ensuring that marriages  entered into legally are given full faith and credit by every State and  the Federal Government.   Simply put, Americans should be free to marry the person they love,  regardless of sexual orientation or race, without fear of  discrimination or fear that their marriages will be invalidated. This  is a straightforward bill. It merely codifies the existing requirement  that the Federal Government and every State recognize legal marriages.   In 2015, the Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that the  U.S. Constitution guarantees the right to marry for same-sex couples.  And 55 years ago, in Loving v. Virginia, the Supreme Court ruled that  ``the freedom to marry . . . a person of another race resides with the  individual, and cannot be infringed by the State.''   These decisions also reflect the will of the American people. Over  the past few decades, public support for same-sex marriage and  interracial marriage has grown exponentially. In fact, recent polls  have found that 71 percent of Americans support same-sex marriage and  94 percent approve of interracial marriages. This bill has been  endorsed by hundreds of organizations, including nonprofits,  corporations, and religious organizations that span the ideological  spectrum.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of endorsing  organizations be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  List of Organizations Supporting the Respect for Marriage Act--November                                  17, 2022         ABB, Abercrombie & Fitch Co., Accenture, ACLU, ADL (Anti-      Defamation League), ADL Austin Region, ADL Florida, ADL New       England, ADL New York/New Jersey, ADL San Diego, ADL       Southeast, ADL Southwest, ADL Texoma, Adobe Inc., AEO, Inc.,       AFL-CIO, Airbnb, Alaska Airlines, ALEPH: Alliance for Jewish       Renewal, AllianceBernstein.

I would like to applaud the House for passing the  Respect for Marriage Act with significant bipartisan support earlier  this summer. It is now the time for the Senate to do the same.   I would like to take a moment to speak to my Republican colleagues  who have said marriage equality is ``a nonissue'' right now. Some of my  Senate colleagues have said things like: It's the law of the land, so  passing legislation is not a good use of Congress's time.   As we saw this summer with the Supreme Court's decision to overturn  Roe v. Wade, hard-fought rights are still always vulnerable to repeal.  We must also remember that in a concurring opinion to the Roe v. Wade  repeal, one Supreme Court Justice explicitly called for the Court to  reconsider and overturn Obergefell. We must act now so that no matter  what happens in the courts, married same-sex and interracial couples  are protected.   Overturning Obergefell and Loving would return the country to a  patchwork of State laws where couples could be subject to State- sanctioned discrimination. Many States still have bans on same-sex  marriages on the books that would immediately take effect if marriage  equality were overturned.   I would also like to touch on how far-reaching the legal  ramifications of overturning Obergefell and Loving would be. Without  the Respect for Marriage Act, if a married same-sex or interracial  couple lived in a State that decided to ban their union, their marriage  could be invalidated. Even if a couple lived in a State that permitted  same-sex or interracial marriage, that marriage could be deemed invalid  if they were able to travel to a State that did not have marriage  equality.   Invalidated marriages would also give rise to a host of legal  concerns for couples who relied on the ability to marry when making  major life and family planning decisions. For example, spouses may no  longer be able to make important healthcare decisions or even visit  their partners in the hospital. Nonbirthing parents may no longer have  parental rights over their children. There would be some serious  confusion about Federal and State tax violations and tax laws could be  arbitrarily and discriminatorily applied.   The Respect for Marriage Act will ensure that all legally married  couples are afforded the same protections, regardless of where they  live, providing security and peace of mind to millions of families.   I spent decades advocating for equality. As a supervisor and mayor of  San Francisco during the height of the gay rights movement, I witnessed  the terrible pain and trauma that resulted from hateful discrimination.  I watched firsthand as the LGBT community fought for legal  recommendation of their lives, their relationships, and their personal  dignity. We cannot return to a system that allows bigotry and hate.  Bigotry and discrimination have no place in this society. No one should  have to live not knowing whether their marriage will suddenly become  invalid.   This bill will give families the peace of mind and security that  comes with knowing that their valid marriages will remain legally  protected under Federal law.   I want to thank Senators Baldwin, Collins, Portman, Sinema, and  Tillis for their leadership on this important  [[Page S6755]]  issue. I encourage the rest of my colleagues to please join us in  supporting the passage of the bill.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
