 Madam Speaker, I rise with my colleagues from the State  of Colorado to honor the 10 precious lives lost at the King Soopers  grocery store in my congressional district in Boulder, Colorado, on  March 22nd.   There are no words to express how the Boulder community is feeling in  the wake of this tragedy. Our hearts are broken. The loss of life is  truly heartbreaking and unimaginable. Ten lives taken too soon;  daughters, sons, neighbors, spouses, coworkers, community members, each  of whom left a profound impact on our community: Officer Eric Talley,  Denny, Neven, Rikki, Tralona, Suzanne, Teri, Kevin, Lynn, and Jody.  Today, may we remember them and honor them as we lift their names and  express our deepest condolences to their families.   I hope everyone in the House will now join me for a moment of  silence.
