 Mr. President, I would like to take the  opportunity to express my appreciation to Sophia for her hard work as  an intern in the Committee on Environment and Public Works. I recognize  her efforts and contributions to my office, as well as to the State of  Wyoming.   Sophia is a native of Virginia. She is a student at Virginia  Polytechnic and State University, where she is studying political  science and foreign affairs. She has demonstrated a strong work ethic,  which has made her an invaluable asset to our office. The quality of  her work is reflected in her great efforts over the last several  months.   I want to thank Sophia for the dedication she has shown while working  for me and my staff. It was a pleasure to have her as part of our team.  I know she will have continued success with all of her future  endeavors. I wish her all my best on her next journey.                            ____________________
