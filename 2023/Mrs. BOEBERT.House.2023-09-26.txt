 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, this amendment decreases the salary of the  Deputy Under Secretary of the Food and Nutrition Service.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, one moment. My apologies. I do not have  amendment No. 77 in front of me, but, Madam Chair, I urge adoption of  amendment No. 77 to be considered to decrease the salary of the Deputy  Under Secretary.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Harris).                                time  0130     Madam Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment that  utilizes the Holman rule to reduce the salary of Deputy Under Secretary  of the Food and Nutrition Services of the Department of Agriculture,  Stacy Dean, to $1.   As the Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition, and Consumer  Services at USDA, Ms. Dean has spent her career helping bureaucrats use  loopholes and gimmicks to gut requirements for able-bodied adults and  bypass Federal eligibility requirements, even going as far as to help  States make millionaires qualify for the program.   The last thing Americans need are higher prices, fewer jobs, and the  largest expansion of our welfare State in a lifetime. The Biden-Harris  administration expansion of the welfare State abolishes work ethic and  promotes a new generation of government dependency.   I have lived under government dependency, and I am thankful that I  have broken free of that cycle given my life experiences and developing  work ethic. I am one of the few who was able to break free of that  cycle of dependency.   Stacy Dean, without Congressional approval, unilaterally increased  Title IV of future farm bills by no less than $256 billion. Stacy Dean  has spent her life's work concocting ways to expand the welfare State  and was given latitude to do so under the Biden administration with no  consequence, no oversight, and no boundaries. No amount of endless  government checks can address the underlying challenges families face.   The best way to help American families is with good-paying jobs, not  endless government checks.   Madam Chair, 25 years ago in the face of rising welfare caseloads,  long durations in poverty, and no work for millions, Republicans and  Democrats came together to reform the Nation's welfare system.   These reforms were based on one simple idea: The best way out of  poverty is a job. Even the Bible says if you don't work, you don't eat.   Ms. Dean has also allowed a 25 percent increase to food stamp  benefits, which was not only unprecedented, but abandoned the cost- neutral policy the Department had followed for 45 years.   Madam Chair, 25 years ago, in the face of rising welfare caseloads,  long durations in poverty, and no work for millions, we said this was  enough. That cannot be reiterated enough.   This move displayed Dean's blatant disregard for program transparency  by failing to even consult USDA's own chief economist. Worse yet, this  move went far beyond Congressional authority granted under the 2018  farm bill, all thanks to Ms. Dean.   Ms. Dean even went as far as to expand woke LGBTQ+ free school lunch  policies absent Congressional approval and direction.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and hold  Ms. Dean accountable for going rogue in an administration that has  ignored the direction of Congress.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment to  prohibit funding for the USDA's Equity Commission.   Our farmers and ranchers are fed up with a government that is  weaponized against them and are fed up paying for commissions that  simply should not exist.   The USDA Equity Commission was born out of a Biden executive order  [[Page H4555]]  calling for Federal departments to address, ``racial equity,'' because  they believe even agriculture is racist.   This Commission made over 30 recommendations to make the USDA more  woke. This includes diversity training for farmers and ranchers,  expanding language access, and even supporting legislation that removes  restrictions on food stamp eligibility based on immigration status, or  even criminal records.   This commission also opened up the door for Joe Biden's racist $4  billion plan for minority farmers and ranchers to pay their loans  because the USDA is racist.   Joe Biden's USDA is even holding school lunch money hostage to force  a curriculum that sexualizes our children. This administration is  acting like a schoolyard bully, saying, if you are not going to do what  I want, I am going to take your lunch money. Quite literally.   They are holding school districts hostage in order to shove their  radical agenda down our throats to ensure biological men are allowed to  use the same restroom as five-year-old girls. This is madness.   This administration is so distracted by pandering to their own  leftist agenda to prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion that they  simply cannot manage their policies that have driven the price of milk  and eggs up over 50 percent for the average American family for those  items.                                time  0140    Let's return our focus to our USDA to what it should be--providing  leadership on food, agriculture, natural resources, rural development,  nutrition, and related issues based on public policy, the best  available science--real science, please--and effective management, not  pandering to the woke mob.   I urge passage of my amendment and, Madam Chair, I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Harris).    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment that  prevents USDA from using funds for woke extreme leftist courses, books,  and study guides as part of this administration's woke LGBTQI+-- whatever other letter you would like to add for the flavor of the day-- Pride Month agenda.   Biden's woke bureaucrats implemented woke courses, books, and study  guides for Department employees' training that defy congressional  intent and mandate leftist indoctrination.   Mandated Department courses and curriculum for the Federal employees  included topics like Pride Leadership: Strategies for LGBTQ+ Leader to  be the King Or Queen of Their Jungle; the Queer Advantage:  Conversations with LGBTQ+ Leaders on the Power of Identity; Out and  Proud: Approaching LGBT Issues in the Workplace; Gender Ambiguity in  the Workplace: Transgender and Gender-Diverse Discrimination; Lesbian,  Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ+) Program.   In total, there were more than 20 different LGBTQI+--add your  letter--training sessions and courses required by USDA that cower to  the left's woke indoctrination policies, defy congressional intent, and  contradict the agency's mission.   Federal employees devoted to public service shouldn't be forced to  participate in extreme training sessions that contradict their own  values.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment and prevent Federal  employees from being forced to participate in extreme training sessions  for the purpose of pandering to a woke agenda.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, maybe the USDA should spend their time  educating those on how to tell the difference between a heifer and a  bull. Maybe then we can actually bring some common sense to this topic.   Also, I would like to note that my colleague on the other side of the  aisle, the gentleman, failed to mention some letters when referencing  the LGBTQI+ community, which is not very inclusive for their party's  agenda. I just wanted the record to reflect that there definitely were  some letters missing from that description, which is extremely  offensive.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
