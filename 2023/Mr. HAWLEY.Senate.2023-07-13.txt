 Mr. President, had I been there for the recorded  vote, I would have voted no on the confirmation of Executive Calendar  No. 114, Kalpana Kotagal, of Ohio, to be a Member of the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission for a term expiring July 1, 2027; the  motion to invoke cloture on Executive Calendar No. 141, David M.  Uhlmann, of Michigan, to be an Assistant Administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency; and the motion to invoke cloture on  Executive Calendar No. 21, Rachel Bloomekatz, of Ohio, to be United  States Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit.                            ____________________
