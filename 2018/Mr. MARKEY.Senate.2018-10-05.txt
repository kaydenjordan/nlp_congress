 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that three  letters and a news article related to allegations against Judge  Kavanaugh be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                       Kaplan Hecker & Fink LLP,       Re Nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh.                                   New York, NY, September 26, 2018.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      Member, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Grassley,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.         Dear Senators Feinstein and Grassley: We have been retained       to act as counsel for Elizabeth Rasor. As you are no doubt       aware, Ms. Rasor was quoted in an article by Ronan Farrow and       Jane Mayer in the New Yorker published on September 23rd       regarding a conversation she had with Mark Judge potentially       relevant to the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the       United States Supreme Court.        Ms. Rasor's recollection of what occurred is stated       accurately in the New Yorker piece and she would welcome the       opportunity to share this information with agents of the FBI       as part of a re-opened background investigation. In the event       that that does not occur, although Ms. Rasor does not welcome       the unwanted attention that would inevitably result if she       were to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, she       believes that it is her duty as a citizen to tell the truth       about what happened.        Accordingly, please contact me at your earliest possible       convenience to make appropriate arrangements.            Very truly yours,      Roberta Kaplan, Esq.                                   ____                                               Kaiser Dillon PLLC,                                 Washington, DC, September 26, 2018.      Hon. Chuck Grassley,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate.        Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein: My       firm represents Deborah Ramirez, as does the law firm of       Hutchinson Black and Cook, LLC. As you likely know, a       reporter recently reached out to Ms. Ramirez to ask her about       an incident involving Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump's       nominee for the United States Supreme Court. Ms. Ramirez       answered the reporter's questions, and he, after interviewing       a number of additional witnesses, wrote a story: https:// www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/senate-democrats- investigate-a-new-allegation-of-sexual-misconduct-from-the- supreme-court-nominee-brett-kavanaughs-college-years-deborah-  ramirez.        That story recounts that the reporter first learned of the       relevant incident from individuals other than Ms. Ramirez.       The reporter then approached Ms. Ramirez, who confirmed and       further described the incident. The reporter proceeded       independently to verify the story with other individuals,       including one who remembered contemporaneously learning of       the incident (including that it involved Mr. Kavanaugh and       Ms. Ramirez), and another who remembered contemporaneously       overhearing a student tearfully recounting what could only       have been the same incident.        Ms. Ramirez has asked that the FBI investigate further. She       has done so both by direct request (through counsel) to the       FBI, and by asking this Committee (again, through counsel) to       involve the FBI. Thus far, however, the Committee has       refused. This is illogical: An FBI investigation would allow       a credible, efficient, and professional development of the       facts--free from partisanship. This not only would best       protect Ms. Ramirez from being dragged into a political fray,       but also would best allow the Committee to learn those facts.       and thereby proceed in an informed manner. Ms. Ramirez asks       again: If the Committee cares about the facts with respect to       the incident she has described, it should ask the FBI to       investigate.        Ms. Ramirez is willing to cooperate with the Committee. To       that end, she--through counsel--repeatedly has asked the       Committee to speak with her about a process by which she       fairly can be heard by Committee members. But the majority       staff thus far has refused even to speak with Ms. Ramirez's       counsel; instead, that staff has insisted that Ms. Ramirez       first ``provide her evidence.'' Respectfully, that demand       misunderstands the process. Ms. Ramirez has not conducted an       investigation to gather materials that she now somehow can       present, gift-wrapped, to the Committee. She is not a       litigant, and she is not a partisan. Rather, she simply has       told her story, truthfully and as best she could, to a       reporter who asked. Indeed, the majority's confusion on this       issue underscores the need for an FBI investigation--that is       the organization that credibly could develop the additional       ``evidence'' the majority references. What Ms. Ramirez can       do--and all  [[Page S6671]]       that Ms. Ramirez can do--is simply tell what happened to her.        Ms. Ramirez has no agenda. She did not volunteer for this.       But nor has she, or will she, shy away from truthfully       recounting the facts. She asks only to be treated fairly. The       Committee should begin by allowing the FBI to investigate.            Sincerely,      William Pittard.                                   ____                                         Kaplan Hecker & Fink LLP,                                   New York, NY, September 27, 2018.      Re Nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh.       Hon. Diane Feinstein,      Member, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Grassley,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Feinstein and Grassley: As a follow up to my       letter of yesterday's date, we enclose an affidavit from Ms.       Rasor executed yesterday evening.            Very truly yours,      Roberta A. Kaplan.                                   ____                         Affidavit of Elizabeth Rasor         I, Elizabeth Rasor, being duly sworn, hereby depose and       say:        1.  I make this affidavit based on my personal knowledge.        2.  I have a bachelor's degree in English Literature from       Catholic University and a master's degree in Special       Education from Teacher's College at Columbia University.        3.  I first met Mark Judge in or around the fall of 1986       while we were both students at Catholic University.        4.  We engaged in a serious, romantic relationship for       approximately two years beginning in 1986 through 1988. We       dated exclusively during much of that time period and       attempted to reunite several times in the months afterwards       until I moved to New York from Washington, D.C. in 1989.        5.  While we were dating, I spent time with Mark's friends       from Georgetown Prep and attended a couple of social       gatherings at which they were present.        6.  I met Brett Kavanaugh at a couple of social gatherings       on or around 1987.        7.  Brett continued to socialize with Mark and their       friends from Georgetown Prep during this time.        8.  At the parties that Brett and Mark attended during this       period, there was frequent and wide-spread alcohol       consumption        9.  In or around 1988, in the context of a conversation we       had about how we lost our virginities, Mark told me, in a       voice that seemed to convey a degree of shame, about an       incident that had occurred a few years prior, where he and       several other boys from Georgetown Prep took turns having sex       with a woman who was drunk. It was Mark's perception that the       sexual activity was consensual.        10.  To the best of my recollection, at the time of the       conversation, I, and I believe Mark, were sober.        11.  After this initial conversation. Mark and I never       discussed this again.        12.  Mark did not share with me any names of other       individuals involved in this incident, and I do not have any       information to suggest, one way or another, that Brett was       one of them.        13.  Mark and I broke up towards the end of 1988.        14.  I last spoke with Mark in or around 2013. We met for       lunch at Georgetown University to catch up, and I brought my       son.        I solemnly swear or affirm under the penalties of perjury       that the matters set forth in this Affidavit are true and       correct to the best of my personal knowledge, information,       and belief.                                                   Elizabeth Rasor,      Sag Harbor, New York, September 26, 2018.         Sworn to before me this 26th day of September, 2018                                                 Lindsey Beckelman,      Notary public.                                   ____                        [From NBC News, Oct. 5, 2018]    The Battle Over Accusations Goes On as Kavanaugh Nomination Advances                            (By Heidi Przybyla)         Washington--As Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley,       R-Iowa, closed out his executive summary of allegations of       sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett       Kavanaugh, his staff called a former roommate of Deborah       Ramirez, the Yale classmate who has accused Kavanaugh of       exposing himself to her.        Jen Klaus, the former roommate, told NBC News that       committee staff members called her at 4:30 p.m. Thursday, put       her on speakerphone and asked about Ramirez's drinking       habits, whether there was a Yale student known for dropping       his pants and the party culture at Yale. She says they       suggested the allegation was a case of mistaken identity.        ``It just gave me the impression they were suggesting       perhaps it was (another classmate) who threw his penis in her       face instead of Brett. Why would they be asking me this?''       said Klaus, who now resides in Brookline, Massachusetts.        In a statement to NBC News, the committee's press       secretary, George Hartmann, said that ``no suggestion of       mistaken identity was made. The committee has received       numerous tips and asked Ms. Klaus for information she could       provide one way or the other.''        ``To say otherwise would not only be inaccurate, it would       also call into question the motivations of the individual       doing so,'' Hartmann added.        The FBI's supplemental background investigation into       allegations against Kavanaugh included interviews with nine       individuals and the results were sent to the White House and       Senate Thursday morning. Grassley's summary said that       committee staffers talked to 35 individuals.        Kavanaugh has strongly denied the allegations and his       confirmation appears to have the votes to pass on Saturday       after Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.,       said they would support him late Friday afternoon.        Two former Yale classmates say they have made several       attempts to share text messages raising questions about       whether Kavanaugh tried to squash the New Yorker story that       made Ramirez's accusations public--and say the FBI did not       respond to their calls and written submissions to its web       portal.        The text messages involve one potential eyewitness to the       incident and the wife of another potential eyewitness.        The texts are a conversation between Kathy Charlton and a       mutual friend of Kavanaugh's who, NBC has confirmed, was       identified to the FBI by Ramirez as an eyewitness to the       incident. NBC News has received no response to multiple       attempts to reach the alleged eyewitness for comment. The       story detailing Ramirez's accusation was published in The New       Yorker on Sept. 23. Charlton told NBC News that, in a phone       conversation three days earlier, the former classmate told       her Kavanaugh had called him and advised him not to say       anything ``bad'' if the press were to call.        Then on September 21, according to the texts, that same       person sent Charlton a text accusing her of disclosing their       conversation to a reporter. ``Helllllloooo. Don't F******       TELL PEOPLE BRETT GOT IN TOUCH WITH ME!!! I TOLD YOU AT THE       TIME THAT WAS IN CONFIDENCE!!!''         9/21/18, 12:34PM        To: Kathy Charlton        From: [REDACTED]        Did you get to go through the biz plan and see [REDACTED]       notes?        Helllllloooooooo        Don't F[REDACTED] TELL PEOPLE BRETT GOT IN TOUCH WITH ME!!!        I TOLD YOU AT THE TIME THAT WAS IN CONFIDENCE!! AND        [REDACTED] CALLS ME. WTF!         ``From the content and all capital letters of the text (the       alleged witness) seemed to feel that there was a great deal       at stake for Brett if Brett's fears of exposure ever became       public,'' Charlton wrote in a statement to the FBI shared       with Grassley's office on Oct. 4.        Charlton is not the only former Yale classmate of       Kavanaugh's to indicate the nominee and his team were active       in reaching out to their social group ahead of publication of       The New Yorker story. NBC News has reported that a memo to       the FBI, drafted by Kerry Berchem, questioned whether       Kavanaugh ``and/or'' his friends ``may have initiated an       anticipatory narrative'' as early as July to ``conceal or       discredit'' Ramirez.        Both women stressed that they don't know the whole story       and are drawing no conclusions but are baffled as to why they       were never interviewed by the FBI or Judiciary staff.        Both say they have made numerous attempts to reach the FBI.       Thursday night, after Grassley pronounced the investigation       complete, Berchem sent her third email to Mike Davis, the       chief counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee, pleading       for him speak with her. Similar to his responses to previous       emails, Davis noted that her information was forwarded to the       investigative staff. Berchem shared the exchange with NBC       News.        Hartmann, the committee press secretary, said ``it would be       a lie to say committee investigators did not interview Ms.       Berchem. Committee investigators spoke at length with Ms.       Berchem on Oct. 3. Committee investigators also extensively       reviewed information provided by Ms. Berchem.''        Berchem told NBC News that she has had one call with a       committee staff member to whom she gave a brief overview of       her concerns but was not interviewed.        Hartmann also said the committee received correspondence       from Charlton. ``In her letter, Ms. Charlton asked the       committee to review her exchange, which the committee did,       and said the committee should feel free to contact her if       there were any questions,'' Hartmann said. ``After evaluating       the information provided, the committee's professional       investigators did not see a need for a follow-up call.''                                  THE TEXTS         The efforts by the two women have continued even as       Republicans like Grassley insist that the investigation of       the accusations against Kavanaugh is complete.        Berchem sent to the FBI some of 51 screen shots of text       messages she exchanged with her friend, Karen Yarasavage, the       wife of Kevin Genda, another alum Ramirez identified as an       eyewitness, to explain why Kavanaugh and his friends should       be asked whether they anticipated a story about Ramirez as       early as July.        Ramirez identified to the FBI Dave Todd, Kevin Genda and       Dave White as eyewitnesses who were in the room during the       alleged incident, according to a source familiar with the       investigation.        In July, as the Washington Post quietly researched a story       on a woman accusing  [[Page S6672]]       Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct while they were in high       school, Berchem said she received what she presumed was a       misfired text from Yarasavage.        The text suggests that Kavanaugh's closest Yale friends and       those Ramirez later identified as witnesses were searching       for an old 1997 wedding party photo that includes themselves,       as well as Ramirez and Kavanaugh, all smiling together.        The July 16 text notes that ``Whitey,'' or Dave White, sent       a 1997 wedding party photo to the Washington Post. Berchem is       not friends with White and assumed it was mistakenly sent to       her. The text came 10 days after Dr. Ford sent an anonymous       tip to the Washington Post's confidential tip line, according       to her testimony before the Senate.        ``Why was the 1997 photo retrieved and distributed to the       Washington Post at that time? Debbie's allegations against       Brett do not become public until September 23rd,'' writes       Berchem in her memo.        The Post did not publish its piece identifying Dr.       Christine Blasey Ford as the accuser until September.        In July, Yarasavage also began texting about an old       classmate whom neither was or is close to, Rick F. On July       16, Yarasavage texted Berchem noting she found a ``box of       college photos. Rick (F) etc.''        ``Neither of us knew him well in college. Does she actually       have photos of him?'' Berchem asked in her memo.        On Sept. 23, the day the New Yorker published Ramirez's       story accusing Kavanaugh of exposing himself, Yarasavage       returned to Rick F.: ``I thought I heard (he) pulled out his       unit once. Could she be so wildly mistaken??''        The subject, Rick, hadn't been at Yale in the 1983-84       school year. ``She concludes by appearing to insinuate that       Ms. Ramirez's memory may have been adversely impacted by       problems with her father,'' writes Berchem.        On the same day, Yarasavage also texted Berchem that she       was being contacted by ``Brett's guy'' and that ``Brett asked       me to go on the record'' regarding the New Yorker piece.        ``I believe that these September 23rd texts raise factual       issues, such as the contents of the conversation if it       occurred between Judge Kavanaugh and why (Yarasavage) seemed       to be encouraging a false `mistaken identity' theory       involving someone who wasn't at Yale at the time of the       alleged incident--that might merit the FBI's further       investigation,'' wrote Berchem. NBC News has received no       response to attempts to contact Yarasavage.     Madam President, I rise to speak in opposition to the  nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to serve as an Associate Justice on  the U.S. Supreme Court.   The vacancy that Judge Kavanaugh seeks to fill is not an ordinary  one. The retirement of Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy created  one of the most consequential vacancies on the High Court that this  country has ever seen. There is a reason why scholars and pundits refer  to the Supreme Court of the last 30 years as the ``Kennedy Court.'' His  influence on so many important cases cannot be overstated.   Throughout his three decades on the Supreme Court, Justice Kennedy  was often the swing vote in decisions decided 5 to 4 on a divided  Bench. After John Roberts became Chief Justice in 2005, Justice Kennedy  was the deciding vote in 92 percent of all cases decided by one vote.  Let me repeat that. Of the 203 cases decided by a 5-to-4 vote in the  John Roberts era, Justice Kennedy was the deciding vote in 186 of  them--92 percent.   The Justice who succeeds Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court will  have the opportunity to leave a deep and lasting mark on issues of the  highest magnitude. Any nominee to the Supreme Court carries  significance, but a nominee at this moment, for this seat, will play a  defining role in our Nation's history.    The constitutional obligation conferred on Senators to provide their  advice and consent on a Supreme Court nomination is a powerful, a  serious, and a sacred responsibility. As Senators, we are duty-bound to  determine whether Brett Kavanaugh is worthy of our trust. Even before  President Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, there  were serious concerns that his views were too extreme, that he lacked  the independence we seek in our judges, and that he had a difficult  relationship with the truth.   During the confirmation process for his current position on the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, Brett Kavanaugh made misleading  statements under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee on issues such  as the Bush administration's policies on torture, his involvement in  the nominations of controversial judges, and his knowledge about the  theft of emails from the Democratic staff of the Senate Judiciary  Committee.   Then, when it came time to fill Justice Kennedy's seat on the Supreme  Court, Judge Kavanaugh was hand-picked by the Federalist Society--an  ultraconservative group that is dedicated to installing far-right  judges on our Federal bench. The Federalist Society promised Donald  Trump that the judges on that list would support his partisan agenda if  they were elevated to the Supreme Court. Donald Trump repeatedly  assured his supporters about that agenda and promised them that he  would only appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who would overturn Roe  v. Wade and the Affordable Care Act. Let me restate that. Donald Trump  promised that he would only appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who  would overturn Roe v. Wade and the Affordable Care Act.   As to Brett Kavanaugh, the promises that Donald Trump and the  Federalist Society made were backed up by Kavanaugh's judicial record  on the DC Circuit.   As a Federal appeals court judge, Brett Kavanaugh wrote a dissenting  opinion that questioned Congress's authority to enact the Affordable  Care Act and suggested that the President could choose not to enforce  it.   Judge Kavanaugh would have blocked a lower court's order allowing an  undocumented minor to safely and legally terminate her pregnancy.   Judge Kavanaugh supported employers who sought to deny their  employees access to contraception.   Judge Kavanaugh wrote an opinion that unless guns were regulated  either at the time the Constitution was written or traditionally  throughout history, they could not be regulated now. He would have  struck down the District of Columbia's assault weapons ban because  assault weapons have not historically been banned.   How about 3D-downloaded guns? That was not in the original  Constitution. There was no 3D gun. Are we bound by what the Founding  Fathers thought about weapons or can we ourselves make a determination  here? He says no. It goes back to the time when the Constitution was  drafted or throughout history but not today. That is just wrong.   Judge Kavanaugh has consistently opposed strong environmental  protections and sought to restrict the authority of the Environmental  Protection Agency. He also authored a dissenting opinion that argued  that net neutrality rules were unconstitutional.   Time and again, on all of these issues--access to healthcare, gun  control, consumer and environmental protections, and a free and open  internet--Judge Kavanaugh has been a rubberstamp for a far-rightwing  agenda. Yet that is not the only reason President Trump chose Brett  Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court.   Judge Kavanaugh, who once served as Ken Starr's top deputy in the  investigation of President Clinton, has since written that a sitting  President should not be investigated for allegations of wrongdoing,  should not be indicted or tried while in office, and should not even  have to participate in civil legal proceedings until he leaves office.  This is a convenient reversal of a pro-investigation and pro-litigation  position that Kavanaugh held when a Democrat was in the White House. It  is a reversal that synchronizes very well with Donald Trump's  interests.   With Donald Trump under criminal investigation and with legal issues  arising from that investigation potentially headed to the Supreme Court  and with Brett Kavanaugh's having articulated strong views about  shielding a sitting President from criminal proceedings, his  confirmation is a constitutional crisis in the making. It is no  coincidence that a President who fears the long arm of the law would  nominate to the Supreme Court a jurist who would keep him from its  reach.   Brett Kavanaugh has left a lengthy paper trail on all of these hot- button issues. That is why President Trump and his allies closed ranks  and fought to keep so much of his record hidden from the American  public. Despite repeated requests from Senate Democrats for documents  relating to Brett Kavanaugh's service in the Bush White House, we--the  Members of the Senate--have only seen 7 percent of those records that  were, in fact, part of Kavanaugh's record inside the Bush White House,  and only about half of  [[Page S6673]]  that 7 percent are available to the public.    To put it another way, no Senator has seen 93 percent of all of Brett  Kavanaugh's work in the White House. That work includes reflections on  his views on the detention of enemy combatants, interrogation  techniques and the use of torture, warrantless wiretapping, and the  banning of same-sex marriage.   We on the Senate floor--and as we cast a vote today--do not have  access to any of those documents that he worked on while he served in  the Bush White House. How can we give advice before we vote on consent  if we can't even gain access to the documents which he himself handled  in the Bush White House and which he himself may have commented upon  during the time they were being considered? We have no access to it.  Ninety-three percent of all of the documents are not available to the  Members of the Senate. Even though there are reams of paper detailing  Brett Kavanaugh's involvement in these issues, his record on them  remains a blank slate for Senators.   To summarize, even before the events of the last 3 weeks, we knew a  lot of things about Brett Kavanaugh and yet, at the same time,  shockingly little about Brett Kavanaugh. We knew we had a blatantly  partisan person, but as you are trying to be nominated for the Supreme  Court, we--the Senators and the American public--have a right to know  what you think about issues. That is why every preceding nominee had to  provide all of the documentation, with the notable exception of Brett  Kavanaugh, who is denying us 93 percent.   This is happening with the acquiescence of the Trump White House and  the Republican leadership here in the Senate. No Member of the Senate,  Democrat or Republican, knows what is in the 93 percent of all of the  papers. No one knows. It is a deliberate coverup of all of those  documents so that we cannot know, so that the public cannot know. So we  begin with that--the 93 percent of all of his records in the White  House that are not accessible to us even though this nominee is given  to us from this White House. We know a lot, but there is much, much  more that we do not know.   We knew that we had a Federalist Society-approved nominee who would  overturn Roe and the Affordable Care Act. We knew we had a President  with a vested interest in finding a future Justice who could shield him  from legal jeopardy, and we knew that there was much else we didn't  know because that 93 percent was being hidden from public scrutiny. All  of these reasons alone were enough to warrant a ``no'' vote on Judge  Kavanaugh's lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court.   Then we learned of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford. Dr. Blasey Ford bravely  came forward to tell us about the Brett Kavanaugh she knew. She came  forward to share a deeply personal and traumatic experience of sexual  assault. Dr. Blasey Ford did not want to share this painful story with  the American public. She did not want to have her life upturned and  picked apart. She did not want to subject her family to harassment and  death threats. She did not want the President of the United States to  shamefully and appallingly mock her at a political rally, but she came  forward anyway. She came forward because she believed it was her civic  duty to do so.   From the beginning, it was clear that her allegations were credible.  She had recounted the painful experiences to her husband, in couples'  counseling, years before Brett Kavanaugh was ever considered for the  Supreme Court--something her therapist's contemporaneous notes  corroborate. Three days before Brett Kavanaugh was nominated, while his  name was publicly in play for the Supreme Court, Dr. Blasey Ford  reached out to her Congresswoman in the hope that she could help inform  President Trump as he decided on a nominee to fill Justice Kennedy's  seat.   Dr. Blasey Ford took a polygraph test to prove that she was truthful,  and she only shared her story publicly when reporters made it untenable  to remain silent. Every detail shows Dr. Blasey Ford to be consistent,  honest, and trustworthy. As hard as it was for her, Dr. Ford did our  country an invaluable service by coming forward, testifying before the  Senate, and telling the entire country her story.   Her testimony was powerful. It was heart-wrenching. When she spoke of  her strongest memory of the assault--the laughter of the two boys as  Brett Kavanaugh pinned her down--we felt her profound pain. When she  spoke of Brett Kavanaugh's covering her mouth as she tried to scream,  we felt her visceral fear. For countless women and men across the  country whose experiences mirror that of Dr. Blasey Ford's, this  testimony was their voice. For many of them, Dr. Blasey Ford's bravery  gave them the courage to come forward with their own stories of sexual  assault.   On the day of her testimony, my office received over 100 calls from  survivors who courageously shared with my staff the painful details of  their own assaults. Many of these men and women were telling their  stories for the first time. Women have stopped me at the airport and on  the street to tell me their stories.   Dr. Ford has given them the counsel to come forward so they can share  their own experiences. Dr. Ford's courage opened a wellspring of  emotion. I applaud her. We owe her a deep debt of gratitude. She was a  role model for all of us, for the children of the country, and for  future generations. She has given new meaning to what it means to be a  good citizen.   Dr. Ford was compelling. She was convincing. She was courageous. She  had nothing to gain and everything to lose. No reasonable, open-minded  person could have listened to Dr. Blasey Ford and concluded anything  other than that she is telling the truth about what happened between  her and Brett Kavanaugh.   Yet there are two sides to every story. What about the other side of  the story? What did Judge Brett Kavanaugh have to say about it after we  heard Dr. Ford testify before the Judiciary Committee? It was Judge  Kavanaugh's turn. What did we hear from Judge Kavanaugh? We heard  anger. We heard belligerence. We heard evasiveness. We heard  disrespect. Judge Kavanaugh's testimony before the Judiciary Committee  reinforced the old concerns about his credibility. He gave answers  about his behavior in high school, about supposed drinking games, and  about his yearbook page that simply defy credulity. Recent reports from  those who knew him in high school and college contradict his assertions  that he was never aggressive or belligerent after drinking or that the  terms he used in his yearbook had the meanings as ascribed to them  before the Judiciary Committee.    In fact, in a letter Judge Kavanaugh himself wrote in 1983 that  surfaced after his testimony, he described himself and his friends as  ``loud, obnoxious drunks.''   The point is not that Brett Kavanaugh engaged in questionable  behavior in high school. The point is he was not honest about it with  the Judiciary Committee under oath at his confirmation hearing. The  point is he was not credible. The point is he misled the Judiciary  Committee. As my colleagues framed the issue yesterday, the point is  that if we are assessing whether Dr. Ford's allegations satisfy a more- likely-than-not standard, they do and do so easily. The point is that  Judge Kavanaugh showed an alarming lack of judicial temperament in  addressing those issues.   Don't take my word for it. Consider what Judge Brett Kavanaugh has to  say. What would Judge Brett Kavanaugh say about Supreme Court nominee  Brett Kavanaugh's appearance before the Judiciary Committee?   Well, in 2015, Judge Brett Kavanaugh gave a speech at the Catholic  University on what makes a good judge. He set forth litmus tests for a  good judge--the characteristics and qualities he or she must have. Here  is what he said then. Brett Kavanaugh said: ``First and obviously, a  good judge, like a good umpire, cannot act as a partisan.'' He went on  to say that it is very important for a judge ``to avoid any semblance  of that partisanship, that political background.'' Yet in his opening  statement to the Judiciary Committee--his opening statement--Judge  Kavanaugh launched into a nakedly partisan screed. He blamed Democratic  Senators for a conspiracy to destroy his nomination. He called the  recent allegations against him a part of some ``revenge of the  Clintons.''  [[Page S6674]]  He told the Democratic Senators on the dais that ``what goes around  comes around,'' making an unvarnished political threat. That was in his  opening statement to the Judiciary Committee. Judge Kavanaugh failed  his own test of partisanship.   Next, in his 2015 Catholic University speech, Judge Kavanaugh said:  ``[I]t is critical to have the proper demeanor.'' Judge Kavanaugh added  that it is important for judges ``to keep our emotions in check, and be  calm against the storm.''   Anyone watching Judge Kavanaugh's testimony before the Judiciary  Committee saw just the opposite. Judge Kavanaugh was angry, emotional,  and belligerent. What we saw was a performance we would expect from a  judge on the ``People's Court,'' not on the Supreme Court of the United  States. Judge Kavanaugh failed his own test for judicial temperament.   Finally, in his 2015 Catholic University speech, Judge Kavanaugh  counseled that a good judge ``must demonstrate civility.'' Yet in his  appearance before the Judiciary Committee, Judge Kavanaugh impugned the  motives of Democratic Senators. He was rude. He interrupted questions.  He went so far as to ask my colleague Senator Klobuchar whether she  ever blacked out from drinking--an affront by a nominee who was there  to provide answers, not to ask questions. Brett Kavanaugh failed his  own test of civility.   That is why more than 2,400 law professors have written to the Senate  and told us ``Judge Brett Kavanaugh displayed a lack of judicial  temperament that would be disqualifying for any court, and certainly  for elevation to the highest Court of this land.''   That is why former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens took the  extraordinary step of stating publicly that Judge Kavanaugh's  performance at his qualification hearing disqualified him from serving  on the Supreme Court.   Let me say this: Brett Kavanaugh is not entitled to a job on the  Supreme Court--no one is--but the American people are entitled to the  truth. President Trump and the Senate Republicans have kept it from  them.   The FBI background investigation that was reopened after Dr. Blasey  Ford's testimony was not a real investigation. It was a figleaf to  cover for Republicans with concerns about Judge Kavanaugh.   The FBI interviewed only nine witnesses. Unbelievably, Dr. Blasey  Ford and Judge Kavanaugh were not among the people interviewed by the  FBI. The FBI was forced to ignore countless leaks or not to follow up  on them. Then Senators were given 1 hour to review the results of the  so-called investigation.   I was locked in a secure room with 17 Senators, and there was one  copy of the FBI report for all of us. It was like a bad game show,  where Senators had to compete with each other to get pages of the  report from the hands of their colleagues, read them, and digest them  before the clock ran out on the 1 hour we were given to read the  report. It was the single most absurd thing I have experienced in my  time in Congress.    Sadly, it was entirely consistent with the manner in which the Senate  Republicans have handled this nomination throughout the confirmation  process. That is because the White House and the Senate Republicans  weren't interested in getting to the truth. They were interested in  covering it up and ramming through Judge Kavanaugh's nomination.   They have gone so far as to stoke claims that Dr. Ford's supporters  have an ulterior motive and that Dr. Ford is being used for political  reasons. It seems that many of my Republican colleagues just cannot  bring themselves to believe a woman's account of a sexual assault and  that other women and men would rise up in support of her. It is  shameful that people think this is what has occurred. It is just  shameful.   Article III of the Constitution says that a Supreme Court Justice  ``shall hold their Office during good behavior.'' That is the standard  after someone serves on the Supreme Court. What this body has been  unwilling to do is to actually determine whether Judge Kavanaugh has  engaged in good behavior before he is put on the Court. They have  truncated that process. They have made it impossible for us to get to  the bottom of that truth.   The Republicans control this Chamber. They control the schedule. They  have rushed to judgment on Brett Kavanaugh in order to confirm him  before the midterm elections.   They have 51 votes to confirm anyone they want. The Democrats do not  control this Chamber. The Republicans have 51 votes. If they wanted to  bring in someone else who did not have these problems, they could have  done it anytime. They could do it today.   Some say we have no power to stop the Republicans from confirming a  Justice this year--no power. That is absolutely untrue. What the  Republicans have in their power, however, is to nominate someone--even  today--who is worthy of serving on the Supreme Court.   We know they want a Supreme Court Justice who would overturn Roe v.  Wade. We know they want a Supreme Court Justice who will take away  health insurance coverage for preexisting conditions. We know they want  a Justice who will oppose any gun control, and we know they want a  Supreme Court Justice who will not question Donald Trump or let him be  investigated.   If Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed, it will further harm a Supreme Court  that has never fully recovered from Bush v. Gore--the partisan decision  that threw the 2000 Presidential election to George W. Bush. It will  further harm a Supreme Court that has not recovered from Judge Neil  Gorsuch joining the Court after Senate Republicans stole that seat from  Judge Merrick Garland. Confirming Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court  will further erode and undermine the Court's legitimacy and continue to  diminish the American people's trust in it.   The Supreme Court of the United States deserves better than Brett  Kavanaugh. The American people deserve better. Our democracy deserves  better.   I will therefore vote no on the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh to  serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United  States, and I urge my colleagues to vote no as well.   Thank you.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
