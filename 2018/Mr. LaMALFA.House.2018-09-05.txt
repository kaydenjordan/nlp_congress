 Mr. Speaker, as we return this week to Washington after  our district work period this last month, I rise today to recognize and  honor the many firefighters around California, particularly in my own  district, who have been fighting so hard to extinguish these  devastating wildfires of hundreds of thousands of acres.   The Carr fire quickly became one of the most devastating fires in  northern California history, and, unfortunately, claimed the lives of  three firefighters in the process. I am very grateful for their  sacrifice and their unwavering efforts in the face of what had to seem  nearly impossible odds. After all, when California's poor forest  management practices turn our public lands into tinderboxes, containing  a wildfire becomes extremely difficult.   I spent a lot of time in Redding last month, and I saw firsthand the  challenges they faced and the great work being done to protect the  citizens, the communities, and each other.   Local firefighters, CalFire, the Hotshots, Forest Service, smoke  jumpers, all of them were ready to go and were working, participating,  putting their lives on the line. We owe all these men and women a great  deal of gratitude.   We can debate what may cause these catastrophic fires, the fuel load  in our forests, and lack of management, but there is no question who  put these fires out. We are very grateful to them.                            ____________________
