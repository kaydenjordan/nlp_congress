 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution and want to  address an issue created by the Federal Communication Commission's  misguided privacy rule in a recent Ninth Circuit case.   For decades, the Federal Trade Commission has been the privacy cop on  the beat for most industries, including the technology sector,  protecting consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices. The  Federal Trade Commission has brought over 500 privacy and data security  cases to protect consumers. These include cases against internet  service providers and some of the largest edge providers.   The Federal Communications Commission is a regulatory body focused on  regulating interstate and international communications by radio,  television, wire, satellite, and cable.   The Federal Trade Commission's work in privacy and data security has  long been held up as a model by both parties, praising the agency for  strong enforcement without overly burdensome regulations. During  negotiations with the European Union to finalize the U.S.-European  privacy shield, the Obama administration held up the Federal Trade  Commission as the premier privacy enforcement agency.   Unfortunately, in a midnight action, the Federal Communications  Commission jammed through its own privacy rule that is very different  from the framework that the Federal Trade Commission has been enforcing  for decades.   While we can reverse the poorly constructed FCC rule today, we must  still address a recent court ruling. The Ninth Circuit recently ruled  that the common carrier exemption in the Federal Trade Commission Act  exempts an entity in its entirety from the Federal Trade Commission's  jurisdiction if it engages in any common carrier activities, even if  the company also engages in non-common carrier activity.   I have introduced legislation to address the court's ruling with the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson). It is my hope that our colleagues  will join us.   S.J. Res. 34 makes clear that the Federal Trade Commission has  authority over common carriers when they are acting outside the scope  of the common carrier.   The repeal of the Federal Communications Commission's misguided  privacy rule in the Ninth Circuit's opinion creates a gap and an  irrational approach to privacy for consumers and would leave portions  of the internet ecosystem completely outside the Federal Trade  Commission's jurisdiction. This bill makes clear that the common  carrier exemption is important to ensure that no duplication regulation  occurs. At the same time, there are no loopholes left for certain  companies to be outside the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade  Commission.                                time  1630    We need to be consistent in our approach to privacy and focus on  consumer-oriented enforcement. This approach has been the foundation  not just of Silicon Valley, but innovators across the country; and the  S.J. Res. 34 sets right the decades of innovation that has spurred job  growth in the United States and greater online services for consumers.
