 Mr. Speaker, I rise today and will be joined by a number  of my colleagues from the State of Michigan to pay tribute to a person  that I have known of and got to know as an adult, but I have known  Congressman John Dingell virtually all of my life. Having grown up in  Michigan and grown up in a family involved in politics in Michigan, I  was aware of John Dingell from my earliest days.   He served in this House with incredible dignity and great  distinction, longer than anyone else in the history of this country, of  this government. In fact, nearly one out of four Members of the House  of Representatives in its entire history served with Congressman John  Dingell.   Yesterday, several of us made an attempt to fly, we left Andrews Air  Force Base in a storm and attempted to fly to Michigan and were,  unfortunately, unable to land due to the weather.   We are here and will be able to honor him this evening and also honor  him tomorrow at the funeral that will take place here in Washington.   So our thoughts go to the Dingell family, especially to our  colleague, John's wife, Congressman Dingell's wife, whom he often  referred to as ``the lovely Deborah.'' She is a friend and a colleague.  I have known her myself, as well, for as long as I can possibly  remember.   I will have more to say about Congressman Dingell, but I think there  are just a few aspects of his career that I just want to make sure I  noted for the ecord.   The longest-serving Member of this House, he is known not just for  the longevity and the quantity of his time here, but for the incredible  impact that he had on our country, on our Nation, and on the policies  that he believed in and stood for.   He served as the chairman or the ranking member on the House Energy  and Commerce Committee from 1981 to 2008, shaping very important  legislation on clean air, clean water, protecting endangered animals,  advocating for national healthcare. In fact, in every Congress that he  served in, he continued the legacy of his father, who preceded him in  Congress, by introducing legislation that would guarantee healthcare  for every American.                                time  1815    Some of the legislative highlights: National Wilderness Act, 1964;  Water Quality Act, 1965; National Environmental Policy Act, 1970;  Endangered Species Act, 1973; Natural Gas Policy Act, 1978;  Prescription Drug Marketing Act, 1988; Clean Air Act Amendments, 1990;  Energy Independence and Security Act, 2007; National Instant Criminal  Background Check System Improvements, 2008; Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act, 2010; FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, 2011.   Any one of these would constitute the highlight of a legislative  career, and every one of them are attributable to the work of  Congressman John Dingell.   Before I yield to my colleagues, I want to mention one other piece of  legislation that he is known for. In my first term--the only term that  I shared with Congressman Dingell--we celebrated, as a nation, the 50th  anniversary of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Late that evening,  commemorating that day, I happened to turn on C-SPAN and was watching  old videotape of the signing ceremony where President Lyndon Johnson  stood with the civil rights and legislative leaders of our Nation. I  saw this tall figure walk into the frame, shake President Johnson's  hand, and receive the President's congratulations for his work on that  historic piece of legislation.   I went to bed, and the very next day, I got up and walked over here  for a session. I sat in that chair right there, next to the one that  Congressman John Dingell sat in for all those years, and I spoke to the  guy who I saw the night before in a moment of American history. He was  still here fighting for the very same things that he had fought for,  for so long. I took that as a personal privilege, to have been able to  serve with him.   As I said, this is a tremendous loss for our country. It is a  tremendous loss for me personally. Our hearts go out to Debbie.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for those remarks. I  think it says a lot about John Dingell that the affection that we feel  for him not only spans the middle aisle here across party lines, but it  transcends it. It is meaningless, in some ways. He had a relationship  with people here just based on the human touch that he had. He was a  wonderful, wonderful person, and you, obviously, had a close  relationship with him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Stevens)-- we have Democrats and Republicans here--a freshman, a person who did  not have a chance to serve directly with him but knew him and admired  him.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Stevens for her  comments.   Yesterday, as we stood on the east front steps of the Capitol, I  stood next to Congressman Paul Mitchell as Congressman Dingell and  Congresswoman Dingell and the motorcade came by. It was an emotional  moment that we shared with one another, and I know he meant a lot to  him, so I now yield to Congressman Paul Mitchell.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Mitchell), and I remember, as well, when he told me--I used to call him  Mr. Chairman, mainly because I was afraid of him most of my life. And  when he told me to call him John, I think it might have been a full  year before I developed enough courage to call him by that name.   Another one of our Members who I know is very close to John, has  worked in Michigan politics and knew John Dingell for a long time, is  our colleague Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs.  Lawrence).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Lawrence for her  comments.   Mr. Speaker, I know that Congressman Fred Upton was a very close  friend with John Dingell. They served together. They served on the same  committee together. They were one another's chairman at different  times, but I know, first and foremost, they were just real friends.   I now yield to the dean of the Michigan delegation, Congressman Fred  Upton.    Mr. Speaker, I recall yesterday, when we were attempting  to get to the funeral in Detroit, Congressman Upton participated in an  impromptu observance for Congressman Dingell at 30,000 feet as we flew  back to Washington, because of our failure to land. I will never forget  that.   Another one of our colleagues who I know, like me, has known the  Dingell family and Congressman John Dingell for as long as he can  remember, and whose father served with Congressman Dingell, and was  also once the dean of the Michigan delegation, Congressman Andy Levin.  I know this means a lot to the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan, (Mr. Levin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Levin for his kind  words.   Mr. Speaker, I would now like to call on the last of our Michigan  Members to speak, a new Member, a freshman, someone who I know had a  very special relationship with Congressman Dingell.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Michigan, Congresswoman Rashida  Tlaib.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Tlaib.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman),  who served a very long time--most of his career--here in the House side  by side with Congressman John Dingell. Congressman Brad Sherman is a  member of the Financial Services Committee and the Foreign Affairs  Committee and a good friend of Congressman John Dingell.    Mr. Speaker, tomorrow we will lay Congressman John  Dingell to rest, and it will be a painful time. But we can take a lot  of comfort in the contribution that he has made, not just to this body  but to the quality of life in this country; and as individuals with our  own perspective, our own experience here, we can take some comfort in  knowing that his wife--the love of his life--will continue his legacy  by serving here with us side by side.   Our hearts go out to her. I know this is a very difficult time for  the Dingell family, but especially for Debbie. They loved one another.  They were inseparable. They were one. I know this will be a difficult  time for her. We stand with her.   Mr. Speaker, John Dingell served with 11 Presidents and 11 Speakers  of the House. Mr. Speaker, 2,419 Members of Congress served with him.  He served 21,551 days in this House and cast over 25,000 votes. But as  he would say and has said many times: It is not the longevity that  counts, it is the way you serve.   He served in a way that brought honor to this Congress and made it a  better institution. He led in a way that made this country a better  place. And I know for each of us who came to the floor and each of us  who served with him, he not only made us better Representatives of the  people whom we work for, but he made us better people.   We honor John Dingell's life and legacy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
