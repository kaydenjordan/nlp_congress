 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. YOUNG asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Chairman, I listened to the presentation of the author  of this bill. I have been in this House 48 years. We have been arguing  about this ANWR for 40 of those years. We have passed it out of the  house 14 times. And by the way, it was established by a Democrat  President and a Democrat House to allow the 1002 areas to be explored  if Congress said so. And that is what we have done.   Now we have a sponsor from California who doesn't know beans about  this business talking about big oil and about Trump. This has been a  policy of this Nation to allow drilling there if the Congress spoke,  and we did so. Under the tax bill, yes, but 13 times before that this  House passed the legislation to have the 1002 explored.   Just keep in mind, we are talking about an area of a 19-million-acre  refuge and areas left inside, the 1002 area--the map behind me, if  anybody can see that little tiny red dot, 2,000 acres, less than the  size of Dulles Airport, less than the size of the Capitol grounds. And  yet, we are trying to say, no, no development. We are trying to say  that is not right, this is the last pristine area. May I say again, it  is not the last pristine area.   We have had approximately 30 years of development in Prudhoe Bay, the  same type of terrain, same species of animals, same amount of caribou.  In fact, we have more now than we had before after we started drilling.  So this bill is a sham. And I listened to this with great interest. I  always understand what they are trying to do, and it is also a sham to  this Congress. This Congress spoke. It is a sham to this Nation. We are  taking time away from what should be done in this Nation. We have sat,  frankly, 2 years in this House and have done nothing.   Unfortunately, we have heard also this is a cultural bill, and the  Gwich'in supposedly is all this gentleman listens to, doesn't listen to  the Inupiats. That to me is important. The people that live there want  the drilling. The people at least 150 miles away don't want the  drilling, but that is who they are listening to.   So, again, my colleagues, this bill is the wrong step forward for  this Nation.  [[Page H7672]]  It is not about big oil. It is about the State of Alaska. It is about  my constituents, not California; they have enough problems of their  own. Just read the papers. So I am suggesting, with respect, this bill  should not go anywhere. It may pass today, because there are a lot of  people on that side who don't believe in oil. I understand that. But it  is wrong to undo what Congress has done. And now I will suggest,  respectfully, it is dead. You are wasting our time. It will not go  anywhere, that is why I am not going to get really excited and go over  there and--never mind.   I would suggest, respectfully, I am going to see the death of this  bill a long time before this gentleman is ever in this House again.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Kevin Hern).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado  (Mr. Lamborn).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Chairman, as painful as it is to listen to all of that  nonsense on the other side, I am glad to have logical people speak on  this side.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Shimkus).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Mr. Chairman, it is an honor now to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Wyoming (Ms. Cheney).    Mr. Chairman, I am happy to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman  from Louisiana.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Upton).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I insert in the Record a Statement of Administration  Policy on this bill which indicates that the President's advisers would  recommend that we veto it, even though it is unlikely that it will ever  get to his desk.                     Statement of Administration Policy   H.R. 205--Protecting and Securing Florida's Coastline Act of 2019--Rep.                      Rooney, R-FL, and 18 cosponsors     H.R. 1146--Arctic Cultural and Coastal Plain Protection Act--Rep.                     Huffman, D-CA, and 182 cosponsors       H.R. 1941--Coastal and Marine Economies Protection Act--Rep.                    Cunningham, D-SC, and 51 cosponsors         The Administration opposes H.R. 205, the Protecting and       Securing Florida's Coastline Act of 2019, H.R. 1146, the       Arctic Cultural and Coastal Plain Protection Act, and H.R.       1941, the Coastal and Marine Economies Protection Act. These       bills would undermine the Administration's commitment to a       prosperous American economy supported by the responsible use       of the Nation's abundant natural resources. Development of       our resources enhances our energy security and energy       dominance, and produces high-paying American jobs; provides       increased revenue to the Treasury, States, tribes, and local       communities; and is a critical source of conservation       funding.        H.R. 1146 would prohibit the Department of the Interior's       Bureau of Land Management from administering an oil and gas       leasing program in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National       Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska. The bill would repeal a       provision of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that directed       the Secretary of the Interior to establish a program for the       development of the Coastal Plain that would allow the use of       no more than about 0.01 percent of the total acreage of ANWR       for surface development of production and support facilities.       The Administration supports environmentally responsible       energy development in the Coastal Plain, also known as the       1002 Area, of ANWR. Such development is expected to increase       America's energy security and independence, create jobs, and       provide affordable, reliable energy for consumers while       providing much-needed revenue to both the State of Alaska and       the Federal Government.        Similarly, H.R. 205 and H.R. 1941 would both restrict       future oil and gas development in the Federal waters of the       U.S. Outer Continental Shelf (OCS). H.R. 205 would amend the       Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act (GOMESA) to make permanent       the current temporary leasing moratorium on offshore leasing       in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico, off the west coast of Florida.       H.R. 1941 would amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act       (OCSLA) to permanently remove from consideration acreage for       offshore leasing on both the Atlantic and Pacific OCS. Both       of these bills would undermine OCSLA, which established a       periodic, multi-stage planning process involving State and       tribal consultation and a thoughtful comparison and balancing       of the benefits and impacts to all the regions of the OCS.       These bills would permanently constrain this careful       administrative process. Under the bills, large swaths of the       OCS would be off limits for resource development without the       benefit of periodic assessments of the potential economic,       social, and environmental effects of development, as required       by existing law. Excluding these areas from leasing       consideration could place more pressure for development on       other OCS areas and constrain our ability to meet national       energy needs as required by OCSLA.        Additionally, each of these bills would eliminate the       potential for future direct revenue that would otherwise be       provided to the Treasury, and through revenue sharing, to the       States, tribes, and counties where the development activities       occur. In Fiscal Year 2018, energy development on Federal and       Indian lands and waters generated approximately $9 billion in       direct revenue from royalties, bonus bids, and rents. Of that       revenue, $1.78 billion was disbursed to 35 States. The top       States receiving Fiscal Year 2018 revenues were New Mexico       ($634.9 million); Wyoming ($563.9 million); Colorado ($112.5       million); Louisiana ($91 million); and Utah ($76 million).       Additionally, more than $1 billion was disbursed to Indian       tribes and individual Indian mineral owners; $1.22 billion to       the Reclamation Fund; $970 million to the Land and Water       Conservation Fund (LWCF); $150 million to the Historic       Preservation Fund; and $3.5 billion to the general fund of       the Treasury.        Prohibiting energy development in new Federal areas would       hinder future administrations' efforts to make up for revenue       lost as production declines from leases in aging energy       fields. Such restrictions will tie the hands of future       administrations and reduce their ability to enhance energy       security through strong domestic energy production and to       ensure affordable energy for American families.        If these bills were presented to the President, his       advisors would recommend he veto them.     Mr. Chair, I also insert in the Record a letter in strong  opposition to this bill signed by over 20 entities, including the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce and the Consumer Energy Alliance.                                                  September 5, 2019.      U.S. Congress,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: We rely on American made energy to       power our daily lives, communities and to grow a more       prosperous future. Americans deserve clean, safe, reliable,       abundant and affordable energy so that our families,       communities and businesses can all share the opportunities       American energy creates. Our country cannot afford to block       access to new energy supplies and risk losing our energy       advantage. That's why we ask you to oppose legislation being       considered by the U.S. House of Representatives next week       that would slow scientific surveys and prevent access to new       sources of American offshore energy in the Outer Continental       Shelf.        For more than seven decades, energy development in the Gulf       of Mexico has worked collaboratively alongside tourism,       fishing and Defense Department training activities. But H.R.       205 would permanently extend the eastern Gulf of Mexico       moratorium on oil and natural gas activities. The       Congressional Budget Office conservatively estimates that       this could cost taxpayers $400 million in revenue over the       next 10 years. Similarly, H.R. 1941 would block offshore       energy development in the Pacific and Atlantic planning       areas, and H.R. 1146 would lock up energy resources in the       Alaskan Coastal Plain.        Congress should support progress. Modern energy       technologies have enabled an impressive record of       environmental stewardship and innovation. But when the       government chooses to arbitrarily and permanently close off       areas to exploration and potential development, we simply       increase our dependency on foreign sources. This reality is       visible in places like California and Massachusetts. Despite       abundant offshore oil and natural gas resources, California       imports 57 percent of its oil supply, a staggering 37 percent       of which comes from Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, to meet energy       needs each winter, Massachusetts imports liquefied natural       gas from Russia.        American energy is produced with a smaller carbon footprint       under significantly stronger environmental protections than       energy produced anywhere else in the world. We ask you to       embrace these homegrown opportunities that benefit American       families, create high-wage jobs, strengthen the U.S. economy       and protect our environment.        Next week, the House of Representatives is expected to       consider legislation undercutting domestic energy security       and economic opportunity by limiting American energy access.       We urge you to reject these bills and instead stand up for       energy produced in America, by American workers for the       benefit of American families.            Sincerely,        American Chemistry Council, American Council of Engineering       Companies, American Forest & Paper Association, American Gas       Association, American Iron and Steel Institute, American       Petroleum Institute, American Pipeline Contractors       Association, Consumer Energy Alliance, Distribution Pipeline       Contractors Association, Energy Equipment and Infrastructure       Alliance, Independent Petroleum Association of America.        International Association of Drilling Contractors,       International Association of Geophysical Contractors,       Laborers' International Union of North America, National       Association of Manufacturers, National Ocean Industries       Association, National Utility Contractors Association,       Offshore Marine Service Association, Portland Cement       Association, Power and Communication Contractors Association,       U.S. Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Oil and Gas Association.     Mr. Chair, I also insert in the Record a letter of  opposition from the Laborers' International Union of North America.                                                          LiUNA!,                                                  September 9, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: On behalf       of the 500,000 members of the Laborers' International Union       of North America (LiUNA), I want to express our opposition to       H.R. 205, which would permanently extend the moratorium on       oil and gas leasing in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico; H.R. 1146,       to once again prohibit oil and gas drilling in the Arctic       National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR); and, H.R. 1941, which would       bar offshore drilling along the Atlantic and Pacific Coasts.        Once again, jobs of LiUNA members who work in the energy       sector are being targeted for elimination by environmental       radicals for purely political purposes. There is absolutely       no chance for these ``message bills'' to be enacted into law       this Congress. So, instead of working to enact real job       creating infrastructure legislation, union members see their       jobs once again being denigrated and belittled.        Energy independence is central to the future of the       American economy and our standard of living. Unfortunately,       the enemies of job creation continue to try to wall off and       strand our domestic energy resources  [[Page H7678]]       from development; killing jobs, prolonging our energy       dependence on unfriendly foreign regimes, and saddling       middle-class and lower-income families with rising energy       costs.        LiUNA members, in Alaska and elsewhere, know first-hand       that when done responsibly, with union-trained workers,       energy development can coexist with environmental       stewardship. LiUNA and the other building trades unions       invest significant resources into the training of our members       that help develop the knowledge and skills they need to work       safely and productively while constructing energy and other       infrastructure to the highest standards.        For the hard-working members of LiUNA and other building       trades unions, these jobs put food on their families' tables       and roofs over their heads. These jobs enable them to put       their children through college, to save for retirement, and       to spend money in business establishments that employ others.        I urge you to vote against these ill-conceived bills.        With kind regards, I am            Sincerely yours,                                                  Terry O'Sullivan,                                                 General President.     Mr. Chair, I insert in the Record a letter from the  president of Voice of the Arctic Inupiat, which is in strong opposition  to this legislation.                                     Voice of the Arctic Inupiat                                     Point Hope, AK, March 20, 2019.      Congressman Jared Huffman,      Washington, DC.        Representative Huffman, Voice of the Arctic Inupiat (VOICE)       strongly opposes H.R. 1146 amending Public Law 115-97 to       repeal the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) oil and gas       leasing program. Beyond the fact that your bill would repeal       an opportunity that the Inupiat people have fought for       decades to achieve, we are struck by the lack of knowledge       displayed in this legislation, which completely ignores the       existence of the Inupiat people, and especially the people of       Kaktovik. The Native Village of Kaktovik is a federally       recognized tribe and the Kaktovikmiut have occupied the       Coastal Plain for at least 11,000 years.        The Coastal Plain is home to more than just caribou and       none of the Coastal Plain is wilderness. It is not a place       without people; it never has been--it has been continuously       occupied by the Inupiat people and our ancestors for       millennia, and we find it insulting that you fail to       acknowledge this history Currently, the Coastal Plain is the       home of a community of over 200 people. People who live,       hunt, fish, raise their families, and hope for a secure       economic future for their children. People who walk in the       footsteps of their ancestors all over the land that Congress,       without our permission, designated as the 1002 Area of the       Arctic National Wildlife Refuge People that you have       completely disregarded because they generally do not agree       with you. In light of this, Congressman, your concern about       human rights seems a bit pale.        When we, Indigenous peoples, use terms like self-      determination, sovereignty, economic equality, cultural       survival, and traditional lands, they are more than just       buzzwords. These are objectives that have long been denied us       and for which we have had to fight for generations. It is not       for you to ignore those ideas, nor the people fighting for       them, in favor of those who are more aligned with your       political agenda. To us, this issue goes beyond politics to       the very sustainability of our communities, culture, and       economy.        The Arctic Cultural and Coastal Plain Protection Act       undermines the wishes of those of us living closest to ANWR       and negates years of work by local stakeholders toward       ensuring a sustainable economy for the people and communities       of our region. We hope this letter might help you better       understand the realities of life in the Arctic. H.R. 1146       preaches a ``moral responsibility to protect this wilderness       heritage as an enduring resource to bequeath undisturbed to       future generations of Americans'', but fails to acknowledge       the basic needs of future generations of Arctic Inupiat. Our       regional government, the North Slope Borough (NSB), is       responsible for more territory than any other local       government in the nation. The NSB receives over 96% of its       revenue from property taxes levied on industry infrastructure       on the North Slope, which enables them to provide services       that were never accessible before in the Arctic. The Borough       School District provides vocational and academic education       for people of all ages; NSB health clinics provide modern       medical services to residents in even the smallest and most       remote of villages. The Municipal Services Department       operates water, sewage, and electric utilities, plows roads       and runways, and maintains landfills Other NSB departments       provide housing, police and fire protection, search and       rescue, and other critical services to our communities.       Altogether, the NSB is the single largest local employer on       the North Slope, employing over 63% of the workforce. These       benefits of modern American civilization, common in the rest       of the nation, have been built on the foundation of the North       Slope oil industry.        It is hypocritical of you, Congressman, to stifle the       efforts of Kaktovik to secure jobs, a local economy, and       income for their community while your state makes billions of       dollars off the development of its own oil and gas resources.       If you are concerned about the impacts of resource       development, we suggest that you focus on your own state of       California, which despite its green image, produces the       dirtiest crude in America and has some of the largest       refineries on the West Coast, which in addition to refining       much cleaner Alaska North Slope Crude, also imports and       refines oil from foreign countries like Saudi Arabia and       Angola. The message this bill sends is that you prioritize       the leisure whims of your California constituents above the       needs of the Native people of Kaktovik.        H.R. 1146 cites climate change as one of the main drivers       of the bill. In reality, climate change--and the world's       response to it--add additional layers to existing burdens       that we, the Arctic's Indigenous people, are facing. We agree       that climate change has deeply affected our traditional       Inupiat ways of life. We do not agree that the solution to       that problem is to create more wilderness that hinders our       ability to provide for our people and respond to the impacts       that we are facing. It is unfair for you to ask that we, as       Indigenous peoples, carry the burden of climate change and       the burden of mitigation so that you can fly back and forth       to your home district with an easy conscience.        Even with the services our local government provides, many       of the people in the Arctic live in conditions that fall       below acceptable standards of living, despite being citizens       of one of the richest countries in the world. We are       concerned and puzzled, then, by your focus on protecting eco-      tourism and this idea of pristine, unspoiled wilderness--at       the expense of an economy to sustain our children--that rich       elites across America ``cherish.'' While we are certainly       used to this harmful narrative by now, it does not seem in       line with your democratic values. For our part, we do not see       any contradiction between developing our resources and at the       same time protecting our environment and wildlife. These are       not diverging priorities but an integral piece to balance in       the Arctic.        The bill as introduced further ignores the historical and       cultural trauma that is a part of this land and the       Kaktovikmiut who inhabit it. The people of Kaktovik, in       recent memory, have suffered through three forced relocations       at the hands of the American military. Then, in 1980, the       federal government took 23 million acres of land--without       consent, consultation, nor a treaty between parties--and gave       the people of Kaktovik back 92,000 acres of land immediately       surrounding their village. A mere fraction of their       traditional and ancestral lands. The ``deal'' was that this       land was locked up, the Kaktovikmiut were unable to access       Native allotments, cultural sites, and subsistence areas in       the newly expanded Refuge in the summer months. No, they now       live with extreme restrictions on how they can use their own       lands as a result of the changes made by the federal       government in how the land is designated, lands that the       Inupiat people have been stewards over for thousands of       years. Do you consider these human rights violations,       Representative Huffman? We hope, at the very least, that this       does not diminish ``the integrity of the National Wildlife       Refuge System,'' which in itself operates on the mistaken       Western idea that Indigenous peoples are incompetent at       managing their own lands.        The views of the Inupiat who call ANWR home are frequently       ignored, and your bill reinforces the perception that the       wishes of people who live in and around the Coastal Plain are       less important than those who live hundreds and thousands of       miles away. Mr. Huffman, you do not have to tell the Inupiat       people, who have lived on this land for generations, the       importance of our homelands--we see it, we know it, we depend       on it, we are a part of it. We have something very important       in common, that often gets lost in this debate--this false       dichotomy of ``for'' vs. ``against'', republican vs.       democrat, economy vs. environment--we all share a commitment       to protecting this land and we would welcome the opportunity       to work collaboratively with you and the Gwich'in people, to       whom we have extended many invitations for discussion, to       protect this balance between responsible development and       environmental protections that is integral to our way of life       and the long-term sustainability of our culture.        The Inupiat people have existed, and even flourished, in       one of the most severe climates in the world for generations.       We understand the balance needed to sustain our way of life       and our communities; this priority is currently dependent on       successful and safe oil and gas developments. We are       confident that the health of the Porcupine Caribou Herd can       be maintained given our success in maintaining the health of       three other caribou herds that migrate within our region. We       respectfully request that you remove your bill from       consideration and come visit our communities to better       understand the needs of our people and our communities. We       would welcome the opportunity.            Taikuu,      Sayers Tuzroyluk,        President, Voice of the Arctic Inupiat.      Rex A. Rock Sr.,        Chairman.      John Hopson Jr.,        Vice Chairman.     Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop), the former chairman of the committee  and ranking member at this time.  [[Page H7679]]         Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona  (Mr. Gosar).    Mr. Chair, does the gentleman from California have the  right to close?    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, this is a sham bill. I have heard people say there was no  consultation. There has been consultation. The gentleman from  California has driven a wedge between two groups of Alaska Natives, one  that lives there, resides there, and is directly affected, and the  other one is 400 miles away. We had testimony from that group.   By the way, I am a Gwich'in. I may not be one, but my daughters are.  My wife was. She would turn over in her grave right now if she heard  this nonsense about the Gwich'in.   You invited a group in Alaska. This used to be the House of the  people. Instead of people putting their nose in my business, I am going  to put it in your business. I will figure out a way to do that because  this is wrong. This has been debated for 40 years, an area set aside by  this Congress for exploration.   By the way, we gave the Alaska Natives who live there at Kaktovik  70,000 acres of land for their social and economic well-being, and you  are taking it away from them. You talk about a cultural aspect, you are  hurting those people, and you don't care. I remember who you represent,  and I understand that. You are a lawyer.   To me, to have this type of bill on the floor is not only a waste of  time for this House body but a bad thing for this Nation, but worse  than that is going back on their word.   I represent the whole State of Alaska. The people who live there,  live on the Arctic slope, want this legislation, not the Gwich'in. Yes,  they are being, very frankly, shilled and used for a sham, and that is  a shame.   You can be what you want to be. You can stand there holier-than-thou.  You are doing something wrong to this Nation, the Alaska people, and  the Alaska Native. You listen to one side.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, we discussed before that this bill was written  by the gentleman from California. It only impacts Alaska and impacts it  only, and I am the only Congressman. I strongly oppose this  legislation.   My amendment, very frankly, was to try to solve one of the problems,  the lack of consultation with the people in Kaktovik, the Inuits, and  only listen to one side, the Gwich'in.   This amendment says, yes, they will have to consult with the Inuits,  and they have to consult with the people of Kaktovik, and it would  require them to understand that if they didn't agree with it, very  frankly, this would not go forth.   It is a good amendment. If the gentleman says this is culturally  real, you have to listen to both sides. You have divided us. This  amendment solves that problem.   Adopt this amendment and make this bill a little bit better but not  totally good.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Again, might I may say, Mr. Chairman, this bill has been  debated. It passed out of this House 14 times--14 times--with  consultation.   And with all due respect to my friend from Gwich'in, I would like to  take a count of the caribou they have harvested in this last year and  the year before. It is a very small number. The people who live there,  right on the shores and with them, are saying this is okay.   We developed Prudhoe Bay. We have more caribou now than we have ever  had.   This is, again, a sham. It is such a dishonest presentation of  something that is not fact at all. But, again, in society, people can  do that. I understand that.   But we ought to understand one thing: This bill should never have  came to the floor.   Number two, it is not the first time. There was consultation. We did  pass it--again, 14 times--out of this House, even when you were in  control, and now it is the wrong thing to do. The Senate didn't pass  the bill once, and Bill Clinton beat it to death.   So I am just saying, again--not much use talking about it much more-- that we can go ahead and vote on this today, but this amendment solves  one of the problems: true consultation with two groups of individual  Alaska Natives, both having some say in it, one totally not listened to  because you have never asked them, and that is an unfortunate thing.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am urging a ``yes'' vote on this amendment  and ``no'' on the legislation itself.   And, again, I think the gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman) has  done a great disservice to the people of Alaska, especially the  natives. He has divided us, and that is not right.   The floor of this House has divided a culture, different cultures,  Alaska Natives, and it is for that I am deeply regretful. It shows what  you can do when you interfere with other people's districts.   This House used to be a House of the people. Now it is a House of  what? What have they done in 2 years? Nothing.   Now they are trying to undo what was done legitimately in 40 years.  And so I understand it. You have the votes. I understand that. It is  not going to become law. I hope you understand that.   And we are going to have a sale--I hope you understand that--and then  my people that I represent will, in fact, get their just due. I know  that.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
