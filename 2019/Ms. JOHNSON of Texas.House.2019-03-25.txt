 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my support  for H.R. 1839, the Medicaid Services Investment and Accountability Act  of 2019.   This bill would extend programs that help seniors and people with  disabilities live in the community, rather than institutions. It would  extend the authorization of the Excellence in Mental Health  demonstration so that none of the participating states run out of  critical funds. It would authorize additional program integrity  measures in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and in other areas of the  Medicaid program. Finally, it would provide states with the option to  provide coordinated care for children with medically complex  conditions.   As representatives of Americans from all corners of our country, we  have a responsibility to protect and enhance Medicaid, a vital safety  net program that finances the delivery of care to 69 million people in  this country. Without this program, the quality and access of  healthcare for our most vulnerable populations will be at risk. We must  ensure that future generations are able to receive the necessary health  benefits to live full and prosperous lives.   On behalf of the over four and a half million Medicaid beneficiaries  in my home state of Texas, I am proud to support the Medicaid Services  Investment and Accountability Act of 2019.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
