 Madam President, back in 2017, before anyone had ever  heard of COVID-19, our Republican colleagues could hardly vote fast  enough for a $1.9 trillion tax bill. Most of the benefits of that bill  went to the wealthiest people in America--$1.9 trillion in tax cuts,  most of it to the ultrawealthy and large corporations. And of course  there was little talk about the deficit and the debt when that was  going on.   Now we are in the midst of a pandemic, and COVID-19 has killed more  than half a million Americans. Americans are hurting. Our economy is  hurting. Millions are unemployed. And our friends across the aisle are  asking how little we can get away with doing at this moment in time.  They want to know how much we can cut from President Joseph Biden's  American Rescue Plan. Can we cut money to open schools? Can't we just  wait? Let's just wait and see what happens. That is their question. How  about cutting funds to help keep families from losing their homes? How  about cutting the funds for vaccination sites? How low can we go?   One point nine trillion dollars in tax cuts for millionaires and  billionaires--no problem. A President who denies the truth about a  pandemic as it rages across America--no problem. But when Americans  elect a new President with a mandate and a plan to finally break the  back of this pandemic, get our economy back on its feet, get our kids  back in schools, and actually help American families, suddenly a lot of  folks on the other side of the aisle have lost interest.   Do you remember last year? I do. We discovered this COVID-19 and  started to worry about it, as we should. In March of last year, we  passed a bill that cost almost $2 trillion--the largest spending bill  in the history of the United States--under President Trump, and it got  96 votes in the Senate--96 votes. Every Democrat and every Republican  Senator who voted, voted for it, and I was one of them. Did I stop and  say: Wait a minute; President Trump may get credit for this. No. We had  an American crisis, a challenge, and we needed to respond to it.   And then what happened in December of last year, while President  Trump was still in office? The second COVID-19 rescue plan came  through, some $900 billion. I was one of those who were part of drawing  it up, and I voted for it, no questions asked. We were still in the  midst of a pandemic. The economy was flat on its back. I didn't care  that Donald Trump was still President; there was work to be done for  America. Ninety-two Senators voted for that; 96 in March, 92 in  December under President Trump.   Well, how many Republican Senators are now stepping up to help us  with the American Rescue Plan that President Biden has proposed? I am  still waiting. None so far. Now it has become a partisan exercise to  talk about dealing with the real pandemic and economic crisis of this  country.   What is going on in this Chamber? Have we decided now, since we have  a new President of a different political faith, that the other side  cannot support efforts to increase the amount of money for vaccines and  distribution across America, to send a cash payment to families who are  struggling to get by, to give unemployment benefits to millions of  Americans when those benefits are scheduled to run out in just 2 weeks?   All we hear from the other side is: You know, we may be overspending  here. We should have thought of this before.   Yes, you should have, and you didn't under a Republican President.  Now it has become an issue.   A year ago, at the beginning of the pandemic, 96 to zero for a $2  trillion COVID relief plan. Maybe if we had had an administration that  wisely managed the COVID response, we wouldn't have been in that mess.  Maybe if we had had a President who for the first year of this  coronavirus wasn't making up stories that it is going to go away; it  will disappear by Easter; it won't be a problem if everybody would just  take a shot of Lysol; a new chemical I have discovered some of my  friends are taking and all the rest--remember that? Remember those  press conferences? And what was going on while the last President was  ignoring the reality of that COVID-19 pandemic? America was getting  sick, and Americans were dying.   We have 5 percent of the world's population and 20 percent of the  COVID-19 deaths. What is going on here in a great nation like America?  Well, for a year, we didn't get it together because we didn't have a  President who accepted reality. Now we have a President who accepts  reality and wants to do something about it. He was elected to lead, and  he wants to lead.   Where is the Republican support? Democrats were there for the Trump  plan; Republicans aren't there for the Biden plan. We wasted time and  resources, but now President Biden wants to turn it around.   The American Rescue Plan, proposed by President Biden and passed by  the House of Representatives last week without a single Republican  vote, no Republican support for it, has the support of 80 percent of  the American people--overwhelming majority of Democrats and  Independents, even Republicans. It turns out the only people in America  who are against this approach of taking this pandemic seriously are the  Republicans in the House of Representatives and apparently in the  Senate.    Every day this Senate delays passing the Biden American Rescue Plan,  more small businesses close their doors, workers lose their jobs,  parents turn to food banks and soup kitchens to feed their families,  and more and more families face homelessness.   One provision that was included in the House version of the American  Rescue Plan will not be part of the Senate plan, and that is the  gradual increase in the Federal minimum wage.   Now, I understand. The rules in the Senate, particularly when it  comes to reconciliation, as conceived by the late Robert C. Byrd, are  almost impossible to understand and defend. I get it. I am not blaming  any one person for that. That is a reality, and I have been here for a  while, and I have seen it. So currently we cannot offer the Federal  minimum wage under the so-called reconciliation bill because of the  Byrd rules.   Our Senate Parliamentarian ruled last week that passing a Federal  minimum wage increase as part of the rescue plan is not permitted under  those rules. I respect the Parliamentarian's judgment. I may disagree  and I may be disappointed, but I respect her judgment. Our Republican  friends should know this, however: Senate Democrats aren't going to  give up on raising the minimum wage. The issue is not going away.   Do you know how long it has been since we raised the minimum wage in  America? Twelve years. Twelve years. The Presiding Officer knows that.  That is the last time we increased the Federal minimum wage.   Twenty-nine States have done something about it, but 21 have not, and  we don't have a change in the Federal law. That is the longest that our  Nation has ever gone without raising the minimum wage since Congress  created that wage in 1938.   During this pandemic, billionaires--people like Jeff Bezos, Elon  Musk, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg--they have done pretty well. They  have seen their net worth increase by billions, even tens of billions  of dollars. How about middle-class families? What do they see? They see  their savings dwindle, and they find it almost impossible to make ends  meet.   Fortunately, as I said, many States are acting. Washington is not. In  29 States, including Illinois, the State minimum wage is higher than  the Federal minimum wage. The Federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. In  Illinois, our State minimum wage is set to reach $15 an hour by 2025,  just like the Biden plan. Most States that have increased their minimum  wage have done so because their State legislatures have come to the  rescue. Some States, like Missouri and Arkansas, raised the minimum  wage by ballot measures.  [[Page S913]]    Americans support raising the minimum wage.   I see Senator Leahy from Vermont has come to the floor. Remember when  we used to have a colleague back there in the back row who would stand  up and bellow about the minimum wage? His name was Ted Kennedy from  Massachusetts. He didn't let a month go by or 2 months go by without  reminding us that a lot of people were struggling to get by in this  country and we sit here in Washington ignoring it, and that is why he  would push for an increase in the minimum wage.   We are told that $15 an hour is exorbitant by some and that it is  going to hurt the economy. The truth is just the opposite. Raising the  Federal minimum wage gradually to $15 an hour will strengthen the  American economy because minimum wage workers are most likely to spend  the money they get on the necessities of life as soon as they get it-- food, clothing, housing.   Last week, one of our Republican colleagues gave a speech and said  that he worked for $6 an hour when he was a kid and he is opposed to  the $15-an-hour minimum wage. Well, if you took that six bucks an hour  and just matched it with inflation, it would be up over $15 an hour  today. Reminiscing about the ``good old days'' of $6 an hour is only  done by people who don't have to live on $6 an hour.   Contrary to popular misconceptions, most minimum wage workers are not  teenagers. According to the Economic Policy Institute, 59 percent of  workers who would benefit from the Federal minimum wage are women-- women. They are taking a beating in this pandemic. They stay at home to  watch the kids who can't go to school, trying to deal with daycare that  has closed down, losing their own jobs--that is the reality.   Many mothers--two-thirds of them are the sole or primary breadwinners  in their family and count on the minimum wage. Nearly one in four  workers who would receive a raise under the $15 Federal minimum wage is  a Black or Latina woman.   During this pandemic, America has relied on minimum wage workers to  do the hard work and dangerous work in the pandemic. Do you want to  know the real pandemic heroes? Do you want to reduce poverty and raise  opportunity in America? Pay workers a living wage. Allow workers to  share the economic prosperity they are creating with their dedication  and labor.   At this moment, we may not have a path, but I hope we can find one.  It is time for us to raise the minimum wage, to give the American  workers the real wage they need to survive, and to show that we really  do value the dignity of work.   I yield the floor.
