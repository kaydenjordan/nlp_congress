 Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Aderholt for his remarkable work on  this bill, particularly under the trying circumstances in which we find  ourselves.   One area of concern I would like to touch on is the Medicare wage  index. The wage index is unfair to rural southern States like Alabama.   Alabama has one of the lowest reimbursement rates in the Nation. Even  worse, Mobile and Baldwin Counties, which I represent, face a huge  struggle with the labor market since they are so close to Florida and  competing with Florida's higher reimbursement rate.   A small adjustment to this classification for Mobile and Baldwin  Counties would level the playing field at a time when hiring and  retaining healthcare workers is at such a critical stage. It would also  address the massive population growth that we are having in these  counties and the increasingly older population on the Alabama Gulf  Coast.   The reclassification is carefully designed to address this unique  situation. These carve-outs have been accomplished for decades in  higher reimbursement States while lowering the reimbursement for States  that need it the most and that have been ignored. To achieve more fair  funding in healthcare, especially in a unique situation like Mobile and  Baldwin Counties, a reclassification is the right thing to do.   Mr. Chair, I support this bill, and I hope that by working together,  we can address these critical issues and ensure a brighter future for  our communities.
