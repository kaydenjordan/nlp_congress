 Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to add my appreciation to  the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his leadership in moving  this bill forward and certainly to our friend and one who has served  this Nation in many ways, Congressman Crow, for his continued  consideration of our friends in Afghanistan.   As the co-chair and founder of the Afghanistan Caucus, I have gone to  Afghanistan many, many times in the early years. I know the people in  Afghanistan truly love democracy. I know the women and children want  education, and I know that in the midst of our decision on the longest- serving war, we must find that pathway to be able to ensure democracy  prevails, both in terms of the democratic leadership of government but  also in the lives of the people.   I hesitate to read this language: ``Gunfire erupts. At least a dozen  men are seen shot to death amid cries of `Allahu Akbar', God is great.   ``The victims were members of an Afghan Special Forces unit: their  executioners, the Taliban. The summary killings took place on June 16  in the town of Dawlat Abad in Faryab Province, close to Afghanistan's  border with Turkmenistan.'' It is, of course, a difficult thing to read  and to understand.   But as we begin to write the democratic principles of a constitution  so many years ago--prior to this Nation going to Iraq--people were  interested and excited about their life. Women were elected as  parliamentarians. In fact, they prided themselves on a number of  parliamentarians who happened to be women.   In the instance of that leaving Afghanistan the first time, we found  that those women, many going to their districts, were killed. Schools  for children that girls were in, schools that I took books to, were  actually burned to the ground.   So those who stood by us, those who guided our troops, those who  translated for us, and those who took us into the villages--because  many of you know the stories of our soldiers going in with money. That  was the policy at that time--this bill specifically acknowledges their  leadership.   I include in the Record three articles referencing this important  issue.                  [From Human Rights Watch, Apr. 1, 2021]          Afghanistan: Taliban Target Journalists, Women in Media         New York.--Taliban forces are deliberately targeting       journalists and other media workers, including women, in,       Human Rights Watch said today. Threats and attacks  [[Page H3812]]       against journalists across the country have increased sharply       since talks began between the Afghan government and the       Taliban, heightening concerns about preserving freedom of       expression and the media in any peace settlement.        Human Rights Watch found that Taliban commanders and       fighters have engaged in a pattern of threats, intimidation,       and violence against members of the media in areas where the       Taliban have significant influence, as well as in Kabul.       Those making the threats often have an intimate knowledge of       a journalist's work, family, and movements and use this       information to either compel them to self-censor, leave their       work altogether, or face violent consequences. Provincial and       district-level Taliban commanders and fighters also make oral       and written threats against journalists beyond the areas they       control. Journalists say that the widespread nature of the       threats has meant that no media workers feel safe.        ``A wave of threats and killings has sent a chilling       message to the Afghan media at a precarious moment as Afghans       on all sides get set to negotiate free speech protections in       a future Afghanistan,'' said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia       director. ``By silencing critics through threats and       violence, the Taliban have undermined hopes for preserving an       open society in Afghanistan.''        Human Rights Watch interviewed 46 members of the Afghan       media between November 2020 and March 2021, seeking       information on the conditions under which they work,       including threats of physical harm. Those interviewed       included 42 journalists in Badghis, Ghazni, Ghor, Helmand,       Kabul, Kandahar, Khost, Wardak, and Zabul provinces and four       who had left Afghanistan due to threats.        In a number of cases that Human Rights Watch documented,       Taliban forces detained journalists for a few hours or       overnight. In several cases they or their colleagues were       able to contact senior Taliban officials to intercede with       provincial and district-level commanders to secure their       release, indicating that local commanders are able to take       decisions to target journalists on their own without approval       from senior Taliban military or political officials.        Taliban officials at their political office in Doha, Qatar,       have denied that their forces threaten the media and say that       they require only that journalists respect Islamic values.       But Taliban commanders throughout Afghanistan have threatened       journalists specifically for their reporting. The commanders       have considerable autonomy to carry out punishments,       including targeted killings.        Women journalists, especially those appearing on television       and radio, face particular threats. The recent wave of       violent attacks has driven several prominent women       journalists to give up their profession or leave Afghanistan       altogether. Female reporters may be targeted not only for       issues they cover but also for challenging perceived social       norms prohibiting women from being in a public role and       working outside the home.        Journalists outside the country's main cities are       especially vulnerable to attacks because they are more       exposed and lack even the minimal protection that a larger       Afghan media, government, and international presence       provides. However, as the fighting has increasingly       encroached on major cities, these have offered decreasing       protection to journalists seeking safety from the violence in       their home districts.        A journalist covering the fighting in Helmand province said       that one of his sources told him the Taliban were looking for       him and he should lie low. ``The majority of Afghan       journalists feel intimidated and threatened,'' he said. ``All       the journalists are scared because everyone feels like they       could be next.''        Residents of Taliban-held areas have long expressed fear of       retaliation if they complain about the way Taliban forces       carry out military operations or enforce restrictions. In a       June 2020 report, Human Rights Watch documented severe       restrictions in areas under Taliban control, including limits       on freedom of expression and the media.        The Taliban leadership should immediately cease       intimidation, threats, and attacks against journalists and       other media workers, Human Rights Watch said. They should       urgently provide clear, public directives to all Taliban       members to end all forms of violence against journalists and       other media workers, and intimidation, harassment, and       punishment of Afghans who have criticized Taliban policies.       The Taliban leadership should also explicitly reject violence       against women in the media.        The United Nations and governments supporting the Intra-      Afghan Negotiations should publicly press the Taliban       leadership to adopt these recommendations, and provide       increased support, including protection, to independent media       organizations and journalists in Afghanistan, especially       those facing threats.        ``It's not enough for Taliban officials in Doha to issue       blanket denials that they're targeting journalists when       Taliban forces on the ground continue to intimidate, harass,       and attack reporters for doing their jobs,'' Gossman said.       ``Countries supporting the peace process should press for       firm commitments from all parties to protect journalists,       including women, and uphold the right to free expression in       Afghanistan.''                       Taliban Threats to Afghan Media         Although the Taliban routinely deny responsibility for       attacks on journalists, the Afghan Journalists Security       Committee (AJSC) has said:        Since the beginning of the spike in targeted killings in       early November [2020], supporters of the group [Taliban] have       welcomed the killings of journalists on social media, calling       these killings in many cases a religious duty. Taliban       supporters accuse journalists of being agents of Western       countries, and corrupted by Western values, thereby       legitimizing any violence against journalists and the media       as not only being permissible but a key part of their war.               Taliban Threats Related to Reporting on the War         Taliban commanders and fighters have long targeted the       media, accusing them of being aligned with the Afghan       government or international military forces. If journalists       report unfavorably about Taliban actions or military       operations, the Taliban often accuse them of being spies.       District and provincial-level Taliban commanders have also       criticized journalists for not reporting incidents such as       civilian casualties from government airstrikes. Journalists       have said that the role some of them play as influential and       prominent figures in many communities has made them targets       of the Taliban. By attacking them the Taliban effectively       threaten all local media. A journalist in Helmand said:        If the more prominent journalists are targeted first, the       other journalists, who might be less influential or       prominent, are automatically intimidated and fear for their       lives . . . . Pro-Taliban accounts on social media . . .       explicitly issue warnings to other journalists, along the       lines of ``learn something from the death of this       journalist''--you can be next.        The effect on Afghan media has been profound. The killings       and threats have generated fear among journalists and media       workers, many of whom have altered their work patterns in an       effort to mitigate the danger or try to be less visible.        Taliban pressure on the media is an apparent part of an       effort to shape public debate about the war at a time of       heightened political tensions surrounding the peace talks.       Local journalists said Taliban commanders and fighters call       them to complain about published reports, questioning why a       certain issue was covered in a certain way. A journalist in       Kandahar said:        The Taliban warned me about reporting on casualties related       to a suicide attack. They wanted me to say that a lot of       people got killed but I just reported the attacker dying . .       . The Taliban threatened a couple of journalists over the       last couple years for not reporting on assassinations. They       say, 'Why don't you report the actual number?' When we argue       with them that it is the correct number, they threaten us.        When one journalist reported a Taliban attack on a civilian       facility in Kandahar, he said that within minutes he received       death threats and other warnings on his phone. The Taliban       called him to say that they had not targeted civilians but a       nearby government checkpost. The journalist said that he       lives in fear that the Taliban might still come after him.       Other journalists in Kandahar have reported being followed by       Taliban fighters. Because of such confrontations, journalists       often self-censor their stories.        In Helmand, Taliban commanders targeted journalists who       reported on military operations during a Taliban offensive in       October. Taliban forces attacked the outskirts of Lashkargah       city, overrunning Afghan government checkpoints until US       airstrikes drove them back. In the months before he was       killed by an improvised explosive device (IED) on November       11, Elyas Dayee, a journalist, had received multiple threats       from Taliban commanders in Helmand, warning him to stop his       reporting on their military operations. Another reporter       covering the fighting said that the morning after his report       came out, a Taliban commander called and accused him of       publishing reports against the Islamic Emirates and warned       that he would face consequences.                          The Nature of the Threats         In Taliban-controlled provinces, threats often come from       local commanders with knowledge of the journalist's family,       work habits, and movements. These commanders maintain       individual contact with journalists and editors, and usually       communicate these threats by phone or through social media.        A radio presenter in Zabul province said that he and his       colleagues routinely receive threats from the Taliban       accusing them of giving the government publicity. The callers       always know details about the journalists they call,       including their jobs, family members' names, and often their       addresses. One caller told him that he should either leave       the area or work for the Taliban. When he refused the caller       told him he should ``count down to his death.'' He said his       relatives also receive these threats and are told to       communicate them to him.        In Ghazni province, reporters say that they have been       threatened and intimidated by various groups and do not know       who is behind every attack. However, despite official denials       from the Taliban leadership, comments by Taliban commanders       and fighters on social media have led journalists to suspect       that the Taliban are responsible for many attacks. These       commanders generally have considerable autonomy to plan and       carry out military operations independently.        The Afghanistan Journalists Safety Committee said that in       Ghazni province, the  [[Page H3813]]       Taliban had instructed the majority of the local media       outlets that they would only be permitted to continue media       activities if they followed Taliban directives. Another       journalist in Ghazni said that the Taliban commanders in the       province object to any content that is negative or critical       about them. Journalists whose reporting is perceived as       favorable to the Afghan government may immediately become a       target. Leaving their jobs is often their only recourse.        On December 21, Rahmatullah Nekzad, head of the Ghazni       journalists' union, was fatally shot as he walked from his       home to a local mosque. Although the Taliban spokesman,       Zabihullah Mujahid, denied that the group was responsible for       the attack, Nekzad had been receiving threats from local       Taliban commanders since at least 2019. He said in early       December, that the Afghan National Directorate of Security       (NDS), the country's intelligence agency, informed him that       he and 15 other journalists in Ghazni were at risk of a       Taliban attack. He described the threats he received:        I use a social media account to upload daily news. Some       local Taliban called me to accuse me of running social media       pages that post anti-Taliban news . . . Their argument was       that every time you post something on your wall, these . . .       are also your accounts. They also threatened people who       commented on the post.        In another case in mid-December, Taliban forces stopped the       vehicle in which a local journalist was traveling. He called       a contact, who then contacted a Taliban official. As a result       of this intervention, the local Taliban released him. While       he was in their custody, the Taliban accused him of working       for the government's intelligence agency and for       ``foreigners.''        Journalists have also been threatened for reporting on       Taliban abuses. A radio correspondent from Badghis province       said that after he and his colleagues broadcast a report       about the Taliban extorting payments from highway drivers,       the journalists began to receive threats:        In addition to the radio, we have a Facebook page where we       publish the news of the day. After I posted this story, one       of the comments read: ``The martyrs of the Islamic Emirate       will soon kill the employees of this media station.'' The       same message came in [Facebook] Messenger. Since then, we       report less news on Facebook now. Badghis's capital is a very       small city. Everyone knows each other and I have no doubt       that they also know the address of our office.        Another journalist from Badghis said that in November, as       he was traveling from Herat to Badghis province, Taliban       fighters stopped him and forced him out of his car. They       interrogated him about whether he had cooperated with       government security forces and threatened to kill him. He       said that his family was aware that he was on the road. He       was finally released after local and ethnic Taliban elders       who knew them mediated his release. ``I am still in fear and       . . . shock from this incident,'' he said. ``Now I publish       less news of the war. Whenever I go to a press conference, I       am fearful and cautious. I only cover news from the capital       now.''        Local Taliban fighters have assaulted journalists who have       traveled into Taliban-controlled districts. A journalist from       Wardak province said that a group of Taliban fighters stopped       and beat him and another reporter, accusing them of spying       and ``going around without the Taliban's permission to take       pictures, record videos, and talk to people.'' The       journalists showed their press identification but were not       released until after they called a contact, who then informed       senior Taliban officials, who ordered them released.        Threats also come in writing. A journalist in Ghazni said       that a letter was dropped by his house ordering him to meet       with the local Taliban because his reports were not       ``neutral.'' It warned him that if he did not change, his       death was ``close.'' After the warning, he left his home       district and stayed in Kabul for a few months. Eventually he       returned home but avoided his office out of fear.        The Taliban also send cell phone text messages to comment       on media coverage, often chiding reporters that they should       have included the Taliban point of view. While criticism of       media reporting is not in itself problematic, when it comes       from an armed group with a history of killing journalists,       the messages are intimidating and create fear. ``Being a       journalist is something that can put your life in danger       without even doing anything specific to antagonize the       Taliban,'' one journalist in Ghazni said.        Journalists also receive threats when they share their       political views on social media. Taliban commanders also use       Facebook to issue threats. A journalist in Ghazni said that       shortly after he posted a government statement on a military       offensive that resulted in Taliban casualties, he received a       message from a Taliban commander demanding to speak with him:        He told me not to listen to what [government officials] say       and ordered me to come see him. I had to comply. He came with       his men in a Toyota vehicle. He threatened me and told me not       to post anything more on Facebook.        Another journalist in Ghazni had a similar experience after       using Facebook to post his report on the police killing a       suspected Taliban bomber. He received a call from a man who       said he was with the Taliban and asked him why he was       publishing inaccurate information. The man warned him that       they would watch out for what he published and that he should       not publish such reports anymore.        Local Taliban commanders issue warnings about radio and       television stations airing music programs, which they       consider prohibited, and blame journalists for this practice.       One journalist described the threats he received:        Whenever the Taliban hears about music on local radio       channels, they immediately start calling you, threatening to       kill you. They told me many times that they held court       sessions about me, proving that I am guilty of broadcasting       music. They threatened to kill me. I left this job because of       these threats.        The journalist said that local Taliban officials had also       told him not to broadcast election-related news because       elections were ``US-instigated.'' He said: ``I argued with       them for a couple of months that this is not my personal       choice but the station's editorial decision. Then the Taliban       asked for my boss' number and threatened him until he left.''       Another Ghazni reporter said he had received at least six       threats in which callers warned him of vague consequences if       he did not remove music or make other changes to the       programs.        Threatening to harm relatives is a common tactic to spread       fear. A journalist in Khost said that he received threatening       calls from unknown numbers, some accusing him of working for       Christians, others accusing him of being a foreign spy. Some       specifically warn him that they know his relatives and where       he lives:        I am terrified but cannot do anything about it . . . One of       my relatives said that I should leave [journalism] because he       is scared . . . I cannot carry on with my work. I cannot go       outside freely. A caller shared a lot of information about me       as proof that they have been watching me--he told me my name,       my father's name, where I work, and the address of my house .       . . after a few days, I got a message saying ``the path you       have chosen is not the right path, so you should move on from       it or else we will decide what to do with you.''        For the time being, the journalist has changed his phone       hoping to prevent further threats.                    Taliban Threats to Women in the Media         The Afghan Journalists Safety Committee reported that 14       women working for media outlets in Afghanistan were       threatened or violently attacked in 2020. An increasing       number of Afghan women in journalism have left the profession       because of worsening security and threats, a trend that       emerged after 2015 and has accelerated.        The Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP), an armed       group affiliated with the Islamic State (also known as ISIS),       took responsibility for killing four women journalists and       media workers, including Malala Maiwand, the first woman TV       presenter for Enikass News, on December 10, and the March 2       killings of Mursal Waheedi, Saadia Sadat, and Shahnaz Raufi,       who worked at Enikass News dubbing foreign language news       reports.        It is often not clear whether the ISKP, the Taliban, or       other groups are responsible for some threats and attacks       against women. In Ghazni province, the Taliban have       instructed media outlets that the hosts of entertainment       programs should not be women, and that no music should be       broadcasted.        Farahnaz Forotan, one of Afghanistan's best-known       journalists noted for her hard-hitting interviews on Tolo       News, left the country in November after hearing that she was       on a Taliban blacklist and would soon be killed.        She said that the Taliban:        do not accept free media, and, in many events, they had       rejected being interviewed by women. The reason they wanted       to kill me, was because as a woman I am not accepted       according to their values . . . The situation in Kabul is       very scary. I know four journalists in Kandahar who left       their jobs. The local media does not reflect it because they       cannot. They are being threatened and the government cannot       provide protection . . . Every morning I check messages to       make sure that everyone is safe. I live with fear--it is very       difficult to live with the fear of losing a loved one.        Another Kabul-based journalist had worked as a producer for       a television news outlet but left her job in mid-2020 after       receiving threats. She said:        The Taliban threatened me a couple of times on the phone,       and they told me to leave my job. I also found a letter from       the Taliban in a hole in our door. The letter repeated that I       must not work anymore for news agencies because this job       doesn't suit me morally. If you continue, then you have no       right to complain [about the consequences].                                   ____                   [From the New York Times, July 22, 2021]  U.S. Scrambles To Move Translators From Afghanistan While Leaving Many                                  in Limbo          An additional 4,000 Afghans who worked with American       forces, many of them interpreters, had been approved to       relocate to the United States with their families in light of       the withdrawal of U.S. troops, State Department officials       said on Wednesday.        But officials added that evacuations were only taking place       out of Kabul, the capital, and any eligible Afghans in remote       areas were on their own in figuring out how to make the       difficult, and likely dangerous,  [[Page H3814]]       journey if they wanted to take advantage of the offer.        ``In order to come on an evacuation flight, they would have       to get themselves to Kabul,'' a senior official, who       requested anonymity in order to discuss the plan in detail,       said on a call with reporters. ``Obviously, we don't have       extensive U.S. military presence. We don't have the ability       to provide transportation for them.''        ``If they're staying in the north of the country and they       don't feel safe staying in Afghanistan, they could go to a       neighboring country'' and finish their application process       there, the official added.        The United States also will not provide security to       applicants outside Kabul, many of whom are under direct       threat from the Taliban for cooperating with coalition forces       during the war.        With the American military in the final phases of       withdrawing from Afghanistan, the White House has come under       pressure to protect Afghan allies and speed up the process of       providing them with special immigrant visas, and President       Biden has vowed to do so. There have been about 20,000       applicants for the special visa program.        This month, 2,500 Afghans will be sent in stages to an Army       base in Fort Lee, Va., south of Richmond, where they will       wait roughly 10 days for final processing. The next 4,000       applicants, who need further approvals, will go with their       families to other countries to complete the visa process       before coming to the United States, the senior official said.        The official did not indicate which countries those       applicants would be sent to complete the visa process.        The House is expected to pass legislation this week       increasing the number of State Department special immigrant       visas and streamlining the application process.                                   ____                     [From Time Magazine, June 15, 2021]             We Must Help the Afghan Interpreters Who Helped Us                            (By Florent Groberg)         Groberg received the Medal of Honor during combat       operations in Afghanistan, and is on the Advisory Board of       With Honor Action.

Kennedy, Major Walter D. Gray, and USAID Foreign Service       Officer Mr. Ragaei Abdelfattah. I think about them every day.        The blast knocked me out. I woke up as my medic strapped a       tourniquet to my leg and turned to my Afghan interpreter to       assist with bandages. Patrol after patrol, year after year,       for twenty years, our Afghan interpreters have stood by our       side in harm's way. Now we have a choice to stand by them.        Taliban militants and terrorists have long targeted our       interpreters, including their wives and children. By the time       the U.S. withdraws from Afghanistan in September 2021, there       will be little defense left for these loyal allies.        Another one of my Afghan interpreters reached out to me       last week. He made it out of Afghanistan but his wife and       kids are trapped and targeted. ``The situation is getting       worse day by day in Afghanistan. I am worried for my wife and       kids,'' he wrote, ``Please help.''        More than 17,000 Afghans who worked with U.S. forces, not       to mention their family members, are still waiting for a       decision from the U.S. Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program.       The process is mired in a maddening bureaucracy. Many have       waited for years after going through security checks with       practically every U.S. government agency imaginable, often at       their own expense for health screenings and other       requirements. The situation has only become more dire of late       with the U.S. Embassy in Kabul halting visa applicant       interviews because of an escalating COVID-19 outbreak in       Afghanistan.        Every soldier I have spoken with who served in Afghanistan       supports granting asylum for loyal Afghan interpreters who       have taken all the necessary security steps and are seeking       this emergency asylum. Not only is granting asylum the right       thing to do, it also benefits the U.S. by accepting talented       and hardworking people, many of whom have already put it all       on the line for our country.        Members of the For Country Caucus in the U.S. House are       leading the charge, including Democratic Representatives       Jason Crow, Jared Golden, and Seth Moulton, and Republicans       Don Bacon, Adam Kinzinger, Peter Meijer, and Michael Waltz.       These veterans have formed a task force and called on the       White House, State Department, and Defense Department to       immediately create a plan that can be executed before the       final withdrawal of U.S. forces this September. Senator       Jeanne Shaheen and U.S. Army veterans Senator Joni Ernst and       Senator Jack Reed are forming a bipartisan coalition in the       Senate.        ``My concern is very simple,'' Representative Crow said,       ``And that is if we pull out and don't protect our Afghan       partners, many of them will be killed.''        Earlier this year, The Atlantic reported that Taliban       militants hunted down and killed ``Mohammad,'' an interpreter       who worked with U.S. forces for a decade and then spent       nearly another decade trying to get through the SIV process       with his wife and kids. Mohammad's family just learned they       finally have been approved for humanitarian parole. They are       scheduled to be resettled in Texas shortly. My hope is we       will hear many more stories of brave Afghan families,       including that of my own interpreter, who will be granted       asylum and can begin the next chapter of their lives in peace       and shared prosperity.        This will only happen if the U.S. steps up and protects the       interpreters and families under threat. Our history points us       to solutions. The Ford Administration evacuated over 130,000       Vietnamese to Guam at the end of the Vietnam War. The Clinton       Administration did the same for Iraqi Kurds during Saddam       Hussein's regime.        Whether through an emergency evacuation, an expedited SIV       process, an expansion of other refugee and humanitarian       programs, or a combination of all of these, the Biden       administration should urgently make a plan and execute it.        I am blessed to be a first-generation American and U.S.       Army veteran who served with patriots, some of whom made the       ultimate sacrifice. Our Afghan interpreters are patriots,       too. Now is the time to open our arms and stand by them,       their wives, and their children.     Mr. Speaker, I support the Afghan Special Immigrant  Visa program, and I support its increased numbers. I ask my colleagues:  Don't stop here. Let's keep going. These are our friends, and democracy  must prevail.   Mr. Speaker, against the backdrop of a war that has demanded  sacrifice and summoned patriotism, I rise in unequivocal support of  H.R. 3985, ``The Allies Act of 2021,'' which honors the contributions  of our allies in Afghanistan by strengthening the Afghan Special  Immigration Visa (SIV) Program.   I wish to recognize my distinguished colleague, the gentleman from  Colorado, Congressman Crow, who valiantly served three tours of duty in  Iraq and Afghanistan, for leading this bipartisan effort to uphold our  commitment to our partners in Afghanistan.   This piece of legislation, which I am proud to co-sponsor, comes as  we conclude a multigenerational war that has accomplished its principle  objectives: rendering justice to those responsible for 9/11 and making  sure that no attack on the homeland ever emerges from Afghanistan.   Over the course of achieving this mission, we found critical allies  and made invaluable friends, among them those who leveraged their  skills and knowledge to protect our troops from harm.   The Afghan Special Immigrant (SIV) Program, created in 2009 to  provide safety for Afghan interpreters, contractors, and security  personnel assisting U.S. efforts in the country, is more than a  program.   It is a promise--a promise to our allies that when they have our  back, we have theirs.   Specifically, the bill improves the SIV application process by:   amending the credible threat requirement;   aligning applicant standards;   clarifying eligibility for certain Afghans;   streamlining duplicative procedures, and,   increasing protections for surviving spouses.   Reports on the ground indicate those Afghan nationals who worked on  behalf of the U.S. Government face extreme danger.   Time is of the essence, and this bill removes our friends and allies  from the bureaucratic barriers of additional lengthy paperwork to  establish a credible threat, when we already know that such a threat  exists for individuals with verified ties to the U.S. government.   Additionally, to qualify for the Afghan SIV Program under the current  law, Afghan nationals who were employed by the International Security  Assistance Force (ISAF) or Resolute Support (RS) must have performed  ``sensitive and trusted'' work.   This employment requirement was removed for U.S. Government employees  in the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act, but it remains for  individuals employed under ISAF and RS.   All current applicants must also submit an I-360 petition to USCIS  after completing the State Department's Chief of Mission process.   This redundancy creates duplicative applications and introduces a gap  in the process that allows for fraudulent petitions, ultimately slowing  down the processing time for all applicants.   The Allies Act of 2021 aligns standards across all types of  employment and gives the Department of Homeland Security the  flexibility to not require I-360 petitions in cases where applicants  have already proven eligibility through the Chief of Mission Process.   By making standards uniform, clear, and nonduplicative for all  applicants, this bill streamlines application processing and ensures a  more efficient safety plan for all our allies.   The bill also expands the types of individuals eligible for the SIV.   In practice, the original Afghan SIV statute only includes Afghan  nationals who worked under U.S. government contracts.   Yet we received support from many Afghan nationals under  nongovernmental cooperative agreements and grants, including many key  contacts working on critical democracy, human  [[Page H3815]]  rights, and governance work to assist the U.S. mission in Afghanistan.   This bill makes clear that Afghan nationals that worked under such  non-governmental agreements to advance the U.S. mission are eligible  for the Afghan SIV program.   In addition to previously excluded contractors, we must also  acknowledge the danger surviving spouses face and place them at the  front and center in our migration support efforts as well.   Currently, surviving spouses of deceased SIV applicants are not  allowed to continue through the process if the primary SIV applicant  died before visa approval.   The immediate families of our allies are also our allies and we must  remove this dangerous obstacle for them to reach safety.   The Allies Act of 2021 allows family members of deceased primary  applicants to continue through the process if their spouse had applied  for Chief of Mission approval.   We cannot leave our Afghan allies and their spouses vulnerable to the  imminent threat of revenge from the Taliban.   They simply are not safe at home and they need our help.   The adaptations and amendments that this act offers would facilitate  a path to safety and freedom for nearly 20,000 of on-the-ground  partners whose work made possible all our advancements in that country.   Madam Speaker, I urge us to act with compassion and honor our core  American value of promoting freedom for all, for it was our reverence  for this value that characterized our extended presence in Afghanistan  in the first place.   It is time for us to ensure the safety and lives of our friends and  allies in Afghanistan.
