 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight one of the many  reasons for my objection on Wisconsin's election certification.   A recent story out of Green Bay has highlighted possible  improprieties during this past November's election. The story alleges  that campaign operatives acted as de facto members of the city clerk's  office and disrupted a fair election process.   I call on State officials to investigate this serious matter, as  election integrity is the priority for an overwhelming majority of my  constituents.   If signed into law, the recently passed radical H.R. 1 will not only  codify the types of issues we have seen across Wisconsin, it will  disenfranchise many voters across our great State and our country.                            ____________________
