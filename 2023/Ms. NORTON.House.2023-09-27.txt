 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment would allocate $10 million for  research, development, test, and evaluation for the Space Force, with  the intent that the funds be used for the Space Force Rocket Systems  Launch Program. This funding would continue the ongoing single-stage- to-orbit propulsion research that we have funded over the past 3 years  and ensure that the commercial space access provider supply chain is as  large as possible.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
