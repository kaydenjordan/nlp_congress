 Madam Speaker, South Florida is hurting. My  community is calling me in tears because they don't know how they are  going to make payments or keep their businesses afloat, and hospital  workers are afraid of losing their jobs. And to make matters worse,  Floridians--over 1 million Floridians--still cannot access unemployment  benefits.   Although I am happy to support this legislation to support our small  businesses, we need to make sure that it is those small mom-and-pop  businesses, minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses, veteran- owned businesses, that receive that funding. We have not done enough  for America. We need to continue to work.
