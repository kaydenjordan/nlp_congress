 Mr. Speaker, I think that today is yet another sad day  here in the House of Representatives for the people of our country,  because what is being brought forward is the same bill that we debated  and that went down because of the weight of the problems and the  cruelty of that bill. It is the same thing with a few more poison pills  in it.    People are going to have to pay higher premiums and deductibles, and  it is going to increase what comes out of their pocket; there is going  to be less coverage; 24 million people will lose their coverage--that  remains in this bill--and key protections are gutted, American people:  emergency rooms, maternity care, opioid, mental health care, a string  of things that you want in your insurance coverage, a crushing age tax  for seniors.   Now, there is a real hypocrisy here. Every single Member of Congress  has been enrolled in the Affordable Care Act. I want to know which one  of you dropped out of it. It was good enough for you--one person,  great. Two people, big deal. It was good enough for you, but it is not  good enough for your constituents.   And you know what? Who is standing with you? Not the doctors in our  country, not the AARP to seniors, not nurses, not the cancer  association, not anyone. This bill violates the American people.    Mr. Speaker, include in for the Record a letter from  common sense kids action:                                       Common sense kids action,                                                     April 25, 2017.      Re H.R. 1628--OPPOSE       Hon. Diane Black,      Chairwoman, House Budget Committee, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Black: On behalf of the millions of       American kids and families who rely on comprehensive,       dependable health insurance to stay healthy and to get       medical treatment when they need it, we are writing to       respectfully express our strong opposition to your bill, H.R.       1628, the American Health Care Act (AHCA). We have added this       bill to our Common Sense Legislative Ratings Tool as an       ``Against Kids'' bill and will communicate our position to       our parent and teacher members.        Common Sense is the nation's leading independent nonprofit       organization dedicated to helping kids thrive in a rapidly       changing world. We empower parents, teachers, and       policymakers by providing unbiased information, trusted       advice, and innovative tools to help them harness the power       of media and technology as a positive force in all kids'       lives. The policy arm, Common Sense Kids Action, is building       a movement of parents, teachers, business leaders, and others       dedicated to making kids our nation's top priority by       supporting policies at the state and federal level that       contribute to the building blocks of opportunity for kids.       Access to affordable and quality medical care for kids is       certainly one of those key building blocks.        Thanks to current law, including the Affordable Care Act,       Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP),       95% of young children in the U.S. today have health       insurance. That's a remarkable achievement. With health       insurance, parents are more likely to seek medical care for       themselves and for their children, helping to prevent       illnesses from developing and shortening their duration when       they occur. However, the AHCA will result in 24 million fewer       Americans having coverage, including millions of children.       This jeopardizes the health and well-being of America's kids       and will alarm any parent who understands the importance of       health insurance for their children and family. The       Affordable Care Act certainly needs to be fixed, but if       Congress has the goal of making sure that all families and       businesses have access to affordable and comprehensive health       insurance, it could improve the law for everyone without       forcing millions of kids and their parents to lose access to       critical medical care.        As Congress continues to grapple with this issue, health       insurance programs, we think these facts about children's       health insurance from the Congressional Budget Office and the       Georgetown University Center for Children and Families are       important to keep in mind:        Ninety-five percent of children age 0-5 are insured today.        Forty-five million of those children access health care       through two programs: about 37 million through Medicaid (a       federal-state program) and 8 million through CHIP, the       Children's Health Insurance Program.        Children are the single-largest group of persons covered       under Medicaid.        Under the Affordable Care Act, as you know, many states       expanded Medicaid with help from the federal government,       increasing coverage for kids and families, including coverage       for mental health care.        Changes being considered, including under the AHCA, would       cut funding to Medicaid by as much as $880 billion over the       next 10 years.        The AHCA, when compared with current law, would result in       24 million fewer Americans with health insurance by the year       2026.        Even with changes recently suggested to your bill,       America's kids will be best served by strengthening the       Affordable Care Act and preserving Medicaid and CHIP, not by       repealing the Affordable Care Act and block granting or       establishing a per capita cap on Medicaid. We urge you to       keep our children's future foremost in your thinking,       withdraw your bill, and work on a bipartisan basis to support       measures that protect and strengthen children's health care.       Thank you for your consideration of our views and we would be       happy to talk with you at any time about this and other       issues that matter to America's children and families.            Sincerely,                                                       Danny Weiss,                                    Vice President, Federal Policy.
