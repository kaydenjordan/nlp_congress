 Mr. President, today I come to the floor to address my  colleagues about the bipartisan resolution of disapproval that I  introduced on January 30, along with Senator Crapo and 24 other  cosponsors. This resolution now has 32 cosponsors, and of course this  resolution of disapproval is absolutely necessary.   The resolution of disapproval is a procedure, as we know, under the  Congressional Review Act for repealing executive branch regulations.  The regulation at issue here in this disapproval resolution was issued  by the Social Security Administration under President Obama. This  regulation unfairly stigmatizes people with disabilities. If the  regulation is not repealed, it will allow the agency to very unfairly  deprive Social Security recipients of their Second Amendment rights.  The regulation would result in disability recipients being reported to  the National Instant Criminal Background Check System as ineligible to  own a firearm and, thus, have their Second Amendment rights violated.   This is essentially a national gun ban list. The agency accomplishes  this by doing two things: determining if a person has a disorder on a  vague ``mental disorders'' list, and, two, appointing a representative  payee to manage benefit payments.   This process has been in place for years to merely assign a  representative payee. That is merely someone who is authorized to deal  with the bureaucracy on behalf of that Social Security recipient to  help a recipient with their finances. Now it is being used to report  beneficiaries to a list so that they cannot buy or own a gun. Of  course, once on that list, individuals are prohibited, as I have  already inferred, from purchasing, owning, and possessing firearms,  thus violating Second Amendment rights.   The regulation is flawed beyond any kind of repair. It results in  reporting  [[Page S1143]]  people to the gun ban list that should not be on that list at all. It  deprives those people of their constitutional rights and, in a very  important way, violates their constitutional rights without even due  process.   Under current Federal law, one must first be deemed ``mentally  defective'' before being reported to the gun ban list. However, the  mental disorder list in this regulation is filled with vague  characteristics that do not fit into the Federal ``mentally defective''  standard.   The disorder list is inconsistent with the Federal mentally defective  standard. More importantly, the list was never designed to regulate  firearms. As such, it is improper to use it for that purpose.   Many of the disorders on the list are unrelated to gun safety. For  example, the disorders list includes eating disorders, disorders that  merely impact sleep or cause restlessness, and even disorders that  could cause ``feelings of inadequacy.''   Because the Second Amendment is a fundamental right, the government  must have a very compelling reason to regulate, and the regulation must  be very narrowly tailored. It unfairly stigmatizes people with  disabilities. The government is essentially saying that a person with a  disability, such as an eating disorder, is more likely to be violent  and should no longer be allowed to own a gun.   There is no evidence to support that general idea and, consequently,  people being denied constitutional rights without due process. And if a  specific individual is likely to be violent due to the nature of their  mental illness, then the government should have to prove it. It is  pretty basic constitutional law: The government should have to carry  the burden before denying a constitutional right.   The National Council on Disability--and that happens to be a  nonpartisan and independent Federal agency--has said this:         The rule stigmatizes a group of people who are not likely       to perpetuate the kind of violence the rule hopes to address.       Furthermore, it deprives a much broader class of individuals       of a constitutional right than was intended by Federal law.    In addition, the American Civil Liberties Union has said:         We oppose this rule because it advances and reinforces the       harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, a       vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent. There is no       data to support a connection between the need for a       representative payee . . . and a propensity toward gun       violence.    That was a quote from the American Civil Liberties Union.   The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities--and that is a  coalition of 100 national disability groups--shares the same concerns  about regulations, and I will quote from them:         The current public dialogue is replete with inaccurate       stereotyping of people with mental disabilities as violent       and dangerous, and there is a real concern that the kind of       policy change encompassed by this rule will reinforce those       unfounded assumptions.    In other words, those unfounded assumptions are about who might be  disabled or not.   I ask unanimous consent to have these letters printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                 National Council on Disability,                                   Washington, DC, January 24, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker of the House, U.S. House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan: I write on       behalf of the National Council on Disability (NCD) regarding       the final rule the Social Security Administration (SSA)       released on December 19th, 2016, implementing provisions of       the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)       Improvement Amendments Act of 2007, 81 FR 91702. In       accordance with our mandate to advise the President,       Congress, and other federal agencies regarding policies,       programs, practices, and procedures that affect people with       disabilities, NCD submitted comments to SSA on the proposed       rule on June 30th, 2016. In our comments, we cautioned       against implementation of the proposed rule because:        ``[t]here is, simply put, no nexus between the inability to       manage money and the ability to safely and responsibly own,       possess or use a firearm. This arbitrary linkage not only       unnecessarily and unreasonably deprives individuals with       disabilities of a constitutional right, it increases the       stigma for those who, due to their disabilities, may need a       representative payee[.]''        Despite our objections and that of many other individuals       and organizations received by SSA regarding the proposed       rule, the final rule released in late December was largely       unchanged. Because of the importance of the constitutional       right at stake and the very real stigma that this rule       legitimizes, NCD recommends that Congress consider utilizing       the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal this rule.        NCD is a nonpartisan, independent federal agency with no       stated position with respect to gun-ownership or gun-control       other than our long-held position that restrictions on gun       possession or ownership based on psychiatric or intellectual       disability must be based on a verifiable concern as to       whether the individual poses a heightened risk of danger to       themselves or others if they are in possession of a weapon.       Additionally, it is critically important that any restriction       on gun possession or ownership on this basis is imposed only       after the individual has been afforded due process and given       an opportunity to respond to allegations that they are not       able to safely possess or own a firearm due to his or her       disability. NCD believes that SSA's final rule falls far       short of meeting these criteria.        Additionally, as NCD also cautioned SSA in our comments on       the proposed rule, we have concerns regarding the ability of       SSA to fairly and effectively implement this rule--assuming       it would be possible to do so--given the long-standing issues       SSA already has regarding long delays in adjudication and       difficulty in providing consistent, prompt service to       beneficiaries with respect to its core mission. This rule       creates an entirely new function for an agency that has long       noted that it has not been given sufficient resources to do       the important work it is already charged with doing. With all       due respect to SSA, our federal partner, this rule is simply       a bridge too far. In fact, it is conceivable that attempts to       implement this rule may strain the already scarce       administrative resources available to the agency, further       impairing its ability to carry out its core mission.        The CRA is a powerful mechanism for controlling regulatory       overreach, and NCD urges its use advisedly and cautiously. In       this particular case, the potential for real harm to the       constitutional rights of people with psychiatric and       intellectual disabilities is grave as is the potential to       undermine the essential mission of an agency that millions of       people with and without disabilities rely upon to meet their       basic needs. Therefore, in this instance, NCD feels that       utilizing the CRA to repeal the final rule is not only       warranted, but necessary.            Regards,                                                    Clyde E. Terry,      Chair.                                   ____                                   American Civil Liberties Union,                                                   February 9, 2017.      Vote YES on the Resolution of Disapproval, S.J. Res. 14           (Social Security Administration NICS Final Rule).      Vote NO on the Resolution of Disapproval, S.J. Res. 12           (Federal Acquisition Regulation/Fair Pay and Safe           Workplaces EO).        Dear Senators: On behalf of the American Civil Liberties       Union (ACLU), we urge members of the Senate to support the       resolution disapproving the final rule of the Social Security       Administration which implements the National Instant Criminal       Background Check System Improvement Amendment Acts of 2007.        Additionally we urge members to oppose the resolution of       disapproval of the rule submitted by the Department of       Defense, the General Services Administration, and NASA       relating to the Federal Acquisition Regulation that implement       the Fair Pay and Safe Workplace Executive Order 13673.      Social Security Administration (SSA)'s Implementation of the NICS     Improvement Amendment Acts of 2007 Harms People with Disabilities         In December 2016, the SSA promulgated a final rule that       would require the names of all Social Security Disability       Insurance (SSDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI)       benefit recipients--who, because of a mental impairment, use       a representative payee to help manage their benefits--be       submitted to the National Instant Criminal Background Check       System (NICS), which is used during gun purchases.        We oppose this rule because it advances and reinforces the       harmful stereotype that people with mental disabilities, a       vast and diverse group of citizens, are violent and should       not own a gun. There is no data to support a connection       between the need for a representative payee to manage one's       Social Security disability benefits and a propensity toward       gun violence. The rule further demonstrates the damaging       phenomenon of ``spread,'' or the perception that a disabled       individual with one area of impairment automatically has       additional, negative and unrelated attributes. Here, the rule       automatically conflates one disability-related       characteristic, that is, difficulty managing money, with the       inability to safely possess a firearm.        The rule includes no meaningful due process protections       prior to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.       The determination by SSA line staff that a beneficiary needs       a representative payee to manage their money benefit is       simply not an ``adjudication'' in any ordinary meaning of the       word. Nor is it a determination that the person ``lacks the       mental capacity to contract or manage his own affairs'' as       required  [[Page S1144]]       by the NICS. Indeed, the law and the SSA clearly state that       representative payees are appointed for many individuals who       are legally competent.        We recognize that enacting new regulations relating to       firearms can raise difficult questions. The ACLU believes       that the right to own and use guns is not absolute or free       from government regulation, since firearms are inherently       dangerous instrumentalities and their use, unlike other       activities protected by the Bill of Rights, can inflict       serious bodily injury or death. Therefore, firearms are       subject to reasonable regulation in the interests of public       safety, crime prevention, maintaining the peace,       environmental protection, and public health. We do not oppose       regulation of firearms as long as it is reasonably related to       these legitimate government interests.        At the same time, regulation of firearms and individual gun       ownership or use must be consistent with civil liberties       principles, such as due process, equal protection, freedom       from unlawful searches, and privacy. All individuals have the       right to be judged on the basis of their individual       capabilities, not the characteristics and capabilities that       are sometimes attributed (often mistakenly) to any group or       class to which they belong. A disability should not       constitute grounds for the automatic per se denial of any       right or privilege, including gun ownership.     Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces Regulations Advance Worker Safety and                                   Rights         The rules implementing the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces       Executive Order take an important step towards creating more       equitable and safe work conditions by ensuring that federal       contractors provide workplaces that comply with federal labor       and civil rights laws.        Employers that have the privilege of doing business with       the federal government must meet their legal obligations. The       Fair Pay and Safe Workplace regulations are crucial because       they help ensure that federal contractors behave responsibly       and ethically with respect to labor standards and civil       rights laws and that they are complying with federal labor       and employment laws such as the Fair Labor Standards Act       (which includes the Equal Pay Act), Title VII of the Civil       Rights Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and       the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and their state law       equivalents. The Executive Order also bans contractors from       forcing employees to arbitrate claims under Title VII of the       Civil Rights Act as well as claims of sexual harassment and       sexual assault.        Congress should stand with workers, increase the       accountability of federal contractors and oppose any attempts       to undo the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces regulations. These       rules will help ensure that the federal government does not       contract with employers that routinely violate workplace       health and safety protections, engage in age, disability,       race, and sex discrimination, withhold wages, or commit other       labor violations.

Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Senate Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:       The Co-Chairs of the Rights Task Force of the Consortium of       Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) urge you to support a       Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to disapprove the       Final Rule issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA)       on December 19, 2016, ``Implementation of the NICS       Improvement Amendments Act of 2007.'' This rule would require       the Social Security Administration to forward the names of       all Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) and       Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit recipients who use       a representative payee to help manage their benefits due to a       mental impairment to the National Instant Criminal Background       Check System (NICS).        The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) is the       largest coalition of national organizations working together       to advocate for Federal public policy that ensures the self-      determination, independence, empowerment, integration and       inclusion of children and adults with disabilities in all       aspects of society.        Prior to the issuance of the Final Rule, the CCD Rights       Task Force conveyed its opposition to the rule through a       letter to the Obama Administration and through the public       comment process. We--and many other members of CCD--opposed       the rule for a number of reasons, including:        The damaging message that may be sent by a SSA policy       change, which focused on reporting individuals who receive       assistance from representative payees in managing their       benefits to the NICS gun database. The current public       dialogue is replete with inaccurate stereotyping of people       with mental disabilities as violent and dangerous, and there       is a real concern that the kind of policy change encompassed       by this rule will reinforce those unfounded assumptions.        The absence of any data suggesting that there is any       connection between the need for a representative payee to       manage one's Social Security disability benefits and a       propensity toward gun violence.        The absence of any meaningful due process protections prior       to the SSA's transmittal of names to the NICS database.       Although the NICS Improvements Act of 2007 allows agencies to       transmit the names of individuals who have been       ``adjudicated'' to lack the capacity to manage their own       affairs, SSA's process does not constitute an adjudication       and does not include a finding that individuals are broadly       unable to manage their own affairs.        Based on similar concerns, the National Council on       Disability, an independent federal agency charged with       advising the President, Congress, and other federal agencies       regarding disability policy, has urged Congress to use the       Congressional Review Act to repeal this rule.        We urge Congress to act, through the CRA process, to       disapprove this new rule and prevent the damage that it       inflicts on the disability community.        On behalf of the CCD Rights Task Force, the undersigned Co-      Chairs,      Dara Baldwin,        National Disability Rights Network.      Samantha Crane,        Autistic Self-Advocacy Network.      Sandy Finucane,        Epilepsy Foundation Law.      Jennifer Mathis,        Bazelon Center for Mental Health.      Mark Richert,        American Foundation for the Blind.     Mr. President, some of the supporters of the new gun  ban have brought forth arguments to try to discredit the other side.  They have said that repealing the agency rule will allow the mentally  ill to acquire firearms.   Let me tell you why that is not true. Under this regulation, the  Social Security Administration never, ever determines a person to be  mentally ill before reporting them to this gun ban list. It does not  provide due process before reporting them to the list. Once the agency  places a person on this disorders list, it then moves to assign a  representative payee. But that is a very flawed process as well.   The former Social Security Administration inspector general said the  following last year in testimony before a committee about assigning a  representative payee. This will be a very short quote from the  inspector general: ``It's not a scientific decision; it's more of a  personal opinion.''   It is quite obvious under our Constitution's due process clause that  the personal opinion of a bureaucrat cannot be the basis for taking  away a person's Second Amendment rights.   Further, a June 2015 internal Social Security report found  significant shortcomings in the representative payee process, namely  that--and I will quote from the Social Security report--``the Social  Security Administration's capability determinations were undeveloped,  undocumented, or insufficiently documented.''   A very legitimate question can be raised: How can any of us be  comfortable allowing our fellow citizens to be subjected to such a  process, a process that leads to the violation of constitutional  rights? The regulation does not then require a formal hearing at any  point.   Federal law and other regulations require that a formal hearing take  place.   Mr. President, 18 U.S.C. 922(d)(4) requires adjudication before  depriving someone of the right to own a firearm due to mental illness.  There can be no adjudication if there is no hearing.   A 1996 ATF Federal Register Notice says ``the legislative history of  the Gun Control Act makes it clear that a formal adjudication is  necessary before firearms disabilities are incurred.''   The Obama administration knew that fundamental rights required  constitutional due process. At the bare minimum, that requires a  hearing. Yet, in this rule, no hearing is being afforded to that  individual that will eventually have their constitutional rights  abrogated. Of course, that ought to be considered not only a travesty  but a travesty on the Constitution as  [[Page S1145]]  well. The constitutional due process is entirely nonexistent because  there is absolutely no opportunity for an individual to challenge the  proceedings against them.   The American Civil Liberties Union has echoed the same concerns,  stating that ``the rule includes no meaningful due process protections  prior to the Social Security Administration's transmittal of the names  to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System database.''   The Second Amendment is very much being tossed aside without a formal  dispute process to challenge the action before the constitutional right  is abridged. On these facts alone, the regulation should be repealed.  Yet there is more.   The regulation fails to establish that a person is a danger to  themselves or a danger to others before taking away the constitutional  rights the Second Amendment allows. If a rule premised on safety is to  have any credibility, one would obviously think that the government  needs to prove a person is dangerous, but this rule fails in that  regard because it does not require the agency to find a person is, in  fact, dangerous. The Second Amendment is a fundamental right requiring  the government to carry the burden showing a person has a dangerous  mental illness. This regulation obviously and simply does not achieve  that requirement.   To be clear, however, if this regulation is repealed, Federal gun  prohibitions will still exist. Individuals who have been determined to  be a danger to themselves or others will still be prohibited from  purchasing firearms. Also, individuals who are found to have a  dangerous mental illness will be prohibited from purchasing a firearm.  A person convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor crime of domestic  violence will still be prohibited from purchasing, owning, and  possessing a firearm. The same is true for those involuntarily  committed to a mental institution.   As government expands, liberty contracts. It follows that with the  expansion of government, power is centralized here, in this island  surrounded by reality that we call Washington, DC, rather than with the  American people. Often with that centralization of power, fairness does  not necessarily follow, as demonstrated by this regulation. This Obama- era regulation is a perfect example of government wielding too much  power--the power to deny people due process, the power to deny people  their constitutional rights under the Second Amendment.   The process described herein is extremely problematic and  necessitates being done away with by the passing of this resolution of  disapproval. It is not clear that any of these disorders a person is  labeled with has anything whatsoever to do with a person's ability to  responsibly own a firearm, and there is insufficient due process to  ensure that a person actually has a given disorder that would interfere  with their safe use of a firearm. Notably, even if a representative  payee has been assigned, the individual still maintains the capacity to  contract.   Thus, the government is subject to a very low threshold to report  names to the gun list and no burden of proof is required. By contrast,  under this regulation, those who are reported to the list must prove  the negative. They have to prove that the government is wrong. They  must prove they are not a danger in order to get their name off that  gun ban list. For the government to shift the burden to the citizen  whose rights are being deprived is clearly unfair and unconstitutional.  The failure to determine if a person is mentally ill or a danger to  self or others is a material defect to this regulation, as is the  failure to afford constitutional due process. There is no reasonable  basis under this regulation to justify abridging that very important,  fundamental constitutional right, and that is why this regulation must  be repealed through the passage of this resolution of disapproval.   I yield the floor.                               Order for Recess     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. today.    Mr. President, we have a very bad regulation that has  been put out by the Social Security Administration that needs to be  obliterated, so we are using a process called the Congressional Review  Act to show Congress's displeasure with the Social Security  Administration and to get this regulation off the books.   Now, there has been a lot of talk about how the Congressional Review  Act is the wrong vehicle to repeal the disastrous regulation. So I want  to quote a contrary opinion from the National Coalition for Mental  Health Recovery saying this:         The CRA--    Meaning the Congressional Review Act--       is a powerful mechanism for controlling regulatory overreach,       and NCMHR urges its use advisedly and cautiously. In this       particular case, the potential for real harm to the       constitutional rights of people with psychiatric and       intellectual disabilities is grave as is the potential to       undermine the essential mission of an agency that millions of       people with and without disabilities rely upon to meet their       basic needs. Therefore, in this instance, NCMHR feels that       utilizing the CRA to repeal the final rule is not only       warranted, but necessary.    I would add to it that it is obviously necessary.   I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                              National Coalition for                                          Mental Health Recovery,                                   Washington, DC, January 29, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Majority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Senate Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell and Minority Leader Schumer:       I write on behalf of the National Coalition for Mental Health       Recovery (NCMHR) regarding the final rule the Social Security       Administration (SSA) released on December 19th, 2016,       implementing provisions of the National Instant Criminal       Background Check System (NICS) Improvement Amendments Act of       2007, 81 FR 91702.        In accordance with our mandate to advise the President,       Congress, and other federal agencies regarding policies,       programs, practices, and procedures that affect people with       disabilities, NCMHR submitted comments to SSA on the proposed       rule. In our comments, we cautioned against implementation of       the proposed rule because there is no causal connection       between the inability to manage money and the ability to       safely and responsibly own, possess or use a firearm. This       arbitrary linkage not only unnecessarily and unreasonably       deprives individuals with disabilities of a constitutional       right, it increases the stigma for those who, due to their       disabilities, may need a representative payee.        Despite our objections and that of many other individuals       and organizations received by SSA regarding the proposed       rule, the final rule released in late December was largely       unchanged. Because of the importance of the constitutional       right at stake and the very real stigma that this rule       legitimizes, NCMHR recommends that Congress consider       utilizing the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to repeal this       rule.        NCMHR is a nonpartisan, is nonpartisan nonprofit with no       stated position with respect to gun-ownership or gun-control       other than our long-held position that restrictions on gun       possession or ownership based on psychiatric or intellectual       disability must be based on a verifiable concern as to       whether the individual poses a heightened risk of danger to       themselves or others if they are in possession of a weapon.       Additionally, it is critically important that any restriction       on gun possession or ownership on this basis is imposed only       after the individual has been afforded due process and given       an opportunity to respond to allegations that they are not       able to safely possess or own a firearm due to his or her       disability. NCMHR believes that SSA's final rule falls far       short of meeting these criteria.        The CRA is a powerful mechanism for controlling regulatory       overreach, and NCMHR urges its use advisedly and cautiously.       In this particular case, the potential for real harm to the       constitutional rights of people with psychiatric and       intellectual disabilities is grave as is the potential to       undermine the  [[Page S1154]]       essential mission of an agency that millions of people with       and without disabilities rely upon to meet their basic needs.       Therefore, in this instance, NCMHR feels that utilizing the       CRA to repeal the final rule is not only warranted, but       necessary.            Sincerely,                                         Daniel B. Fisher, MD, PhD,                                                       Chair NCMHR.     Mr. President, there has also been talk about how  supposedly dangerous it will be if this Social Security regulation is  terminated. I don't see how that can possibly be realistic if the  Social Security Administration doesn't even determine whether a person  is dangerous in the first place--and ``dangerous'' meaning in regard to  whether or not they ought to be able to make use of the constitutional  right of the Second Amendment to own and possess firearms.   Others in this debate continue to mention that mentally ill people  will be able to acquire firearms. Now this is very important. The  Social Security Administration does not determine a person to be  mentally ill prior to reporting their names to the gun ban list, and  being on the list denies you your constitutional rights. The agency has  confirmed this in writing to my office:         Yes, you are correct. The Social Security Administration       does not diagnose individuals as mentally ill.    Supporters of this gun ban failed to address why individuals are not  provided formal due process before reporting their name to the list.  Supporters have also failed to talk about how the regulation is  inconsistent with the statutory standard of ``mental defective.''   An existing statute requires agencies to report individuals to the  gun ban list who are ineligible under current law for possessing  firearms. That requirement does not require the existence of any  regulation to be effective. So it is plainly wrong to claim, as was  said this very day by the people opposed to what we are doing, that if  the regulation is disapproved, agencies will no longer have to report  prohibited persons. The reverse, in fact, is true.   The regulation usurps unlawful authority to report people to the gun  ban list who are not barred from owning guns under current law and that  the agency is prohibited from reporting under current law, especially  without the adjudication that is required under current law.   Opponents of the regulation base their opposition on the language of  the regulation, existing law, and the Constitution, citing the  Constitution to say that you don't have a constitutional right to own  arms under the Second Amendment, which is contrary to two recent  Supreme Court decisions that verify that that applies to an individual.  That is why the regulation's supporters must resort to arguments that  lack legal and factual foundation.   Supporters of this gun ban also fail to address how overly broad this  regulation is, as written. It will capture innocent Americans, denying  innocent Americans their constitutional rights. Sadly, then, we know  how this will play out if this regulation were allowed to go forward  because we have the example of the Department of Veterans Affairs  reporting hundreds of thousands of veterans to the National Instant  Criminal Background Check System without adequate due process. That is  the same system that Social Security was going to report people to.   Veterans were reported just because some lonely bureaucrat wanted to  report them, with no opportunity to first have a neutral authority hold  a hearing, finding that that individual is dangerous or actually has a  dangerous condition. These were veterans who needed financial help  managing their benefit payments.   It is common sense that needing help with your finances should not  mean that you have surrendered a fundamental constitutional right of  self-defense that you have under the Second Amendment.   Just like the Social Security Administration, the VA does not  determine whether a veteran is dangerous before reporting his name to  the gun ban list and denying that veteran his Second Amendment  constitutional rights to own and possess firearms. The VA regulation is  eerily similar to what the Social Security Administration wants to do.   On May 17, 2016, Senator Durbin and I debated my amendment that would  require the Department of Veterans Affairs to first find veterans to be  a danger before reporting their names to the gun ban list. Now that is  common sense; isn't it? You ought to find out if they are really  dangerous before they are denied a constitutional right.   During the course of that debate, Senator Durbin admitted that the  list was broader than it should have been. He said:         I do not dispute what the Senator from Iowa suggested, that       some of these veterans may be suffering from a mental illness       not serious enough to disqualify them from owning a firearm,       but certainly many of them do.    Senator Durbin also said:         Let me just concede at the outset, reporting 174,000 names       goes too far, but eliminating--    As my legislation proposed to do--       174,000 names goes too far.    For the record, though, it wasn't really 174,000 names going too far.  It was actually 260,381 names that the VA sent to the gun ban list. Now  that happens to be 98.8 percent of all names that are in the alleged  ``mental defective'' category.   The Department of Veterans Affairs reported more names by far than  any other agency without sufficient justification. Senator Durbin's  staff and mine have met over these issues since that debate, and I  appreciate and thank him for that outreach.   Now we have the Social Security Administration problem and, through  the Congressional Review Act, we can do something about it. We don't  have to pass a separate piece of legislation, like we are going to have  to do to straighten out the VA. So the Social Security Administration  is about to make the same mistake as the VA unless we stop it right  here and right now.   If this regulation is not repealed, the agency has informed my staff  that approximately 15,000 to 75,000 beneficiaries of Social Security  may be reported annually, denying them their constitutional right to  bear, possess, and own firearms. That figure of 15,000 or even more  so--the higher figure of 75,000--will add up very quickly.   In my earlier speech today on this topic, I made clear that the  agency regulation is defective in many ways; namely, the regulation  does not require the agency to find a person dangerous or mentally ill.  The regulation provides no formal hearing before a person is reported  to the gun ban list.   Supporters have also said that repeal of this regulation will  interfere with enforcement of gun prohibition laws. Such a position is  without any merit--denying people constitutional due process.   As I made clear in my earlier speech, important Federal gun laws are  still on the books, even if the agency rule is repealed. This is so  because this new regulation is actually inconsistent with those  existing Federal gun laws. For example, individuals who have been  determined to be dangerous or mentally ill will be prohibited, as will  those convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor crime of domestic  violence, and the same for those involuntarily committed to mental  institutions.   While discussing the faults and defects of the rule, I think it is  important to highlight that the issues I have pointed out are also the  solution to the problem. If the supporters of the agency rule want the  Social Security Administration to report individuals to the gun ban  list, changes need to be made. Individuals must first be determined by  a neutral authority after a fair hearing meeting the requirements of  the U.S. Constitution. If they are dangerous and have a dangerous  mental illness, then they could constitutionally be denied that right.  Constitutional due process is a very important part of that process.   If we do not act, the agency will erroneously report tens of  thousands of people per year to the gun ban list, and not one of them  will have been adjudicated to be dangerous after a hearing with due  process, not one of them will have been adjudicated to be mentally ill  after a hearing with due process, and all of them will have had the  government's burden shifted to them to prove they are not dangerous in  order to get their name off the gun ban list. It is common sense, isn't  it? It ought to be that you are innocent until proven guilty. If you  can't have a gun, common sense tells me you ought not have  [[Page S1155]]  to prove that you can have a gun to the government; the government has  to prove that you should not have a gun.   Any way you look at it, the regulatory scheme is patently unfair. If  the government wants to regulate firearms, it needs to produce a  clearly defined regulation that is very narrowly tailored to identify  individuals who are actually dangerous and who actually have a  dangerous mental illness. The government must also afford  constitutional due process.   What we are dealing with here is a fundamental constitutional right  backed up by two Supreme Court decisions in the last 10 years. With  that type of constitutional status, the Second Amendment requires  greater effort and greater precision from the government in order to  fairly regulate how the American people exercise that constitutional  right. This regulation simply doesn't meet that standard.   I urge my colleagues to support the resolution of disapproval.   Mr. President, I don't know whether anybody else is coming to seek  the floor. If I am infringing upon somebody else's time, I will yield  the floor, but in the meantime, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise today to discuss some criticism I  have heard about the nominee to fill the seat on the Supreme Court.  That nominee is Neil Gorsuch.   My colleague, the minority leader, met with the nominee last week.  Afterward, he told reporters that he had ``serious, serious concerns''  about the judge. Well, I guess I shouldn't be surprised--after all, it  seems the minority leader had concerns about the nominee even before  the nominee was announced.   Before Judge Gorsuch was announced, the minority leader made clear  that any nominee must be ``mainstream.'' But it became clear  immediately that this nominee is widely regarded as a mainstream judge  with impeccable credentials. Liberal law professor Laurence Tribe says  that ``he's a brilliant, terrific guy who would do the Court's work  with distinction.'' Alan Dershowitz, who certainly is no conservative,  says that Judge Gorsuch will be ``hard to oppose on the merits.'' Even  President Obama's Acting Solicitor General, Neal Katyal, said Judge  Gorsuch ``would help to restore confidence in the rule of law.'' The  chorus goes on.   Apparently, because the nominee is so obviously mainstream, the  benchmark for my colleague's concerns keeps changing. The minority  leader has conveniently developed a new test. Now he says the benchmark  is independence: ``The bar for the Supreme Court nominee to prove that  they can be independent, has never, never been higher.''   Well, fortunately for the minority leader, Judge Gorsuch passes that  bar with flying colors, just like he passed the ``mainstream'' test  with flying colors. The nominee's record makes clear that he is an  independent and fairminded judge who is deeply committed to the  separation of powers.   Here is just one example from his many opinions on this point. Just  last year, Judge Gorsuch had to decide a case about the authority of  the Board of Immigration Appeals, or the BIA, which answers to the  Attorney General. The BIA wanted to change the Attorney General's power  to waive immigration requirements for illegal immigrants, and it wanted  the new rules to apply to undocumented immigrants whose waiver  applications were already in the works. The nominee said no to this  executive agency. To be clear, Judge Gorsuch was asked to decide  whether an executive agency in charge of immigration laws could change  the law on a whim in a way that many believed was unfair to immigrants  who had already sought waivers. He said no.   With due respect to my friend the minority leader, there is no doubt  that Judge Gorsuch would say no to this or any other part of the  executive branch that oversteps its bounds.   Here is what the nominee wrote about the separation of powers and  executive branch overreach. For him to defer to the executive agency in  that case would be ``more than a little difficult to square with the  Constitution of the framers' design.'' That is because doing so would  allow agency bureaucracy to ``swallow huge amounts of core judicial and  legislative power,'' which the Constitution assigns to separate  branches of government. So the nominee was concerned about the  separation of powers. He was concerned about people whose liberties  might be impaired, and because of those concerns, he said no to the  immigration agency's policy whim of the day.   Judge Michael McConnell, a former colleague of Judge Gorsuch on the  Tenth Circuit, makes the same observation about this case. He says the  scope of executive power arguably ``will be the most common Supreme  Court issue of the coming decade.'' He says the nominee analyzes that  issue in a way that is faithful to the Constitution and to the  independence of the judiciary, and he points to the nominee's thinking  on this question. Judge Gorsuch wrote:         What would happen . . . if the political majorities who run       the legislative and executive branches could decide cases and       controversies over past facts? They might be tempted to bend       existing laws, to reinterpret them . . . [this would] risk       the possibility that unpopular groups might be singled out       for this sort of mistreatment--and [would] rais[e] along the       way, too, grave due process, fair notice, and equal       protection problems. . . . It was to avoid dangers like       these, dangers the founders had studied and seen realized in       their own time, that they pursued the separation of powers.    That is the writing of an independent judge who believes in the  separation of powers.   You know, there is a bit of irony to some of the criticism I have  heard leveled against Judge Gorsuch. On the one hand, I have heard that  he will have to be independent and that he won't rubberstamp the  President's agenda. On the other hand, I have heard that he will be way  too tough on the executive branch as it fulfills the President's  agenda. It is quite obvious that, common sense tells us as we look at  those two arguments that we can't have it both ways.   Judge Gorsuch has shown he is faithful to the separation of powers in  the Constitution. That means he will be an independent judge who will  say no when the other branches of government overreach.   You don't need to take my word for it. Listen to President Obama's  Acting Solicitor General, Neal Katyal. He is no fan of the President's  Executive order, but he says that Judge Gorsuch ``will not compromise  principle to favor the President who appointed him.'' Instead, the  Solicitor General said the nominee ``would help to restore confidence  in the rule of law.''   Judge Gorsuch's record and reputation leave no room to doubt that he  is a mainstream, independent judge. He will apply the law fairly, and  he won't be afraid to say no when the Constitution requires it.   Every time my colleague the minority leader has set out a standard  for filling this Supreme Court seat, this judge has met it. He is  mainstream. He is independent. And when my colleague chooses a new  standard, I bet the nominee will also meet that new standard.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that floor  privileges be granted this Congress for Darren Dodd, a detailee from  the U.S. Secret Service, and Saleela Salahuddin, a detailee from the  Department of Justice.
