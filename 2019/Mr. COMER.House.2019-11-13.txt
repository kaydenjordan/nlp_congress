 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Necco Foster Care  of Kentucky, an organization with offices across Kentucky's First  Congressional District and the Commonwealth.   Necco works tirelessly to place thousands of children with supportive  and caring families. With foster parents from all walks of life and a  variety of backgrounds, the organization ensures that each child is  matched with a loving, stable, and comfortable home.   The organization was recently recognized as a 2019 Angels in Adoption  honoree.   Necco offers supportive community living for young adults and  intensive home-based treatment for families. Through programs like  these, Necco shows itself to be a diligent, compassionate guiding hand  to society's most vulnerable.   The staff at Necco helps children in both rural and urban settings as  well as those in the juvenile justice population. By providing these  services, Necco is improving the lives of those most in need while also  setting the foundation for a brighter future for coming generations of  Kentuckians.   On behalf of my constituents, I congratulate Necco and its staff in  their efforts to make the dream of a family a reality for many children  in need.     Congratulating Dean Owen for Being Awarded the HIRE Vets Medallion                                   Award     Mr. Speaker, I rise to applaud my friend, Mr. Dean Owen,  for being awarded and recognized last week by the Department of Labor's  HIRE Vets Medallion Awards Program.   This program focuses on bringing our Nation's veterans back to the  workforce and equipping them with the skills they need to excel at home  after serving our country across the world.   As a resident and business owner in the First Congressional District  of Kentucky, Dean Owen has gone above and beyond to invest in  recruiting, employing, and retaining our Nation's finest through his  professional accountant services firm in Paducah, my district's largest  city.   The rigorous criteria by which a HIRE Vets Medallion is earned speaks  to the remarkable dedication Dean regularly displays in his mission to  advance veteran careers.   I want to thank Dean once again for being a valuable, caring, and  ambitious figure in my district. With constituents like Dean, there is  no question as to why I am proud to stand here today and represent the  First Congressional District of Kentucky.                      Conduct the Business of the People     Mr. Speaker, this must be a proud day for many Washington  Democrats: the beginning of their quest to impeach our duly-elected  President of the United States, with wall-to-wall coverage from all the  major media networks of this circus of an event.   But I, again, rise today to implore the Speaker of the House, Nancy  Pelosi, to conduct the business of the people.   The people of America elected all 435 of us to do the things that  they expect Congress to do--real business, not theater. And the  business that the people expect us to do, of the utmost importance  today, would be to ratify the USMCA and to take up the demand to try to  have some type of prescription drug reform legislation passed before  the end of the year.   But, instead of doing these two most essential acts that Congress  should be taking up to represent the people of  [[Page H8790]]  America, we have, instead, the majority party conducting baseless  impeachment hearings.   I conclude again by calling on Nancy Pelosi and the majority party to  do the things the American people actually want Congress to do.                            ____________________
