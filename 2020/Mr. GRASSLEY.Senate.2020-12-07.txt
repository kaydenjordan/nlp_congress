 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Mr. President, I want to visit with my colleagues about  something that hasn't happened in Iowa for over 100 years. Over the  weekend, the Iowa State football team completed their regular season  play. The Cyclones are having a noteworthy season. They secured the  first place rank in the Big 12 Conference's regular season after  winning five consecutive conference games and eight overall conference  wins this season.   The good news doesn't stop there for the Iowa State football program.  The Cyclones finished first place in league play, for the first time  since 1912, when they won the Missouri Valley Conference. This has  earned the Cyclones their well-deserved spot in the Big 12 title game  on December 19, the first ever Big 12 championship appearance in Iowa  State University's history.   I want to applaud the Cyclones for their historic season. So many  fans, including me, will be rooting them on for the Big 12 championship  game.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
