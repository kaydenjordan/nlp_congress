 Mr. Speaker, throughout my career, I have worked to  protect vulnerable populations.   Yesterday, I was proud to support the Consumer Protection and  Recovery Act, which will aim to protect exploited consumers, including  the elderly, who are oftentimes the most at risk.   The Federal Trade Commission has an essential role to safeguard  consumers from businesses that utilize misleading and deceptive  practices. These bad actors must be held accountable, and the victims  of any scam deserve justice.   I appreciate the leadership of the House Energy and Commerce  Committee to ensure that the FTC has the capabilities it needs to  protect all individuals from fraud.   I encourage our Senate colleagues to consider this important  legislation as soon as possible.                            ____________________
