 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1635  because our country is facing a student debt crisis.   In fact, nearly 580,000 student borrowers defaulted on their loans in  just the last year. This debt crisis has been created, in part, because  students and their parents aren't given the full information they need  to make informed decisions about paying for college.   Right now, only students receiving Federal loans are required to  receive financial counseling. Even then, they only receive counseling  when they take out their first loan and upon graduation. That means  that countless students are signing up for thousands of dollars in  loans and arriving on campus before they have received any advice about  these major financial choices.   This is just wrong. Our young people should not be left in the dark  as they make decisions that will impact their lives for years after  graduation.   That is why I am supporting H.R. 1635, the Empowering Students  Through Enhanced Financial Counseling Act, which would make sure that  students know all of their funding options, including grants, work  study, and scholarship assistance, before taking out loans.   The legislation would also ensure students and parents receive  financial aid counseling before they sign on the dotted line.   Higher education should be a stepping-stone to success, not a  financial drag on our students' futures. By giving students and their  parents the best information possible to make financial decisions, we  can ensure students are prepared for a bright future.
