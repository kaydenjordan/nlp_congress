 Mr. Speaker, I rise unscripted and in  passionate support of freedom. I have heard many statements with words  like ``fact'' and details of the minutia of these plans. I will share  with you a fact.   Two hundred years ago, my ancestral forefather was born. He was a  young, poor Irishman born into indentured servitude. He heard a whisper  of a land born across the sea, a land where a man could own his own  property, a land where a man could keep the toil of his labor. So he  garnered his courage, he saved his money, and he booked passage on a  cargo vessel converted to carry human beings. According to the letter  unearthed by my sainted mother, his sleeping berth measured 2 by 2 by  5.    What could have driven my ancestral forefather--and yours, Mr.  Speaker--indeed, all of America? What drove our ancestral forefathers  to come to this land? Freedom. Freedom drove us, and it is freedom for  which I stand.   The Affordable Care Act, known as ObamaCare, is 8,000 pages--8,000  pages--of regulation and taxation. There is not a man or a woman  amongst us, from sea to shining sea, who believes this body can produce  8,000 pages of freedom. The American Health Care Act is 124 pages of  reasonable legislation based upon the best input of free market  principles.   A vote against the American Health Care Act is a vote against  freedom. It is a vote against 124 pages of reasonable legislation, and  it is a vote for 8,000 pages of ObamaCare.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' for the American  Health Care Act.
