 Mr. Chairman, I rise before you today to offer  my amendment No. 24 to the fiscal year 2019 Department of Defense  Appropriations Act.    Mr. Chairman, in the proposed NDAA, the chief  managing officer of the Department of Defense is to develop a plan no  later than March 1, 2020, to transition certain functions and services  from the Defense Information Systems Agency, or DISA, to other elements  of the DOD.   My amendment on which I worked closely with my friend and colleague  from Maryland, Congressman Ruppersberger, prevents funds from executing  this change. In fact, the administration has objected to this change in  the NDAA because it would ``weaken the Department's ability to secure  its cyber networks and inhibit DISA's mission to provide seamless  communication to warfighters and senior leaders.''   While our men and women, Mr. Chairman, in uniform focus on defending  our values abroad, DISA is constantly managing the information network  that supports our entire defense apparatus and fighting for American  interests on the global stage.   DISA's primary mission is to secure our network infrastructure for  our warfighters and intelligence and security agencies. The question  regarding DISA's fate has never been asked or answered by this Congress  nor the Pentagon.   While I commend the effort to find efficiencies within the Department  of Defense, it remains unclear what would happen to DISA's missions and  functions if the measures in the NDAA were executed.   According to retired Lieutenant General Harry Raduege, who served as  DISA Director from 2000 to 2005, he said: ``We have looked at  reorganizing DISA in the past, disestablishing it, but the missions are  going to have to be performed somewhere.''   DISA is an agency where numerous other functions from other agencies  have been folded in over time, and the operations include global  missions, such as commercial satellite communications, leasing for all  of the military, secure communications for the White House and other  senior government and government leaders, support to the Joint Staff,  and disaster response communications.   Over the years, many missions and activities that even today are  relatively unknown have been transferred to DISA because everyone has  been looking to increase efficiencies and effectiveness.                                time  1815    By eliminating DISA, Congress may be increasing the costs, manpower  requirements, and cyber risks that can be better managed via a shared  services approach currently envisioned by DISA.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the committee chair and the entire committee  for consideration of the amendment. Let's support our warfighters and  help them focus on the threats that we face today.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my  time.
