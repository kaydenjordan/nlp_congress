 Madam President, I rise to express my support and to  highlight the importance of reauthorizing the Children's Health  Insurance Program, CHIP.   CHIP expired in September, causing great concern and worry for  families and providers who depend on this program to care for our  Nation's neediest children. Many States have been operating on reserve  funds, which will soon run out. It is time we provide the program with  the necessary funding to take care of America's children.   I know Arkansas families who rely on the program to provide medical  care for their children are pleased with the inclusion of a 6-year  reauthorization for CHIP, including in the legislation before this  Chamber. This would mark the longest extension for the program since  its inception.  [[Page S340]]    I thank Chairman Hatch, the original author of CHIP, for his  dedication to the health of our Nation's children, and his bipartisan  effort with Ranking Member Wyden that brought a 5-year CHIP  reauthorization out of the Senate Finance Committee last fall.   Approximately, 50,000 children in Arkansas--and nearly 9 million low- income children nationwide--receive healthcare through CHIP. Currently,  these children, their families, and providers are living in a cloud of  anxious uncertainty.   Take for instance this story of a young Arkansan:         In Little Rock, a precious little girl marks the milestone       of turning 8 months old tomorrow in the care of Arkansas       Children's Hospital fighting an infection. She has been in       the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit and other floors there       since the day she turned 2 months old.        Her mother has four other children and spends every hour       she can at her daughter's bedside. Every one of those hours       is an hour spent away from the baby's brothers and sisters,       two and a half hours away in Fort Smith.    Again, she has other children she is trying to take care of at the  present time.         In addition to her child's medical condition, her mother is       worried because her daughter's care is covered by CHIP.        As much as she looks forward to bringing her daughter home,       this mother knows that even those supplies she needs to make       that happen--the tubes, the medicines, the fluids--all of       those are at risk without that coverage.    This story highlights the reality so many families are currently  facing. Failing to reauthorize this important program would have real,  direct, and serious consequences.   We must work to ensure these families need not worry every year--or,  as of now, months--about continued access to benefits for the health  and well-being of their children. We must commit to passing this  extension to provide these families peace of mind and stability.   Arkansans recognize how important this program is. My office has  received significant amounts of inquiries on the issue. Our response  has always been the same: Everyone in Congress is working in good faith  to find a solution--at least it seemed that way until a few days ago. I  would have supported a 5-year reauthorization like the one my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle were pushing for, and guess  what. We did even better with a 6-year reauthorization attached to the  current CR.   Now those same Members who had been asking for a 5-year  reauthorization just days ago are refusing to support the longest  extension of the program since its inception. That is not negotiating  in good faith. That is not being part of the solution. That is being  part of the problem.   Additionally, I continue to be frustrated by this unfortunate new  normal of continuing resolutions and stop-gap measures to fund the  government year after year.   The idea of willingly facilitating a government shutdown is reckless,  but, unfortunately, it appears that some of my colleagues prefer  stalemate over robust debate. We need to keep the government open and  solve our differences through regular order, understanding, and  compromise. Governing by hostage and crisis does not fulfill our moral  and our constitutional duties to the American people.   We must not lose sight of our shared goals and purpose or the impact  our decisions here have. We must aim to use the power of our offices  for good. Supporting children's healthcare and passing this continuing  resolution is certainly a component of that goal.   I hope my colleagues remember the story I shared today--and the  stories I know they have heard from their constituents--and vote in  favor of children's health.   I yield the floor.
