 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for  yielding and for calling this Special Order to pay tribute to our  departed friend and colleague, Walter Jones, Jr.   Walter died on February 10, his 76th birthday. He lived a full life  of service: four years in the National Guard, ten years in the North  Carolina General Assembly, and nearly a quarter century in this U.S.  House of Representatives.   Walter and I met long before either of us served in the House. We  worked together on the Jimmy Carter Presidential campaign of 1976. I  have a photo on my desk of a very youthful-looking group of campaign  workers to prove that.   Walter, of course, went on to chart a different course politically, a  course that was uniquely his own. In fact, he found himself frequently  at odds with, if not one party, then the other, but by the same token,  he sometimes found possibilities for alliances and cooperation in  unexpected places, and he didn't hesitate to take those opportunities.   Madam Speaker, tonight we are going to hear from a wide range of  colleagues, an amazingly diverse group of colleagues that reflects the  friendships that Walter had in this Chamber. That was also reflected in  the delegation that went to Greenville for Walter's funeral service on  February 14. He was an independent man and he just had friends all over  the place.   Now, that independence was rooted in Walter's strong convictions and  his personal sincerity. He actually, I think we would all agree, stood  out. In an age in which sincerity is sometimes in short supply in our  Nation's politics, he earned respect and admiration on both sides of  the aisle.   The outpouring of tributes and remembrances that we have seen and  will see tonight is a testament to that fact.   Much has been said about the personal encounters Walter had with  veterans of the Iraq war and the families of those who never returned  and how those encounters led him to reassess his past and present  policy circumstances.   Walter sent over 10,000 letters to families of fallen troops and he  memorialized those who died from North Carolina's Camp Lejeune with  photos outside his office.   Walter's determined and effective voice for the military and  especially his beloved Marines and his deep love for his home State of  North Carolina are going to be missed in these Halls and in the coastal  farming and military communities in the Third Congressional District.   So we express heartfelt condolences to Walter's wife Joe Anne,  daughter Ashley, his loyal staff who are joining us in the Chamber here  tonight, his countless friends, neighbors and community members, the  lives he touched along the way.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a tribute from one from his  longtime staff members, Ray Celeste, Jr.                  A Tribute to Congressman Walter B. Jones         (By Colonel Ray Celeste Jr., U.S. Marine Corps (Retired))         I had the pleasure and good fortune to have served with       Congressman Walter B. Jones for almost eight years in his       D.C. office as his Military Legislative Assistant. He was an       American icon of virtue and American values. He loved America       and his constituents deeply. He worked tirelessly on their       behalf for many decades. He stood up against injustices that       many of them faced.        He had an iron-will to do what was best for his       constituents. His will was strong and unflinching. We, as       part of his staff, worked to ensure we represented the       congressman as best as possible and to be as helpful as       possible to him and our constituents of the 3rd District. His       constituents' services were renowned.        Congressman Jones was the epitome of a public servant. He       was always working for the betterment of his people. He was       their divine servant. He greatly appreciated the sacrifices       our military veterans have made for our great Nation.        He also appreciated the sacrifices their families make. The       general public sometimes overlooks these sacrifices. He did a       lot of work in promoting the proper education of military       children who are autistic through the use of Applied Behavior       Analysis (ABA).        Congressman Jones worked tirelessly to help treat service       members and Veterans who suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress       Disorder (PTSD) and those that suffer from Traumatic Brain       Injury (TBI). He promoted the use of Hyperbaric Oxygen       Therapy (HBOT). He did not think this was a cure-all for PTSD       or TBI, but as one of treatment methods that that should be       available to service members and Veterans. He authored a       legislative provision that was adopted in the Fiscal Year       2017 National Defense Authorization Act (FY 2017 NDAA). This       provision allows for the use of HBOT to be used as a       treatment method for PTSD/TBI by the Department of Defense       (DoD).        He was shocked at the overuse of drugs to treat PTSD/TBI       where there was no conclusive clinical trial done that proved       a certain regime of drugs could cure or alleviate the       horrible mental and physical impacts of PTSD/TBI. In some, if       not many cases, it made matters worse. He was shocked at the       over reliance on the use of drugs.        Congressman Jones looked for holistic methods to treat       PTSD/TBI such as the use of service dogs. He also admired the       positive influence influences of yoga and combat acupuncture.        Congressman Jones was the Republican lead on the       legislation to honor Purple Heart recipients and other       American heroes by giving them access to Department of       Defense commissaries and recreation facilities. The Purple       Heart and Disabled Veterans Equal Access Act of 2018 extends       access to commissaries and Morale, Welfare, and Recreation       (MWR) facilities to Purple Heart recipients, all veterans       with a service-connected disability, Medal of Honor       recipients, former prisoners of war, and veteran caregivers.       Commissaries are grocery/department stores on military       installations that sell food and some household items. MWR       facilities offer a range of services on bases including       libraries, outdoor recreation, dining, golf courses, and       sports and fitness centers. It was adopted in the Fiscal Year       (FY) 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).        Two words sum up Congressman Walter B. Jones. He was highly       principled and he was a statesman. He thought we, as a       Nation, must look at what is best in the U.S.'s interests       first. He was not an isolationist, but he did think the U.S.       was allowing itself to be taken advantage of by our allies.        Congressman Walter B. Jones was a once in a lifetime member       of Congress. God bless him, his wife Joe Anne, and their       daughter, Ashley. Semper Fidelis.     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for  yielding.    Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for  presiding over this remarkable series of tributes. It has been a  memorable evening--more than I could have anticipated--in the array of  colleagues who have paid tribute and in the kind of emotions stirred in  all of us, I think, by the memory of a good friend and a good man, but  also a sense of the values and the affection that binds us together  here.   It is too bad, perhaps, that it took an occasion of this sort to  bring this out. But I will never forget it, and we will never forget  Walter Jones and what he meant to all of us, so I thank the gentlewoman  so much.
