 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  congratulate Chairman Aderholt on his first bill as chairman of the  subcommittee. I thank the minority staff--particularly Stephen  Steigleder, Philip Tizzani, Laurie Mignone, and Jackie Kilroy--for all  of their hard work, as well as the majority staff, Susan Ross, Kathryn  Salmon, James Redstone, Emily Goff, and Laura Stagno. As I have often  said, they keep our names on the door, so many thanks to all.   Mr. Chair, I have never seen an appropriations bill quite like this  one. I have never seen a bill that was this inhumane and which defies  all the values and ideals of a society which promises to address the  needs and the challenges of its people.                                time  1130    In Charles Dickens' ``Great Expectations,'' Pip observes the Pocket  family children as ``not growing up or being brought up, but were  tumbling up.'' This bill leaves America's children tumbling up.   This bill is the largest domestic appropriations bill, and for good  reason. The programs funded in Labor-HHS-Education ensure that our  workforce is strong, our families are healthy and safe, and our  children's future is secure.   Indeed, last Congress, we passed a Labor-HHS bill that supported  middle-class working families, lifted up vulnerable Americans, and  prepared our Nation for future crises, which makes it even more  disappointing to see where we have ended up in this year's process.   The majority's 2024 Labor-HHS-Education bill and its 28 percent cut  of $64 billion bring us back to a level unseen since 2008. It heralds  their intent to end public education in the United States. This bill  eliminates present and future job opportunities for young adults,  seniors, and working families. It jeopardizes maternal, pediatric, and  public health.   This bill is shameful, which is presumably the reason why it was  never marked up or voted on by the full Appropriations Committee.   As disappointed as I am to see the authority of the Appropriations  Committee surrendered, sadly, based on where the majority has taken  this entire process, it is not surprising.   Mr. Chair, 154 days ago, the House Appropriations Committee held its  first full committee markup of the 2024 bill. Nine more followed. This  bill was not one of them.   Nonetheless, the House majority circumvented the committee process.  They air-dropped five new poison pill riders into the Labor-HHS bill  without any bipartisan consultation or vote by the committee.   We are left to assume that the majority knew this bill had no path  forward in committee, and they know it has no path forward, period.   Horace Mann called education ``the great equalizer.'' Perhaps, then,  it is the majority's aversion to equality that explains why they cut 28  percent from the Department of Education.   They will take at least 224,000 teachers out of low-income classrooms  and eviscerate the programs that help at-risk youth build a bright  future. This cut would entail a loss of 3,700 teachers in Alabama, 800  teachers in Idaho, 4,400 teachers in Maryland, 4,300 teachers in  Tennessee, 6,500 teachers in Michigan, 5,000 teachers in Louisiana,  8,300 teachers in Georgia, 1,500 teachers in Kansas, 22,300 teachers in  Texas, and 4,400 teachers in Arizona. Explain that to your  constituents.   I am deeply concerned about the impact such a colossal retraction  from public education funding would have on children across our  country.   This bill tells the story of where the majority seeks to take this  country. Republicans have made it clear they are opposed to public  education, and they seek to destroy it.   Quality education will no longer be accessible to working families,  but it will be accessible, again, to the purview of the rich.   I must underscore that point. This is no messaging bill. This is  their Commitment to America. I am taking Republicans at their word, as  should all American people. This is what they want to do.   When 161 House Republicans voted earlier this year to eliminate all  K-12 funding at the Department of Education in the Massie amendment to  H.R. 5, I was horrified, but that was only the beginning.   House Republicans are in lockstep behind the most extreme ideologues  in their party. Just this summer, former Secretary Betsy DeVos penned  an op-ed calling to eliminate the Department of Education.   The Heritage Foundation's budget blueprint includes a proposal to  eliminate the Department of Education.   Former OMB Director Russ Vought wants massive funding reductions to  ``thwart'' a public education system he sees as ``an existential threat  to the American Republic.''   We are witnessing a widespread attack on public education that should  shock every American family. If left to their own devices, Republicans  will gleefully take public education to the graveyard.   How will this bill move us closer toward those ends?   English language acquisition funding to help 5 million English  learners nationwide is eliminated, disadvantaging and discriminating  against students who primarily speak another language and restraining  their future ability to compete and succeed in the economy.   Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants, which provide  professional development opportunities for educators, are completely  gone.   Federal work-study is no more for the 660,000 students who need it to  help finance their postsecondary education. It limits their potential  earnings and future success in the job market.   Nearly $1 billion is cut from the supplemental educational  opportunity grants, which eliminate need-based financial aid for 1.7  million students nationwide.   Promise Neighborhoods, social and emotional learning grants, and  magnet schools are all completely erased, as well.   The programs that are not completely abolished in this bill are so  poorly funded as to be completely nonfunctional.   A $14.7 billion cut from title I, the very foundation of public  education in America, is patently unthinkable and would remove hundreds  of thousands of teachers from classrooms, directly harming children in  every single one of our districts.   Students nationwide are struggling with rising college costs, and  this bill provides no relief by freezing the maximum Pell grant for the  first time in 12 years.   I believe we all agree that we have a crisis in our Nation's  classrooms, but rather than address the teacher shortage and fully fund  our children's future, our Nation's future, the majority's solution is  to abolish the public classroom altogether. If you cannot afford a  private education for your children, well, too bad.    This is the every child left behind act. Regardless of your age or  stage in life, this bill means you can't count on your country for  assistance in getting back on your feet.   Youth job training, adult job training, Job Corps, and senior  community service employment programs are all eliminated. If you want  to work and just need help finding the right job or finding a better  job, this bill has nothing to offer you.  [[Page H5742]]    They are putting workers who do find jobs at risk by cutting $313  million for worker protection agencies like the Occupational Safety and  Health Administration. The 30 percent cut to the Wage and Hour  Division, the agency that is tasked with enforcing wage law and  ensuring that our children are not working illegally, will send the  rights of workers in this country back to a time before World War II.   This bill hangs working families out to dry. Healthy Start, diaper  distribution, teen pregnancy prevention, title X family planning--all  abolished.   With riders that block access to abortions and reproductive  healthcare services and force providers to withhold critical  information about healthcare options, it is clear in this area that the  majority does not trust women to make their own decisions, and where  they are taking us is moving down a road to a nationwide abortion ban.   These provisions amount to the majority simultaneously ensuring  anyone who may get pregnant will get pregnant, teenagers included, and  there are no resources or lifelines available to help those children  and their families.   People can only hope that they do not get cancer. You will not find  support from House Republicans. From the National Institutes of Health,  over $2 billion is cut from the National Cancer Institute, the National  Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the National Institute  of Mental Health, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  Diseases.   Cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are as  outrageous as they are dangerous. Firearm injury prevention, tobacco  prevention, and ending the HIV epidemic, which, by the way, was an  initiative of President Donald Trump, Republicans have decided that  addressing these problems is not worth a single dollar to the American  people.   What should we be doing if not combating the leading causes of death  in this country? What should we fund if not the health and future of  America's families? Supporting our children and working families is the  bare minimum of what the greatest country in the world should do for  its people, but this bill goes well below the bare minimum.   This bill steals from our children's future, from our families'  health, and from Americans' livelihood. It abandons young adults. It  stifles biomedical innovation. It surrenders to current and future  public health crises. It hurts women with poison pill riders on  abortion.   Mr. Chair, for these reasons, I vehemently oppose this bill, and I  urge my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the distinguished ranking member of  the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and  Related Agencies.     Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel), a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Nevada (Ms. Lee), a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for her strong voice,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. McClellan).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Magaziner).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   It is incredulous the scope of this bill and its damage to the  American people, their healthcare, their education, and their  opportunity for a job and their future.   Just quickly, in the Department of Labor: Adult Job Training; Youth  Job Training; Job Corps; Senior Community Service Employment; the  Bureau of International Labor Affairs; the Women's Bureau, the Women's  Bureau that helps women find jobs in nontraditional areas, these are  all eliminated. They are eliminated.   Let's go now to the Department of Health and Human Services: Title X  Family Planning; Healthy Start; Ryan White Ending the HIV Epidemic,  something that George Bush and Donald Trump wanted to provide funding  for, eliminated.   Nursing Workforce Diversity. We have a shortage of nurses today. We  need to be recruiting and training nurses to be able to take care of  patients, to be able to administer healthcare.   I always classify nurses as angels of mercy. They were with me every  single day when I was in the hospital a number of years ago for a  period of time. The doctors could look at me, they did great surgery,  but it was the nurses who looked at me, and they could tell whether it  was a good day or a bad day, and they were there for comfort and care.  But, no, we don't want to train and recruit nurses.   The CDC, Tobacco Prevention and Control--my God, we have gone to such  an extent to really cut back on addiction and not to make kids addicted  in our country.                                time  1200    Firearm Injury and Mortality Prevention. This is research and the  same kind of research we did with regard to understanding how good  seatbelts were and how they could save people. This is not taking  anyone's gun away. This is about public health, but, no, that is  eliminated.   Global HIV/AIDS, the CDC's contribution to PEPFAR--launched by George  Bush--all eliminated. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services,  Minority AIDS. My God, we are suffering a mental health crisis in this  country, but, no, the Republicans would eliminate that.   Preschool Development Grants, Adult Protective Services Formula  Grants, all eliminated.   Now, the Department of Education. Effective Instruction State Grants,  eliminated. Social and Emotional Learning, eliminated. Civics--we find  today that young people, older people, don't know anything about the  American government. They don't know who does what at local, State, or  federal. They don't engage in a dialogue with one another so that you  can get to some sort of a rapprochement, understand what is being done  in government. No, Republicans don't want a literate society, so let's  eliminate civics.   Magnet Schools Assistance, Promise Neighborhoods, the Federal  Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants. My God, the kids who need  financial assistance.   Federal Work-Study, let me mention that one, because today, working  families, middle-class families, vulnerable families, are having a  tough time. They are going paycheck to paycheck. Yeah, you know what?  They want their kids to go to school to get an education. You know  what? Their kids are willing to work. They will go to the library. They  will do those jobs with the Federal Work-Study Program.   When I talk about Republicans wanting to eliminate public education,  this is a very good example, because you cut off the opportunity for  that child to be able to work and to help his parents support him in  getting an education.   Who are we and what are we about with this bill?   I could go on, but what would be the point? That is what this bill is  about. As I said, it is not a messaging bill. This is where the  majority wants to take us. They want to eliminate public education in  this Nation.   I come from an immigrant family whose parents could dare dream their  daughter serves in the United States House of Representatives. I can  hear, day in and day out, my folks who have now passed who said: Get an  education. Get an education. They sacrificed for that education, and we  have a majority of this body who wants to take it away.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the amendments en bloc, and in  support of the amendment with regard to the CDC ALS registry, which  increases the funding for the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention's National Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, ALS, Registry.   I cannot talk about ALS without acknowledging the remarkable Ady  Barkan, who died earlier this month. ALS is a cruel disease. Ady and  Brian Wallach, who continues his own battle against ALS, are two of the  amazing advocates who are changing the face of medical advocacy in this  country. I support this amendment in their honor.   The ALS Registry collects and analyzes information about persons with  ALS in the United States. It advances our understanding of the disease.  With approximately 30,000 participants, the ALS Registry has provided  crucial information to guide future research.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Barragan).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I rise to support another amendment in the en bloc.   This is the Congressman Gottheimer's amendment with regard to safe  school drinking water. I rise in support of the amendment, and I thank  the Representative for sponsoring the amendment and allowing this time  to talk about the importance of safe drinking water at schools.   Children are more susceptible to lead exposure because their bodies  are still rapidly developing. Approximately 400,000 schools and  childcare centers are served by a lead service line or pipes and other  fixtures.   Let me be clear. There is no amount of lead that can be tolerated in  the body. We know what happened in Flint, Michigan. Thousands of  children were lead poisoned.   I met most recently with medical staff who was trying to work with  these children, because of their brain, their slow development, et  cetera, all as a result of a political decision allowing for the  contamination of water with lead and lead poisoning so many thousands  of children in Flint, Michigan.                                time  1215    That is why clean and safe drinking water at schools is so critically  important. That is our responsibility. The CDC funding allows health  departments to develop partnerships with schools, daycare facilities,  and early childhood education centers to strengthen blood lead testing  reporting and link lead-exposed children to recommended services. The  earlier they get their services, the more likely they are to be able to  grow and thrive.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this en bloc amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   For over 50 years, the mission of the Department of Labor's  Occupational Safety and Health Administration has been to assure safe  and healthful working conditions for working men and women by setting  and enforcing standards by providing training, outreach, education, and  assistance.   OSHA is responsible for making sure employers provide safe  workplaces. Since OSHA was created in 1971, the number of workplace  deaths and the rate of on-the-job injuries has declined by 65 percent-- with a workforce twice as large.   During that time, OSHA issued lifesaving standards for asbestos,  lead, carcinogens, chemical exposure, and blood-borne pathogens. Do we  not want standards for those illnesses and disasters?   The agency has enforced these standards and provided assistance to  employers to keep American workers safe on the job.   Make no mistake, by eliminating all funding for OSHA, this amendment  results in an unconscionable spike in workplace injury, illness, and  death.   In the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics report, there were 2.8  million nonfatal workplace injuries in 2022. This is up 7\1/2\ percent  over 2021. In 2021, there were 5,190 workplace fatalities. That is up  8.9 percent.   This is a reckless amendment. This says we don't care what kind of  conditions workers are working in and that we ought to go back to the  industrial revolution. It should be clear. This is a reckless  amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, this amendment and the prior one are  indicative of the majority's willingness to put workers' health and  safety at risk.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. Public  servants should be commended and not demonized.   Our Federal Government needs talented, intelligent, hardworking  people who are willing to bring their skills to public service.   Proposing to eliminate the salaries of hardworking public servants is  petty. It really is beneath the dignity of this body. It is not how we  should solve differences of opinion on policy.   For 45 years, the mission of the Department of Labor's Mine Safety  and Health Administration has been to ensure that miners can return  home from work every day to their families and their communities safe  and healthy.   When MSHA was created in 1977, the fatality rate in the mining  industry was more than four times greater than the average for all  industries in the United States. Since then, mining fatalities have  dropped sharply as MSHA has established and enforced workplace safety  standards and worked together with all stakeholders to prevent  fatalities.   For fiscal year 2024, MSHA is prioritizing additional actions to  reduce accidents, injuries, and fatalities involving customer and  contract truck drivers, falls from heights, and lack of use of personal  protective equipment.   Taking out the agency's top enforcement official, as this amendment  seeks to do while MSHA completes this important work, would be reckless  and irresponsible.   In addition, it is particularly shameful that this amendment targets  a nonpolitical Federal employee who is part of our Federal civil  service.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this vindictive  amendment, which I believe is small and is petty, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    First of all, Mr. Chair, let me correct the record here.  The Job Corps provision was not a drafting error.   I rise in strong opposition to this amendment.   Treasure Island, a former naval installation island between Oakland  and San Francisco, was closed in the 1990s and is undergoing a major  redevelopment.   Treasure Island Job Corps is one of the best-performing sites in the  country and serves over 430 students with outdated and crumbling  buildings. It is located on a sizable piece of land in the middle of  the island.   The Department of Labor and Treasure Island Development Authority,  TIDA, are jointly examining the possibility of selling or exchanging  land from the Department of Labor to the Treasure Island Development  Authority to allow for additional housing development on the island in  exchange for building a brand-new campus for Job Corps within a smaller  portion of their current site.   Longstanding language on this matter has been included in  appropriations bills since 2018. This language waives potential  barriers to an exchange, allowing the Department to retain the proceeds  from a sale to rebuild a more compact Job Corps site within its current  boundaries.   There is no cost--let me repeat--no cost to the Federal Government.  For years, Congress has recognized this as a win-win: a new Job Corps  facility without additional appropriations and badly needed additional  housing in the area.   This amendment strikes the reference to Treasure Island in a general  provision specific to that Job Corps site and inserts the name of a  different Job Corps site from the author's State of Texas.   This amendment is silly and nonsensical, and it breaks from years of  precedent around this language.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, the amendment would cut funding for the  National Institute of Nursing Research by $19 million. I support $10  million for health workforce training, but I am in total opposition to  a $19 million cut to the National Institute of Nursing Research.   The National Institute of Nursing Research supports research that  develops the scientific basis for nursing practice. For example, the  NINR is supporting a research initiative to assess changes in  organizational factors that could mitigate or prevent nurse burnout,  which we know to be one of the primary causes of a nursing shortage and  of people leaving the profession.   NINR also supports initiatives such as the AIM of care initiative to  address high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality and to prevent  adverse maternal health outcomes. Again, we know what a serious issue  this is in our Nation with maternal morbidity and mortality. Women are  dying. They look at these efforts to try to give us the best  information and data possible.   The National Institute of Nursing Research supports training  opportunities to develop doctorly trained nurse  [[Page H5773]]  scientists at schools of nursing throughout the United States.   By cutting funding for the National Institute of Nursing Research,  this amendment would reduce funding for nursing faculty, which would  result in schools of nursing turning away many qualified applicants.  Let me just say that, in 2020, over 80,000 qualified applicants were  not accepted at schools of nursing primarily due to a shortage of  clinical sites, faculty, and resources.   This institute is already underfunded and underappreciated, which is  true of all nursing professions. Maybe that is why HRSA estimates that  the nursing shortage will grow from 56,000 to 78,000 by 2025.   More importantly, this amendment demonstrates, once again, that  overall funding in this bill is grossly insufficient. I support $10  million for training but not a $19 million cut.   We need to properly fund health workforce training and the National  Institute of Nursing Research. We should not be forced to choose  between nurses and nursing research.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), the Democratic whip and former member of the  Appropriations Committee and of the subcommittee, I might add.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                    Amendment No. 8 Offered by Ms. Boebert     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would reduce the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention Public Health Scientific Services  account by $158 million.   Bringing this account to the FY 2019 level, think about what it would  eliminate: significant advancements in public health, negatively  impacting the National Center for Health Statistics, laboratory  science, and public health data modernization efforts.   I have personal propriety on data modernization. I championed the  establishment of a public health data modernization initiative in  fiscal year 2020, just prior to the pandemic, I might add. This massive  undertaking is moving public health away from the fax machine and into  the 21st century.   Think about what happened during the pandemic, with all of the  laboratories around the country. I think about Connecticut, nearly shut  down. It couldn't do its work because it didn't have the equipment, the  modernization, the ability to collect data that makes it incredibly  important for us to deal with a pandemic or any other disease.   I might add, this modernization initiative provides funding directly  to 64 jurisdictions, including States, territories, large cities, and  Tribes. Eliminating this funding impacts the entire country.   I suspect that my colleague on the other side of the aisle would  agree with me that the local jurisdictions of public health need to  have the capacity to do their job. This funding is critical to  improving jurisdictions' public health decisionmaking capabilities.  Some have very highly rated and forward-thinking decisionmaking  capabilities, and they have what they need, but we have a lot of  communities with minimal capacity.   This is really pretty extraordinary. We have people entering records  by hand. They are writing their records out by hand or using software  not designed for tracking outbreak data, to being able to publish  provisional national death data on a weekly basis. Some places have no  capacity to do this, and they are not reporting the data so that we  have no idea what is happening.   We all want to know the scope of a foodborne or infectious disease  outbreak in our community. I suspect my colleague wants that  information for himself, his family, and for his constituents. We all  do. However, that does not happen without the data first identifying  the cases. Our public health data systems, laboratory resources, and  the National Center for Health Statistics are already far behind where  we need them to be, and this amendment would only make matters worse.   We should have learned a very, very big lesson from the pandemic,  where our public health infrastructure in many instances crashed  because of the lack of technology, the lack of data collection, the  lack of modernizing their ability to collect that data.  [[Page H5776]]    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment. I think it is not  just for the emergency. We need to have a very, very strong public  health infrastructure.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, let me just preface my comments by saying we  are not scientists, and we are not doctors. Maybe some are. We may have  one or two, but we are not in the business of scientific research or in  the medical profession, for the most part.   This amendment calls for the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention to conduct an exploratory study on the topic of a  supplement, vitamin D deficiencies, and COVID mortality rates.   To make recommendations, Federal agencies leverage the results of  multiple randomized control trials that form the same conclusion, which  builds the scientific evidence for recommendations.   The National Institutes of Health and academic peers have  consistently found that there is insufficient evidence for a  recommendation either for or against the use of vitamin D for the  prevention or treatment of COVID-19.   Supplements are not a replacement for preventive measures like a  vaccination. Studies are being conducted on more effective linkages  between COVID-19 infection and preventive measures, including  vaccination and ventilation. The CDC should be receiving additional  investments for these studies, not being told to conduct a study on  this supplement.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Norcross).    Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   Let me tell you a brief story. I arrived at Congress in 1990. At the  time--and this is on a bipartisan basis, and this had to do with  women's health--what we discovered at the National Institutes of Health  was that all the clinical trials on illnesses and diseases in the  country, all the research, all science, and all of these diseases, the  clinical trials had included only men--only men.   I don't think anyone would view that this is rocket science, that  women are physiologically different than men.   On a bipartisan basis, the women--Nancy Johnson, Barbara Kennelly,  Nancy Pelosi, Nita Lowey, and Marge Roukema--banded together and said  this was crazy.   Women and minorities need to be included in clinical studies so that  we do not just extrapolate data from clinical trials for men and apply  it to women. Women and minorities deserved to be in those trials so  that we could find out what was the best treatment, what was the best  cure, and what was the best way to treat their health issues.   This is an amendment that would cut $10 million to the National  Institute of General Medical Sciences at the NIH. One of the basic  missions of NIGMS is to support the next generation of scientists. This  amendment would reduce support for scientific trainees across every  stage of their career trajectories, from supporting undergraduate and  community college students in research experiences, to Ph.D. and  clinician-scientist training, to postdoctoral training and the  transition to a first scientific position.   Eliminating an office of diversity in biomedical research takes us  backward when we moved forward all those years ago to talk about how  biomedical research and discovery to cure had to include in the  scientific endeavor, yes, men but also women and minorities.   This amendment would limit early stage investigators, who are a  pipeline to a next generation of researchers for future scientific  discoveries.   Mr. Chair, with all deference and respect for my colleague, this  amendment is shortsighted and counterproductive, and I urge my  colleagues to oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in vehement opposition to this  amendment. This amendment would eliminate all funding to the National  Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, which would  eviscerate funding for research on minority health.   This is a lack of understanding of scientific discovery or discovery  to cure. Frankly, it is appalling and disgusting. I will be calling for  a roll call vote on this amendment. I want to know exactly which  Members of the House of Representatives want to eliminate funding for  research on minority health and health disparities.   The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities  supports research on diseases and conditions that disproportionately  affect minority populations--minorities, writ large.   The United States continues to experience persistent and preventable  adverse health effects with a disproportionate burden on minority  communities.   To take one example, chronic diseases are among the leading causes of  death in the United States. Some racial or ethnic minority groups  experience a higher prevalence of multiple chronic conditions. We need  to continue research on interventions to reduce mortality from multiple  chronic diseases such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease,  diabetes, sickle cell disease, maternal mortality, obesity, asthma,  heart disease, cancer, which continues to disproportionately affect  minority communities.   The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities also  supports researchers from backgrounds who are underrepresented in the  biomedical research workforce.   I urge my colleagues to think about this amendment and how it lacks  scientific understanding and the ability to use biomedical research as  a discovery for a cure.   Oppose this amendment. I look forward to seeing the results of the  recorded vote.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I can't state strongly enough how much I  oppose this amendment, which thwarts biomedical research to save  people's lives. That is what is done in this area. That is what the NIH  does. That is what the National Institute on Minority Health and Health  Disparities reviews. It is about saving lives. We have no more noble  cause in this institution than to help to save people's lives, whoever  they are.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. This  amendment would eliminate funding for the Fogarty International Center  at the National Institutes of Health.   This amendment is shortsighted. It would undermine our ability to  prevent and mitigate disease outbreaks around the world.   The Fogarty International Center has supported research training  programs which have been vital to fighting emerging infectious diseases  including Ebola and Zika.   Now, we dealt with Ebola in 2014, and we dealt with the Zika crisis  in 2016. I know that the gentleman was not here at that time and really  didn't experience what was happening both here in the U.S. and also  internationally. The very fact is that Fogarty helped to train the  people who were involved with on-the-ground responders to the Ebola and  to the Zika crisis.   Moreover, Fogarty supports training programs for scientists in the  United States and abroad who are engaged in prevention and treatment of  diseases, such as malaria, dengue fever, and tuberculosis, all of which  now have affected parts of the United States.   Fogarty programs have provided research training to 6,000 scientists  worldwide. It contributes to biomedical innovation. It supports the  next generation of researchers across the globe.   In addition, health innovations developed with foreign partners can  be adapted to help solve health issues in the United States.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1345     Mr. Chair, in my continued opposition to this amendment,  I suspect that my colleague is not interested in saving lives in West  Africa, in Brazil, or in Haiti.   Once again, with prior amendments that were listed here today, the  issue of the work of science and research in the pursuit of saving  lives is what this institution should be about. We are not talking  about helicopters, roads, bridges, or anything else. Fundamentally, we  are addressing the issue of using the biomedical research which we have  scientists engaged and involved in both for the United States and  internationally. If it happens internationally, it happens in the  United States. That is our job. There is no higher calling than to save  lives here and abroad.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   Unfortunately, this amendment is nothing more than a political stunt.  It would cut funding to the National Institutes of Health's Office of  the Director as a penalty for a research grant awarded years ago.   The grant awarded by NIH was subject to rigorous peer review and  judged by reviewers to be a high priority due to the previous emergence  of SARS-CoV in a bat population.   The grant application did not propose research to enhance  coronaviruses to be more transmissible or virulent in humans. The NIH  determined that the award did not involve research with enhanced  potential pandemic pathogens.   The bat coronavirus sequences under this grant award showed that the  viruses studied at the Wuhan Institute of Virology under the NIH-funded  grant were evolutionary, distant from SARS-CoV-2, and could not have  been the source of SARS-CoV-2.   Essentially, this is a cut of $3.7 million as a penalty for funding  research and thereby taking funds away from the NIH as well, which are  sorely needed.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would cut funding by $160  million to the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of  Health.   During the time that I had the opportunity, for the 4 years that I  served as chair of this subcommittee, we increased funding for NIH  research by $8.4 billion, an increase of 21 percent above the 2019  level, and I might add, something I am really extremely proud of.   As chair and with Ranking Member Cole, we agreed on a bipartisan  basis  [[Page H5781]]  for the increases to the NIH. I, again, feel very, very proud of the  role that I was able to play with my colleague in providing additional  funding for lifesaving research at the NIH, including research to  develop cures or treatments for cancer, Alzheimer's, ALS, diabetes, the  funding to develop a universal flu vaccine, and the funding to ensure  that women are represented in clinical trials.   This amendment would undermine the progress that we made on a  bipartisan basis over the last 4 years, and I urge my colleagues to  please oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I don't know if the gentleman knows this  but, as another point, I will extol the virtues of Dr. Anthony Fauci  and his scientific background and experience of what he has done to  resolve issues of disease and cures in the United States of America and  overseas.   Maybe the gentleman doesn't know, Dr. Fauci is no longer at the NIH.  It is unbelievably stunning to me that we are listening to someone talk  about how COVID came out of the NIH. What happened to all your other  theories?   Mr. Chairman, this is really a conspiracy theory that we are  generating here. For that reason, and probably for many, many other  reasons that have no basis in science or in reality, I continue to  oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I am having trouble listening to a series  of science deniers here this afternoon. That is really troubling.   The amendment would cut funding to the National Institutes of Health  by an additional $3.6 billion.   The base bill already cuts NIH funding by $2.8 billion below what we  are talking about in 2023. That is 2.8 and another 3.6. I think there  was another amendment that took additional money, which means that this  amendment would bring the overall funding cut to the NIH of $6.4  billion at the current funding levels.   That would mean drastic cuts to lifesaving research on cancer,  Alzheimer's disease, ALS, diabetes, infectious diseases, and the list  goes on and on and on.   This amendment would cut funding to the National Cancer Institute by  an additional $710 million.   I am a 36-year survivor of ovarian cancer. I had the benefit of  biomedical research. Why shouldn't other women have the benefit of  biomedical research to save their lives with ovarian cancer, one of the  biggest killers of women in the Nation?   This bill would also cut funding to the National Institute of Child  Health and Human Development by $175 million.   It would cut funding to the National Institute on Aging by $441  million. Let's tell that to all of our elder Americans with the issues  that they have as they age. Let's cut back that research.   It would cut funding to the National Institute on Drug Abuse by $166  million. I continue to hear from my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle about how upset they are about addiction and drug abuse and the  increase of that. What are we doing about it? This research addresses  that issue.    It would cut funding to the National Institute of Mental Health by  $200 million. Do we not understand that we had a crisis in mental  health in this country before the pandemic, and we are in a serious  crisis with mental health at all ages post-pandemic?   We want to cut the money for the research for mental health?   Put simply, this amendment would mean a drastic cut to scientific  breakthroughs, cures to diseases, and lifesaving treatments.   Did you know that the United States has been the leader in the world  in health and advancement. We have the NIH, the CDC, and the FDA. These  are crown jewels in what health is about in the United States and the  cures here and abroad. Why would we want to roll back our advancements  in health, science, and medical achievements?   This does go backwards. Like I have said in prior amendments, our job  with these bills is to save lives, not to be engaged in political  diatribes.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, let me say a couple of things because I am a  strong supporter of BioShield.   Within the 2023 budget, I might add, there is $850 million. I am for  emergency preparedness. The gentleman every year puts in requests for  increases, and we put in increases every year for Project BioShield.  However, what I am concerned about, which I will address, is the $59  million cut. I think we should continue to increase money every year  for Project BioShield, but the amendment cuts funding for the buildings  and facilities at the NIH by $59 million.   NIH currently has a backlog of nearly $4 billion in needed repairs,  and during the 4 years that I served as chair of the subcommittee, we  increased funding for the NIH buildings and facilities account from  $200 million in 2019 to $350 million in 2023 to begin to address the  long-term backlog in a responsible way. This amendment would undermine  the progress we have made.   I might add, once again, this was on a bipartisan basis over the last  4 years that we agreed to the increases in the NIH buildings and  facilities account as well as the increases in Project BioShield.   Cutting funding for NIH's buildings and facilities would exacerbate  the backlog of repairs, potentially affecting NIH's intramural research  projects if laboratories and facilities are degraded.   More importantly, this amendment demonstrates, once again, that  overall funding in this bill is grossly insufficient. That is one of my  biggest concerns about this bill. We need to properly fund Project  BioShield and the National Institutes of Health. We should not be  forced to choose between research facilities and emergency  preparedness.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    As with the prior amendment, Mr. Chair, I support the  National Strategic Stockpile very strongly, and I might say I strongly  support it, so I don't oppose it.   As the chair of the subcommittee in the past, I have increased  funding on a yearly basis for the stockpile. I know that the gentleman  has made requests for increases, and we have met those increases with  regard to the stockpile.   The question, once again, for me is cutting the buildings and  facilities at the NIH by $119 million. I will repeat this: NIH has a  backlog of nearly $4 billion in needed repairs. In the 4 years that I  served on the subcommittee as chair, we increased the NIH building and  facilities account from $200 million in 2019 to $350 million in 2023 to  begin to address the backlog and build up in a responsible way.   I might add that I am particularly proud that we did this on a  bipartisan basis, and we have done that over the last 4 years while  recognizing the gentleman's concerns in this area and responding in a  positive way to the increases that have been requested.   Cutting the funding for NIH buildings and facilities exacerbates the  backlog of repairs. It affects their intramural research projects if  the laboratory and the facilities are in disrepair.   More importantly, as I said just a few moments ago, the amendment  demonstrates that overall funding in this bill is grossly insufficient.  I know that there are some who want to cut it even further, so we begin  to deal with robbing Peter to pay Paul here.  [[Page H5784]]    Nonetheless, we need to properly fund the Strategic National  Stockpile. That is in our national interest and the interest of the  National Institutes of Health.   However, it is my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are  always telling me that we have hard choices to make and that we do have  to make choices--and we do--but we should not be forced to choose  between research facilities and emergency preparedness.   Nevertheless, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle believe  that we should starve the bill and then, for the issues that may be  critically important, take money from another critically important bill  or program.   Let us fund this bill where it should be to meet the needs of the  National Strategic Stockpile as well as allowing the NIH to be able to  have laboratories and buildings in good repair so that our scientists  can perform in an environment that allows them to be more creative,  more innovative, and do more about the discovery to cure.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would direct $15 million from  the Strategic National Stockpile to allow States to build or maintain  their own medical stockpile.   The 2023 appropriation bill authorized a demonstration program for  State Strategic National Stockpiles but did not include funding. This  amendment would reduce funding for the Federal Strategic National  Stockpile to support State efforts. You have one amendment that wants  to go to $100 million, one who wants to take $15 million away from the  national stockpile.   It is important to note that the authorization specifically stated  that authorized funds were intended to supplement rather than supplant  the maintenance and use of the Federal Strategic National Stockpile.  Redirecting SNS funds as this amendment does is in conflict with the  intended purpose of the law. We are not adding on to, we are taking  away from and moving someplace else.   I would suggest that with regard to our public health and our  national security, that through these efforts what we should do is to  focus in on dealing with public health infrastructure in the strongest  possible way, and that means making the investments in data  modernization and data collection.   There ought to be the authority to report data that the CDC should  have to get this information, so we know what is happening in real  time. We ought to take a look at the State laboratories and look at how  we are supporting State laboratories, which many crashed, the whole  infrastructure during COVID, the public health infrastructure nearly  crashed.   This amendment is in conflict with the intended purpose of the law.  Once again, it takes money rather than adding to. It is intended to  supplement, but what it does is it supplants.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I stand in continued opposition to the  amendment. It is hard to fathom the logic of supplanting versus  supplementing. If you are taking money from the stockpile, you are  taking away the funds  [[Page H5785]]  that are there, but you are not adding funds to what they already have  so, in fact, you are taking money from the SNS for this other effort  which is contrary to what the law states.   I agree different States have different needs, et cetera. That is why  I think that what you ought to do is to buttress what we are doing in  State laboratories, dealing with data modernization, to make our public  health infrastructure as strong as possible. This really takes money  away from the SNS.   Mr. Chair, I oppose it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment. This amendment would cut $28 million from the Department of  Health and Human Services for the purpose of eliminating the Minority  HIV/AIDS Prevention Initiative.   How far my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have come from  the vision of George Bush and his PEPFAR Initiative. The underlying  bill already cuts funding for the Minority HIV/AIDS Prevention  Initiative by more than 50 percent. We have cut it already in this bill  by 50 percent from its current funding level of $60 million to a  proposed funding level of only $28 million. That is unacceptable.   In the explanatory materials the Republican majority posted online to  accompany the Labor, HHS, Education appropriations bill, the majority  acknowledges ``the critical role that the Minority AIDS Initiative  plays in our longstanding efforts to eliminate HIV and address the  disproportionate disease burden that racial minority communities  face.'' That is in the explanatory materials, and that is true.                                time  1445    The minority HIV/AIDS prevention initiative supports HIV prevention,  as well as treatment in minority communities to help address that  disparity.   While we have made significant advances in recent decades against the  HIV epidemic, it continues to be a crisis in many racial and ethnic  minority communities. Almost three out of four new HIV diagnoses are  among racial and ethnic minorities.   This amendment to eliminate funding for the minority HIV/AIDS  prevention initiative would take us back to a time when the Federal  Government turned a blind eye to the spread of HIV, especially in  minority communities.   Let me be clear: Not only is this amendment unacceptable, but the  funding cut of more than 50 percent in the base bill is unacceptable.  When we go to conference with the Senate, after this House bill goes up  in flames, I will ensure that these disastrous funding cuts are not  included in the final bill.   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose this amendment. I also  might add, if you take the base bill which my Republican colleagues  have come forward with, which is really unacceptable, the base bill  ends the HIV initiative. These are programs that have been eliminated.  It eliminates the HIV initiative here.   This amendment would further cut the opportunity for treating AIDS in  the minority community. What is going on here that we are not moving  toward ending the HIV epidemic? We are close to it, which is why we  dealt with this initiative on a bipartisan basis over the last 4 years.   This, once again, is my colleagues turning their backs on saving  people's lives. What more important effort should we be involved in in  this Congress?   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment  because for me this amendment continues that road that has been laid  out in this Labor-HHS bill where the majority is moving to really  eliminate public education in the United States.   This bill decimates public education by cutting the Department of  Education by $22.5 billion, 28 percent. It seeks to plus-up one of the  only education programs that received an increase, the Charter Schools  Program. They cut everything else in public education but increased the  charter schools in this bill.   We have had some spirited discussions about charter schools on the  Labor-HHS subcommittee, and there are certainly some differences of  opinion around the role that they should play in our public education  system and whether they have historically received appropriate  oversight by the Department of Education.   The Charter Schools Program provides seed money to open new charter  schools around the country. We should be in agreement on one point:  This program has far more money than the Department of Education knows  what to do with.   In 2019, months after Secretary DeVos pleaded with our subcommittee  for a $60 million increase to the Charter Schools Program, the  Department approached us with warnings that demand for funding was low.  Sure enough, before the end of the year, the Department was unable to  use the full appropriation and transferred $12 million to other  education accounts. That was almost 3 percent of the program's  appropriation.   In addition, over the years, our committee discussed issues raised by  the inspector general, including findings that States have mismanaged  charter school closures and that the Department failed to provide any  adequate guidance or oversight on the issue. I know my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle want oversight, and that is why we need to  continue our oversight of the Charter Schools Program with respect to  accountability, transparency, and success. Many open, many close. Many  take people, and then they disgorge people.   I support charter schools, but not at the risk of eliminating public  education in this country, which is one of the issues that is on the  agenda of the Republican majority in this Labor-HHS bill. This  amendment provides a wasteful increase that would be better directed at  restoring some of the underlying bill's disastrous cuts.   Let's take a look at those cuts that are disastrous in education.  Let's make sure that we are supporting title I. Let's make sure that we  are supporting the development of teachers. Let's make sure that we are  looking at Promise Neighborhoods. Let's make sure that we are dealing  with the social and emotional learning of our kids instead of plussing- up a program that has enough money to make it and has not had the kind  of oversight it needs in order to make sure that it is doing its job.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue my opposition of this amendment.  As I understand it, this is an increase for the inspector general. As I  mentioned a few moments ago, the inspector general has done intensive  investigation of the charter school movement. They have findings that  the States mismanaged charter school closures, and the Department  failed to provide adequate guidance or oversight on this issue.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Financial Services  and General Government.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                   Amendment No. 62 Offered by Ms. Boebert     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment. Make no mistake, this amendment will result in fewer  students receiving Pell grants and will cut the maximum Pell grant  award for 6.4 million students who use Federal student aid to pay to  get a college education.   A cut of $9.25 billion will leave the program with a shortfall of  $875 million in 2024. Under special scoring rules for the Pell Grant  Program passed by Congress nearly two decades ago, Congress cannot  provide less funding than required under current estimates by the  Congressional Budget Office.                                time  1515    This cuts a Pell grant to every single Pell recipient. If this  amendment passes, the Pell grant program would have less funding than  required to sustain the current maximum award and existing eligibility  parameters.   Faced with this reality, House Republicans will have two choices--cut  the Pell grant maximum award or kick students out of the Pell Grant  Program.   At a time when students and families are struggling to cover rising  college costs, it was already unconscionable that House Republicans  would eliminate Federal Work-Study for 660,000 students and eliminate  the Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants for another 1.7 million  students nationwide. It was already cruel when House Republicans  offered no relief to rising college costs by freezing the maximum Pell  grant for the first time in 12 years.   If this amendment passes, House Republicans will go one step further  by cutting the maximum Pell grant or kicking students out of the  program. This is truly a new low.   Does anyone in this Chamber remember Senator Claiborne Pell? I  remember him. Claiborne Pell was from Rhode Island to the manner born,  affluent, but he had a vision. He understood that the sons and  daughters of working men and women of middle-class families, of  vulnerable families, had a right to an education just as every rich  person in this country does, and therefore, he created this program,  the Pell Grant Program.   If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle pass this amendment,  then, in fact, they are on that road that I have said over and over and  over again is eliminating public education in the United States of  America, eliminating opportunity for people to succeed in this country.   Why would you want a legacy or a legend that follows you with that  kind of effort?   The United States is the land of opportunity. It should be,  particularly where it comes to education for our children. It is the  way to the future.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this misguided amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the distinguished ranking member  of the Education and the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, this is one more amendment on the road to  eliminating public education in the United States of America.   I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. I am shocked by this  amendment's intent to eliminate all funding to the Department of  Education's Office of Federal Student Aid. What will this mean for the  17.5 million students who need to fill out a Free Application for  Federal Student Aid, the FAFSA? What will this mean for the 6.4 million  students who rely on Pell grants to pay for college? What will this  mean for nearly 43 million individuals, one in six adult Americans who  are working to repay their Federal student loans?   Make no mistake, this amendment signals an intent to destroy  postsecondary education in this country. The House Republican Labor,  HHS, Education bill already follows through on the other side's intent  to break and dismantle public and postsecondary education for American  students and families. This amendment just takes that destruction to  another level.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Scott), the distinguished ranking member of the Education  and Workforce Committee.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time is  remaining?    Mr. Chair, the gentleman wants to cut and wants to  privatize higher education. He wants to send students to the for-profit  colleges where there is a raft of information about how they are  harming college students, and he wants to provide funding for the for- profit online program management companies, profiteers. That is who  these folks are. It is everywhere. We know it.   The data is rife with how they have created terrible situations for  young people, and even those who are older, by shutting down, leaving  these people with a bill, about not providing a credential so that  people can get jobs. They are a menace on our education system.   The gentleman here, as I understand it, will cut the Department of  Education's Office of Federal Student Aid in order----    No, I am sorry, I won't.----in order to be able to  support an online, for-profit industry that is bilking America's  students and, in many instances, America's veterans. It is really  pretty incredible the direction that the majority will go in destroying  public education in this country.   Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the time remaining?    Mr. Chair, with that 15 seconds, I will repeat what I  said. We are looking at something that is scurrilous, supporting  institutions that have been putting our students and our veterans at  great risk.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, just as a point of reference, Grand Canyon is  online and nonprofit in name only.   I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. I am shocked by this  amendment's intent. To eliminate all Federal education funding for  Historically Black Colleges and Universities,  [[Page H5791]]  HBCUs, and minority-serving institutions, it is staggering, truly  staggering. $400 million for HBCUs, eliminated. $228 million for  Hispanic-serving institutions, eliminated. $100 for historically Black  graduate institutions, eliminated. $52 million for Tribal colleges and  universities, eliminated. Public education, eliminated.   This colossal cut also eliminates countless other programs that help  students access a postsecondary education and receive expanded economic  opportunities.   $1.2 trillion for the Federal TRIO program, eliminated. How far we  have come. I have been on this Appropriations Committee for almost 28  years and been on the Labor-HHS subcommittee, and I can remember my  Republican colleague Ralph Regula. Some of my colleagues on the other  side will remember Ralph. There was no bigger supporter of the TRIO  program or for the GEAR UP program. He understood the relevance of  these economic and educational opportunities for youngsters.   It was not just Ralph Regula. I can go down the line in a bipartisan  way of individuals who have supported the TRIO program. It is  eliminated. $388 million for the Federal GEAR UP program, eliminated.   Once again, the House Republican goal in this bill is crystal clear:  Destroy postsecondary education opportunity for students and for  families nationwide. This amendment makes that goal explicit.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I just had a quick look. At Grand Canyon,  86,000 students are online, so let's put that aside.   The essential point of this amendment is what it would do to  education and educational opportunities. As I mentioned, for the  historically Black colleges, eliminated; Hispanic-serving institutions,  eliminated; historically Black graduate institutions, eliminated;  Tribal colleges--where else do you want to go to revoke education for  youngsters in this country?   I go back to an unbelievable man of vision, Claiborne Pell, who said,  let's make postsecondary education available to all, not just the rich.                                time  1545    I said it before on this floor. I am the daughter of an immigrant  family who shared the dream that I would be here someday. The road for  me was education--tough. My mother worked as a garment worker in the  old sweatshops in the city of New Haven. My father was an insurance  agent. They pieced together what they could to give me the best  education that I could have so I could have success. I am successful. I  am here and grateful for it.   All those young people out there who are going to be denied a chance  to get a college education because somewhere deep inside the psyche of  the Republican majority now--this hasn't been in the past; there has  been bipartisan support on these issues--but right now deep in that  psyche is that we have to rid ourselves of public education.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.  [[Page H5792]]     Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   This amendment highlights the extreme lengths that House Republicans  will go in order to dismantle public education for students and  families nationwide.   The Institute of Education Sciences', IES', mission is to provide  scientific evidence on which to ground education practice and policy  and to share this information and make it accessible to educators,  parents, policymakers, researchers, and the public.   IES is independent. IES is nonpartisan. They are the statistics  research and evaluation arm of the U.S. Department of Education.   What would happen if this amendment is successful? Well, it would  mean the end of the National Assessment of Educational Progress, NAEP.  That is the assessment of what students in the United States are able  to do in various subjects. That has been administered since 1969.   It would mean the end of regional educational laboratories, which  provide evidence-based technical assistance to school districts and  States across the country.   It would mean the end of new advances in education research and  development, including exciting initiatives to expand high-risk, high- reward transformational research.   This amendment would be the death of our Federal investment in  education research.   We just saw a little while ago that we were going to end our  investment in biomedical research. Now, we are ending our investment in  educational research. Simply, I cannot accept that outcome.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose this amendment, but I  want to provide a framework here for a moment.   I was looking through the various amendments over the last little  while. Amendment No. 69 from Mr. Biggs slashes the Pell grant funding.  Amendment No. 70 from Mr. Biggs eliminates funding to give out Pell  grants and to be able to collect student loans. Amendment No. 71 from  Mr. Biggs eliminates funds for HBCUs, MSIs, TRIO, GEAR UP, and Tribal  colleges. Amendment No. 76 from Mr. Biggs eliminates education,  research, and funding. The most recent one is eliminating the funding  by the Department of Education for the Institute of Education Sciences.    There are two others, amendment No. 104 that eliminates the salary of  the Department of Education Secretary, and amendment No. 92 from Mr.  Crane that cuts education staff by $38 million.   This is the litany of this battery of amendments where I make my  point that the Republican majority is really in the business, within  this bill, of eliminating public education. These amendments come on  top of the underlying bill, which makes a 28 percent cut in education.   Do we think we have a reasonable understanding of where the  Republican majority wants to go with public education? Let's do it in.   Mr. Chairman, I say to Mr. Biggs that he has the lion's share of  taking education and public education to the graveyard. Is that what we  are to do?   The greater strength of this institution is its potential to help  make a difference in people's lives and to provide opportunity. That is  what we are supposed to do in the United States Congress and in the  House of Representatives.   Mr. Chair, this battery of amendments would destroy educational  opportunity, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, once again, the Republican majority needs Democratic  votes to govern. We are considering this bill under suspension of the  rules because House Republicans could not agree to pass a rule on a  bill to keep the government open and operating on behalf of the  American people. They can't do it. It says something very poignant  about the ability to govern and the willingness to govern.   This continuing resolution is flawed. Critically, it does nothing to  help our allies. It does not include any emergency assistance for  Israel, Ukraine, or our Indo-Pacific partners, for humanitarian aid,  for childcare, or for disaster victims here at home.   At a time when the Departments of State and Defense need to be able  to respond quickly to global crises, House Republicans would put our  diplomats and warfighters under outdated funding levels into February,  for more than one-third of the fiscal year.   Not only is it irresponsible to kick the can down the road for  several months, but it is really a waste of taxpayer dollars, and these  are folks who pride themselves on wanting to save taxpayer dollars.   This proposal also shortchanges the WIC program, the women, infants,  and children program. As a result of increased participation rates, the  administration requested an additional $405 million to ensure that we  can meet the demand for nutrition programs. The House Republican  proposal includes no additional funds and will require States to halt  enrollment or scale back benefits.   A continuing resolution is a bridge to a final agreement. It should  be judged on how it helps facilitate our goal, which is to update  spending levels for full-year bills and the full-year bill of 2024. A  so-called laddered bill makes it harder to reach a final agreement.  Why? Because it doubles the likelihood of future shutdowns. In a time  of global crisis, we should promote stability and not chaos.   Ultimately, we are here because House Republicans broke the June  budget agreement they overwhelmingly supported that was signed into law  by the President. It established a top line, the amount of money that  could be translated into the dollar amount to each one of the  appropriations subcommittees.   To make it simple, Mr. Speaker, it is a number that we agreed to,  then you take that number, and it gets broken up into pieces. That is  the majority's responsibility. I took that responsibility last December  in the prior year in dealing with the allocation to each one of the 12  appropriations subcommittees. They then proceeded to waste the entire 6  weeks of the current stopgap bill overthrowing their own Speaker and  pushing partisan spending measures that take us further from a final  agreement.   Congress must avoid a shutdown.   I have just one point, Mr. Speaker. I think it is so interesting that  we are discussing this continuing resolution at the same time--and I  happen to be managing both bills--that the Labor-HHS-Education bill is  on the floor and when we are going through a marathon of 146  amendments. It is the same path we were on for the last several weeks,  where two bills had to be pulled from the floor because there weren't  enough votes to pass them.   I don't know if there are the votes to pass the Labor-HHS bill this  afternoon or this evening or tomorrow morning. I just don't know.  Nevertheless, it is the same path that we are on.   Nothing is changed in looking at a continuing resolution that makes  an additional proposal.   Again, Congress must avoid a shutdown. That is our responsibility. I  am very aware of that. Nonetheless, we must find a path forward to  finish full-year bills.   The worth of this agreement will be proven by what comes next, and  the only successful path forward requires the following.   First, the majority must recognize reality and abide by the  bipartisan budget agreement that accompanied the debt-limit law.   I think I am one of the few in this institution who voted against the  budget agreement. I was fearful of where we would be today, and it is  where we are today. Nevertheless, I understand the law of the land: It  passes in the House. It passes in the Senate. The President signs it.  It becomes the law of the land.    We must abide by the bipartisan budget agreement that accompanied  [[Page H5797]]  the debt-limit law. That means a modest increase for defense programs  and maintaining nondefense investment levels. It also means adhering to  the same policy framework that we have adopted on a bipartisan--that is  Democrats and Republicans--bicameral--House and Senate--basis.   We have this done over and over again. That means no new poison pill  riders. We have done this over and over again. We did it just last  December and the prior December.   Second, the Appropriations Committee must be let loose to effectuate  the agreement, and that means a good-faith negotiation to set the  allocations for all 12 bills. Chair Granger and I have done this  before, and she knows that I am ready to get to work to do it again.   In the Senate, Chair Murray and Ranking Member Collins are already on  a path to dealing with following the budget agreement so that we hold  down the four corners of appropriations. I am so proud that we are all  women. We get it. We are on track. We know how to do this.   Lastly, we have to address the crises across the globe that threaten  our allies, endangering our own national security. That means a  promise--a promise--to work in good faith to bring forward an emergency  supplemental bill that deals with Ukraine, Israel, humanitarian needs,  our influence in the Indo-Pacific, and border security.   Why are we holding up the resources and investments to the American  people? Why are we abdicating our leadership in the world community by  not moving forward? Why is it when the world is clamoring for  humanitarian assistance that the only people holding back humanitarian  assistance in this entire Congress on the House side and on the Senate  side were the Republican majority?   Mr. Speaker, let us move forward. That is the only way that we avoid  finding ourselves right back here in January and February, considering  another extension.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   As you know, Mr. Calvert is the chair of the Defense Appropriations  Subcommittee and a very respected member. I don't see him on the floor  now. He is someone who cares deeply about our national security here at  home and our international obligations and responsibilities.   I mention a couple of things in this context. As of this bill, $28  billion for the Department of Defense is held up until next February,  and that depends whether or not we can come to agreement. Next  February, $28 billion to the Department of Defense.   The other piece of this is that the State Foreign Operations, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee and the Defense Subcommittee have shared  responsibilities. As you know from reading this laddered approach,  those two bills will not get to a continuing resolution until February  2.   What do they do that has relevance in this period of time? The State,  Foreign Operations and Related Agencies Subcommittee has a very small  amount of money in which they can move humanitarian assistance in this  global crisis that we have and the world clamoring for humanitarian  assistance.   Now, the State, Foreign Operations and Related Agencies Subcommittee  and the Defense Subcommittee share some other pieces which have to do  with funding for Ukraine and funding for Israel. The $3.3 billion to  Israel is held up until next February, and money for Ukraine, which is  depleted, is nowhere to be found; so we are walking off the  international stage. We have abdicated a moral responsibility to Israel  and Ukraine--not unlike what happened in 1938 with appeasement--and to  humanitarian assistance. Think about who was responsible for that.   There is another piece of this which I think is very, very  interesting. We have seen the delay. It has been 5 months since we had  the budget agreement in June, so 5 months of delay there. Then another  45 days of delay.   I said a few moments ago, given what we have seen on the floor with  regard to Labor-HHS today, I don't understand what is going to change  in this next go-round. There is every opportunity for further delays.  Further delays.   What happens then is we move toward something called sequestration.  Let me translate it into real terms. Those are across-the-board cuts in  every single area, both domestic and international. That is what the  law has done here.   There appears to be no understanding or no consideration for the  movement of where we need to go. We have a history now of delay after  delay after delay, and I don't see anything that portends a change in  that activity or behavior.   With regard to those across-the-board cuts, if all 12 appropriations  bills are not passed--not 8, not 4--and there is one hanging out there,  that across-the-board cut comes crashing down on our heads. I think  people just need to know this information and fully understand.   I don't want a government shutdown--I don't--but I want to fully  understand what the stakes are. I have to believe that every Member of  this body wants to know what the stakes are and what is actually in  these bills.   Finally, I am going back to something I said earlier: Who is holding  up the resources that the American people are clamoring for, whether it  is their health, their education, or their ability for a job? Every  bill that we have seen on this floor curtails and cuts back in a  remarkable way.   In the Labor-HHS bill, they are taking us back to 2008 numbers. The  resources that the American public needs to thrive are being cut back.  People in this country are living paycheck to paycheck, and we are  doing nothing to help them deal with their cost of living. I believe  that they know that. On the domestic front, we are shortchanging the  American people.   Let's get to the international scene. Who is holding up aid to  Israel? Who is holding up funding the support for Ukraine? When did we  believe that Vladimir Putin has noble intentions? He would gobble it up  in a nanosecond. Who would believe who was holding up humanitarian  assistance?   We have a moral responsibility. We are watching children in Ukraine,  Israel, and Gaza dying, but we don't have the strength to blow past  this and say let's do what we have been charged to do by this  Constitution and carry out our duty.   House Republicans are holding up all of these critical security  funding needs. Think about it and think about how we should break the  logjam with people who know better in this institution. Get us those  top-line numbers. Get us the allocations. Get the appropriations  process on track. Fund the bills for 2024.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   The underlying bill already cuts NLRB funding by one-third. That is  the lowest nominal appropriation since 1999 and the lowest  appropriation in real terms in at least five decades.   A further reduction would mean mass furloughs, reduction in force,  and the closure of field offices. In terms of scale, a $100 million cut  equates to total compensation for more than 500 FTEs. That is roughly  40 percent of the NLRB workforce. Combined with the $99 million cut in  the base text, the agency would lose roughly 80 percent of its staff  capacity.  [[Page H5810]]    Case processing would grind to a halt, even as the agency faces a  backlog following last year's 10 percent increase in case intake.   Let's talk about cases. Let's talk about unfair labor practice.   We should ignore unfair labor practices, according to the majority.  We should not concern ourselves with employers who ignore collective  bargaining rights because, quite frankly, I don't believe the majority  believes in collective bargaining rights.   That really thwarts economic policy. That leaves people on their own,  people who are living paycheck to paycheck who are fundamentally  concerned with their cost of living. We just make it worse for them,  but I believe that this follows a Republican philosophy--antiworker,  antiunion, antiworking family. That is what sums up this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose this amendment, but it  is really very interesting. We are in the year 2023. We have a budget  for this year, and maybe this is news to the gentleman, but in a  bipartisan way where the NLRB had been flat funded for decades, we came  together and increased the funding for the NLRB.   All of these pejoratives that you are spewing about the NLRB, your  Republican colleagues on the committee from last year voted to increase  funding for the NLRB.   I don't believe that the Republican majority cares much about the  goals; that is, about dealing with worker complaints, dealing with  basic, fundamental, collective bargaining rights. I think you believe  in thwarting people's economic opportunity for the future; otherwise,  you would not be going down this road. In 2023, in a bipartisan,  bicameral basis, we increased the funding for the NLRB to be able to do  its job.   I don't know what has happened to folks since last December, but you  clearly don't follow what has been happening and what was being done  with the NLRB.   Mr. Chair, this amendment really ought to be defeated, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   This amendment prohibits the use of funds by HHS or any grantee to  implement a mask mandate at Head Start programs.   First, I think we need to be clear about the facts. There is  currently no Federal mask requirement in place. There is no Federal  mask requirement in place.   This amendment would leave the Federal Government ill-equipped to  implement evidence-based policy that protects the health and safety of  the public if we face another public health emergency, such as a  dangerous new COVID-19 variant.   Preventing diseases reduces healthcare costs, such as hospitalization  and pharmaceuticals. Masking is a critical public health tool. New  variants are an expected part of the evolution of viruses and can be  more aggressive, transmittable, or cause more severe disease than the  original strain.   Face masks can protect the wearer and those around them by preventing  transmission. Although many people would like to act as if COVID is  over, it is not. Over the past 3 years, there were more than 1 million  deaths due to COVID in the United States, some of whom the people in  this room knew and loved.   We also know that some people infected with the virus that causes  COVID-19 can suffer long-term effects from their infection, meaning  they can experience health problems that can last for years.   Our Nation's public health officials need to have options to protect  our communities as we continue to live with COVID and respond to other  public health emergencies in the future.   Why would we politicize something that could help our fellow  Americans stay healthy? This sweeping amendment is unnecessary. It puts  us all at risk. I think it sets a dangerous precedent for Congress to  overrule a scientific process.   We need to follow the science. That is what we need to be doing and  not following the politics, the religious beliefs, the philosophies,  the ideology of Republican Members of Congress.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1815     Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose this amendment. I will  make the point I made before. Why do we really want to politicize an  issue of public health and public safety? We can come together around  these issues. It is not a matter of gotcha.   We all experienced a very traumatic period in our lives with COVID- 19. Yes, there were masks. We were trying to find our way forward to  protect people in this country. That is essentially what it is all  about. You can have a disagreement, but why would we prohibit the use  of funds by HHS or any grantee to implement a mask mandate at Head  Start programs when there is no Federal mask requirement in place?   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   American families pay into their retirement savings over the course  of their working lives so that they can retire with financial security  and dignity. Responsible advice providers can help people meet their  savings goals and retire with dignity, and they should be paid fairly  for this important work. Unfortunately, many retirement savers rely on  the financial advice of providers who do not put their interests first,  actions that can lead to diminished investment returns or higher  transaction costs.   Let me give you an example. Advice rooted in conflicts of interest  regarding the sale of just one investment product--that is fixed index  annuities--may cost savers as much as $5 billion per year. This hurts  workers, families, and the American economy. Plain and simple, these  are a form of junk fees that can erode the retirement savings of  hardworking American families. Fortunately, the Department of Labor is  proposing to protect retirement investors through a new rule requiring  financial advisers to avoid recommendations that pad their pockets at  the expense of retirement savers. I don't know if somebody can tell me,  why wouldn't we want to protect folks in retirement?   This amendment would block the Department's regulatory efforts to  protect retirement savers from junk fees. This would leave the  investments of hardworking Americans vulnerable to financial advisers  looking out for their own financial gain at their clients' expense.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment.   I think the gentlewoman is right. Americans are worried about very  serious financial issues. They are living paycheck to paycheck, and  they are struggling.   What, in fact, they don't need is irresponsible providers charging  them junk fees that take money out of their pockets instead of  understanding that they do have some advice and counsel as to where to  go and who the bad actors are.   Once again, this amendment would leave retirement savers vulnerable  to junk fees.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, the prior speaker talked about families  trying to save for college. I understand that. It is tough these days  to save for college, to put your kids through college, especially in  this economy--thwarted, I might add, by some of the prior amendments  that we have seen here tonight.   Why wouldn't we try to protect those folks, allowing them to save  and, quite honestly, save them from junk fees?   I didn't really realize that so many of my Republican colleagues  support this effort, which would leave retirees susceptible to people  who would sell them a bill of goods, a pig in a poke--pick whatever  commentary you want to make--and then charge them for it. You deny  people a real return on their investment, but you charge them a fee for  doing that. That is a junk fee. You are paying for junk--junk advice,  junk assistance--and you bear the brunt of that.   I am not saying it is all providers. There are probably lots of good  folks who are financial consultants and advisers, but don't tell me  there aren't a lot of bad actors in this area who are collecting from  the most vulnerable.   Not every person in retirement has all the knowledge to do everything  that they need to do to evaluate and investigate a financial planner to  make them whole at the end of the day.   As I just mentioned before, this is an amendment that leaves  retirement savers vulnerable to these junk fees.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I am still in opposition to this amendment.   Let me tell you this tale here. Grant and Dorothy were a retired  couple who were both in their seventies when they turned over their  retirement funds to their broker. The broker decided it would be  appropriate to employ a complex strategy that was geared toward  generating growth while hedging against catastrophic bear market  losses.   Unfortunately, with the strategy, in just 7 months, the broker lost  almost 20 percent of their $150,000 in retirement funds. During the  same time period, the broker earned $15,000. That is a junk fee. Bad  investment advice that denies savers good returns on their investments  is a form of a junk fee.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, the amendment would prohibit HHS, Health and  Human Services, from making any voluntary contributions to the World  Health Organization, including contributions from the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention and the Administration for Strategic  Preparedness and Response.   WHO, the World Health Organization, is an indispensable partner for  the CDC and the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response  to effectively achieve their missions of protecting America from  health, safety, and security threats, both foreign and domestic.   The World Health Organization sets health norms and standards for its  194 member states--for everyday public health concerns, as well as  crises and public health emergencies.   Without collaboration with WHO, CDC and the United States would have  limited means by which to inform and influence those global norms. As a  U.N. organization, the World Health Organization has access to  geographies and populations that may be difficult for our CDC, the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other bilateral health  agencies to reach, and therefore, filling critical needs around the  world to address public health threats at their source in a way no  other organization can.   CDC uses all the tools at its disposal, including sharing technical  expertise and deploying emergency responders, to ensure its resources  at the WHO are working to achieve CDC's core mission.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention works with the World  Health Organization to address ongoing public health threats and  priorities, including polio eradication; routine immunizations and  immunization system strengthening; pandemic, seasonal, and avian  influenza; and building foundational public health capacities at the  country level to strengthen global health security.   In addition, I might add that the Administration for Strategic  Preparedness and Response, ASPR, has an agreement with the World Health  Organization to provide smallpox vaccine to respond to an outbreak  should one occur. This amendment could jeopardize the containment of an  outbreak, and therefore, the health and security of the United States.   This amendment is unnecessary, and it would open the door for other  countries to replace our seat at the table. If we are not at the table,  then China will claim our place.   Congress must not tolerate any effort to stymie American leadership  on global health.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   It really is disgraceful that the Republican majority has shown a  proclivity in the 2024 appropriations bills to target dedicated public  servants and threaten their livelihoods.   Public servants are doing their jobs, and they carry out the policy  of the administration that they serve, Democrat or Republican.   The gentleman may have genuine concerns about the Office of Refugee  Resettlement, but Congress should be talking about policy concerns  without rhetoric and certainly without personal retribution to the  employees devoting their time and talent to the Federal Government.   Ms. Dunn Marcos is extremely qualified. She has worked tirelessly on  refugee issues domestically and internationally for years. She has led  teams for the International Rescue Committee across the United States  and Europe. She has served in the Peace Corps. She stood up the  processing services and safe havens for thousands of Afghans during  Operation Allies Welcome. She now oversees the care of thousands of  vulnerable unaccompanied children.   Ms. Dunn Marcos is a dedicated public servant. Defunding the office  of the director position is not how we solve policy differences.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose this amendment. It  really is pretty disgraceful that this woman is a public servant with  an impeccable background in the area of dealing with refugees,  International Rescue Committee, Peace Corps, safe haven for Afghans  serving with Operation Allies Welcome, caring for thousands of  vulnerable children now.   This is beneath our dignity, and I might add it is a little bit about  theater of the absurd, and it is disgraceful the direction that this  committee has gone in dealing with really dedicated public servants and  denigrating them and trying to threaten their livelihoods.    There are policy differences, as I said, and without rhetoric,  certainly without personal retribution--nobody out there, if they have  differences with us, threatens our livelihoods. Why are we doing that  to others?  [[Page H5816]]    If we have a policy difference, let's get it sorted out and find  another way to deal with policy differences instead of defunding the  office of the director position.   Again, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment. This amendment attempts to block a proposed rule that would  protect LGBTQ youth in foster care.   The foundation of our foster care system is that it must act only in  ``the best interest of the child.'' Taking custody of a child is a last  resort, a step the government should take only when there is no other  way to keep a child safe.   Federal law requires foster care agencies to ensure that each child  in foster care receives ``safe and proper'' care and has a plan that  addresses the specific needs of the child while in foster  [[Page H5817]]  care to support their health and their well-being.   The administration's proposed rule ensures ``safe and proper'' care  for some of the most vulnerable youth in our foster care system. It  would require a foster care agency to place an LGBTQ child in a home  that is free of, again, ``hostility, abuse, or mistreatment'' based on  their LGBTQ status and to provide appropriate training to their  caregivers. That is all. Why wouldn't we want a child to be in an  environment that is free of hostility, abuse, or mistreatment?   Voting for this amendment would be voting to allow children who  suffered abuse or neglect to be placed in homes where they are subject  to hostility, abuse, or mistreatment.   LGBTQ youth are disproportionately represented in the child welfare  system, and they have disproportionately worse outcomes. They are more  likely to be abused while in foster care. They are forced to change  homes more often. They are more likely to be placed in institutions.  They are more likely to run away from foster care. They have a higher  suicide rate.   Family and caregiver support is essential for the mental health of  LGBTQ youth. To take one example, LGBTQ youth who feel high levels of  social support report attempting suicide at less than half the rate of  their peers who feel low or moderate levels of social support.   It is unconscionable and disgraceful that anyone would try to make  the child welfare system less safe for any youth, let alone the LGBTQ  youth we know are especially vulnerable.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue my opposition of this amendment.  LGBTQ youth in foster care are very vulnerable. Why do we not want them  to be provided with safe and proper care, to be in an environment free  of hostility, abuse, or mistreatment, based on that status. That is all  this signifies. I am opposed to this amendment, which really attempts  to block this rule that protects LGBTQ youth in foster care.   Mr. Chair, I continue opposition, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment.   This amendment is absurd and would bring the Medicare program to a  standstill.   If this amendment were to be enacted, Health and Human Services would  be prohibited from finalizing rules for paying physicians, hospitals,  nursing homes, or any other healthcare supplier or provider--which  would throw the Medicare program into chaos.   I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't really like  Medicare, but now they want to throw it into chaos.   By law, Medicare issues annual rules that govern how it runs the  programs and pays for services that Medicare beneficiaries need. These  rules are always major rules of over $100 million, and they happen by  law several times a year so that Medicare beneficiaries know the rules  of the programs and providers know how they will get paid for the  upcoming year.   If this amendment were enacted, Medicare would not be able to pay  physicians or hospitals for new services. Medicare would not be able to  pay for new drugs or devices. Medicare would not be able to pay rural  hospitals that depend on Medicare to stay open to serve beneficiaries  in rural areas.   These rules always exceed $100 million because they govern how  Medicare pays for services for its 60 million beneficiaries.   In short, this amendment would cause a massive disruption to  healthcare for millions of seniors and individuals with disabilities.   The amendment is not a serious policy proposal. It really is a  campaign slogan.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to oppose this.   The information--I just didn't make it up. I don't know where the  gentlewoman's information is coming from. This came from the Ways and  Means Committee. I am not making it up. It is not anecdotal.   If the amendment would be enacted, Medicare would not be able to pay  physicians or hospitals for new services. Medicare would not be able to  pay for new drugs and devices. It would not be able to pay rural  hospitals that depend on Medicare to stay open to serve beneficiaries  in rural areas. These rules exceed $100 million. They govern how  Medicare pays for the services for these 60 million beneficiaries.   We have that information. I do not know where the gentlewoman has  received her information. I suspect maybe there is a misunderstanding  of the scope and the reach of CMS and its oversight of Medicare  beneficiaries and the services that they need.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   The underlying bill already cuts Program Administration at the  Department of Education by $77 million or 18 percent. This amendment  would slash another $38 million from this account, bringing the total  cut to $115 million or a stunning 27 percent.   The Program Administration account funds the Federal civil servants  who provide grants to States. If your State is looking for a grant,  these are the folks that are going to help you. School districts--if  your school district is looking for a grant, these folks are going to  help you--and institutes of higher education. These staff answer  questions and provide vital funding to communities across the country.   This amendment fits with others like it. Let's face it, the  underlying bill where there is a 28 percent cut, the goal is to  dismantle public education and higher education in the United States of  America so that working people, middle-class families, and vulnerable  families have fewer economic opportunities. This denies Americans the  opportunity for an education.    This amendment takes glee in breaking the Department of Education by  decimating the nonpolitical career staff that administers its vital  programs. This is plain wrong.   Vote ``no'' on this amendment. This is another in the list of what I  call the list of particulars taking public education to the graveyard.  There is this new one right now by the gentleman from Arizona. He had  an earlier one which cuts education--this is it; this is his $38  million in cuts.   It slashes Pell Grant funding. It eliminates funding to give out Pell  Grants and collect student loans. It eliminates funding for HBCUs,  MSIs, Tribal colleges, TRIO, and GEAR UP. It eliminates education  research funding and eliminates the salary of the Education Secretary.  This is on top of the underlying bill with a 28 percent cut.   Do I make my point?   The Republican majority is looking to eliminate public education in  the United States of America. That is not a very noble goal.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to be opposed to this amendment.  Nevertheless, we keep hearing that Grand Canyon University has 86,000  students online. Once again, let me repeat that they are a nonprofit,  but they deal with for-profit companies. What they do is they are  ripping off students. They are ripping them off.   That is something that we need to really take a very hard look at  because they are predators with young people. They make a ton of money,  and they don't provide the services, education, or opportunities for  employment after that.   We have people here who are all over these so-called nonprofits that  are really in league with profitmaking companies that are raking in  tons of dollars at the expense of our students.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   This amendment prohibits the use of funds to require any institution  of higher education to enforce any COVID-19 vaccine mandate. This is  the second and third time I have repeated this.   Let us be clear that there is no Federal requirement that any  institution of higher education put a COVID vaccine mandate in place.   Now, the university could easily have its own immunization policy  that is part of its immunization strategy. However, no one from the  Federal Government is forcing universities to enforce any COVID-19  vaccine mandate. There is no one.   I find what is really interesting here is that I am told all the  time, especially with regard to education, that government should not  be interfering with education and educational institutions. They should  be doing what they want to do, and the Federal Government should stay  out. Now, all of a sudden, what we are going to do is prohibit the use  of funds to require any institution of higher education to enforce any  COVID-19 vaccine amendments where there is no Federal requirement to  enforce a vaccine amendment. It really is pretty preposterous here.   Let me just step back. COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective at  protecting people from getting seriously ill, being hospitalized, or  dying. Vaccination remains a safer strategy for avoiding  hospitalizations, long-term health outcomes, and death. COVID  vaccination reduces the risk of death by at least 75 percent. Getting a  COVID-19 vaccine is a safer and more reliable way to build protection  than getting sick with COVID-19.   For those who have had COVID, vaccines offer added protection against  being hospitalized for a new infection. New variants are an expected  part of the evolution of viruses and can be more aggressive and  transmittable or cause more severe disease than the original strain.   Vaccines continue to be our best line of defense. Scientific experts  have determined the COVID vaccines to be safe and effective, and  hundreds of millions of doses have been administered in the United  States.   We should not place restrictions like those of this amendment when we  say we do not want interference from the Federal Government.   Imagine that we talk about the Federal Government in curricula. We  certainly don't want to do that, and we don't. However, the Republican  majority now wants to impose a restriction on institutions of higher  education regarding the tools that they use in their own best interest  to protect the health and safety of their students.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment.   One more time, to be clear, there is no Federal mandate for vaccines.  There is no mandate. There is no Federal Government forcing a  university to have a vaccine mandate.   If you want to vote for freedom, Mr. Chairman, then allow the  university to do what it would like.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The amendment would block funding for two research grants funded by  the National Institutes of Health. NIH grants are funded after a  vigorous peer review process to identify the most promising research  proposals. In this case, the Congressman from Arizona has identified  research grants to study bat coronavirus as well as zoonotic virus  emergence in Southeast Asia.   Given the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, I would argue that  we really do need to understand more about bat coronavirus as well as  zoonotic virus emergence in Southeast Asia.                                time  1945    I will tell you; I am not in the medical profession. I am not a  scientist. I believe in the research. I believe that we need to take a  look at things, given what we have heard anyway. Again, I am not a  scientist, but I believe in research and we need to understand more  about bat coronavirus, zoonotic virus. Coronavirus and zoonotic viruses  are not going to disappear if we stop funding research. Why are we  research deniers?   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose this amendment, and I  say to my colleague just keep your head in the sand.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I say to the gentleman, my colleague and  friend, I will refer to my earlier remarks on a similar amendment from  the Congresswoman from Florida.   This amendment would bring Medicare operations to a standstill. I  urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I am hoping that the  gentleman will make good on a muffuletta.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the gentleman and I agree on muffulettas, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   This amendment prohibits the use of funds to implement, promote, or  enforce the recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention to add the COVID-19 vaccine to the child and adolescent  immunization schedule of the Advisory Committee on Immunization  Practices.   This amendment would set a dangerous precedent for Congress to  overrule the scientific process used in determining eligible vaccines  for children.   The amendment would interfere with the work and purpose of the  Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice, CDC's Federal advisory  committee, which develops recommendations on the use of vaccines in the  civilian population of the United States.   The advisory committee is comprised of medical and public health  experts who make recommendations that include the ages when the vaccine  should be given, the number of doses needed, the amount of time between  doses, and precautions and contraindications.   Before recommending any vaccine, the advisory committee considers  many factors, including the safety and the effectiveness of the  vaccine. CDC sets the U.S. adult and childhood immunization schedules  based on these recommendations. The COVID-19 vaccine has already been  added to the CDC immunization schedules based on recommendations from  the advisory committee.                                time  2000    This amendment would undermine CDC's ability to engage in its ongoing  immunization work, including the safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.  Kids may be less likely to get COVID, but why wouldn't we want to  continue to protect them? For immunity sake, we need to protect the  entire population to be able to protect everyone.   I oppose this amendment due to its interference with the scientific  process that is used in determining eligible vaccines for children. I  urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. This  amendment prohibits the use of funds to enforce any COVID-19 vaccine  mandate. Okay, one more time, let's be clear. There is not a COVID  vaccine mandate in place. I will repeat, there is not a COVID vaccine  mandate in place.   COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective at protecting people from  getting seriously ill, being hospitalized, and dying. Vaccination  remains the safest strategy for avoiding hospitalizations, long-term  health outcomes, and death. COVID vaccination reduces the risk of death  by at least 75 percent.   Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is safer and a more reliable way to build  protection than getting sick with COVID-19. For those who have had  COVID, vaccines offer added protection against being hospitalized from  a new infection.   There are new variants that are expected as part of the evolution of  viruses, and those could be more aggressive, transmittable, or cause  more serious or severe disease than the original strain. Vaccines  continue to be our best line of defense. Scientific experts have  determined the COVID vaccines to be safe and effective, and hundreds of  millions of doses have been administered in the United States.   Our Nation's public health officials need to have options to protect  our communities. As we continue to live with COVID, we should not be  limiting the use of our most effective public health tool. This  amendment would set a dangerous precedent for Congress to overrule the  scientific process.   Although many people would like to act like COVID is over, it is not.  More than a million people have died due to COVID in the United States.  We all have lost someone.   Why isn't it understandable in terms of some of these amendments that  there is no COVID vaccine mandate in place? What are we speaking about  here?   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment. Public service should be commended and not demonized.   Our Federal Government needs talented, intelligent, hardworking  people who are willing to bring their skills, expertise, compassion,  and experience to public service.   Proposing to eliminate the salaries of hardworking public servants is  petty and beneath the dignity of this body, and it is not how we should  solve differences of opinion on policy.   Admiral Levine--I repeat--Admiral Levine is the head of the United  States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps. That is one of the  eight uniformed services in the United States.   A physician, she completed her training in pediatrics and adolescent  health at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City.   The focus of her medical career has been the interaction between  mental and physical health, particularly for children and adolescents.  Imagine the knowledge, expertise, study, and commitment of Admiral  Levine.   Given the ongoing mental health crisis in this country, particularly  with children and adolescents, I am grateful and in awe of her  expertise and service.   Prior to joining the Biden administration, Admiral Levine served as  Pennsylvania physician general and secretary of health. My God, what a  background.   She is highly qualified for her position, and I say to her tonight  that I commend her efforts to improve the health of Americans across  this country.   Let's be honest. The Congresswoman from Georgia submitted this  amendment to target the salary of a transgender health official. It is  as simple as that.   It is ugly. It is disgraceful. I ask whoever is watching of the  American people and everyone in this body to note the date and time  when the Republicans in the House of Representatives have hit a new  low.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this vindictive  amendment offered to target the salary of a qualified transgender  health official who has the expertise and knowledge to address health  issues in a way that many in this body are unable to do.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment. Again, public servants should be commended and not  demonized.   Our Federal Government needs talented, intelligent, hardworking  people who are willing to bring their skills to public service.  Proposing to eliminate the salaries of hardworking public servants is  petty, and it is, yes, beneath the dignity of this body. It is not how  we should solve differences of opinion on policy.   I suspect that folks could challenge Members of Congress on their  views and opinions, yet they don't have the ability to threaten our  livelihoods. Maybe they should have the ability to threaten our  livelihoods. Proposing to eliminate the salaries of hardworking public  servants is really a stain on this institution.    I know Secretary Cardona well. Secretary Cardona is well known for a  career as an educator with a passion and dedication to students and  teachers and a commitment that has now been on full display nationally.   When he first joined the Department, students and families were  facing unprecedented change and disruption to their education. With his  leadership and investments made by Congress over the past several  years, including the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Safer  Communities Act, schools now have the resources to strengthen teaching  and learning in our classrooms.   Under his leadership, schools can better support student academic  recovery, address mental health needs, and tackle nationwide teacher  shortages. Those are the issues.   We need his steady leadership at the helm of a vital agency that  oversees our investments, our Federal investments, in public education.   Let me take a second to make a comment, Madam Chair. We are now less  than 4 days away from a government shutdown. Instead of focusing on  keeping our government open, we are working on a bill that is going  nowhere. This is a bridge to nowhere, for sure.   The harmful funding cuts proposed in this bill and the ugly  amendments that demean this body and this institution are on full view.   This is not regular order. What we should be doing now is to have the  allocations for each of the appropriations subcommittees. We should do  what was agreed to by the former Speaker of the House in a budget  agreement. We should be moving toward passing appropriations bills that  will provide the services and resources to the American public in  agriculture, education, health, and transportation.   We should be dealing with the issues of national security that face  us today. We should be dealing with the international crises that face  us today, which are going begging, about which we are doing nothing.   This is an unbelievable waste of time and an exercise in futility  with the overview of an ugliness that, once again, demeans this  institution. This is the Congress of the United States.                                time  2030    We are here tonight introducing petty and vindictive amendments that  demean the individuals who hold these positions and once again demean  the dignity, the stature of the United States House of Representatives.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this vindictive amendment, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise to strike the last word.    Madam Chair, I am very well aware of the vote that we  took earlier this evening. It may be that the gentlewoman doesn't know  that there is another body attached to the U.S. Congress called the  United States Senate, and they have to vote on the continuing  resolution. When they vote on it, we will find out what it is that they  do with regard to this continuing resolution passed by the House, which  quite frankly, is flawed to a fare-thee-well in meeting our  obligations, both domestic and international.   By the way, it isn't a law of the land until the President of the  United States signs it. That may be a basic lesson in civics. There is  the House, there is the Senate, and there is the President.   Quite frankly, the budget agreement that had been signed by the  President--for a basic primer in civics--is that the budget agreement  passed the House overwhelmingly, and it passed the Senate, and it was  signed by the President. It is the law of the land, which my colleagues  on the other side of the aisle have dismissed, walked away from, and  quite frankly, don't understand the process of government, an  unwillingness to govern and an inability to govern.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   This amendment blocks a critical aspect of the Biden administration's  whole-of-government strategy to build resilience at home and abroad  against the impacts of climate change.   Madam Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   This amendment blocks another critical aspect of the Biden  administration's whole-of-government strategy to build resilience both  at home and abroad against the impacts of climate change. It is my  understanding that  [[Page H5827]]  this amendment would prohibit--let me give an example. The agency  highlighted certain grants provided under the Workforce Opportunity for  Rural Communities and clean energy sector apprenticeships provided  through the bipartisan YouthBuild program, but that would be blocked.   It is wrong to block the Department of Labor from commonsense  grantmaking intended to build skills in the clean energy sector for  rural workers and for at-risk youth.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   This amendment blocks suggestions and recommendations from a report  by the Department of Education to ensure that college is available to  all Americans who wish to attend, not just the wealthy, not just the  privileged.   In this report, the Department has identified promising practices  based on evidence that institutions can consider. Many of these  interventions or practices have already been shown to be successful at  other institutions or States.   The types of strategies this amendment seeks to undermine are  essential to expanding diversity and opportunity in higher education  and enjoy broad, bipartisan support, strategies like supporting K-12  college counseling, providing emergency and need-based aid, and  supporting transfer and community college partnerships. Why not?   Instead of proposing amendments like this that would harm students, I  hope my colleagues across the aisle will join me and the Department of  Education in expanding educational opportunity for all Americans. Let's  have a literate, educated society.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. It  seeks to block priorities for an out-of-date civics competition from  2021.   While my colleague seeks to gin up alarm over the prospect of Federal  funding being used to support priorities that alarm her, she failed to  mention how the Department ran an entirely new civics competition in  2023 that used different priorities from the 2021 competition. The  Department has no current plans to reuse the 2021 priorities that she  speaks about.   Let me just tell you: Our children need to know about civics. We have  children today who know nothing about government at the local level,  the State level, or the Federal level. They don't know how to interact  with one another with differences of opinion. The lack of knowledge  about civics has created more division in our society than almost  anything else.   We need to invest in civics, and I know that because I have  introduced legislation in a bipartisan way on having civics taught.  Let's not create a specter about what civics education is and define it  in your terms. It is good to have an educated society that understands  what our government is about and how we can interact with one another  and have agreements and disagree in an agreeable way with one another.   In the end, this amendment was drafted to conjure up unwarranted  fears and concerns. It will have no impact. It is another waste of our  time.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise to claim the time in opposition to  this amendment.   This amendment would cap the facilities and administrative costs for  NIH awards at 30 percent of the cost of the award.   About 6 years ago, in October of 2017, the Labor-HHS subcommittee  held a hearing on this topic. In a bipartisan way, we invited four  experts who represented research institutions across the country, in  Connecticut, Oklahoma, San Francisco, and Seattle.   The consensus from our expert panel that morning was that a proposal  by the Trump administration to place a  [[Page H5829]]  cap on indirect costs for NIH awards would have a sharply negative  impact on research.   Our expert panel outlined the critical importance of indirect costs  to their world-renowned research programs and the harsh consequences of  establishing an arbitrary cap on indirect costs.   Dr. Bruce Liang, dean of the University of Connecticut School of  Medicine, outlined the many research-related costs that are covered  under the guise of facilities and expenses, or indirect costs. He  described the facilities and administrations cost as the shared  expenses related to the building and use of research facilities and the  administrative backbone functions that make such places run.   Dr. Liang noted that the facilities and administrative reimbursements  pay for building depreciation and maintenance, shared equipment,  academic library materials, departmental administration, office  supplies, and grant oversight activities, such as preaward applications  and hopefully post-award work.   He concluded by saying that F&A costs are absolutely critical funding  to keep academic medical centers and research facilities operating  efficiently.   Our expert panel noted that the Association of American Medical  Colleges, the Association of Public and Land Grant Universities, and  the Association of American Universities all oppose the proposal to  place an arbitrary cap on indirect costs for NIH awards.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   In the past few years, most of the institutes targeted, as I  understand it, by this amendment, or Confucius Classrooms that are  affiliated with them, have closed down. According to the data from the  Congressional Research Service and the National Academy of Scholars, we  know that compared to 2019, when there were over 100 Confucius  Institutes nationwide, there are only a handful that operate in the  United States--between 7 and 10. They are not still operating. Given  the rate, they may continue to plummet.   I am struck by this amendment. By exaggerating the threat and  proliferation of these kinds of classrooms, it seems to be spreading  misleading information that creates fear. Fear that is caused by these  exaggerations leads to harm toward Asian-American students and  teachers.   To be honest, I don't know, and I would like to examine this. Were  they teaching the Chinese language and Chinese culture? Maybe it was a  learning experience. I don't know the answer to that. I just know that  this does not appear to be a difficulty.   I worry about spreading misleading information that creates fear. We  have all seen in these areas what happens when fear and misinformation  is spread. It has resulted in violence against Asian-American students  and Asian-American teachers, which is not something I believe my  colleague would foster.   Based on available data, I think we can conclude that this amendment  does not address any measurable threat to our system of public  education and, quite honestly, is not being offered in good faith.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I really am quite troubled with this, and I  [[Page H5830]]  need to express this. It seems to me that what is happening here with  the amendment is that it seems to incite misinformation and fear.   I don't know, quite frankly, if there is any evaluation or tangible  results of what the effect of the institute or the classrooms were and  are. They seem to have gone away.   I think of it in these terms. My family members are immigrants from  Italy. If they were teaching about Italian culture, teaching the  Italian language--again, I don't know. This has really piqued an  interest in me in trying to look at and investigate what we are talking  about.   Would there be this view that somehow the Italian Government was  taking over and somehow brainwashing our kids or taking our kids down a  wrong path?   We seem to be casting aspersions with this amendment on Chinese  culture and education in the guise of the Chinese Government. I suspect  that that has a chilling effect. Quite frankly, you could say this  about any cultural group or ethnic group that was working with  youngsters in our community.   Madam Chair, I find this amendment to be very troubling, more so than  I ever thought. We have discerned no measurable threat to our system of  public education.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.                                time  2110     Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment. This amendment, once again, demonstrates the lack of  seriousness of this process and the lack of seriousness by my  Republican colleagues.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, just to note, this Federal employee is a  nonpolitical civil servant, but I will say what I said before: I  believe what this amendment demonstrates is a lack of seriousness of  this process that we are engaged in here tonight and a lack of  seriousness of my Republican colleagues in this House.   Madam Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   Secretary Xavier Becerra is a lifelong public servant. He is also a  very dear friend, and I suspect he is a personal friend of many Members  here today on both sides of the aisle.   Xavier Becerra spent 24 years in the U.S. House of Representatives,  including as a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee and as a  member of the House leadership, serving as assistant to the Speaker and  as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus.   As Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, Xavier  Becerra leads one of the most important departments in the Federal  Government, including world-leading biomedical research, public health,  and drug development.   Health and Human Services is responsible for mental health, substance  use prevention and treatment, community health centers, LIHEAP, Head  Start, childcare and development block grants, and emergency  preparedness and response.   As Secretary of HHS, he is responsible for Medicare, Medicaid, and  the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplace, which together  provide healthcare coverage to 160 million Americans, or nearly half of  our country.   During his tenure at HHS, Secretary Becerra has overseen record- breaking enrollment in health coverage under the Affordable Care Act,  as more than 16 million people selected a marketplace health plan in  2023.   Secretary Becerra's accomplishments are too numerous to list here. He  has served his country honorably for more than 30 years, and he  deserves better than this deplorable amendment.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this vindictive  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2150     Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment. Proposing to eliminate the salaries of the hardworking  public servants, as I have said earlier, is really petty. It is very,  very petty, and it is beneath the dignity of this body. It demonstrates  a lack of seriousness in the process that we are now engaged in and the  road on which we should be traveling to really put together  appropriations bills that meet the needs of the American people and our  international obligations. This is really not how we should solve  differences of opinion.   The mission of the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights  is to ensure equal access to education and to promote educational  excellence throughout the Nation through vigorous enforcement of civil  rights.   OCR's mission includes areas of concern that the Labor-HHS-Education  Committee has prioritized, again, over the years on a bipartisan basis,  including stronger enforcement to protect the rights of students with  disabilities.   Currently, there is bipartisan support for continuing OCR's  enforcement of civil rights laws as outlined in President Biden's and  the Biden administration's U.S. National Strategy to Counter Anti- Semitism, something that we are--just the flood of anti-Semitism today,  and on a bipartisan basis we are supporting OCR's enforcement of the  civil rights laws to counter anti-Semitism.   At a time when so many student populations are feeling vulnerable and  in need of support, it really is irresponsible, and it is reckless to  take out the Department of Education's top civil rights official. Once  again, it demonstrates a lack of seriousness in the process that we are  engaged in here on this floor at 10 o'clock at night.   I believe again, as I said earlier, it demonstrates a lack of  seriousness on behalf of my Republican colleagues in the House of  Representatives.  [[Page H5835]]    Vote ``no'' on what is a vindictive amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    I am opposed to the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment. This is really pretty extraordinary.   What is the mission of the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety  and Health Administration? It is to assure safe and healthful working  conditions for working men and women by setting and enforcing standards  and by providing training, outreach, education, and assistance.   OSHA is responsible for making sure employers provide safe  workplaces. This is really just consistent with an earlier amendment  that the gentlewoman offered which was to eliminate all funding for  OSHA. Clearly, she doesn't have very much concern about creating a safe  workplace for employees.   Since OSHA was created in 1971, the number of workplace deaths and  the rate of on-the-job injuries has declined by 65 percent, with a  workforce twice as large.   Why do we not want to protect workers on the job? What is wrong with  that concept?   My mother worked in the garment industry, and all those years ago,  she was not protected. None of the women in that sweatshop were  protected. We have moved forward to protect our workers. That is what  OSHA does.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this misplaced  amendment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, there isn't a COVID vaccine mandate. I  think we have established that over and over and over again.  Apparently, it just doesn't come through.   The long and the short of it, what this amendment would do is really  hurt a public servant at the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration.   Madam Chair, I am opposed to the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.   The amendment would prohibit funding to the World Health  Organization.   This prohibition would remove the United States from an indispensable  partner in protecting America against everyday public health concerns,  as well as crises and public health emergencies.   Disease does not recognize borders. The United States is not an  island. If you have an outbreak of Ebola in West Africa, you can bet  that that is a plane ride away from the United States. Understand that  this is the world that we function in and that we need to have partners  in what we are doing to be able to control public health emergencies  overseas and in the United States.   This amendment is unnecessary. It opens the door for other countries  to replace us in our seat at the table. We cannot tolerate any effort  to stymie American leadership on global health.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, there is nothing more to do but continue to  oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment.   This amendment would block funding to the Office of Population  Affairs at the Department of Health and Human Services.   The two most significant grant programs administered by the Office of  Population Affairs are the Title X Family Planning program and the Teen  Pregnancy Prevention Program.   I might add that the Republican Labor-HHS bill introduced today  already eliminates both of these programs.   In 2022, 2.6 million people in the United States received healthcare  services through Title X health clinics, including in all 50 States,  the District of Columbia, and eight territories. The majority of  patients live at or below the Federal poverty line.   More than a million people rely on Title X-funded providers as their  sole or primary source of healthcare. This healthcare includes access  to contraception, cancer screenings, sexually transmitted infections,  testing, and treatment, and other preventive services.   In 2022, Title X-funded providers administered close to 500,000  cervical cancer screenings and more than 3.5 million STI and HIV tests.  Let us take those healthcare opportunities away from people who use  these clinics as their primary source of care.   Given the push by Republicans to ban abortion, since the overturning  of Roe v. Wade, it is more important now than it has ever been in 50  years for people to have access to birth control.   In addition, the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program supports evidence- based comprehensive sex education programs, which have been proven to  reduce pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections among teens.   The Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program is vital--now more than ever.  Young people need access to honest and accurate sex education programs  that give them the knowledge to prevent unintended pregnancies, avoid  sexually transmitted infections, and the ability to develop healthy  relationships.   But again, the Labor-HHS bill introduced today eliminates funding for  both Title X Family Planning and the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program.  It is appalling.   The Republican majority will stop at nothing to attack women's  reproductive health at all levels.   As we have seen across the States, Republicans will continue their  efforts to ban abortion.   As this amendment shows, their preoccupation with women's  reproductive health is not limited to abortion but extends to  eliminating access to contraception and comprehensive sex education.   Mr. Chair, I will give a note about cervical cancer, if I can. Every  year almost 4,000 women die from cervical cancer in this country. The  ability to get people screened--and a lot happens with young women-- their ability to get screened and to be diagnosed and get the treatment  that they need is essential for them to survive.   Why in God's name would we deny them the opportunity for a screening  and treatment in order to be able to survive? Why?   I don't understand my Republican colleagues' preoccupation with  women's reproductive health. It is not limited to abortion. You would  eliminate contraception, comprehensive sex education, and the ability  for people to get screenings and treatment that they need in order to  be able to survive.   Again, saving lives is the most important effort that we can make as  Members of Congress. That is our job.   Let us oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   The amendment would block the Biden-Harris administration's proposed  rule that would ensure the Federal Government and States get the most  bang for their buck from the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by closing  loopholes that drug manufacturers were taking advantage of--and we do  know that drug manufacturers can take advantage of individuals.   By opposing this rule, Republicans just want to hand money to their  drug manufacturer friends to take advantage of taxpayers' dollars.   The proposed rule would help States more effectively operate their  Medicaid pharmacy programs and approve access to necessary prescription  drugs for people covered by Medicaid.   In particular, the proposed rule would help States obtain drug  rebates required under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The proposed  rule would enhance the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program integrity by  assuring greater consistency and accuracy of drug information  reporting, strengthen data collection, and efficient operation of the  program.   This amendment would make it more difficult to understand  manufacturers' pricing--a big issue today is the cost of the  prescription drugs, the manufacturers' pricing. What a sop to the  industry. It tells you where the majority's priorities are--so a State  is unable to increase its leverage in negotiating larger supplemental  rebates for high-cost drugs.   This amendment would increase costs for the Federal Government and  for the States.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   The amendment would prohibit the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention from conducting or supporting any firearm injury and  mortality prevention research.   Firearm injury is among the five leading causes of death for people  aged 1 through 44 in the United States and the leading cause of death  among children and teens aged 1 through 19.   I have to repeat the last statement: Firearm injury is the leading  cause of death among children and teens aged 1 through 19.   The gentlewoman said that this is not about public health. It is the  leading cause of death among children and teens aged 1 through 19. This  is all about public health unless we don't believe that causes of death  are a part of public health. Maybe that is true.   This amendment to prohibit the CDC from conducting research on the  leading cause of death of our young people would be added to a bill  that already removed the funding for this research.   This amendment is absurd.   Mr. Chair, read the bill. Collecting timely data, addressing the gaps  in knowledge around this issue, and identifying effective prevention  strategies are needed to keep individuals, families, schools, and  communities safe from firearm injury and death and to enhance safe  firearm practices.   The CDC is supporting a diverse portfolio of research projects to  advance our understanding of the characteristics, risks, and protective  factors of firearm violence, suicide, and unintentional injury, and the  effectiveness of interventions to prevent firearm-related injuries and  death--injuries and death, public health.  [[Page H5838]]    Many funded research projects focus specifically on youth or will  have implications for youth while others are relevant for specific  populations at elevated risk for firearm violence and suicide like our  veterans and those who have been victims of violence.   I fought to establish this funding line in fiscal year 2020, and I  will continue to fight to ensure that this funding is included.   We should be united in finding ways to save lives and end gun  violence, not play partisan games with this critical research.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, let me make one point. I am opposed to this  amendment, obviously, because it is an absurd amendment.   Firearm injury is the leading cause of death among children and teens  aged 1 through 19. This is all about public health. Let us not turn it  into a debate or a discussion on anything else.   What this says to me is there really isn't a desire or the  understanding of what we try to do to save the lives of teens, adults,  veterans, or anything else that falls into the litany of amendments  that we have seen here tonight that would put people's lives in danger  and don't use the resources we have through this Labor-HHS bill that we  have used on a bipartisan basis in prior years to save lives.   This is one more example of how we believe that maybe the lives are  not worth saving.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment.  The amendment would block the Department of Health and Human Services  from requiring minimum staffing levels at long-term care facilities.   Understaffing in nursing homes is in a full-blown crisis.   To address the staffing crisis, the proposed rule would require a  minimum number of certified nursing assistants, who provide the bulk of  personalized care for our loved ones, as well as registered nurses.   Staffing minimums will ensure that high-quality care and patient  safety are prioritized, as decades of research demonstrate a clear  association between higher staffing levels and a higher quality of  care.   In contrast, low staffing levels have been linked to increased cases  of abuse and the overuse of antipsychotics and psychotropic drugs.   In addition, minimum staffing levels are needed to support a long- term care workforce that has relied for too long on the sacrifice of  underpaid caregivers who often earn below 200 percent of the poverty  level.   This workforce is disproportionately comprised of women, particularly  women of color, whose hard work, dedication, and skill has never been  properly valued.   Underpaid long-term care workers face physical and emotional burnout,  which also leads to high turnover rates which further exacerbates  staffing shortages.   Furthermore, let us be clear: The long-term care industry is making  record profits in Medicare. Billions of taxpayer dollars are being  diverted from patient care to profits. Private equity firms are buying  nursing homes because of their potential for profit.   If the majority was serious about supporting the nursing workforce,  they would have provided increased investments in the Nursing Workforce  Development program at the Health Resources Services Administration,  which helps to develop the pipeline of nurses.   Instead, the majority has cut nearly $20 million from this program  and has the audacity to then include report language that says that the  committee remains concerned over workforce shortages among healthcare  professionals, including the nursing workforce.   Concerned would be great without cutting $20 million from the  program.   I strongly support the Biden administration's proposed rule to  strengthen minimum staffing levels at our long-term care facilities.    Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I would just say  to the gentleman that if you really cared about the nursing shortage-- and we have a serious nursing shortage--there wouldn't be this $20  million cut that is there. There wouldn't be less pay for nurses. There  wouldn't be the cutting of the programs that recruit and train nurses.   We would have a program that dealt with the cancellation of student  debt for nurses. We would make investment in nurses so they would want  to be on the job, but no. You cut every piece that, in fact, assists  nurses in being recruited, trained, get better wages, get better hours,  get better opportunity to get their training and get indemnity on their  student debt in that regard.   No. This is a profit motive. This is a profit motive for nursing  homes and the industry that protects them. There are private equity  firms that are buying the nursing homes because of their potential for  profit.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.                                time  2240     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. This  amendment prohibits the use of funds to enforce any COVID-19 mask  mandate. I don't know how many times I have said it here this evening,  there is currently no Federal mask requirement in place.   What is it that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't  understand? No Federal mask requirement in place. Is that not the  Queen's English? It is there.   I will just say that masks have been used in medical settings to  prevent respiratory infections for decades. Healthcare professionals  wear masks for a simple reason: They work.   Let me repeat one more time: There currently is no Federal mask  requirement in place, so let's not continue to waste more time when we  need to proceed with getting appropriations bills funded.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment. This amendment would block implementation of guidance issued  by Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra in October to  apply to all employees and applicants of HHS agencies.   The guidance simply says that HHS is a workplace that does not allow  for discrimination against employees based on gender, including gender  identity. It is the policy of the Federal Government to treat all of  its applicants and employees with dignity and respect and to provide a  workplace that is free from discrimination and intolerance. Title VII  of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination on  the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation.   The HHS guidance issued in October follows guidance issued by the  Office of Personnel Management, OPM, in March of this year.   The Federal Government needs to set an example. We have a  responsibility to ensure that all employees are able to work in a safe  environment free from discrimination, from intolerance, from bullying,  all of those things, and I would add that all Federal employees should  be guaranteed a respectful environment. This is basic human decency.   We cannot--and we should not--stand for discrimination in any form,  and this amendment would seek to promote discrimination. Please, I  strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, basic human decency. Let's embrace  people wherever they are, whoever they are. Let's not allow for a  workplace, particularly at the Federal level, that allows  discrimination, intolerance, bullying or making people feel they are  less than a human being, less than an individual who deserves love and  respect. That has to be starting from the top at the Federal level. We  need to set an example.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.                                time  2250     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   The Department of Labor first started working to prevent silica- related diseases in the 1930s. The Secretary of Labor, Frances Perkins,  the first woman Secretary of Labor in the United States, launched a  major campaign to stop silicosis deaths in this country.   In 2016, the Department issued a long-needed standard to protect  workers against deadly silica dust, which causes silicosis and leads to  a very painful death. Silica dust causes silicosis and lung cancer.   Unfortunately, the exposures, deaths, and diseases continue, which is  why the Mine Safety and Health Administration proposed new rules to  strengthen miners' protection from silica.   Once again, this is about workers' lives, but it would appear that:  Who cares? The miners are expendable.   The new rule lowers exposure limits from breathable crystalline  silica in coal, metal, and nonmetal mines. In addition, the rule would  provide the same medical surveillance protection that coal miners  receive to all miners in metal and nonmetal mines.   Unfortunately, this amendment would halt our country's steady  progress in combating silicosis and other fatal health conditions by  blocking the Department of Labor's efforts to save miners' lives-- again, a theme throughout the amendments that we have heard on this  floor tonight. All put at risk the lives of men, women, and children in  this country. Hard to believe that my colleagues would not be  interested in saving lives rather than making these lives expendable.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2300     Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose this amendment. I think  one of the pieces of information I just found out is that miners will  die a lot younger from silicosis.   I have to think about the logic that my colleague mentioned, that if  we put this rule into effect that the mines will close, but having dead  miners will somehow keep the mines open? The miners are not there. It  would just seem to me that it is a cost-benefit analysis here.   Let's put the rule into place, let's save miners, and let's let the  mine thrive, instead of no rule, no miners, closed mines. There's no  logic.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   This amendment is yet another effort by the House Republican majority  to curtail the rights of workers, many of whom are living paycheck-to- paycheck in order to enrich the big businesses and corporations that  they serve.   The amendment blocks the National Labor Relations Board's new  election rules, which will reduce unnecessary delays in the union  election process. This allows employees to realize their free choice of  representation more quickly, and if a majority supports the union, get  parties to the bargaining table, and it does not subject employees to  intimidation by employers.   The previous board, which answered to their allies at big  corporations, drafted election rules in 2019 that were struck down by  the D.C. circuit. So those unlawful rules were already struck down  under the current board.   This amendment would prevent the board from finishing the process of  restoring the prior rules that have already been held up by the Federal  courts.   A point to be made: It is the unions who created the middle class in  this country. It is the unions that have provided a work week, a safe  workplace, increased wages, and I might add that unions benefit  nonunion workers, as well. It has been demonstrated in the auto  industry in terms of salary.   This is just another attempt to deny people the ability to form a  union, to have collective bargaining rights, and to be able to  determine what kind of representation they need and that they want in  the workplace. It is about getting to the bargaining table and making  sure that workers' rights are respected and honored in this country.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I think it was the National Labor Relations  Act, and I think it may have been Franklin Roosevelt who dealt with the  National Labor Relations Board.   Do you know how many union elections--I will tell you about one in  the city of New Haven. The graduate students at Yale University, who I  worked with for several years, were shot down by the NLRB year after  year after year, maybe for 6 or 7 years, until finally last year, they  were able to be able to form the union. Now the issue is how are they  going to be able to deal with the first contract and bargaining.   It has been a slow walk to get unions recognized and give people the  opportunity to be represented by a labor union. It only takes grit and  tenacity to get through it in order to be able to get the opportunity  to be represented by a union.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I was surprised. The gentleman earlier said  he was for unions and collective bargaining, and all of a sudden we are  talking about union lackeys.   The Cemex decision blocked by this amendment has already been  implemented and is now the legal framework that determines when and why  employers may be required to recognize and bargain with unions.   Cemex preserves the employer's discretion to voluntarily recognize  unions based on a demonstration of majority support. Many employers are  doing so, but employers are always free instead to timely request an  election to test a union's support.   The NLRB is already conducting these elections, and parties are  seeking remedies where there is election interference.   Blocking enforcement of the rule would create legal uncertainty for  employees, employers, and unions. Since the board decided Cemex,  employers--this is not just workers--but employers have filed almost  100 petitions for such elections. This amendment would put many of  those employer-filed petitions in limbo.   The amendment would also block the board's current standard for when  an employer's illegal conduct prevents a fair election and necessitates  a bargaining order.   Employees would lose clear protections for their right to have a free  and fair choice on union representation.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment.   I think one has to try to take a look at the labor history in our  country in a very serious way to understand that the birthing of the  unions, the struggle for workers' rights, and the violence against  workers who have tried to form unions in this country. It has been not  an acceptance of the collective bargaining rights of workers in this  Nation.   Workers have sacrificed. Some sacrificed their lives to get the  creation of a union in this Nation.   What are we talking about?   The delays and the delays and the delays to recognize workers'  rights; to study labor history in this Nation and what a difficult time  it has been for workers to be able to be represented by a union of  their choice and not have to fight over and over and over again for  their rights.   It can't be that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle don't  understand the labor history and what has happened, and the forces that  have tried to keep labor unions from forming.   I think we have a point of agreement. Labor unions created the middle  class of this Nation. Thank God, once again, they are on the rise. They  are winning elections against some of the major corporations in this  Nation who have tried to trodden down on them for many, many years.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  [[Page H5845]]    This amendment would prevent millions of Medicaid and CHIP  beneficiaries from accessing critically necessary care.   The Biden-Harris administration's proposed rule seeks to strengthen  access to coverage for children and adults covered by Medicaid and  CHIP. To access the healthcare providers and services they not only  need but that they are entitled to.   The proposed rule would set a national standard for maximum wait  times for routine medical appointments for primary care and obstetrics/ gynecology. An appointment would need to be provided within 15 days,  and for outpatient behavioral health services, 10 days.                                time  2330    The proposed rule would require greater transparency on provider  rates. The rule would require rate transparency to, once again, ensure  an adequate network of providers. The proposed rule would require home  care agencies to allocate at least 80 percent of the Medicaid payment  to direct care workers' compensation.   Once again, this Republican amendment would hurt our economy's  children, seniors, people with disabilities, and the most vulnerable.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment.   I will make a suggestion to the gentleman that Texas ought to expand  Medicaid.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, our Federal Government needs brilliant and talented  scientists who are willing to bring their skills to public service.   Dr. Munster is chief of the Viral Ecology Section at the National  Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, an important  component of the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Munster is a  leading expert in how viruses emerge and infect human populations and  how we can best address these public health threats.   Dr. Munster's laboratory aims to understand how emerging viral  pathogens cross the species barrier so we can identify risks to humans  and prevent disease outbreaks. He and his colleagues, in collaboration  with the University of Oxford, helped to pioneer a vaccine approach  that was used to develop a COVID-19 vaccine in partnership with  AstraZeneca. The vaccine was widely used in the United Kingdom to  combat the COVID-19 pandemic.   Nevertheless, Mr. Chair, apparently no good deed goes unpunished. Dr.  Munster should be celebrated for his contributions to science and his  dedication to protecting people from deadly public health threats.   This is another amendment that really just demonstrates the lack of  seriousness in this process and a lack of seriousness on behalf of my  House Republican colleagues.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  2340     Mr. Chair, this lack of pursuing scientific knowledge,  scientific research--and the gentleman earlier spoke about Dr. Anthony  Fauci.   Dr. Fauci, his contributions to HIV/AIDS research for over 50 years  and other immunodeficiency diseases is heralded in the annals of  Discovery to Cure. This basic view that the pursuit of the answers to  chronic illnesses, to diseases, to pandemics somehow is not understood  for what its potential is and what it can do to save lives.   I get the impression that some of my colleagues would shut down the  NIH and the basic research, the scientific research that we do, the  biomedical research that we do, collapse the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention, not allow them to function, to deal with  illness and disease and pandemics.   It is really kind of staggering that we would just see this  unbelievable denial of science, pioneering vaccines in partnership with  AstraZeneca used in the United Kingdom to combat the COVID-19 pandemic,  expertise in how viruses emerge, which we are looking at, how they  infect human populations. Why don't we want to know that?   Why? Why don't we want to understand that?   Then what we can do, if we understand it, is figure out how to treat  these public health threats. What do we need to do to deal with the  public health threats?   It is stunning to me that we would retreat to a backwater in science  and research if my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have their  way.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.  [[Page H5847]]     Mr. Chair, I am unclear because it says that the  amendment offered by Mr. Rosendale of Montana: None of the funds made  available by this act may be used to finalize, implement, or enforce  the rule titled, ``Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule,''  published in the Federal Register on October 4.   I think what the gentleman is speaking about, if there is another  amendment that he is making reference to, that what he is talking about  is providing abortions to unaccompanied children. That isn't the basis  of his amendment at all here.   Mr. Chair, can we get some clarity on the gentleman's amendments? My  understanding is that it is about the Unaccompanied Children Program  Foundational Rule. Is that what this amendment is about?                                time  2350     Mr. Chair, it says amendment No. 135, and I think we  need to--do you have an amendment that deals with the unaccompanied  children program foundational rule?   I yield time to the gentleman to talk about what amendment we are  speaking about. I yield time to the gentleman on his amendment.    Mr. Chair, one more time, I yield time to the gentleman  to clarify, but the amendment that was submitted, confirmed by the  majority, is ``none of the funds made available by this act may be used  to finalize, implement, or enforce the rule titled Unaccompanied  Children Program Foundational Rule.'' The gentleman is speaking about  something else altogether different than the proposed amendment. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I  think this amendment is a good example of the Republican approach to  appropriations bills. It is an overreaching effort to block seven  separate executive orders related to climate change. Many of these  executive orders have nothing to do with the Labor-HHS-Education  appropriations bill.   We are here to protect the welfare of the American public, and we  cannot close our eyes to the impacts of climate change, such as the  recurring drought, flooding, severe storms, and wildfire events that  have been pummeling our country and, for that matter, the world.   As of last month, the United States has experienced 24 confirmed  weather/climate disaster events exceeding $1 billion in damages each-- each one. That is $24 billion; a new record.   However, instead of addressing climate change, this amendment would  block funding to develop more resilient communities, mitigate the  impacts of climate change, and protect future generations.   This amendment would ensure that we continue to pay billions of  dollars more each year for disaster relief--though we don't seem to be  able to get a supplemental bill that includes disaster relief for  people who are struggling--rather than invest in strategies that  minimize and prevent the acceleration of climate change or mitigate  against its disastrous effects.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.  [[Page H5848]]         Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   Over and over again, I have said tonight there is no vaccine mandate.  Understand it. Get it into your head.   My only response is let's not waste any more time. Tutto finito.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, I congratulate the gentleman on his  amendment. I think one of the places where we haven't really put in  resources for a while is the National Eye Institute, and I am always  interested in making sure that all the institutes are being plussed up.   I have tried to do that in the 4 years that I served as chair of this  committee because some of the smaller institutes do not get the  resources that they need.   Mr. Chair, I support my colleague's amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I  am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, I guess this is kind of kumbaya here. I rise  in support of the amendment.   The amendment would add $2 million to the funding already provided to  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to address Valley fever.   CDC's Valley fever efforts received annual increases while I was  chair of this subcommittee, and the bill before us includes an  additional $10 million increase.   The intention of offering this amendment is to highlight that even  more should be done, given the growing impact of this fungus. To me,  this amendment highlights the significant need to support the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention overall.   The CDC has a wide range of programs. Each one does not operate in a  vacuum. Core activities of public health data, infrastructure,  workforce, health statistics, laboratory science at CDC must be  supported to raise the tide for all programs.   The majority of CDC's funding is provided to State, local, Tribal,  and territorial public health partners. CDC is supporting efforts in  each of our communities, and this amendment highlights the needs of  public health efforts are growing.   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, our luck ran out. I rise in strong opposition  to the amendment.   This amendment would further cut funding by 26 percent for important  programs and services that provide opportunities for working families.   The underlying bill already cuts tens of billions of dollars from  programs that help families and low-income workers. This amendment  would cut an additional $38 billion from education, health, job  training, worker protection, and the Social Security Administration's  operating budget.   For instance, this amendment would cut Head Start by another $2.9  billion, almost $3.7 billion below this year 2023, leading to over  250,000 children losing access to high-quality early learning programs.   It would cut the Childcare and Development Block Grant by $2.1  billion. This is amidst a childcare crisis when parents want to work,  but they cannot find affordable childcare for their kids.                                time  0020    It would cut the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP,  which is a bipartisan priority, by more than $1 billion.   It would cut senior nutrition, including Meals on Wheels, by $277  million, resulting in more than 1 million low-income seniors losing  access to home-delivered or prepackaged meals.   It would cut biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health  by more than $11 billion, resulting in a reduction of more than 10,000  new grants for potentially lifesaving research.   It would cut nearly $2 billion from mental health and substance use  disorder services, when CDC data shows nearly 110,000 deaths in 2022  related to drug overdoses, the highest number ever.   It would cut title I funding for low-income public schools by $3.2  billion, reducing needed resources for 25 million low-income students.   It would cut special education grants to States by $3.8 billion,  reducing support for services for 7.5 million students with  disabilities.   It would cut Pell grants by $5.8 billion for students and families in  need.   Yes, it would cut the Social Security Administration's operating  budget by more than $3 billion. It would shutter field offices and  eliminate services for seniors.   It is interesting to me that when it comes to the programs that are  encompassed in the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education  appropriations bills, that there is a great worry about a deficit,  there is a great worry about borrowing, but when we did $2 trillion for  the richest one-tenth of 1 percent of the people in this country and  the biggest corporations who pay no taxes, no one batted an eyelash.   We continue on that road of looking at the biggest corporations who  pay no taxes, and we will continue to make sure that they profit and  that working families, middle-class families, the most vulnerable  families, are at risk because someone has decided that it is no time to  borrow and it is no time to make public investments in their lives.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, we have a revenue problem. We have a serious  revenue problem, and the majority looks for every excuse to cut back  the opportunity for increased revenues.   Why do I say that? We are told that we leave $1 trillion on the table  every year because we do not enforce our tax laws on the wealthiest,  the billionaires, the Amazons, the Hewlett-Packards, the corporations  who pay no tax. We cut the heart and soul out of the IRS when they are  collecting millions of dollars from tax cheats.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   This amendment would block the Department of Education's commonsense  provision that prevents colleges from stretching out the length of  their postsecondary training programs just to rake in more of the  students' and taxpayers' money because the students will have to take  out more loans.   When a student goes to a higher education training program, they  shouldn't have to complete 1\1/2\ times the training the State requires  just to graduate and get a job, all so their college can make a few  extra bucks.   This provision of the Department's regulation rights a longstanding  wrong that allowed colleges to exploit students and abuse taxpayer  dollars by dragging out the time it takes to graduate from a program.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment.   Let me highlight the first sentence of this executive order: ``The  right to vote is the foundation of American democracy.'' Amen. I agree.   I find it really pretty extraordinary to say that we are weaponizing  to protect the right to vote. The right to vote is enshrined. People  have died for the right to vote in this Nation.   This executive order recognizes that there are too many obstacles to  voting. Unfortunately, those obstacles disproportionately exist for  people of color, people with disabilities, and people who speak English  as a second language. Members of our military serving overseas as well  as other American citizens living abroad also face challenges to  exercising their fundamental right to vote.   Simply put, the Biden administration is trying to expand access to  voter registration and election information. This order directs  agencies to ensure that the online Federal voter registration form is  accessible to people with disabilities. They have a right to vote.   This order directs the Secretary of Defense to establish procedures  consistent with the applicable law to offer each member of the Armed  Forces the opportunity to register to vote in Federal elections.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, it really is quite amazing that when the  States have their purview. We have just been through an extraordinary  time where States have legitimized the election of the President of the  United States, and we have a whole bunch of folks here who deny what  the States have said about the legitimate election of the President of  the United States.   Again, the right to vote is the foundation of American democracy.  That is what this is about. We need to continue to enshrine the  public's right to vote whether they are able, disabled, people of  color, everyone, a veteran overseas, and Americans who are abroad who  are allowed to vote. We need to make it possible for people to exercise  their right to vote in the United States and not continue to  circumscribe that right, as my colleagues on the other side have been  doing for a very long time, and oppressing and suppressing a vote.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, the amendment would block a reporting  requirement related to COVID-19 vaccination coverage among healthcare  personnel, which is submitted quarterly via a web-based tool.   Mr. Chair, we know vaccines work. In the case of the COVID vaccine,  we know they help to prevent illness as well as mitigate the severity  of illness for those who get sick.   For healthcare workers, being vaccinated is not only a matter of  their own health. It is also good for the health of their patients.   When healthcare workers get sick, they can unknowingly infect their  patients, and patients who come to ambulatory surgical centers are  already recovering from an illness or injury and cannot afford  additional exposure or the risk of COVID.   Vaccines help to keep workers healthy. Higher vaccination rates for  healthcare workers mean fewer days of missed work because of illness,  which is good for healthcare facilities, particularly facilities  already struggling with staff shortages. It is good for patients, who  do not have to worry about canceled appointments because healthcare  workers are out sick.   That is why healthcare staff vaccination rates are a useful measure  in the quality reporting program.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment for the reasons that  I have stated, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment even  though I strongly support the gentleman's interest in Head Start.  Frankly, I thank my colleague for his interest in Head Start and his  willingness to acknowledge the devastating cuts to the program in the  current bill. The Head Start program was cut by $750 million.                                time  0050    In real terms, that means roughly 80,000 Head Start and early Head  Start children would no longer be able to receive services under the  proposed Republican House appropriations bill.   In Mr. Lawler's district alone, 1,400 low-income children and their  families are benefiting from the education, health, and nutrition  services provided by Head Start. Mr. Chair, 140 of these children, a  tenth of those in his district, will lose services and support with the  shameful cut in the bill that we are dealing with right now.   Do I appreciate and support a $100 million increase to the program?  Yes, but $750 million was cut. $100 million is a fraction of what is  necessary. The whole cut needs to be restored, and Head Start needs  additional resources so that none of the children currently lose their  opportunity for Head Start, not just in Mr. Lawler's district, but the  1,600 children in Mr. Aderholt's district, as well as the 1,300 kids in  my district, and the 1,000 children in Chair Granger's district.   Now, let's talk about the offset. The gentleman wants to take from  the Department of Education. Here we go again traveling down the road  of eliminating public education in the United States.   House Republicans don't support the Department of Education. We get  it, but the Departmental Management Account has already been cut 18  percent. This amendment would slash another $100 million from this  account, bringing the total cut to $177 million, or a stunning 41  percent.   The Program Administration account funds the Federal civil servants  who provide grants to States. You need a grant for your State, this is  where you go. School districts need a grant, this is where they go.  Institutes of higher education need a grant, this is where they go.   These staff answer the questions. They provide vital funding to  communities across the country. Head Start is critical for fostering  school readiness, family development, and creating lifelong learners,  and when these opportunities are taken from children, all of us in  every community suffer.   I appreciate my colleague's intent to increase Head Start, and I  appreciate that another colleague on the other side of the aisle is  willing to stand up and acknowledge how inadequate the funding level in  this bill is, but we cannot destroy the Department of Education by  decimating the nonpolitical career staff that administer its vital  programs.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I think as chair of this committee for 4  years, in a bipartisan way, we increased Head Start funding in higher  numbers than had been dealt with in the recent past.   I applaud the bipartisanship of that effort to deal with Head Start  funding because of how critically important Head Start is, but it is  stunning to me that we could look at a $750 million cut in Head Start  with this bill.   You mentioned spending. I will get back to you on revenue. Let's  collect revenue, so we can make the public investments in Head Start  and in education and other areas that have been begging. Let me assure  the gentleman I will work along with all of my colleagues. I will fight  against cuts to Head Start. Head Start will always be a priority for  me.
