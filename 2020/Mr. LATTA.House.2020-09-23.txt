 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my good friend from  Michigan, for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 4447, which represents a  missed opportunity to advance true bipartisan policies that would  secure our Nation's energy future.   America's innovators have shown over the past 15 years that they are  capable of spurring economic growth and reducing emissions as long as  the United States has a regulatory environment that is conducive to the  development and deployment of new technologies.   In fact, according to an April EPA report, national greenhouse gas  emissions have fallen by 10 percent since 2005 and power sector  emissions have fallen by 27 percent while, during the same period, our  economy grew by 25 percent. Unfortunately, H.R. 4447 would do nothing  to cultivate the necessary regulatory environment to continue to build  on these accomplishments.   Another reason to be concerned about this bill is the price tag. At a  time when our country is seeing record budget deficits, how has the  majority chosen to respond? By spending over $135 billion in taxpayer  funds on partisan energy mandates that pick winners and losers.   Finally, my Republican colleagues and I offered amendments to improve  this bill. My amendment would have authorized the establishment and  operation of a uranium reserve to assure its availability in the event  of a market disruption and to support strategic fuel cycle capabilities  in the United States. This policy would result in lower carbon  emissions, new jobs, and a more secure world.   Unfortunately, the majority ruled against this amendment, as well as  those offered by my Republican colleagues on the Energy and Commerce  Committee that would have ensured the American people would have access  to affordable and reliable sources of energy.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this partisan  legislation.
