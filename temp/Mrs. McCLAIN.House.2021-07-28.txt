 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the radical,  partisan, and polarizing appropriations bill the Democrats are ramming  through this Chamber.   It wasn't enough for the Democrats to disregard the opinion of an  overwhelming majority of Americans who do not want their tax dollars  being used to bankroll abortions here in the U.S. In this  appropriations bill, they want to take it a step further and export  abortion around the world. You heard it right.   The Helms amendment, which predates the Hyde amendment, ensures that  U.S. tax dollars do not fund abortion through foreign assistance  programs. Foreign assistance programs should help defend our country.  Democrats felt the need to strip it from this bill.   My constituents do not want their hard-earned tax dollars shipped  overseas to kill unborn children. And you know what? Neither do 77  percent of Americans, according to a January 2021 Marist poll. Yet,  Democrats are saying they are giving people what they want. Well, that  is a flat-out lie.   Who exactly are they catering to with this radical move? Far left- wing activists?   I am disgusted by some in this Chamber and the President for their  shameful disregard of taxpayer wishes; their hypocritical double  standards; and, most importantly, their shameful disregard for human  life.   As a reminder to this administration and my colleagues, I am wearing  flip-flops today so they can be reminded of this administration's  ability to flip-flop on issues. This administration could not be  consistent if their life depended on it, or worse, ours.
