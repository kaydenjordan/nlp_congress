 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Bowman for  yielding, and I fully appreciate an opportunity to be in partnership  with a fellow teacher for the cause of climate change.   Climate change is infrastructure. Our buildings, roads, and  transportation are directly impacted by the impending climate crisis.   In this 1 year, we have seen our oceans on fire; a pipeline broke in  the Gulf of Mexico; our bridges are crumbling; our buildings are  collapsing; wildfires and heat waves have been paired with rolling  blackouts in my district.   Unfortunately, my constituents and I have experienced this for  decades without much progress, but we cannot continue to accept this as  a reality, a continuing reality.   In addition to losing power in my district, some of the worst air  quality in the country exists in my district. Despite California  leading the Nation in investing in renewable energy, we still are not  doing enough.   As co-chair of the Congressional Energy Storage Caucus, I know how  critical it is for us to invest in renewable microgrids that are  powered by solar and wind energy and backed by battery energy storage.  Congress must provide municipalities, businesses, and residents with  the ability to purchase and build their own energy grids that are  resilient to our frequent natural disasters.   We have the technology to catch up to the modern industrial world. We  cannot afford not to use this technology. We must invest.
