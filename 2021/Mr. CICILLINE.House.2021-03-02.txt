 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1, the  For the People Act, which would provide the most significant reform to  our democratic system in decades.   This landmark legislation will strengthen our democracy by expanding  access to the ballot, reducing the corrupting influence of corporate  money in political campaigns, and restoring ethics and integrity to  government.   H.R. 1 will make it easier for millions of Americans to vote and  significantly increase the number of voters in this country by  implementing initiatives like automatic voter registration. It will  also implement reforms that will hold elected officials to a higher  ethical standard, such as requiring Presidential candidates to disclose  their tax returns.   These are issues that I have introduced legislation on in the  previous Congress, and I am proud that they are included in H.R. 1.   Finally, H.R. 1 will include the DISCLOSE Act, which I introduced to  shine a light on unlimited spending that has overrun our elections.  Without fixing our broken system and taking power from the powerful  special interests and returning it to the people of this country, it  will be almost impossible to make progress on the issues  [[Page H974]]  that are important to the American people.   The DISCLOSE Act will require organizations that spend money on our  elections to promptly disclose donors who give $10,000 or more during  an election cycle, and prevent political operatives from actions meant  to conceal the identity of donors.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the For the People  Act, restore democracy, return power to the people of this country, and  take it away from the powerful special interests.
