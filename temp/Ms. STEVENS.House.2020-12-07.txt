SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.         This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, shall take       effect on the date that is 180 days after the date of       enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on S. 1153, the Stop Student Debt  Relief Scams Act of 2019.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1153, the Stop Student  Debt Relief Scams Act, today.   I would like to thank my colleague, Congressman Smucker, for  cointroducing this bill with me and for his efforts to end these debt  relief scams. We all know that our country faces a mounting student  debt crisis, with Americans now holding more than $1.5 trillion in  student loan debt.   Predatory scammers are increasingly taking advantage of student loan  borrowers, who face a complicated loan repayment process. These  unscrupulous scams defraud student borrowers by providing deceptive  information to mislead them into paying thousands of dollars for  services that the Federal Government already provides for free.   These scams come by way of robocalls. They are harassing and  menacing, and the victims of these schemes are not only defrauded but,  unknowingly, become delinquent on their payments and default on their  loans, falling even deeper into debt.   We hear this time and time again because these phone calls come to  your personal cell phone even if you don't have a student loan.   In 2007, I took out $9,000 of student loans to finish my last  semester of graduate school. I was able to repay that loan within 6  years. Years later, I still receive these very types of menacing phone  calls, to my personal cell phone, of scams asking me to go through  these programs.  [[Page H6882]]    These are individuals who receive information through the Department  of Education. This is what we are trying to stop. They are accessing  your personal information to scam you.   This is what we are here today to stop. This problem, unfortunately,  during COVID-19 has only exacerbated. During this pandemic, the relief  that was provided to help Federal student loan borrowers under the  CARES Act has created additional opportunities for scammers to target  desperate Americans.   This bill will ensure that the Department of Education and law  enforcement agencies have the tools they need to crack down on these  predatory fraudsters. It will also empower student borrowers by  providing counseling and resources to make sure that all borrowers are  aware of these potential scams and receive accurate information about  the repayment options.   Knowledge is power here. It is time to stop these scammers from  jeopardizing the financial future of student borrowers, and I urge my  colleagues to support the passage of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   He is called the gentleman from Pennsylvania, but some of us also  call him the gentleman from Lancaster.   I truly want to thank my colleague on the other side of the aisle,  Mr. Smucker, for his leadership on this critical piece of bipartisan  legislation to stand up for hardworking Americans, to stand up for our  students, and to put into place a clarified law declaring that it is a  Federal crime to access U.S. Department of Education information  technology systems for purposes of fraud, commercial advantage, or  private financial gain, and that fines these scammers up to $20,000, or  up to 5 years of imprisonment, as my colleague so nicely articulated.   This is an attempt today to shut down predatory scammers who are  targeting our student borrowers, for the financial health of the  American people.   Again, I strongly encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to join us here today in passing this critical piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
