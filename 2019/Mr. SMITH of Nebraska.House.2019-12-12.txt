 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  100th anniversary of the Scotts Bluff National Monument's official  designation.   Having grown up in Gering, Nebraska, I am proud of the monument and  the uniquely American story of the role it played in our westward  migration. As one of the highest points in Nebraska, dominating the  landscape, it stood as an unmistakable part of the Oregon Trail. When I  look at the monument, I can't help but think of the brave pioneers of  the Oregon Trail.   Stunning sights and Oregon Trail landmarks, such as Scotts Bluff  Monument, must have been a source of awe on the arduous journey west.  It had to have served as motivation to keep going and a relief to know  they were well on their way.   Scotts Bluff was named for Hiram Scott, a fur trader who died nearby  in 1828. Just as the monument's name comes from early economic activity  in our region, the monument is still important to our regional economy,  drawing 150,000 people from across America and around the world each  and every year.   I thank the great folks who dedicate their time and hard work to keep  the park in great condition so others may enjoy it for generations to  come. It is with great pleasure I join with all Nebraskans to celebrate  the centennial of this Oregon Trail icon.                            ____________________
