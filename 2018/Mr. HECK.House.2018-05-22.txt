 Mr. Speaker, I will regrettably vote ``no'' on S. 2155.   It is regrettable because I believe our local banks and credit unions  are struggling under the weight of regulations. I believe that we have  bank rules that need fixing. I wanted to support a bill that would do  so.   But I cannot vote ``yes'' for two reasons.   First, this bill cannot release the pressure small banks are under  because it does not address the single biggest cause. Every bank and  credit union I have met with cites one regulatory burden as paramount,  and that is the Bank Secrecy Act, CTRs, anti-money laundering. And what  does this bill have? Not one section, not one sentence, not one word.   Secondly, this bill makes changes I believe could set us back. It has  been cited; the increase of SIFI designation from $50 billion to $250  billion is a large step down a dangerous road.   The insurance provision, on the other hand, also goes against my goal  of returning power to State regulators, who provide the greatest  consumer protection.   If my colleagues had been allowed any input, I think we could have  accomplished the goal. But this bill doesn't solve the problem it aims  for and may create new ones. Accordingly, I cannot support it. I ask  Members, as well, to oppose it.
