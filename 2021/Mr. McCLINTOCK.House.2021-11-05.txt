 Madam Speaker, if the previous question is defeated,  we will take up the Illegal Immigrant Payoff Prohibition Act.   Last week, our Nation was stunned by the revelation that the Biden  administration is about to use our tax dollars to pay thousands of  illegal immigrants $450,000 apiece and up to a million dollars per  family.   Why? Because they were separated from their minor child when they  were arrested for the crime of crossing our border illegally.   Now, remember, any American citizen arrested with a child is  immediately separated from that child. The adult goes to jail, the  minor is taken into protective custody. That is what happened.   The penalty for illegal entry is supposed to be a fine and prison.  The Democrats are literally changing it into a million-dollar jackpot.   This administration has already made a mockery of our immigration  laws by refusing to enforce them. This has now produced the greatest  illegal border incursion in our country's history.   Working- and middle-class Americans are the most harmed by this  because it is their wages that are depressed by flooding the market  with low-wage labor. It is their classrooms that are strained with non- English-speaking students. It is their emergency rooms that are  overwhelmed by illegal immigrants demanding basic services. It is their  communities that are made more dangerous as gang activity increases and  criminal, illegal aliens are released back into their neighborhoods.   And now, to add insult to injury, the Democrats propose taking their  tax dollars to make thousands of lawbreakers fabulously wealthy as an  apology for President Trump actually enforcing our laws and securing  our border. That is insane.   The American people understand that quite clearly. Republicans will  not allow this twisted travesty to go unchallenged. If there are any  sane Democrats left in this House, I invite them to join us by voting  ``no'' on the previous question.
