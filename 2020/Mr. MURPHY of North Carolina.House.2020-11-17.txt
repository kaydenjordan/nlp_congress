 Mr. Speaker, this past Wednesday, we  recognized Veterans Day.   It is most appropriate that we set aside a day each year to thank the  brave men and women in our Armed Forces who have selflessly sacrificed  so much for our great Nation.   For more than two centuries, Americans have fought under the American  flag for the principles of freedom, justice, and equality under the  law.   Our Americans stand tall and are respected worldwide for their  dedication to country and the sacrifices that they have made for our  freedom. Many have gone to hell and back to preserve the natural rights  outlined in the Constitution, specifically freedom of speech, freedom  of religion, and the right to bear arms.   In eastern North Carolina, I am honored to represent 95,000 veterans,  the third most of any congressional district in the United States.   Despite the partisanship oftentimes seen in this body, it is  critical, like was done on this House floor last night, that we show  broad, bipartisan support for our American veterans.   Their defense of our Nation has not been just for Democrat, not just  for Republican or independent. It has been for all Americans.   So, again, we say thank you for your service, and God bless you all.                            ____________________
