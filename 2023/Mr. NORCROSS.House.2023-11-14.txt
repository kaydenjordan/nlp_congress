 Mr. Chair, I thank the ranking member for recognizing  me.   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the Republican Labor-HHS  appropriations bill, which, among other cuts, would slash funding for  DOL's Wage and Hour Division by nearly 30 percent.   Among other functions of the Wage and Hour Division, it enforces the  Davis-Bacon Act, which ensures that workers are fairly compensated. It  has been around since 1931.   Davis-Bacon requires that workers on Federal construction projects  are paid a prevailing wage, which prevents workers from being undercut,  not being paid the correct amount of money for their work.   For this reason, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to  recommit this bill back to committee. If the House rules permitted, I  would have offered the motion with an amendment to increase funding for  the Wage and Hour Division to improve the full force of Davis-Bacon.   Mr. Chair, I hope my colleagues will join me in voting for this  motion to recommit.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record the text of my amendment.        Mr. Norcross moves to recommit the bill H.R. 5894 to the       Committee on Appropriations with the following amendment:        Page 18, line 12, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $155,953,000)''.
