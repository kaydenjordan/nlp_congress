 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise today to  express my support for the resolution to impeach President Trump.   This is an open and shut case. The facts are clear to all who wish to  see them.   In his January 6 speech, Donald Trump incited a vicious assault on  the U.S. Capitol with the intention of pressuring Vice President Pence  and a joint session of Congress into overturning the results of the  Electoral College vote that made Joe Biden president. It's clear he  wanted Congress and the Vice President to declare him president for a  second term despite his losing the election.   I believe that this was the final act in what was a months-long  effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election results so that he  could remain in office.   I believe that Donald Trump's actions on January 6 constituted high  crimes and misdemeanors under the Constitution and therefore justify  his impeachment. He is clearly  [[Page H189]]  guilty of sedition, and his actions led to the loss of five lives that  day, including that of a Capitol Police officer who was mortally  injured defending the Capitol, the Congress, and the Vice President.   I also support impeaching him now, even though he has just a few days  left in office, in order to define a standard of acceptable conduct for  future Presidents--and a precedent to deter future presidents from  attempting to defy the will of the American people.   Finally, I believe that President Trump should be impeached and  immediately removed from office because I am concerned that, given what  he has done to illegally remain in office, it is possible, if not  highly probable, that he would take further undemocratic and criminal  actions in the days he has left in a desperate bid to thwart the  voters' will.   Those are the reasons why I cosponsored the article of impeachment  and why I will vote for it today.
