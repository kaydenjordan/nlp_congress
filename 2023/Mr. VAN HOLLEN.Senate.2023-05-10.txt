 Mr. President, I think everybody in this body now  knows that, yesterday, President Biden convened a meeting at the White  House to discuss how the United States would avoid a default--a default  on the country, a default on our debt, a default which would be  something that has never happened before in the history of the country.   The 14th Amendment, section 4 says:         The validity of the public debt of the United States,       authorized by law, including debts incurred for payment of       pensions and bounties for services . . . shall not be       questioned.    ``Shall not be questioned.''   Throughout our history, in good times and bad times, we have always  met our obligations as a country, and that is why President Biden  wanted to bring together the congressional leaders to discuss making  sure that we don't do that for the first time.   He was joined, of course, by Speaker McCarthy. He was joined by the  minority leader from the House, Congressman Jeffries. From the Senate,  he was joined by Majority Leader Schumer and Republican Leader  McConnell.   I was asked earlier today whether I felt better in the aftermath of  this meeting having taken place. And I said: I am glad that the leaders  planned to meet again on Friday, but, no, I don't feel more comfortable  or confident today than I did before the meeting, and the reason is  this: because Speaker McCarthy continues to threaten to default on  America's debts unless he and the MAGA Republicans in the House can  impose big parts of their agenda on the country, impose their agenda on  the American people.   I just want to unpack for a moment what exactly that means. What  exactly is Speaker McCarthy saying to the country? And he is saying  this: that if  [[Page S1589]]  the Senate doesn't go along with the very extreme proposals passed by  the House Republicans and if the President doesn't agree to sign on to  those extreme proposals, he will allow the United States, for the first  time in our history, to default on our obligations.   And what does that mean? It means he is threatening economic  catastrophe, because there is no dispute among Republicans--I don't  care if you are a Democratic economist or a Republican economist-- economists across the board will tell you that a default would be  catastrophic for our economy--massive job losses. We saw an estimate  the other day of 8 million jobs lost in the country--retirement nest  eggs that people have been working a lifetime to build up imploding,  interest rates rising, the credibility of America around the world  shattered, the dollar as the world's reserve currency being called into  question.   I can tell you who will be celebrating if this happens, and that is  the folks in Beijing, the PRC. They will be very happy if the United  States undermines its credibility on the world stage, and they will be  very happy if we lose our position of having the dollar being the  world's reserve currency.   So what was President Biden's response? So what the President is  saying--and I want to be clear about what he is saying. He is saying:  Hold on, Mr. Speaker. Hold on, Speaker McCarthy. Paying our bills on  time is not just a Democratic obligation. It is not a Republican  obligation. It is not an Independent's obligation. It is an obligation  of Uncle Sam. These are obligations the United States has built up  during Democratic Presidencies and Republican Presidencies.   In fact, if you look at the record during the 4 years of the Trump  administration, we accumulated one-quarter of the total debt owed by  the United States today. Yet, during those 4 years, the House and the  Senate, without drama, said: Yes, the United States is committed to  paying its debts, and we will do so, and we will address the debt  ceiling in that manner.   Just to emphasize once again, what we are talking about is  obligations the United States has already incurred, that we have  already said as a country: We will do this. We will pay your Social  Security. We will pay your Medicare. We will pay our veterans. We will  pay our obligations as a country, including those who have purchased  U.S. Treasury bonds.   That is what we said when we passed those things, and it is important  that we keep our word.   So what President Biden says is, look, these are Uncle Sam's  obligations. Mr. Speaker, you don't get to come in here and threaten  the health of the American economy if you and House Republicans don't  get to enact your policies, don't get to enact your agenda. So take  your finger, Mr. Speaker, off the default detonator, and then we should  talk about issues of common concern. We can talk about the budget. We  can talk about the deficit and debt. We can talk about spending. We can  talk about revenue.   In fact, President Biden has submitted to the House and Senate his  budget proposal. I serve on the Senate Budget Committee. We as a Senate  have received that. President Biden has proposed a budget that achieves  $3 trillion in deficit reduction over the next 10 years. The proposal  passed by Speaker McCarthy and Republicans in the House achieves about  $4.5 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years.   So what the President is saying to Speaker McCarthy and House  Republicans is: We are happy to sit down as part of the normal budget  process. We are happy to talk as part of the normal appropriations  process about how we can address the deficit and the debt. I put  forward my proposal. You put forward a proposal. Let's sit down.   But President Biden is not saying this to Speaker McCarthy: You have  to reduce the deficit by $3 trillion the way I, President Biden, have  done it, and if you don't agree to my proposal for reducing the deficit  by $3 trillion, then I am not going to sign a bill to raise the debt  ceiling.   If President Biden said that, people would say he is crazy, and it  would be very irrational. But that is exactly what Speaker McCarthy and  House Republicans are doing. They are saying: Mr. President, if you  don't reduce the deficit our way, we are going to blow up the American  economy.   So let's step back from the brink here. Speaker McCarthy, take your  finger off the default detonator, and let's have a discussion about how  to reduce the deficit and debt, because when you do that, you  understand that many of our Republican colleagues really don't care  that much about the deficit and debt. Why do I say that? Because if you  say ``Let's reduce the deficit and debt by increasing revenue by asking  some of the wealthiest people in the country--billionaires, people who  make hundreds of millions of dollars every year--if you say ``Let's  reduce the deficit by asking them to pay more in terms of taxes,'' you  won't get any support from our Republican colleagues, the same folks  who say it is absolutely urgent that we reduce our deficit and debt.   But we know there are two sides of the equation. There is spending,  and there is revenue. In fact, if you go back to the last time the  United States balanced our budget, which was around the year 2000, you  will find that revenues as a share of our GDP, revenues as a share of  our economy, were about 20 percent. Today, if you look forward to the  next couple of years, the projections are that total revenues will be  about 18 percent of our economy. The difference between 18 percent  revenues as a share of our economy and 20 percent may not sound like a  big number, but 2 percent of a very big American economy is a lot of  revenue.   So what President Biden is saying is: You know, the last time we  actually balanced our budget, revenue as a share of GDP was 20 percent,  so at least let's look at that as a contribution. Let's look at raising  the top rate on corporations to a level that would still be lower than  it was just 10 years ago but higher than it is today.   All this talk about the IRS agents--you know, Republicans say: Let's  get rid of the additional funds to support IRS agents.   These are IRS agents who are going to go after very rich tax  deadbeats. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office projects that if  you invest in that effort to go after very rich tax deadbeats, you  actually raise revenue. So the action the House took in this regard  actually increased the deficit and is just protecting folks who make a  boatload of money from paying the taxes that are already due and owed.   What President Biden has said is: OK, sit back. Let's talk through  the normal budget appropriations process, but don't threaten to blow up  the American economy.   President Biden's budget also has cuts in it. In fact, what the  President has proposed is that the Medicare Program pay Big Pharma--pay  the pharmaceutical industry a little less for the drugs that the  Medicare Program purchases. After all, all of us in this room and every  American citizen contribute billions and billions of dollars every year  to really important work done at the National Institutes of Health,  which is headquartered in my State of Maryland. It is an American  treasure. It is an amazing place, and it is a great engine of  invention. We spend billions and billions of dollars in taxpayer money  every year for them to do research that has uncovered really important  cures and really important treatments and helped the pharmaceutical  industry develop a lot of the drugs. Yet, Big Pharma uses the research  developed with taxpayer dollars and then often turns around and sells  those drugs at prices that American taxpayers can't afford. So what  President Biden has proposed is that they take a little less. We give  the Medicare Program even more negotiating authority so we can reduce  those costs to Medicare and to the taxpayer. So he has proposed those  kinds of cuts.    I know a lot of our Republican colleagues don't like those ideas, but  that is why you come to the table. That is why Speaker McCarthy should  accept President Biden's invitation to come to the table to discuss, in  the normal course--in the budget and the appropriations process--how we  can address issues of the deficit. What are our priorities? What should  we do on the revenue side? What should we do on the spending side? But  don't, Mr. Speaker, continue to threaten to blow up the American  economy if you don't get your way.   I am just going to end with a story from 2011 because that is the  last time  [[Page S1590]]  we really faced this kind of crisis. I am especially worried this time.  It was very bad in 2011. We came very close to going over the  waterfall. The markets got very jittery. Interest rates did begin to  creep up. It cost the U.S. Government more to meet our obligations. I  am more worried this time because we apparently have a lot more folks  in the House of Representatives who don't seem to fully appreciate and  understand the disastrous consequences of default for American  families, for our economy.   So I remember back in 2011. It was right after the 2010 elections.  Republicans had won a big majority in the House of Representatives.  President Obama was in the White House. And they were threatening early  on to hold the issue of default and threatened to use it for budget  purposes. It is true and we have heard it said that Vice President  Biden at the time came down to the Hill, and they formed what was  called the Biden group. They met in an office right around the corner  here on this floor of the U.S. Senate. I was one of the House Members  who participated in that. There was a total of about 10 from the House  and Senate, Republicans and Democrats. We had at least 10 meetings.   Vice President Biden would begin each meeting this way--he would say:  I know today we are going to talk about the cuts that are being  proposed by House Republicans, and we will do that. But I want you to  know two things. One is, nothing is agreed to until everything is  agreed to, and after we go through these proposed cuts, we are going to  go through proposed revenue increases. We are going to close tax  loopholes for very wealthy people. We are going to attack the deficit  from both sides of the equation. We will do some cuts, but you also  have to be prepared to talk about revenue.   Everybody at the table nodded their head--Senate Republicans, House  Republicans, Democrats.   Well, after 10 meetings of discussing cuts, a lot of us were getting  concerned that we hadn't really begun to dig into revenues.   Vice President Biden said: You know, I said at the beginning of every  meeting that we have to get to revenues. We are going to do that.   At that moment, the talks broke down. Eric Cantor, who was the  majority leader in the House at the time; Speaker Boehner was Speaker;  Kevin McCarthy walked out of the talks, largely because he was afraid  he was going to be fingered by his House Republican colleagues for  having agreed to talk about revenues. Imagine that. You care about the  deficit, but you won't talk about any ways to raise even a penny of  revenue from very wealthy people. That sort of exposed the whole  charade at the time.   Now Joe Biden is President of the United States. I am sure he is  thinking about those days when he served as the head of that budget  group, and I am sure he is thinking back to the fact that our  Republican colleagues came to the table and said they cared about  deficit reduction and all nodded their heads and said ``Yes, after we  talk about cuts, we are going to talk about revenues'' and then walked  out of the room when that moment came.   That just shows that what we are dealing with here is not a  commitment to deal with the deficit and debt. What we are talking about  is a power play to threaten the health of the American economy in order  to impose the MAGA House agenda.   President Biden is absolutely right to say: I am more than willing to  talk about the budget and deficits and fiscal policy, but first, Mr.  Speaker, take your finger off the default detonator.   That is what Mr. McCarthy needs to do, and then we can deal with this  in a way that the country deserves.   I yield the floor.
