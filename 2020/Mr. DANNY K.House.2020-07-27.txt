 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman  from Georgia for giving me the opportunity to speak on this important  bill.   As a matter of fact, Representative Frederica Wilson has made this  her life's work. As a matter of fact, I am wearing her 5000 Role Model  tie, where for many years she established one of the most effective  programs in public education with the Dade Miami school board, where  5,000 young males are taught and trained.   Mr. Speaker, we have had many efforts. Eleanor Holmes Norton and I  created the Caucus on Black Men and Boys. We have been all over the  country with conferences. And I remind us that what we say is one  thing, but what we do is something else.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that we take into consideration all of the things  that we know that has caused the disparities among African American  males and do something that is going to really make a difference. Put  them into action.
