 Madam President, on December 1, we mark the 33rd  anniversary of World AIDS Day, which gives us an opportunity to pause  and reflect on the lives lost to HIV/AIDS, how far we have come in the  fight against this virus, and what we need to do to ensure an AIDS-free  future.   Since the first cases of AIDS were reported domestically in June  1981, more than 700,000 Americans have tragically died due to AIDS- related complications. Significant scientific advances, brought about  by public and private partnerships, led to the development of  antiretroviral therapies--ARTs--which have been instrumental in  decreasing AIDS-related mortality rates by more than 80 percent since  they peaked in 1995. Investment in U.S. disease surveillance,  prevention, and public education has similarly led to an almost 50- percent decline in the incidence of infection since 2010.   We are fortunate to have premier scientific research institutes  within my home State of Maryland working together to combat this deadly  virus. The National Institutes of Health, the Walter Reed Army  Institute of Research, and the Institute of Human Virology at the  University of Maryland all lead U.S. and global research on developing  treatments and a vaccine for HIV/AIDS. The world-class research  institutions housed in Maryland have not only substantially led the  scientific advancements with respect to HIV/AIDS; they have also played  a significant role in reducing the number of new cases among  Marylanders and affording those who contract HIV/AIDS to continue  living full lives. Across Maryland, more than 30,000 adults or  adolescents were living with HIV at the end of 2020.   Though my State ranks seventh among all U.S. States and Territories  in HIV diagnosis rates per 100,000 people, we are making great strides  to prevent new infections. Last year, Maryland recorded fewer than  1,000 new cases of HIV infection for the third consecutive year and a  significant decrease over the peak of 2,612 new HIV infections among  Marylanders in 1991. Public health initiatives the Maryland Department  of Health implemented have been instrumental in reducing new  infections, including programs like safe-sex education programs, condom  distribution, access to prophylactic medication, and a statewide  needle-exchange program for injection drug users.   Today, approximately 1.2 million Americans are living with HIV, and  they are able to lead healthier and safer lives due to increased access  to care under the Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act, ACA. The  ACA has led to increased patient protections such as the prohibitions  on rate-setting tied to health status, the elimination of preexisting  condition exclusions, and an end to lifetime and annual dollar limits.  Still, there are challenges ahead. Increasing prescription drug costs  for ART regimens and health insurance benefit designs that shift out- of-pocket costs onto patients risk the progress we have made to end the  HIV epidemic in the U.S.   Although Federal financial support to Medicaid, the largest source of  insurance coverage for people living with  [[Page S8860]]  HIV, has increased through the duration of public health emergency due  to the COVID-19 relief bills, tightening State budgets amid record  Medicaid enrollment could hinder access to treatment or care for the  HIV/AIDS population. Forty-two percent of adults with HIV receive  healthcare under Medicaid.   In the U.S., the fight against this disease also disproportionately  affects communities of color, with Black and Latino Americans  accounting for a disproportionate share of new HIV diagnoses and  deaths, consisting of about 70 percent of new diagnosis despite making  up roughly 30 percent of the U.S. population. The Biden-Harris  administration's theme for World AIDS Day this year is ``Ending the HIV  Epidemic: Equitable Access, Everyone's Voice,'' denoting a strong  commitment to addressing health inequities within the epidemic. I share  the administration's determination to address the disproportionate  impact of the epidemic on marginalized populations like the LGBTQI+  community and racial and ethnic minorities.   Internationally, the U.S. has invested more than $100 billion in the  global HIV/AIDS response through the President's Emergency Plan for  AIDS Relief--PEPFAR--and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis  and Malaria, Global Fund. This investment has saved more than 20  million lives, prevented millions of people from becoming infected, and  achieved HIV/AIDS epidemic control in more than 50 countries. Since  2003, PEPFAR has changed the trajectory of the HIV epidemic around the  globe by expanding access to HIV prevention, treatment, and care  interventions. PEPFAR is one of the most successful and cost-effective  efforts in the history of American foreign assistance.   Despite the progress we have made around the globe, there is still  significant work to do. Of the 38 million people globally living with  HIV, 12.6 million are not accessing lifesaving treatment. In 2019,  there were 1.7 million people newly infected with HIV--more than three  times the global target--and 690,000 people perished from this terrible  disease. While we have made strides in combating HIV/AIDS in eastern  and southern Africa, we have seen increases in new infections in  Eastern Europe, central Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America.   As with last year's commemoration, this year's World AIDS Day finds  us continuing to battle the COVID-19 pandemic. Support through PEPFAR  and the Global Fund has financed efforts to minimize the disruption of  the pandemic on HIV epidemic response efforts, through services like  telehealth and multimonth dispensing of antiretroviral therapies. The  COVID-19 pandemic, however, continues to affect the global response to  HIV and threatens the decades of progress we have made against this  disease. In addition to disrupting HIV treatments and prevention  services, downstream impacts of the pandemic have cut off vulnerable  populations from educational and social support services, and growing  inequalities resulting from the economic downturn are likely to lead to  increases in HIV risk behaviors and vulnerability. The Global Fund  reported that last year, HIV testing dropped by 22 percent and the  percentage of HIV-positive TB patients on antiretroviral therapies  dropped 16 percent.   A world free from HIV requires global leadership from the United  States, and we have stepped up to the plate by heavily investing in the  global response to HIV. From significant contributions to the Global  Fund to the creation of PEPFAR, U.S. global health leadership and  international collaboration helped to turn the tide on the global  epidemic. This is as true today as it was 33 years ago. International  public health crises require international responses. Unlike the  previous administration, I support President Biden's actions to  reprioritize cooperative global health response efforts. We are only as  strong as the weakest health system, and it is incumbent upon the U.S.  to lead global health response efforts as we look to end the COVID-19  pandemic and HIV/AIDS epidemic.   One of the biggest tragedies of the HIV epidemic is that millions of  people around the world died while waiting for treatment, and once  treatment became available in 1987, it was out-of-reach. At about  $8,000 a year--more than $17,000 in today's dollars--the first HIV drug  was too expensive for populations who needed it most: low-income  communities in the U.S. and low and middle-income countries. While  Congress authorized $30 million in emergency funding to States to pay  for low-income patients' treatment, global access to the drug lagged.  For example, when we established PEPFAR in 2003, only 50,000 people in  Africa were accessing lifesaving HIV treatment.   We cannot make the same mistake with COVID-19. While we have made  great strides domestically to vaccinate our population, it is equally  important to vaccinate the rest of the world from COVID-19. The Biden  administration has made significant strides to supply and commit future  supplies of vaccines to low-income countries, and I implore the  administration to continue working with vaccine manufacturers to  expedite this effort as fast as humanly and safely possible. Equally  important is ensuring access, when approved, to antiviral treatments.  One potential antiviral treatment reduces the risk of hospitalization  and death by 89 percent in high-risk adults when used in conjunction  with ritonavir, a medication commonly used to treat HIV. The potential  success of this antiviral treatment is a testament to the biomedical  infrastructure of the United States, where the incredibly innovative  treatments we developed for HIV may be effective in battling the COVID- 19 pandemic, too.   COVID-19 does not respect borders. To protect our domestic health, we  must ensure that our allies and low and middle-income countries around  the world have affordable access to eventually approved COVID-19  vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics. While we celebrate the  progress we have made with respect to HIV/AIDS this World AIDS Day, we  must recommit ourselves to continuing this fight because success is  within our grasp.   We have made so much progress through international partnerships.  Donor nations; civil society; people living with HIV; faith-based  organizations; scientific research community and academic partners such  as Johns Hopkins University, the University of Maryland, and the Walter  Reed Army Institute of Infectious Disease Research; the private sector;  foundations; and implementing organizations such as Catholic Relief  Services and Lutheran World Relief have complemented those partnerships  tremendously. We must apply the lessons of the fight against HIV to our  current battle against the COVID-19 pandemic so we can save more lives  and get the global economy back on track.                            ____________________
