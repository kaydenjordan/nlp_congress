 Madam Speaker, I rise today to show my support for a  Stronger CAPTA.   The opioid crisis is devastating communities across the country, and  we are seeing rising rates of child abuse and neglect as a result of  this crisis. In order to reverse these trends, we must invest in smart  primary prevention efforts like those included in this bill.   Passing Stronger CAPTA will mean stronger networks of prevention  services that will benefit children and communities for decades to  come.   It will also mean a stronger child welfare workforce. Some States see  a 40 percent annual turnover rate among the child welfare workforce. We  must do more to equip our workers to better serve our most vulnerable  children and families.   That is why I am pleased this bill includes a provision I authored  with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Wright), my colleague, that will  help develop and retain a high-quality workforce in the child welfare  system.   I urge a ``yes'' vote from my colleagues on this commonsense bill.
