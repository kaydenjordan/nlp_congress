 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 388.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the service of Eden  Prairie Police Chief Jim DeMann, who will retire at the end of  September after a career of dedication to the safety of Eden Prairie  and Minnesota families.   Chief DeMann spent his entire career in law enforcement serving our  community in Eden Prairie. In fact, his 31 years of service began back  in 1983, as a Police Department intern. But by 1987 he was a sworn  officer, and he served for almost a decade as a canine officer.   I have known Jim for years, and his leadership will surely be missed  because he led by example and has seen a lot of growth in our  community. But incoming Chief Greg Weber now will surely be up to the  task.   On behalf of our entire Eden Prairie community, I want to thank Chief  DeMann for his service to the entire Eden Prairie community, and I wish  him all the best in his retirement.                            ____________________
