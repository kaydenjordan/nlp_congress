 Madam President, Dr. King's profoundly just and moral  letter from the Birmingham jail continued:         There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and       men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of       despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and       unavoidable impatience. You express a great deal of anxiety       over our willingness to break laws. This is certainly a       legitimate concern. Since we so diligently urge people to       obey the Supreme Court's decision of 1954 outlawing       segregation in the public schools, at first glance it may       seem rather paradoxical for us consciously to break laws. One       may well ask: ``How can you advocate breaking some laws and       obeying others?'' The answer lies in the fact that there are       two types of laws: Just and unjust. I would be the first to       advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a       moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a       moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree       with St. Augustine that ``an unjust law is no law at all.''        Now, what is the difference between the two? How does one       determine whether a law is just or unjust? A just law is a       man made code that squares with the moral law or the law of       God. An unjust law is a code that is out of harmony with the       moral law. To put it in the terms of St. Thomas Aquinas: An       unjust law is a human law that is not rooted in eternal law       and natural law. Any law that uplifts human personality is       just. Any law that degrades human personality is unjust. All       segregation statutes are unjust because segregation distorts       the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator       a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense       of inferiority. Segregation, to use the terminology of the       Jewish philosopher Martin Buber, substitutes an ``I it''       relationship for an ``I thou'' relationship and ends up       relegating persons to the status of things. Hence segregation       is not only politically, economically and sociologically       unsound, it is morally wrong and sinful. Paul Tillich has       said that sin is separation. Is not segregation an       existential expression of man's tragic separation, his awful       estrangement, his terrible sinfulness? Thus it is that I can       urge men to obey the 1954 decision of the Supreme Court, for       it is morally right; and I can urge them to disobey       segregation ordinances, for they are morally wrong.        Let us consider a more concrete example of just and unjust       laws. An unjust law is a code that a numerical or power       majority group compels a minority group to obey but does not       make binding on itself. This is difference made legal. By the       same token, a just law is a [law] that a majority compels       a minority to follow and that it is willing to follow       itself. This is sameness made legal. Let me give another       explanation. A law is unjust if it is inflicted on a       minority that, as a result of being denied the right to       vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law. Who can       say that the legislature of Alabama which set up that       state's segregation laws was democratically elected?       Throughout Alabama all sorts of devious methods are used       to prevent Negroes from becoming registered voters, and       there are some counties in which, even though Negroes       constitute a majority of the population, not a single       Negro is registered. Can any law enacted under such       circumstances be considered democratically structured?        Sometimes a law is just on its face and unjust in its       application. For instance, I have been arrested on a charge       of parading without a permit. Now, there is nothing wrong in       having an ordinance which requires a permit for a parade. But       such an ordinance becomes unjust when it is used to maintain       segregation and to deny citizens the First Amendment       privilege of peaceful assembly and protest.        I hope you are able to see the distinction I am trying to       point out. In no sense do I advocate evading or defying the       law, as would the rabid segregationist. That would lead to       anarchy. One who breaks an unjust law must do so openly,       lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the penalty. I       submit that an individual who breaks the law that conscience       tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of       imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the       community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the       highest respect for law.        Of course, there is nothing new about this kind of civil       disobedience. It was evidenced sublimely in the refusal of       Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to obey the laws of       Nebuchadnezzar, on the ground that a higher moral law was at       stake. It was practiced superbly by the early Christians, who       were willing to face hungry lions and the excruciating pain       of chopping blocks rather than submit to certain unjust laws       of the Roman Empire. To a degree, academic freedom is a       reality today because Socrates practiced civil disobedience.       In our own nation, the Boston Tea Party represented a massive       act of civil disobedience.        We should never forget that everything Adolf Hitler did in       Germany was ``legal'' and  [[Page S2311]]       everything that the Hungarian freedom fighters did in Hungary       was ``illegal.'' It was ``illegal'' to aid and comfort a Jew       in Hitler's Germany. Even so, I am sure that, had I lived in       Germany at the time, I would have aided and comforted my       Jewish brothers. If today I lived in a Communist country       where certain principles dear to the Christian faith are       suppressed, I would openly advocate disobeying that country's       antireligious laws.        I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and       Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few       years I have been gravely disappointed with the white       moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion       that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward       freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux       Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to       ``order'' than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which       is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the       presence of justice; who constantly says: ``I agree with you       in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of       direct action''; who paternalistically believes he can set       the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a       mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro       to wait for a ``more convenient season.'' Shallow       understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating       than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will.       Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright       rejection.        I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that       law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice       and that when they fail in this purpose they become the       dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social       progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would       understand that the present tension in the South is a       necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative       peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust       plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men       will respect the dignity and worth of human personality.       Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not       the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the       hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the       open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that       can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be       opened with all its ugliness for the natural medicines of air       and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension       its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and       the air of national opinion before it can be cured.    Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Virginia.
