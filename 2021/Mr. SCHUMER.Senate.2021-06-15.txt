 Mr. President, a few weeks ago, toward the end of the  legislative session in Texas, Texas Democrats in the statehouse staged  a dramatic walkout, denying a quorum and preventing the Texas  Republican majority from passing one of the most restrictive voting  laws in this country.   Texas Republicans could come back and reconsider the law in a special  session, but the extraordinary measures taken by the State Democrats  reflect the extraordinary damage of the voting law.   Texas Republicans were on the verge of passing several alarming  restrictions: reducing polling hours, eliminating drive-through voting  and 24-hour voting centers. The proposed law would have made it easier  for a judge to overturn an election and push back the start of Sunday  voting--a measure that seemed designed to interfere with voting drives  held by Black churches.   Texas already has some of the strictest voting procedures in the  country. The additional effort, in the wake of Donald Trump's Big Lie,  directly targets all the ways poorer, younger, non-White, and typically  Democratic voters cast their ballots.   Of course, Texas is only the most recent flashpoint in the nationwide  effort by Republican legislators to contract Americans' right to vote,  as you well know, Mr. President.   The tide of Republican voter suppression laws is a direct assault on  our democracy and could disenfranchise tens of millions of Americans   Today, I am proud to say, at the Democratic caucus lunch we will host  the group of Texas Democrats who bravely fought the voter suppression  law in their State. The topic of our discussion will be about how to  come together to protect voting rights not just in Texas but across the  country.   Next week, the Senate will consider major voting rights legislation.  Congress must take action to defend our democracy.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on the President's foreign trip,  President Biden's first foreign trip has projected a welcome sight to  the world: an American President embracing our allies and bringing them  together to confront our common adversaries.   Already, the President's visit to G7 has yielded results: a  commitment to counter China's rapacious economic policies and unwinding  a longstanding dispute over tariffs and trade with the European Union.   Now after meeting with our allies at both the G7 and at the NATO  summit in Brussels, the President will meet tomorrow with Vladimir  Putin. From the occupation in Crimea to violating political human  rights within its own borders, to interfering in democratic elections  across the Western world, to imprisoning those who expose his brutal,  undemocratic regime, Vladimir Putin has spent the past decade  interfering and destabilizing the world order.  [[Page S4524]]    For 4 years, former President Trump turned a blind eye and gave Putin  a free pass. In the history of our country, Americans had never seen a  President of the United States support an adversary the way Trump  supported President Putin on that stage in Helsinki nearly 3 years ago.  We all remember President Trump standing next to Vladimir Putin and  taking the word of a Russian intelligence officer over America's  intelligence agencies.   Trump not only defended Putin repeatedly from accusations of election  interference, he actually announced--if you believe this, stranger than  fiction--that the United States and Russia would set up a joint cyber  security unit. Even Senator Graham said that it wasn't ``the dumbest  idea [he'd] ever heard, but it [was] . . . close.''   Now, President Biden must take the exact opposite approach. The  United States must approach Vladimir Putin with a firm hand and demand  accountability in a way that President Trump never did. I expect  President Biden will do exactly that.   One issue I am particularly concerned about is cyber security and the  rise of ransomware attacks on the critical infrastructure of the United  States. Many of those cyber criminals, unsurprisingly, may be hiding  out in Putin's Russia or potentially connected to Putin's intelligence  agencies.   Here at home, I have called on Congress to significantly boost  funding for our cyber fighting Agencies and asked our Senate committees  to study if we need new legislation to help counter the threat of cyber  attacks.   Abroad, President Biden has an opportunity to pressure Putin directly  to put an end to Russian-supported cyber crime. I expect he will. The  President has smartly made these issues a priority among our NATO  allies, announcing a host of joint actions to combat cyber crime,  harden our cyber security, and condemn Russian aggression in the cyber  space. It is time to take the issue directly to Vladimir Putin himself.   For 4 years, former President Trump berated our allies while  emboldening and sometimes embracing the world's dictators and  autocrats, Vladimir Putin above all. Already, President Biden's first  foreign trip is a welcome turn of the page in America's relationship  with the world.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, on one final matter, QAnon, last  December, I joined with Senator Heinrich and other Democrats to ask the  FBI and DHS to provide a written assessment on the dangers posed by the  online conspiracy group QAnon.   They recently responded to our request with a very sobering  assessment. The threat of QAnon is likely to persist, and the current  environment will likely continue to spur QAnon adherents to see  violence as a legitimate course of action. The assessment also  expresses that QAnon adherents and domestic violent extremists will  likely shift from acting digitally to engaging in real world violence.  That is a shot across our bow. That is a warning signal.   QAnon today is perhaps best known for the role it played in inspiring  many of the rioters who assaulted the U.S. Capitol on January 6.  According to the FBI's assessment, they arrested 20 self-identified  adherents who participated in the insurrection. But even before the  horrific events on January 6, QAnon supporters spread disinformation  that amplified hatred and violence and threatened our democratic  institutions.   The past 4 years have seen a notable increase in violent domestic  terrorism, fed by a host of lies and conspiracies that flourished under  the Trump era. This assessment by the FBI is a stark reminder that we  have a lot of work to do to tamp down conspiracy theories and  disinformation as well as monitoring and thwarting violent domestic  extremists.   And to my Republican Senate colleagues, I would add that this report  further strengthens the argument for an independent January 6  Commission.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     We have two of our Members who couldn't be here because  of serious illnesses in their families, and therefore we are going to  delay the vote on Kiran Ahuja.   I ask unanimous consent that the cloture motion with respect to the  nomination of Kiran Ahuja to be Director of the Office of Personnel  Management be withdrawn.    We will return to that vote as soon as these Members can  return.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I now ask that the Senate recess until  2:15 p.m.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 123.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 157.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, finally, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today, June 15, be  waived.   The PRESIDING OFFICER without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Judiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. 475  and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 269, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, thank you. That was the Juneteenth  resolution, which we will talk about more tomorrow.   I yield the floor.
