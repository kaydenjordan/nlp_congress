 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the life  of Colonel Johnnie Pantanelli.   Colonel Pantanelli embodied so many of our values. She fought for  freedom, broke glass ceilings, and made sure the next generation of  women flew.   Colonel Pantanelli served in the Marine Corps Reserves in 1944 and  1945, and soon after was told her service was no longer needed because  the men were coming home.   Instead of quitting, she joined the Civil Air Patrol in White Plains  and served as a wartime mission observer searching for German subs.   After the war, Colonel Pantanelli earned her pilot's license and  survived  [[Page H557]]  a plane crash during her flight training. She served for decades as  commander of the squadron that is now named after her. In 2011, she  earned the rank of colonel.   Colonel Pantanelli passed away on January 14, 2023. She would have  been 98 in March.   New York's 16th District and I thank her for her service and send our  deepest condolences to everyone impacted by this monumental loss.                            ____________________
