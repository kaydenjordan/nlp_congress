 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  4334, the Dignity in Aging Act of 2019. This is a strong bipartisan  bill to reauthorize the Older Americans Act, which provides vital  services and support to seniors and their families in our community.  [[Page H8475]]    Reauthorization has been an important local priority in my community  in northern Illinois.   During the August work period, I held a roundtable on the issue at  the Fox Valley Older Adult Services with local stakeholders. Their  priorities for reauthorization included increased funding,  transportation, legal services, and support for seniors who age in  place, and their caregivers.   That is why I am so proud that the bill that we are discussing today,  among other improvements: Increases overall transportation program  funding by 35 percent; improves access to that funding; increases  availability and accessibility of meals for seniors; and strengthens  support for family caregivers, including those caring for individuals  with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease.   I am so proud that this bill includes my bipartisan amendment to  ensure that programs that serve seniors are ready to respond to  outbreaks or other public health emergencies.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the  Dignity in Aging Act so that our seniors have the services and support  they need.
