 Madam President, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of Morris Andrews, a revered champion of teachers, children, and  public education in Wisconsin.   Morris Andrews was born in Big Rapids, MI, on November 26, 1935. As a  talented student athlete, Andrews graduated from Big Rapids High School  and went on to play football at Central Michigan University, graduating  with a bachelor's degree in secondary education. He earned his master's  degree from Indiana University in physical education.   Morris taught high school government, coached football, and organized  teachers throughout the country. He came to Wisconsin to lead the  Wisconsin Education Association Council, WEAC, in 1972, initiating a  transformation in the way teachers were valued in the State. Morris  brought pride, power, and respectable wages to the teaching profession.  [[Page S6239]]    After the protracted and bitter Hortonville teachers strike in 1974,  Morris helped craft a mediation/arbitration law that replaced the right  to strike with collective bargaining. This new way of settling public  sector labor disputes ushered in decades of labor peace.   Under his leadership, WEAC set the standard for recognizing the  importance of teachers in shaping the future for generations of  students. As teachers' rights increased, so did graduation rates and  test scores. Wisconsin ACT scores rose to the top of the national  charts for decades. Morris also initiated advancements in education  that are now taken for granted, including uniform graduation  requirements, gender equity in school athletics, universal special  education programs, school nursing services, and remedial reading  programs for underachieving students.   Morris never shied away from a fight worth winning. One never had to  guess whose side he was on. He knew what was best for teachers,  students, and education, and he knew how to get it for them. By  organizing and empowering teachers, he shifted the balance of political  power in Wisconsin away from well-heeled corporate interests toward K- 12 students, their parents, and the dedicated educators who teach them.   When Morris began his tenure in 1972, WEAC had 40,000 members and  little involvement in State politics or education policy. When he  retired 20 years later, he left a 62,000-member powerhouse with a $10  million budget and a staff of 175 that was a major player in the State  legislature and at the ballot box.   Morris didn't rest after his retirement from WEAC in 1992. He  remained committed to his passions of organizing and advocacy,  providing sage advice to candidates of both parties running for office  and speaking assertively for those without a voice. Morris also left an  indelible mark on the State through his work on behalf of the Urban  League of Greater Madison, Fair Wisconsin, and the campaign to build  the Monona Terrace Convention Center.   There is only one endeavor that surpassed his commitment to teachers,  children, and public schools: his dedication to Kris, his wife of 25  years, and his siblings, children, and grandchildren. Beneath his gruff  exterior lived a man with a gentle heart who cared deeply about his  family, friends, and colleagues.   Morris Andrews believed in his heart and soul that a solid education  system was the very foundation of a strong democracy. He dedicated his  life to ensuring both education and democracy thrived in Wisconsin. His  legacy lives on in the successes of generations of leaders educated in  Wisconsin public schools. He can rest in peace knowing he indeed made a  significant difference.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to recognize former  Wisconsin Governor Tony Earl on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of  his election to the Wisconsin State Assembly and the beginning of a  remarkable career of public service. Governor Earl is a progressive  champion in Wisconsin politics and government. He successfully fought  to clean up our polluted waters and protect our environment. He is  passionate about building a society where no one is left behind, and he  listens to and fights for those whose voices are too often not heard.   Anthony Scully Earl was born in St. Ignace, MI, and enjoyed his  childhood on Michigan's Upper Peninsula. As the son of a grocery store  owner, Tony was influenced by his father's strong work ethic. He took  this work ethic with him to Michigan State, where he graduated in 1958.  After earning his law degree at the University of Chicago, Tony served  our country in the U.S. Navy for 4 years.   Following his military service, he moved to Wausau, WI, in 1965 and  immediately became an integral part of the community. He served as an  assistant district attorney of Marathon County for a year before  becoming the first full-time city attorney for Wausau from 1966 to  1969. Following the nomination of Wisconsin Congressman Melvin Laird to  serve as Secretary of Defense and the special election of Dave Obey to  succeed Laird in Congress, Tony himself was elected to fill Dave Obey's  seat in the Wisconsin State Assembly. Tony was so respected by his  colleagues that he was elected majority leader after only 1 year in the  assembly.   He was later tapped by Governor Patrick Lucey to serve as Secretary  of the Department of Administration, followed by service as Secretary  of the Department of Natural Resources. He chaired the Center for Clean  Air Policy and directed the Great Lakes Protection Fund. In recognition  of his passionate stewardship of Wisconsin's natural beauty and his  commitment to environmental protection, the State of Wisconsin recently  renamed the Peshtigo State Forest in his honor.   In 1982, Tony Earl was elected Governor of Wisconsin. As Governor,  Tony was principled, courageous, and bold. He was a passionate advocate  for equality, and his leadership had a profound impact, particularly on  women. Recognizing that people working in female-dominated fields were  often paid less than workers in comparable male-dominated jobs, Tony  established a commission to conduct a comprehensive study of the  comparable worth of State government jobs and then used that data to  establish pay equity for State employees. He led by example and his  work informed decisions by other governmental entities and the private  sector.   Early in my career, I had the privilege of interning in Governor  Earl's office, working with his advisor on women's issues, Roberta  Gassman. It was an extraordinary opportunity that inspired me to pursue  a career in public service. In addition to his advocacy for women, Tony  was a trailblazer in the fight for LGBT equality. He was among the  first Governors to appoint a liaison to the LGBT community he  established the first Governor's Council on Lesbian and Gay issues,  which provided much needed oversight of anti-discrimination laws that  had been recently adopted in Wisconsin. Working for Governor Earl  taught me the importance of doing what is right, regardless of  political popularity. Tony personifies our strong Wisconsin values of  kindness, determination and hard work.   I am grateful to Tony Earl for all of his contributions to the State  of Wisconsin. I am pleased to join thousands of people across our State  in recognizing Tony's dedication to public service and achievements  over the past 50 years.                            ____________________
