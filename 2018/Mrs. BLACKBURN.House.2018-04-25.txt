 Mr. Speaker, what an honor it is to stand here today  and to celebrate the bipartisan work that has been done on this  legislation and to bring it to this point.   Indeed, this is something on which we can all agree: that the  creative community, these wonderful creators, have that constitutional  protection to what they create, the right to be compensated for their  creation. And I am so appreciative that that has already been mentioned  in this debate.   Chairman Goodlatte said I come from music-loving Tennessee, and  indeed I do. And we are so pleased that we are known as Music City and  that, whether it is classical music or country or gospel, that you are  going to hear music from every hill and every valley. And we treasure  that creative community and protecting that product that they do  create.   Now, one of the things that has happened through time: With the  change of delivery systems, it has become more difficult for these  artists and these creators and the support network around them, the  engineers, those who work on producing this product, to be  appropriately compensated. This bill, as Doug Collins mentioned, has  been in the works for years; and the CLASSICS Act, to take care of  those who are now no longer able to tour and to make certain that they  and their heirs are able to be compensated for that music that they  have created.   One thing to bear in mind: Songwriters and musicians are truly small- business people. They work for themselves. Their stock and trade is  their idea. And they have the right to commercialize that idea and to  be compensated. The Music Modernization Act and the different bills  that it brings together to update this system, to protect those  copyrights, and to make certain that the creators are compensated, has  been a collaborative effort.                                time  1430    Chairman Goodlatte and Congressman Collins have been to Nashville  several times to meet with stakeholders and to hear their stories  firsthand. We are grateful for that, we are grateful for the  bipartisanship, and we are very grateful for the passage of this  legislation.
