 Madam Chair, I thank the ranking member for  yielding.   I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1. My community of Buffalo and  Niagara Falls are all too familiar with the devastating consequences of  decisions that put polluters over people.   Toxic waste dumped by Hooker Chemical in the 1940s contaminated the  Love Canal neighborhood of Niagara Falls. President Jimmy Carter  declared a Federal health emergency, and Congress passed the Superfund  Act with Love Canal becoming the first cleanup site.   In 1968, the Buffalo River caught fire due to industrial  contamination and was considered biologically dead.   Atrocities like this led to the approval of the Clean Water Act in  1972 and have required hundreds of millions of dollars annually for the  Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.   After residents sounded the alarm for years, in 2013, Tonawanda Coke  was found guilty of deliberately releasing cancer-causing benzene into  surrounding neighborhoods, a violation of the Clean Air Act.   The Superfund Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Clean Air Act were  each put in place after historically unchecked pollution impacted the  health of our waterways, communities, and families.   H.R. 1 removes safety protections, lessens accountability for  violators, and diminishes public input.   If this bill were in place 10 years ago, western New York neighbors  would have had no recourse to address the carcinogens and toxic  substances released into the air by Tonawanda Coke.   We can't let polluting history repeat itself.   I am voting ``no'' on H.R. 1 and encourage my colleagues who care  about the health and future of our communities to do the same.
