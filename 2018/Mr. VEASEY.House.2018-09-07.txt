 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  Zebedee ``Zeb'' Strong.   Zeb was from Kilgore, Texas, and was raised on a cattle farm down in  the oilfields there. But when he came to Arlington and settled in that  city, he left a strong legacy.   He worked at his alma mater, which was the University of Texas at  Arlington, known as UTA, for 25 years. As director of multicultural  services and recruitment, he really embodied the spirit of the UTA  campus. He served as an adviser for over 40 student organizations and  mentored so many students.   Zeb was someone whom I first met when I was a congressional staffer  back in the 1990s, and he was someone who really helped me out a lot as  I was beginning my career in that field.   He was also dedicated and committed to volunteer work at Big Brothers  & Big Sisters, and he was also one of the individuals who was really  the driving force behind starting an African American studies program  at UTA.   He was also one of the founders of the Arlington African American  Chamber of Commerce and the Arlington chapter of the NAACP.   My prayers and condolences go out to his four children and his wife,  Sheri, who lost Zeb unexpectedly.   But I want the family and friends of Zeb Strong to know that he was  such a uniting force. If you walked around the campus of UTA at any  moment, anyone, from any background, would come up to Zeb and they  would feel like Zeb was their best friend because that was just the  type of gentleman that he was.   My prayers, again, go out to the family  [[Page H7939]]                                ____________________
