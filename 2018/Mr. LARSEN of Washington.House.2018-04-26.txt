 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 4, the FAA Reauthorization  Act of 2018.   I am pleased that Congress is here today to consider a long-term bill  to reauthorize the FAA. This moment has been a long time in coming.  Congress has not enacted a long-term FAA bill since 2012, and it is  currently running on its fifth extension since that time.   We are here to consider a comprehensive, bipartisan piece of  legislation that provides long-term, predictable funding for the FAA,  improves aviation safety, addresses workforce needs, and advances vital  research in the aviation field.   Whether large or small, airports across the United States play an  important role in communities by connecting people, goods, services,  and creating jobs. In Washington State, my constituents rely on  airports of all sizes. In my hometown of Arlington, general aviation at  Arlington Municipal Airport is vital, and the annual EAA fly-in brings  in people from all across the country.   Bellingham International Airport in northwest Washington is a  developing airport, which requires further investments in terminal and  operations infrastructure to help keep pace with passenger demands.   Paine Field Airport in Snohomish County is a growing hub in the  Pacific Northwest, with the construction of a new terminal and expanded  air service expected later this year.   Each of these airports plays a different, yet important, role in  serving the local community and the national aviation network.  [[Page H3594]]    The bill reflects Congress' consensus to reform FAA's aircraft  certification processes, improve aviation safety, provide additional  protections for U.S. passengers, and help to better prepare the  aviation workforce and further the safe integration of unmanned  aircraft systems into the national airspace.   One of the most important things this bill does is to make FAA's  certification process more streamlined, consistent, and efficient,  while maintaining the highest level of safety.   The U.S. aviation industry is an economic powerhouse. It is  particularly important to my home State of Washington. In our State,  general aviation, alone, contributes an estimated $3.6 billion to the  economy and more than 30,000 jobs a year.   Without question, predictable and timely certification of aircraft  and aircraft components is critical for domestic manufacturers to get  their products to market. These reforms are desperately needed to allow  U.S. aviation manufacturers like my constituents in Everett, who are,  as well, smaller contractors, to compete globally.   This bill ensures that FAA's product certification remains the gold  standard abroad, as well, so that U.S. manufacturers remain  competitive.   As passenger growth continues, Congress must ensure airports have the  right tools in place to safely accommodate this new demand.   The bill makes a host of improvements to make our skies safer,  including:   Ensuring the FAA safety workforce is utilized efficiently and  receives enhanced training;   Strengthening the FAA's current voluntary safety reporting program  for pilots so that critical safety enhancements are not needlessly  delayed;   Making progress toward NextGen implementation through engagement with  local communities and airports in the process;   Improving the Federal Contract Tower Program to allow airports to  make investments in their critical infrastructure; and   Ensuring flight attendants have sufficient rest between duty periods.   It also includes numerous provisions that enhance the air travel  experience for more than 900 million passengers who fly each year,  including:   A prohibition on airlines involuntarily bumping passengers after they  have boarded;   A prohibition on the use of cell phones for voice communications  during flight; and   A requirement for airlines to create a one-page document outlining  the rights of passengers, which will bring much-needed transparency to  this industry.   One of my top priorities is to ensure working families in the Pacific  Northwest get a better deal, which means expanding opportunities,  creating more jobs, and making sure that the next generation of workers  have the tools necessary to succeed.   This bipartisan bill that my colleagues and I have agreed to will  protect and create American jobs through airport construction and  aerospace manufacturing, ultimately boosting the Nation's economy. As  an example, the Port of Skagit is focused on expanding the Skagit  Regional Airport and is working to build a new hangar and longer  taxiing runways. These improvements are not only for safety, but will  create well-paying jobs in construction.   Further, the Career Connect Washington initiative aims to connect  more than 100,000 students, over the next 5 years, with career-focused  learning opportunities, building a bridge from school into high-demand  and good-paying jobs. Across my district, nearly 900 young adults  participating in this initiative have connected to apprenticeships, job  shadows, or other structured work-based activity.   This bill builds on these efforts to better prepare students for the  aviation workforce by:   Encouraging schools, industry, and other stakeholders to address the  skills gap in the aviation maintenance field; and   Requiring a GAO study of best practices to incentivize, recruit, and  retain new aviation workers.   I am pleased that the bill includes my proposal to create a Youth  Access to American Jobs in Aviation Task Force. This task force will  work with aviation trade schools and community colleges, airline  carriers and industry, labor unions, and other relevant stakeholders to  develop recommendations to encourage high school students to enroll in  aviation manufacturing, maintenance, and engineering apprenticeships.   This legislation includes a title on unmanned aircraft systems, or  drones, which are flourishing in the skies at a pace we did not imagine  just a few years ago. Provisions in the current bill will help the  commercial drone industry safely thrive, while also addressing the many  issues these new users present as they become integrated into U.S.  airspace.   Finally, this bill enacts a multiyear reauthorization, Mr. Chairman,  of aviation taxes and FAA expenditure authority. This will provide the  stable, predictable funding needed to carry out its safety mission and  ensure the FAA remains the world leader in aviation research and  development.   While these are all positive areas to address, I understand that some  amendments on slot exemptions and slot swaps have been made in order  that would have regional consequences. I oppose these efforts and  believe it would be better to have a more substantive discussion to  address these issues in the committee.   Mr. Chairman, we have the biggest, most complex, and busiest aviation  system in the world. We are years past due in enacting a long-term FAA  reauthorization that will allow the U.S. to remain the gold standard in  aviation. I am pleased to cosponsor this bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Shuster and  Ranking Member DeFazio, as well as Chairman LoBiondo, for their work on  this bill.   I know Mr. LoBiondo is leaving Congress this year, and we may get a  better Democrat or a better Republican in that seat, but we will not  get a better Representative for this Congress in that seat than Frank  LoBiondo.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms.  Titus).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington, D.C. (Ms. Norton).    I yield the gentlewoman from the District  of Columbia an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to  the amendment offered by the gentleman from Nebraska.    Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment  offered by the gentleman from Nebraska.   This amendment would require the Comptroller General to conduct a  study on the current and future supply of individuals for the U.S.  aviation workforce. The study would review the current state of our  aviation workforce as well as barriers to entry.   A strong and robust aviation workforce will ensure the U.S. remains  the global leader and innovator in civil aviation; therefore, I support  this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to oppose the  amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota.   Mr. Chairman, I understand the concerns that he has with his local  MPO. We all face our own challenges with local MPOs, but they are an  important decisionmaking body that ensures local governments can take  full advantage of Federal transportation programs in a coordinated  manner.   This amendment is attempting to break apart the operating structure  of a local MPO, seemingly to punish it. It does not achieve the outcome  the gentleman is hoping to achieve except to create government  dysfunction.   I would also note that some frequently argue that local decisions  should be made by local decisionmakers. They say, ``Keep the Federal  Government out of our business,'' except this amendment declares, if  the decisions are not made to the liking of one Federal official, he  can step in and blow up that local decisionmaking body.                                time  1545    Mr. Chairman, I am urging my colleagues, therefore, to oppose this  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, we have no other speakers, and I  urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois. There is no doubt  that time and time again, the airlines have a lot of work to do in the  realm of customer service. With little competition in the U.S. airline  industry, airlines are no longer required to compete on the quality of  services they provide to consumers, yet, the industry has become the  world's most profitable due in large part to countless ancillary fees  they charge passengers.   I believe certainly that more must be done to restore basic rights  and fairness in air travel. However, the amendment, as drafted, does  take a one-size-fits-all approach to customer service that may not be  appropriate for every situation.   Before legislating prescriptive requirements for the airlines when  passengers are displaced, I think the committee should hold additional  hearings and study these issues more thoroughly. I hope we can agree on  that.   A recent lesson learned was with the Department of Transportation  tarmac delay rule, a rule with great intentions that had several  unintended consequences, such as passengers becoming stranded overnight  at diversion airports hundreds of miles from their destination.  Congress had to mitigate some of these issues in the 2016 FAA  extension.   When we are proscriptive on the customer service front, we have to be  sure we are getting it right. But I do want to thank Mr. Lipinski for  offering this amendment. I hope he will continue to work with the  committee to perfect it, but I stand in opposition to it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition, but I do support the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the  amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico.   This amendment requires the U.S. Government Accountability Office, or  the GAO, study air cargo traffic in the Caribbean, including an  assessment and data collection. This data and assessment are needed to  help assess Puerto Rico's role as a cargo hub for international  traffic. I look forward to seeing what the GAO reports.   Therefore, I support this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to  support it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1615    Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Chairman, this bill will  provide data that is important for the due recognition in terms of the  capabilities of the island for the near future, and I hope this bill  will pass and give Puerto Rico the opportunities we need to fulfill the  opportunities in the region and the States.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition, even though I support the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment being  offered by the gentlewoman from Virginia.   This amendment would create within the FAA Commercial Space  Transportation Office an office of spaceports, a centralized policy  office that will support and promote infrastructure improvements at  FAA-licensed spaceports.   This amendment also requires a report to Congress evaluating the  Federal Government's national security and civil space launch demands,  and offers recommendations on how we can further support and promote  greater investment in commercial space infrastructure. It also requires  the Comptroller General to study spaceport activities in the U.S.   Commercial space transportation and enabled industries includes  satellite and ground equipment manufacturing, satellite services and  remote sensing, and distribution industries. In 2015, the size of the  global space industry was estimated to be $335 billion; the size of the  U.S. space industry was approximately $126 billion, which includes $89  billion in revenues generated by satellite services, manufacturing,  ground equipment, and launch services.   The commercial launch of satellites is particularly important as  these technologies offer us a range of services from television and  radio broadcasts to high-speed internet and weather forecasting.   This amendment will strengthen the Nation's competitiveness in this  nascent industry and offer us a better understanding of how we can  maintain a robust and resilient network of space transportation  infrastructure.   Mr. Chairman, with that, I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the  amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts.   It would direct the FAA to engage and cooperate with airlines to  identify and facilitate opportunities for them to retrofit their  aircraft with devices that mitigate noise. Air traffic noise is an  extremely important issue to those who live in communities surrounding  our airports. This noise can be destructive to the well-being of the  residents of these communities. This amendment would go a long way  toward mitigating future noise issues around our airports.   I support this amendment and ask my colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the  amendment offered by the gentleman from New York.   This amendment directs the FAA Administrator to offer a public  comment period and public hearing with respect to the New York North  Shore Helicopter Route and would then be required to review the  applicable regulations related to the route and assess the noise  impacts on communities and the availability of alternative or  supplemental routes to reduce those impacts.   I oppose it on the grounds that it is really not good policy to  legislate on noise in a piecemeal fashion, addressing each region and  each airport one by one. That is not the best way to address air  traffic noise. The community has been aware of this issue for some time  and certainly of the occasionally unreasonable exposure to helicopter  noise reported by residents in urban areas.   The Aviation Subcommittee held a roundtable on this in October of  2011 to explore this issue, and perhaps it is time to re-up that  roundtable to get some movement on this issue.   Further, I have concern about possible unintended consequences of  legislative proposals that could lead to the redistribution of aircraft  noise. Although well-intentioned, such proposals have social justice  ramifications and often can end up distributing noise over socially  economically disadvantaged communities. We have to make sure that noise  is distributed equitably if we are going to make these decisions.   I would be happy to work, and I think on our side we would be happy  to work with the gentleman and the cosponsors to try to address these  concerns by talking directly with the FAA, but I have to oppose taking  the solution towards a legislative resolution.   I ask my colleagues to oppose it, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
