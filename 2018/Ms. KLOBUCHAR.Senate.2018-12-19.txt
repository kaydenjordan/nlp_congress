 Mr. President, I rise to speak about some of our  colleagues who are leaving the Senate. Before I do that, I want to  address what happened late on the Friday night--I think 9 days before  Christmas--when a Texas judge basically threw out the Affordable Care  Act.   This latest decision comes more than 6 years after the Supreme Court,  in an opinion written by Justice Roberts, already upheld the law's  constitutionality. That opinion also found that parts of the law can be  severed from the rest of the legislation. It comes after the  administration has stated emphatically that it would not defend the  law.   So, basically, instead of going in there and helping out to save  healthcare for millions of Americans and protect them from being thrown  off their insurance if they have preexisting conditions--instead of  going into that burning building--the administration has said to  basically stand down and throw lighter fluid on the fire. That is  exactly what has happened. If this ruling takes effect, the  consequences will be devastating.   To start, protections for people with preexisting conditions would be  gone. About half of all Americans have preexisting conditions. This  isn't just about rare diseases. This is also about asthma and diabetes.  The ability to keep your kids on your insurance plans until they are 26  years old will be gone. The work we have done to close the Medicare  doughnut hole coverage gap, which makes it easier for our seniors to  afford pharmaceuticals and to lower prescription drug prices, will be  gone. The provisions that help people to buy insurance on the  healthcare exchanges will be gone. Minnesotans will see a loss of $364  million in premium tax credits, and, roughly, 272,000 people in my  State will lose coverage.   We can't allow this to happen. The judge must issue a stay  immediately until the appeals are completed so that these protections  can stay in place and this decision can be overturned.   It is time to stop trying to start from scratch. The American people  spoke in this last election across the country. Do they want  improvements to the Affordable Care Act, like making pharmaceuticals  less expensive and doing something about premiums? Yes, they do, but  they don't want to start from scratch.   We have already seen what kind of healthcare proposals we get when we  start from scratch--the ones that my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle have put forward. The legislation that we saw earlier this  Congress would have hurt people by kicking millions off of Medicaid, by  letting insurance companies charge people more when they get sick, and  by jacking up healthcare costs. Every major group that you trust when  it comes to your health--the largest groups of doctors, nurses,  seniors, hospitals, people with cancer, Alzheimer's, heart disease, and  diabetes--has said it was the worst repeal bill yet. We cannot spend  the next 2 years going backward and fighting  [[Page S7889]]  old fights. We need to focus on building on the work we have done and  strengthening and improving the Affordable Care Act.   I have always said that the Affordable Care Act was the beginning and  not an end, and we all have heard from those on the frontlines;  doctors, patients, seniors, and those working to combat the opioid  epidemic say that repeal is not the way forward. We should now be  governing from opportunity and not from chaos.   It means passing reinsurance programs, like the bipartisan  legislation, which I am proud to cosponsor, that Senator Alexander and  Senator Murray put forth, and using ideas that have worked in Minnesota  and taking them out on a national basis.   It means doing something about skyrocketing pharmaceutical prices and  passing my bill that has over 30 cosponsors to allow Medicare to  negotiate for less expensive drugs under their Medicare part D-- literally lifting the ban that says that the 41 million seniors of this  country shouldn't be allowed to get a better deal.   It means passing my bill with Senator Grassley, which we just  improved upon today, to limit anti-competitive pay-for-delay deals,  which delay more affordable generic drugs from getting out on the  market.   It means allowing less expensive, safe drugs to come in from other  countries so that we can have true competition. We could even put it to  a trigger so that if there were not competition, then you could allow  the safe drugs to be purchased from other countries, and I think that  it would create a major incentive for drug prices to go down.   What we need to do is work together on the many bipartisan proposals  that have been put forward to actually improve the Affordable Care Act,  not throw it out and not throw people who have preexisting conditions  off their insurance.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have already given speeches in this  Chamber about my four friends, departing Democratic colleagues,  Senators Heitkamp, McCaskill, Nelson, and Donnelly. Now I rise to  recognize my Republican colleagues who are leaving the Senate.   Let me start with Orrin Hatch, who is truly one of a kind.   Out of 100 Senators, none of us can say that our great-grandfather  founded the town of Vernal, UT, home of the Dinosaur Roundup Rodeo.  None of us can say that we served as a Mormon bishop or that we started  off working as a janitor to pay for school and then went on to become  the most senior Republican in the U.S. Senate.   None of us can say that we moonlight as a singer, songwriter, and  famed lyricist, whose catalogue includes the classics: ``Heal Our  Land,'' ``Eight Days of Hanukkah,'' and his ode to Manhattan, ``Skatin'  with My Baby.'' Orrin Hatch's songs have been featured in the movies  ``Oceans 12'' and ``Stuart Little 2.''   While Senator Hatch takes pride in all of his accomplishments, I know  that he is proudest of his family: his wife, Elaine; their six  children; 23 grandchildren; and 24 great-grandchildren.   Senator Hatch and I have worked together for a long period of time.  He was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, and I also got my  start in elected life that year as the secretary-treasurer of my 10th  grade high school class. Washingtonian Magazine once named us the two  Senators least likely to get into a scandal, which I assume includes  with each other.   We are both members of the Senate prayer group. One time I will never  forget was when he was speaking at the National Prayer Breakfast and  his phone started ringing and he had to improvise in front of the  entire National Prayer Breakfast. He said that God was calling him with  prayer advice as he answered the cell phone.   Most of all, we have teamed up on many issues that matter to the  American people. We are cochairs of the Rare Disease Caucus.   We have helped to make our schools safer just this spring by adding  $1 million to improve school security. We led a bipartisan bill that  was passed unanimously in this Chamber, and it was signed into law.   We worked together to restore the integrity to our patent system.   He also has been a supporter of comprehensive immigration reform,  something we need more of in this Chamber.   I will always be grateful for the opportunity I have had to work with  Senator Hatch, someone who has dedicated his life to serving his State  and country for more than 40 years.   I also want to honor the service of my colleague from Arizona,  Senator Jeff Flake, whom I have truly enjoyed working with during our  time together in the Senate.   Jeff has never invited me to travel with him to a deserted island, as  he did with Senator Heinrich, but we did once stay with Jeff and his  wife, Cheryl, at John and Cindy McCain's ranch, and let's just say it  had a few more amenities than he had on the island with Senator  Heinrich.   During that memorable visit to Sedona, I saw firsthand how dedicated  Jeff is to his family. I remember how early he got up one morning to  travel to his son Tanner's track meet. That afternoon he actually sent  me a photo of Tanner taken after he had won the event.   I also have seen how much he loves his home State. At heart, he is a  fifth-generation Arizonan, one of 11 kids who grew up on a cattle ranch  in the town of Snowflake. That land had first been owned by his great- great-grandfather, who had come to Arizona in 1878, and then it was  passed down generation to generation.   I learned a lot about the Flake family history through Jeff's book,  which I once read in its entirety on Christmas Day. What I most  remember from that book was that growing up, Jeff's family had a card  on the refrigerator, and this is what it said: ``Assume the best. Look  for the good.''   It is that unshakeable sense of optimism and faith in the decency of  other people that Senator Flake has brought to the U.S. Senate. He has  been willing to work across the aisle to do what he thinks is right,  even when it has sometimes meant breaking with his own party.   Jeff knows what is at stake, for instance, with immigration reform.  He wrote in his book: ``From a very young age in ranch country, you get  to know immigrants intimately and honestly'' and you know ``how  indispensable they are to making things work in America.''   It is clear that those lessons have stayed with him. I have seen it  as Jeff has worked to build bipartisan consensus on immigration issues,  reaching across the aisle to find a solution to try to protect our  Dreamers.   I have seen it when we joined together to introduce a resolution, the  two of us, recognizing the contributions of Muslim Americans. That  resolution passed the Senate because Jeff Flake was willing to  cosponsor it with me.   I have seen these values as Senator Flake has worked with a  bipartisan group of us to normalize relations with Cuba. This  commitment dates back decades to his earlier experience in building  democracy in Namibia. So when President Obama took up the cause of  Cuba, Jeff did not hesitate to lend his support, and together Senator  Flake and I led the bill to lift the embargo on Cuba, along with  Senators Enzi, Leahy, and many others.   Jeff's voice has been particularly needed lately in the face of grave  threats to our democracy and the rule of law. He has been a strong  advocate for this bipartisan legislation that the Senate Judiciary  Committee passed to simply protect the work of the special counsel, and  he has taken a stand to try to ensure that the bill gets a vote on the  Senate floor.   As a daughter of a journalist, I also deeply appreciate Senator  Flake's leadership on behalf of a free press, which is essential to our  democracy.   At a time when journalists are under attack, when reporters are  risking and losing their lives and the President is calling them ``the  enemy of the people,'' it has never been more important for us to speak  out for the First Amendment. So when Jeff Flake took to the Senate  floor in support of freedom of the press earlier this year, I was proud  to speak after him.   While Jeff will be so missed in the Senate, I have no doubt that he  will  [[Page S7890]]  continue to use his strong voice on behalf of the issues he cares  about, on behalf of his State and our country, which he has served so  well.   Also, Senator Corker. Senator Corker and I were elected to the Senate  at the same time in 2006. He was the only Republican Senator in our  incoming class. I see Senator Cardin here in the Chamber; he was also a  Member of that class. We all have remained friends with Senator Corker  over the years. I will tell you that Senator Corker never misses  Senator McCaskill's annual chili party. He has been very good to us,  and we have worked together for years.   Before becoming a Senator, Bob Corker had two previous experiences as  an elected official. He was the mayor of Chattanooga and the president  of a high school class. He claims that he did not even have to campaign  for that job. Here is what he said: ``I just woke up one day and was  president.'' That is not how it usually works in politics.   It turns out that Bob's roots were actually, of course, in business.  He saved up $8,000 to start his own construction company at age 25 and  then expanded it to 17 other States, and he has brought this  commonsense business background to tackle difficult problems head-on,  while always calling it as he sees it.   We have seen that in his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations  Committee, where Bob has spoken up to defend the values that define  America, including strongly stating that he felt this Chamber and the  administration had to do more in response to the murder of journalist  Jamal Khashoggi.   We have seen it as Senator Corker has worked to strengthen our  alliances. I can tell you, when I was having trouble getting the  nominees to be Ambassadors to Sweden and Norway through the Congress  last Congress, which is very important in my State with its  Scandinavian roots, I knew that I could count on his support.   We have seen it in his efforts to combat human trafficking, an issue  I also care deeply about.   Bob has so much to be proud of at the end of his chapter of public  service and begins another back home in Tennessee.   Finally, I want to recognize my friend and colleague, Senator Dean  Heller of Nevada.   Dean has dedicated so much of his life to public service on behalf of  his State--in Nevada's legislature, as secretary of state, in Congress,  and in the U.S. Senate.   His family moved to Nevada when he was only 9 months old. As the son  of an auto mechanic and a school cook, he has often said that he is  likely one of the only Senators who can change your oil and fix your  transmission.   Nevada is obviously a State with no shortage of tourism, and Dean has  worked with me as cochairs of the tourism caucus to promote tourism  across our entire country. He understands that when we increase  tourism, we not only create jobs and strengthen our economy, we also  strengthen our alliances and export our values.   It is that same philosophy that is behind his efforts, along with  Senator Flake who is here in this Chamber, to normalize relations with  Cuba. Dean and I traveled to Cuba, along with Senator Flake, with  President Obama, and I deeply appreciated his commitment, as well as  Senator Flake's and others, to improving the relationship between our  countries and opening up new opportunities for American businesses.   I have valued our time together on the Commerce Committee, where we  led bills that passed and were signed into law regarding more women  getting into science, technology, engineering, and math at NASA. We are  proud that both bills were signed into law.   I have enjoyed serving with Dean Heller in the U.S. Senate, and I  thank him for his service.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.
