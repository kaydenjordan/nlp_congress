 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to this cruel  partisan effort that does nothing to stop family separation, address  the crisis of children already separated from their parents, nor does  it fairly address the plight of Dreamers.   Instead of uniting families, it eliminates the ability of U.S.  citizens to sponsor parents, adult children, and siblings, and it  abandons 3 million family members waiting to legally enter our country.   This bill limits access to asylum and eliminates provisions that  protect children and their right to seek refuge in our country. It  excludes thousands of Dreamers, has no guarantee of citizenship, and  does nothing to remove the uncertainty and fear Dreamers have of  deportation away from family and the only country they know as home.   This bill is a sham. It authorizes prolonged detentions, funds  Trump's border wall, militarizes our borders, weakens child protection  laws, and erodes our American tradition of united families. I urge my  colleagues to vote against this irresponsible bill.
