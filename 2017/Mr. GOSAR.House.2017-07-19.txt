 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2910,  legislation sponsored by my friend and Western Caucus member, Bill  Flores.   One area of wide bipartisan agreement is the need to support critical  infrastructure in the United States. This bill presents an important  opportunity to deliver on our commitment to modernize infrastructure,  grow the economy, and support safe, reliable American-made energy.   By improving agency and industry coordination, we can provide more  certainty regarding the timeframe and procedures of the pipeline review  process. By making these improvements, we will ensure that the energy  we produce right here in America can be transported in the safest  possible manner.   If my colleagues are truly serious about protecting the environment,  we should be promoting American-made energy, where we know it will be  produced in adherence to the highest environmental and safety  standards.   This bill does exactly that by making the improvements necessary to  modernize our pipeline approval process. These improvements are  necessary to match the advancements in shale gas technology and  increased demand for safe, reliable, and domestically-sourced energy.   While roads and bridges often get the most attention when we talk  about the need for updated infrastructure, modern pipelines and other  energy infrastructure are sorely needed to support our economy and  power our homes and businesses.   Promoting efficient and comprehensive cooperation within our  regulatory process is an effort that is not only bipartisan, but plain  common sense.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Texas for sponsoring this  much-needed legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support of  this commonsense bill.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2883,  the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act, introduced by my  friend and Western Caucus member Markwayne
