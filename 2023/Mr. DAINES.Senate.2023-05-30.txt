 Mr. President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Lori Hoppe of Park County for her dedication to fostering  excellence in agricultural education and across Park County.   In 2013, Lori saw an opportunity to bring agricultural education to  her hometown of Gardiner; a quaint gateway community to Yellowstone  National Park with a population of 800 people. She established Gardiner  High School's first agriculture program and FFA chapter, which today  proudly boasts a near 50-percent student body participation rate. The  Gardiner FFA Chapter has consistently built a name for themselves as  being fierce competitors; they are the first agricultural sales career  development event team to not only champion the district contest, but  also to qualify for the national convention.   As Gardiner FFA prepared for the national competition, their means of  getting there was threatened when historic flooding impacted Park  County. With a state of emergency declared and access to Yellowstone  National Park halted, the lack of tourists required the cancellation of  the local rodeo, with sales from the concession stand being the primary  means of funding for Gardiner FFA's trip to the National FFA Convention  and Expo.   Lori knew they needed to come up with a new fundraising idea if they  wanted to compete at nationals. During the school year, the students  built a utility trailer that they decided to try and sell at the Park  County Fair. The community rallied behind the students and helped them  raise more than five times their goal. The Gardiner FFA Chapter went on  to make their community proud, earning a seventh place team finish, and  one student placing third individually.   Now reaching her 10th year as an educator, Lori is receiving  statewide recognition from the Montana Association of Agricultural  Educators--MAAE--for being among the best ag instructors in the  Treasure State. Her application will be forwarded on to the regional  level where she will be evaluated alongside winners from other States.  I am confident Lori will represent Montana well.   It is my distinct honor to recognize Lori Hoppe for her commitment to  promoting agricultural education in Park County and throughout the  Treasure State. The future of Montana agriculture is better off because  of her tireless work.   Thank you, Lori. You make Montana proud.                            ____________________
