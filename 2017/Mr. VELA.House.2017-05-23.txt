 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1370, the Department of  Homeland Security Blue Campaign Authorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, human trafficking is a $32 billion-per-year global  industry, making it one of the most profitable forms of transnational  crime with more than 20 million victims worldwide. Each year an  estimated 17,500 innocent people are trafficked into the United States;  almost half of those individuals are children.   Trafficking victims can be of any age, race, gender, or nationality,  and are largely found in workplaces within the manufacturing,  agriculture, hospitality, and domestic service industries. Since 2010,  the mission of the Department of Homeland Security's Blue Campaign has  been to bring DHS components together with Federal, State,  [[Page H4482]]  and local law enforcement agencies, private industry, and other  nongovernmental entities to combat human trafficking.   The Blue Campaign has provided the Department with the necessary  structure to uniformly train personnel in its components to identify  and investigate these criminal activities. The Blue Campaign has proven  an effective mechanism through which DHS and its law enforcement  partners collaborate to dismantle human trafficking networks across the  country and bring perpetrators to justice.   The public awareness and outreach efforts launched through the Blue  Campaign provide the general public, nongovernmental organizations, and  private sector entities with tools to be active partners in the Federal  Government's efforts to assist victims of human trafficking and prevent  others from being exploited.   Earlier this year, DHS recognized its partners in the transportation  and hospitality industries for training their employees and customers  about how they can help combat human trafficking by identifying the  signs and reporting suspected incidents.   Over the years, the program has proven to be an important,  multifaceted tool that leverages both government and private sector  resources with the goal of ending the exploitation of vulnerable  people. H.R. 1370 codifies the important program and emphasizes the  importance of clear guidance and training for all Blue Campaign  partners.   This bill also underscores the importance of timely and routine  information sharing amongst DHS components to ensure unity of effort in  preventing and disrupting human trafficking. As a cosponsor of H.R.  1370, I believe that it is our responsibility as Members of Congress to  do whatever it takes to stop the illegal and immoral smuggling of  innocent people into the United States by transnational criminal  organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my House colleagues to support H.R. 1370, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1370 was unanimously approved by the Committee on  Homeland Security earlier this year. The partnerships that DHS has  established through the Blue Campaign are critical to stopping criminal  activity that comes with a tragically high human cost.   By leading the charge and identifying and closing all possible  avenues through which human traffickers smuggle people into the United  States, DHS plays a critical role in ensuring the safety of children  and other innocent people. Joint, concerted efforts that bring together  law enforcement, nongovernmental entities, and private industry, and  raise public awareness of this criminal activity, are important to  ending the practice altogether.   We must continue to support this unity of effort in order to aid and  protect victims of human trafficking, and bring those who exploit them  to justice.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul for his leadership in this  effort, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1370, and I yield back  the balance of my time.                                time  1645
