 Madam President, I am proud to recognize Trevor  O'Brien of Lodonderry as January's Granite Stater of the Month. When  Cobblestone Ale House, a popular local bar in Keene, was destroyed by a  5-alarm fire, Trevor jumped into action to support the people in his  community who were impacted by this devastating event.  [[Page S439]]    Trevor had previously worked at the ale house as a bartender for 10  years, and during that time, he was part of a vibrant community that  felt to him like family. During his shifts, the bar would fill up with  locals and tourists alike, who were there to meet up with old friends  or make new connections. Trevor met his now-wife while working there,  and he is officiating a wedding soon for another couple who met at the  bar.   When Trevor heard the news of Cobblestone Ale House burning down, he  immediately knew that he had to support his community during this  difficult time. He made an impromptu Go-Fund-Me page that he shared  over social media and asked his friends to donate the equivalent of one  final drink at the bar. Within an hour donations were pouring in. The  campaign continued to spread from person-to-person and has since taken  off, raising nearly $20,000.   The money from the Go-Fund-Me will be going to bar staffers to help  with lost wages and to the tenants who lived above the ale house who  lost belongings in the fire.   Trevor's actions are a testament to him, but also reflect the  determination to be generous, kind, and strong neighbors that is a  hallmark of Granite State character. Trevor's decision to help others  sparked a movement that will make a real difference for people in his  community, and I am honored to name him as January's Granite Stater of  the Month.                            ____________________
