 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Newhouse for leading the  effort on this.   And I rise to oppose the Green New Deal for many of the reasons that  have already been said, but this is the most amateurish resolution that  has come before this Congress in a long time, not from only my point of  view but many others who have served longer than I have.   We were asked to consider a policy that would change every aspect of  American life, deciding what we eat, how we travel, how we stay warm,  and even what jobs we can take and what homes we are allowed to live  in.   We are presented with a total overhaul of society, but with no  explanation how. There is no roadmap, no method of implementation, and,  of course, no price tag. All we know is that this will be dictated by a  cabal of better-knowing bureaucrats. Yet every estimate shows just how  unrealistic this green deal really is.   According to the American Action Forum, the total cost could run as  high as $93 trillion over 10 years.                                time  2045    This totals 21 times our current Federal budget of $4.4 trillion.  That can only mean one thing for the American people: taxes, taxes, and  more taxes.   This resolution is so lacking in detail, we might as well vote on the  merits of a scrap of paper that says, ``solve the problem.'' This is no  way to govern.  [[Page H2096]]    The only details we do have are from a survey that enjoyed a brief  existence online before it was removed out of embarrassment and has  since been denied.   One source of embarrassment was the call to get rid of cows. To my  knowledge, this is the first time that a Member of this House has  called for bovine genocide.   That the deal's supporters are now hiding these facts reveals that  the true agenda behind the Green New Deal is too horrifying to be  shared with any of the public. As a rule of thumb, any law that cannot  be shared with the people cannot serve the people.
