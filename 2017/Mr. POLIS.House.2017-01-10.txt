 Mr. Speaker, you might recall, during the campaign,  President-elect Donald Trump promised to build a wall with Mexico and,  of course, make the Mexican Government pay for it.   Well, now we are hearing that Republicans intend to come to this  body, Congress, to spend your hard-earned money and mine, American  taxpayer money, to build a wall with Mexico. They are estimating $10  billion to $12 billion.   Well, do you know what? In comprehensive immigration reform, which I  was proud to support last session, we had over $40 billion for border  security. So apparently Donald Trump is building one-quarter of the  wall, all directly with deficit spending.   In comprehensive immigration reform, we not only paid for that border  security, not only paid for that $40 billion and required people who  were here illegally to pay fines and register and get right with the  law, it actually would reduce the budget deficit by over $200 billion  over 10 years.   So what we have is one-quarter of the wall and deficit spending with  Donald Trump. With Democrats, four times the wall and reduce the  deficit by $200 billion.   Mr. Speaker, the choice is obvious.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  thank the gentleman from Georgia for the customary 30 minutes.   We will get to the content of the bills in a moment, but there is a  procedural issue here that disenfranchises millions of American  citizens in this process.   We are in the 115th Congress since the founding of this country. We  were just sworn in last week to begin that. There are 56 new Members  who just started serving last week that have never served in this body  before, and there were 56 people that served in the last session who  are no longer with us. What we are doing here is we are taking bills  that those former Representatives worked on and new Representatives  have not worked on and advancing them to the floor without going  through committee, without going through the regular order.   So, for example, you have two bills, H.R. 5 and H.R. 79. We will talk  about them in a moment. These are Committee on Financial Services  bills. They should have gone to that committee, and members of that  committee, Democratic and Republican, would have had the chance to  amend those bills in that committee and mark it up before it comes to  the floor. That is the normal process. Both parties are now  constituting those committees; we are putting people on them.   I heard you, Mr. Speaker, read just before we began this debate how a  number of Members were officially appointed to those committees. That  is what we do in our first week or two.   Fifty-six new Members should have a say on these bills. They will get  a vote on the floor on these bills, but they were completely excluded  from the committee process that wrote these bills. That is wrong, Mr.  Speaker, to not allow 56 new Members of this body to be the lawmakers  that the people of their districts elected them to do. In fact, it  disenfranchises the tens of millions of people collectively that those  56 Members represent. And I hope that, for future legislation, we can  move through regular order and allow the new Members, as well as those  who are returning, to be part of the lawmaking process.   With regards to these bills, we have largely seen these bills in  prior sessions that people who are no longer in this body worked on.   The HALOS Act, I was proud to support last session and I am proud to  support again. It addresses a potentially real problem. There is  guidance from the SEC that--in our Rules Committee meeting yesterday I  questioned the subcommittee chair--largely also addresses those  concerns, but it is better to do it in statute and it is better to do  it in the broader language that is included in the bill, which is why  many Democrats--I hope a majority--support the HALOS Act.   The United States is the leader in innovation in the global economy,  and this is a small piece of that. What we are talking about here are  demo days where entrepreneurs can pitch their idea. I, personally, have  been able to attend a number of those, and it is a question of who can  be in the room when that occurs.   Should it only be millionaires who are allowed in that room? Or can  it be the next great generation of entrepreneurs? Can it be students?  Can it be aspiring entrepreneurs? Can it be community members who want  to learn what it means to pitch and how to do it and how ideas are  spread, or maybe they are looking for a job?   It doesn't change who can invest in those startup companies. They  still have to be qualified investors. By the way, I hope we have the  opportunity to work with Republicans on the definition of ``qualified  investor'' because I think it is unfair to restrict investment  opportunities to multimillionaires. We need to allow educated and  qualified investors of all levels.   Just because somebody is rich doesn't mean that they are a good  investor, and just because somebody has not yet earned a lot of money  doesn't mean that they can't be trusted to invest $10,000 or $50,000 of  their own money.   We made progress in the original JOBS Act with the result of  crowdfunded investing, but that is only a small piece--almost an  insignificant piece. Private placements are the much larger piece of  capital formation for venture-stage startups in our country. If there  is a way we can have an alternative to the net worth test that allows  individuals to, perhaps, take a qualitative test of their knowledge  and, therefore, qualify as an investor, they ought to be able to do  that, too.   This bill does not do any of that. That is a controversial area. It  is one that it will take Democrats and Republicans working together on  to help fund tomorrow's great companies and allow opportunity for all  people, not just millionaires and billionaires.   What this bill does is it continues to restrict the actual investors  to the millionaires. Okay? But it allows other people in the room at  least. That is a start. It allows an MBA student who him- or herself  wants to, perhaps, come up with their own company to hear 10 or 20  companies pitch so they can assemble their own deck; somebody who might  have a great amount of value to give as a mentor who themselves is a  veteran of a number of companies. Maybe they are not quite worth a  couple of million dollars. Maybe they are worth only--only, right?-- $500,000. Maybe they were a reasonably successful person worth  $500,000, but they have a lot of knowledge to give.   Without the HALOS Act, it would be unclear whether that person would  even be allowed in that room. So we want to make sure that mentors, up  and coming, young entrepreneurs, and, frankly, up-and-coming  entrepreneurs of all ages have access to the knowledge and the learning  that can occur in these pitch events.    Congress has a role in making sure we have laws in place that really  help build an environment that promotes innovation. When we passed the  JOBS Act in 2012 that allowed for crowdfunding, Congress took a step  forward. We have room to go there, room to go with private placements.   The HALOS Act is a small step, but it is a good one and a  noncontroversial one. It creates a clear path for startups to  participate in demo days, sponsored by government entities, nonprofits,  angel investment groups, et cetera, and  [[Page H252]]  a clear safe harbor from the SEC with regard to the definition of  general solicitation to make it clear that business experts and others  can be in the room, while maintaining that only existing accredited  investors can actually participate in offerings under Regulation D for  the purchases or sale of securities that are mentioned in those  demonstrations.   Currently, sponsors of demo days are relying on the 12-year-old, no- action letter by the SEC to make sure that they don't face the  consequences of failing to comply. The guidelines outlined by the SEC's  no-action letter are actually incorporated into the HALOS Act. So, in  many ways, this clarifies and puts in statute something that has been  at the whim of the SEC for too long.   The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) and others will join me in  talking about the importance of angel investors for early stage capital  to create jobs, to allow tomorrow's great entrepreneur who might not  have any resources of their own today to raise the resources they need  to hire people and succeed.   The Center for Venture Research estimates that U.S. angel investors  invested $24.6 billion in about 71,000 small businesses in every area,  every congressional district of our country. Many of those were  startups in the early stages of building a company.   Tomorrow's company that employs 10,000 or even 50,000 people is  today's garage startup trying to figure out how to get $50,000 or raise  $100,000 to make their payroll or buy their inventory.   Angel investors focus their investment on local startups and much  more so than, for instance, national venture capital firms that tend to  be clustered at the coast. It is an important way we can continue to  grow the economy in every ZIP code in this country, across the  heartland and the middle of the country, not just the coasts where the  venture capital firms themselves are situated.   The Colorado-based digital home design firm, Havenly, started by two  sisters, utilized demo days as networking opportunities to perfect  their pitch to investors, a very common path. After participating in a  500-startup demo day, the pair received nearly $13 million in  investment capital from qualified investors. Now Havenly is a thriving  business, employs hundreds of interior designers across the country,  and I am proud to say it has a staff of 40 people in their Colorado  headquarters. Havenly is a perfect example of how demo days provide  opportunities to startups that create real jobs for real people in our  country.   The HALOS Act simply gives the same opportunities to other startups  that thousands of others have had when getting off the ground.   I believe the HALOS Act is the appropriate approach to regulatory  relief. I appreciate the bipartisan nature of the legislation. It is  targeted to provide clarity around a specific potential problem and  certainty around what these events can entail.   Now, there is another bill under this rule as well. It is a bad bill.  It is not a strong bipartisan bill. It is called H.R. 79. Since we  began the 115th Congress here, the Republicans are promoting a  deregulation agenda. Often this agenda results in this body, Congress,  potentially being buried in having to do inordinate amounts of work to  review the executive branch of government.   Now, we all believe in oversight of the executive branch. Believe me,  Mr. Speaker, you are going to hear many Democrats speaking up about how  important oversight of the executive branch is, particularly for the  incoming administration.   We are not the executive branch. Congress delegates authority to  agencies, under the laws we write, to fill in gaps and decide how best  to implement the law. If we disagree, we can always change or amend the  authorizing statute to make more clear the intent of this body.   However, these bills being brought to the floor by the Republicans  would either require Congress to spell out exactly what ways to  implement a policy in a changing world or give the authority of how to  interpret and implement law to the judicial system, neither of which  are wise or expedient choices regardless of who occupies the  Presidency.   While I certainly will have more sympathy with this approach with  President Trump in the White House than President Obama in the White  House, I still believe this is the wrong way to go about the separation  of powers under our Constitution.   This bill sets out 60 new analytical requirements that agency actions  must meet before they can be implemented. In other words, any attempt  by agencies to protect the public from toxic substances, make sure our  planes and trains are meeting safety regulations, or make sure our food  is toxin free would be subject to 60 new bureaucratic hurdles,  effectively creating more and more red tape to tie the bureaucracy up  rather than make their work quicker and more efficient, which is what  Democrats seek to do.   This bill would bury the agency rulemaking process under a blizzard  of bureaucratic hurdles and documentation requirements, literally  burying the executive and administrative branch of government in red  tape and paperwork. This bill would hold the regulatory process hostage  to the whims of the very corporations and bureaucrats whose rulemaking  it is designed to address.   The process that the bills call for have been roundly discredited by  so many experts on regulatory policy from the left and the right and  consumer advocates as well. The administrative law and regulatory  practices section of the American Bar Association stated that these  burdens would reduce transparency, reduce public input, threaten public  safety, and, most importantly, not result in any better rules.    This bill is nothing other than a recycled effort that 56 Members of  this body have not had a chance to participate in writing through the  committee process to slow down the government and get in the way of  agency rulemakings that are critical for protecting public health,  safety, and our environment.   We are simply failing our constituents that we are elected to serve  by spending time on legislation that would deliberately sabotage our  own ability for our government to function efficiently. This is a bill  that would make government less efficient. That is not what I hear when  I am back home from my constituents--Democrat, Republican, Independent.  I don't hear: Go to Washington to make government less efficient. My  constituents want government to be more efficient.   Finally, this bill is being considered under a structured rule  limiting the amendment process. There were over 30 amendments filed.  Yet, we are only considering 16 amendments under this very overly  restrictive rule. This is particularly onerous because, again, there  was no opportunity for the 56 new Members through the committee process  to amend this bill.   There was a new Member that appeared before the Rules Committee  yesterday. Unfortunately, he was not even allowed to advance his  amendment to the floor under this rule.   Another example is an amendment offered by a new Member, Ms. Blunt  Rochester, who filed an amendment that would ensure that LGBT employees  are protected from workplace discrimination. It would allow Federal  agencies that are tasked with protecting the civil rights of employees  to continue to do their work without being hamstrung with unnecessary  requirements.   Civil rights protections do not fit neatly into a corporate monetary  analysis, and our government has a responsibility to ensure that all  Americans are protected from arbitrary or unjust discrimination based  on race, gender, sexual orientation, or gender identity.   Given the breadth and scope of this legislation, an open amendment  process would have allowed this amendment to be debated if the majority  wanted, perhaps even voted down, although I hope the majority would  have approved it. It would have produced a more thoughtful piece of  legislation. Yet, we are not even allowed to have that debate on the  floor of the House, which is why this rule is wrong and why I stand in  strong opposition to it.   We should be considering legislation to create permanent, high-paying  jobs, investing in infrastructure to grow our communities, fixing our  broken immigration system, and streamlining and improving our tax  system through tax reform rather than recycling old bills  [[Page H253]]  that 56 Members have not even had the opportunity to put their imprint  on.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule for those very  reasons.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, when we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up a bill that would establish a  national commission to investigate foreign interference in the 2016  election.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately  prior to vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, we have all been very concerned about the  reports from our own intelligence agencies about foreign interference  in the 2016 American elections.   I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) to  discuss our proposal, the ranking member of the Committee on Oversight  and Government Reform.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland.    I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the distinguished ranking member of the  Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and  Investigations.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado,  and I thank my good friend from Georgia. It is important to take note  of the value of democracy and the discourse on this floor, and my  friendship with the gentleman from Georgia, but absolute disagreement  with him on our purposes here.   Yes, regulation should be fair, and it should cede to the  administrative process and the administrative laws that dictate how  they should be formulated, and that fairness should be their  underpinnings. But I think my constituents, in terms of the regulatory  scheme, are far more interested in clean water and clean air. They are  far more interested in making sure that consumer products that impact  toddlers and babies are enforced. They are far more interested in  ensuring that there is competition to the FTC, and that there are fair  energy laws to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.   Having said that, I am disappointed as well that we are moving  forward on H.R. 5, which is a bill that went through the Judiciary  Committee, and, as my colleague from Colorado said, with 56 new  Members, it did not go through regular order. We are recycling the same  bad bill again.   I rise today to express concern over the number of amendments that  were presented that were good amendments that did not get in. Before I  speak to the amendment I am concerned about, first, I want to speak to  the previous question. I support the gentleman from California (Mr.  Swalwell) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) on a very  important statement, and that is in the tragedy and the heinousness of  9/11, we formulated the 9/11 Commission.   Mr. Speaker, there is no more heinousness than a foreign nation  interfering with the just and fair voting of every American. There are  many who lost their life in the name of one vote, one person. For that  reason, I would make the argument that it is imperative that this bill  be amended to create the commission that will address the question of  foreign intrusion, particularly Russian intrusion and hacking in our  election.   I believe this election was skewed, in spite of the peaceful  democratic transfer of government, which we will all adhere to, but  there is no doubt. This does not compete to 2001 with President Bush in  Florida. It does not compete to 2004 with Mr. Kerry. It is beyond any  kind of comprehension of what happened in this election, a direct  intrusion and skewing of this election. But, more importantly,  protecting the systems of election and the voting rights, the  preciousness of the voting rights, is crucial to democracy.   This commission, independent of any of the committees that should be  working--and I agree, Congress should be working. Senator McCain has  already begun working--a Republican--but this commission would be a  vital asset. So I am certainly disappointed that the amendment I had  that was crucial as relates to cybersecurity to deal with the question  of cyber intrusion was not made in order. It would have been  appropriate for us to have an amendment that would have spoken directly  to the idea of identifying new tactics or techniques that a malicious  actor might deploy, or detect and disrupt an ongoing intrusion, in  addition to protecting the data that enables cybersecurity firms and  other network defenders to identify certain malware that the Russian  intelligence services use.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.    I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman.   This amendment would have been vital to have not only a vigorous  discussion on the floor but also to recognize that cybersecurity has  now become a potential weapon. I have worked on this issue for a decade  as the former chairwoman of the Transportation and Infrastructure  Subcommittee. It was under my subcommittee that we began to look at  electric grids and began to see the enormous power of the cyber world.  My amendment should have been included because we are now faced with  what the cyber world used as a weapon can do. I am disappointed that  that amendment was not made in order. I am disappointed that H.R. 5 is  again before us without regular order, and would hope that we have the  opportunity to vote for and support the previous question to find out  what happened and who conspired to alter our elections in 2016.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule and the  underlying bill.   I strongly oppose this rule because it makes in order H.R. 5, the  Regulatory Accountability Act of 2017, which is a radical measure that  could make it impossible to promulgate safety regulations to protect  the public.   I oppose this rule because it would effectively shut down the entire  U.S. regulatory system, amending in one fell swoop every bedrock  existing regulatory statute.   My opposition to H. Res. 33 is amplified by the Rules Committee's  decision to decline to make in order the Jackson Lee Amendment, ``to  provide an exception for regulations that help prevent cyberattacks on  election processes or institutions.''   Apparently, House Republicans are still reluctant to debate the  subject--undisputed by our Intelligence community--of Russian  cyberattacks on American cyber networks and infrastructure.   Key Judgments in the Intelligence Community Assessment's declassified  version of a highly classified report entitled, ``Assessing Russian  Activities and Intentions in Recent U.S. Elections,'' have confirmed  that 2016 witnessed the first American presidential election that was  the subject of cyberattacks.   These and other subversive activities have been confirmed to have  been perpetrated by entities allied with the Government of Russia and  were undertaken for the express purpose of influencing the presidential  contest to secure the election of its preferred candidate, Donald  Trump, who made history by becoming the first presidential candidate to  invite a hostile foreign power to launch cyberattacks against his  political opponent.   All three agencies, CIA, FBI and NSA, agree with this judgment.   The so-called Regulatory Accountability Act (RAA), in addition to  this rule, demonstrates the deceptive design of the majority to make it  harder to establish regulations to protect the public by tilting the  entire regulatory system significantly toward special interests.   The bill allows Federal courts without expertise on technical issues  to substitute their judgment for those of the expert federal agencies.   These agencies are staffed with career subject matter experts that  are deeply knowledgeable of the background, context, and history of  agency actions and policy rationale.   For this reason, courts have long deferred to agency experts who are  in the best position to carry out the statutes.   The RAA would end this well-established practice and allow far less  experienced judges to second-guess expert opinion--essentially  sanctioning judicial activism.   The Jackson Lee Amendment, however, would have attuned this dangerous  legislation to provide an exception for regulation upon which Americans  so greatly rely on their government to help prevent cyberattacks on our  highly coveted and esteemed election processes and institutions.   The bill promoted by the majority, calling for accountability from  our Administrative Agencies--fails to answer in accountability to the  threat posed by foreign and domestic invaders on our national cyber  networks.  [[Page H255]]    As the new Congress commences in the People's House, obstructionist  Republicans are circumventing the very procedures by which elected  officials answer the cries of outrage and dismay of desperately  concerned constituents.   To the obstructionist majority perpetuating this restrictive rule,  let me stand firm in the American convictions laid bare by the Jackson  Lee amendment--the system of Checks and Balances established by the  Separation of Powers clause of the Constitution will not be thwarted.   The spirit of the H.R. 5 is clearly designed to stop all regulation  dead in its tracks--no matter the threat to cyber networks, national  security, economy, or the very health and safety of the American  people.   We know that Russia's cyber activities were intended to influence the  election, erode faith in U.S. democratic institutions, sow doubt about  the integrity of our electoral process, and undermine confidence in the  institutions of the U.S. government. These actions are unacceptable and  will not be tolerated.   The mission of the Intelligence Community is to seek to reduce the  uncertainty surrounding foreign activities, capabilities, or leaders'  intentions.   On these issues of great importance to U.S. national security, the  goal of intelligence analysis is to provide assessments to decision  makers that are intellectually rigorous, objective, timely, and useful,  and that adhere to tradecraft standards.   Applying these standards helps ensure that the Intelligence Community  provides U.S. policymakers, warfighters, and operators with the best  and most accurate insight, warning, and context, as well as potential  opportunities to advance U.S. national security.   This objective is difficult to achieve when seeking to understand  complex issues on which foreign actors go to extraordinary lengths to  hide or obfuscate their activities.   My amendment would have improved H.R. 5 by exempting only those  regulations critical to making cyber networks invulnerable to attack  from foreign and domestic agencies and individuals.   Specifically, the amendment that the Rules committee disallowed for  presentation on a vote here on the floor today would have provided the  American people an exemption to allow for the prevention of tampering,  alteration, or misappropriation of information by agents of foreign  countries with the purpose or effect of interfering with or undermining  election processes or institutions.   In particular, restrictions put forth in H.R. 5 could result in  further delay to agencies attempting to take action to help network  defenders better identify new tactics or techniques that a malicious  actor might deploy or detect and disrupt an ongoing intrusion, in  addition to protecting data that enables cybersecurity firms and other  network defenders to identify certain malware that the Russian  intelligence services use.   The Regulatory Accountability Act provides no accountability to the  American public.   Instead, it allows polluting industries and special interests to game  the system and escape accountability for any harm they inflict.   It makes it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to secure new  public protections and arms industry with numerous tools to avoid their  legal obligations.   The increasing use of cyber-enabled means to undermine democratic  processes at home and abroad, as exemplified by Russia's recent  activities, has made clear that a tool explicitly targeting attempts to  interfere with elections is also warranted.   We cannot afford to let global terroristic threats, in the form of  cyber activities, erode faith in U.S. democratic institutions, sow  doubt about the integrity of our electoral process, influence  elections, or undermine confidence in the institutions of the U.S.  government.   My amendment would have offered protections guarding the integrity of  our cyber networks, while at the same time allowing the bill to achieve  the proponents' major purposes.   The exceptional Americans we serve deserve a Congress that does its  job and keeps our time-honored institutions functioning.   For these reasons and more, I oppose this rule and the underlying  bill.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Swalwell).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close if the gentleman from  Georgia is.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, so, in summary, when we defeat the previous question, we  will then bring forward our bill to establish an independent report on  foreign interference in this most recent 2016 election, something that  the American people deserve to see, that we need to see. We need to put  safeguards in place to prevent our election system from being hijacked  by foreign powers.   With regard to the rule, Mr. Speaker, it is a bad, closed rule,  particularly given the chance that 56 new Members of Congress have not  had the opportunity to add their imprint to the bills that are before  us.   The gentleman mentioned, oh, the Democrats did this 10 years ago.  Well,  [[Page H256]]  that is hardly an excuse that the American people buy. There were many  things about the Democrats' tenure in this body the American people  didn't like; and to simply cite some of those less popular elements of  Democratic leadership and now say: Well, now we Republicans are going  to do earmarks; now we Republicans are going to have a closed process  that doesn't allow amendment; now Republicans are going to gut the  ethics rule.   In over 200 years, you can always cite some precedence for that from  both Democrats and Republicans, but those aren't good things. We want  to learn from our mistakes, I hope, and not say, just because some  Democrat or some Republican did this in 1952, it is a good thing to do  today.   Mr. Speaker, we are 6 days into the next Congress. After we defeat  the rule, hopefully, and defeat the previous question, we can bring  forward an independent study on foreign interference.   With regard to these two bills, I urge my colleagues to join me in  voting ``yes'' on the HALOS Act and, of course, oppose the ridiculously  broad H.R. 5, Regulatory Accountability Act, which would simply add  more paperwork to the bureaucracy, further reducing the efficiency of a  branch of government that many Americans believe is already too  inefficient.    I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question and  ``no'' on the rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.
