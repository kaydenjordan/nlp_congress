 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to stand here with my chairman from the great  State of Washington, (Mr. Reichert). This is a bipartisan bill.   The Generalized System of Preferences expired December 31, 2017. I  rise today to urge my colleagues to support the legislation that would  renew what I consider a very important program.   This is a longstanding trade program, Mr. Speaker, that has enjoyed  broad bipartisan support since 1974. Since the GSP already expired, it  is imperative that we extend the program now.   While this bill makes slight technical corrections, no real  substantive changes were made in the existing program. I am open to  having a debate on modifications that would enhance GSP in the future.  I would have liked to have had it before this debate, had the time that  we are debating right now and not have let the program expire, but,  unfortunately, I am not in control of the calendar. I am pleased,  however, that we agreed to work to renew this program in its current  form on a bipartisan, bicameral basis.   Established by the Trade Act of 1974, GSP promotes economic  development by eliminating duties on thousands of products when  imported from one of approximately 120 designated beneficiary countries  and territories. This program not only supports American  competitiveness and economic opportunity, but it also encourages  developing countries in the program to adopt high labor standards,  intellectual property rights, and the rule of law.   So, as part of the current program, the committee known as the GSP  Subcommittee of the Trade Policy Staff Committee conducts an annual  review of the articles, an annual review of all the countries that are  involved, that are eligible for duty-free treatment under this program.  This committee is chaired by the United States Trade Representative and  comprised of representatives of other executive branch agencies.   The law requires that the President take into account several factors  when designating a country as eligible for GSP. These factors include  whether a country has taken or is taking steps to afford workers  internationally recognized worker rights--that is what the law says-- and the extent to which a country is providing adequate and effective  protection of intellectual property rights.   Last year, the administration began a review of Bolivia's compliance,  as an example, with the labor eligibility criterion due to concerns  regarding the use of child labor and other labor abuses in Bolivia.                                time  1745    The legislation we are considering today includes a new reporting  requirement that will improve the effectiveness of congressional  oversight of the administration's enforcement of these eligibility  criteria and the progress made under effective investigations. Article  I, section 8 is very clear of what the legislators in this House have  as a responsibility. It is my hope that Congress can further strengthen  the enforcement mechanisms of the GSP in the future.   The program also boosts the competitiveness of United States  companies and workers by reducing the cost of imports used to  manufacture goods in the United States. In 2016, products valued at  $18.9 billion entered the United States duty-free under the program.  Since the expiration of the program, small- and medium-sized  enterprises have borne the burden of higher costs of products imported  under the GSP.   Consider Primetac, which is located in Little Ferry, New Jersey, in  my district. It is a family-owned business from my district that uses  the GSP-eligible goods to support their industrial packaging business.  When GSP last expired, Primetac was forced to raise prices to  compensate for the new import taxes. This was no small increase. The  company estimates it paid about $1.5 million in new tariffs during the  program's lapse.   This legislation would provide benefits retroactively to GSP-eligible  imports so that small- and medium-sized American companies like  Primetac can take full advantage of the benefits of GSP and boost their  business' productivity   It is critical that we act quickly. I also want to mention that the  GSP is also intended to prevent domestic companies from being harmed.  Under the current process, the competitive need limitation provision  within the law imposes ceilings on GSP benefits for each product and  for each beneficiary country. The GSP statute provides that a  beneficiary developing country loses GSP eligibility with respect to a  product if the competitive need limitations are exceeded and then no  waiver is granted.   In closing, I look forward to considering this legislation. With the  successful passage of GSP, I hope that we will be able to issue a  joint, bipartisan statement and continue working together to show the  strong support for this program.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We have had expiration times in the last 5 or 6 years, but we always  come together. We passed last week the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill in  Trade. I think that is a good sign moving forward, working together in  order to protect--not be protectionists, but protect American  industries. I think that this is a very, very important move.   I also think that extending it to 2020 is a great idea. I think this  is very, very important, so I won't be back here next year anyway. We  have a little foresight here.   So I thank Mr. Reichert for bringing this to the floor. We worked  hard to get this here. We hope we will get help from the other side of  the building.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
