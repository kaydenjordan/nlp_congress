 Madam Speaker, I rise today with my House colleagues to  honor and remember Senator Richard Lugar, a giant in Indiana politics  who recently passed away at the age of 87.   For those who had the privilege to serve in Congress alongside  Senator Lugar, you simply could not find a better mentor, colleague,  and friend. Nor could you find a more honorable and decent individual.   Senator Lugar truly defined what it meant to be a principled  statesman, dedicating his life to the betterment of the world, our  Nation, and the Hoosier State.   From serving in the United States Navy to being elected mayor of  Indianapolis in 1968 and to his service in the United States Senate  from 1977 until 2013, he spent his entire life in service to his Nation  and his fellow Americans.   While Senator Lugar worked on a wide variety of issues during his  time in office, it was in the realm of foreign policy that he made the  largest impact. Senator Lugar's knowledge of foreign policy issues was  unmatched. Our Nation will forever be stronger and safer because of his  tireless efforts.   It was a privilege and honor to serve alongside Senator Lugar during  my first term in Congress. As I stand here today, it is truly humbling  to say good-bye to a man who inspired so many to answer the call to  service.   Our thoughts continue to be with his beloved wife, Charlene; his  sons, Mark, Bob, John, David; and the rest of the Lugar family.   May he have fair winds and following seas. Godspeed.                            ____________________
