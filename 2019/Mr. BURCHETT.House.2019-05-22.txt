 Madam Chair, I rise today to speak on behalf of Dr.  Burgess' Amendment to H.R. 1500, the Consumers First Act.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has two primary  flaws. First, Congress does not oversee the agency, and a sole director  determines its priorities. Second, instead of securing funding through  the Congressional appropriations process, the CFPB receives money from  the Federal Reserve. This funding method exempts it from budgetary  limitations and is a prime candidate for the irresponsible use of tax  dollars.   These practices do not serve the American people, those that this  agency was designed to protect. Because of this current lack of  oversight and accountability, the agency is vulnerable to political  whims. An agency this powerful should have Congressional oversight.   Dr. Burgess' amendment, which I am proud to cosponsor, would help to  right these wrongs. It would subject the CFBP to the Congressional  appropriations process, just like other federal agencies of similar  scope and size. This is not a partisan amendment: The simple change  would increase resistance to political impulses and accountability to  the American people.
