 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask a simple question: What  is the rush? Why are we rushing to vote on a $1.7 trillion tax bill  that will end up being paid off the backs of working Americans?   Don't be fooled. Working Americans will pay for this bill. That is  why the National Association of Realtors warned that the typical  homeowner in my State could see their home value drop between $37,000  and $57,000. That is why the Joint Committee on Taxation has said the  Republican bill would increase costs to college students and their  families by $71 billion.   We all know whose retirement Republicans will raid when their overly  optimistic growth numbers don't materialize. They are going to go after  your Medicare and Social Security.   The American people deserve better than this Republican tax scam.  Instead of rushing to get this done, let's work together to get it done  right.
