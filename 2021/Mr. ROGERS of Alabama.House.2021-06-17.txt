 Mr. Speaker, let me start by saying that this  argument that we have to get rid of the AUMF is just ridiculous. We  pass the National Defense Authorization Act every year. We have passed  it every year for 60 consecutive years. If we don't want to authorize  something we are doing militarily, we can stop it at any time. So this  is a false argument that we have to do this to be able to prevent what  we are doing in Afghanistan or Iraq or anyplace else.   But with regard to this specific bill, this is a bad deal for our  national security and the safety of American servicemembers overseas.  Since the liberation of Iraq, the murderous Iranian regime has armed  proxy organizations to kill Americans and innocent Iraqis.   Iran has armed proxy militias with small arms, mortars, rockets, and  now sophisticated UAVs that can avoid base defenses. The Obama and  Trump administrations both used the 2002 AUMF to target terrorist  threats originating from Iraq.   Threats like ISIS and militias backed by Iran have killed and injured  American servicemembers and contractors. This bill would repeal the  2002 AUMF and offer nothing in its place; no authorization to mop up  ISIS forces or whatever movement comes next; no authorization to target  Iranian proxies whose sole goal is to destabilize Iraq and kill  Americans.   This bill only offers the illusion of withdrawal. Like President  Biden's  [[Page H2907]]  failing Afghanistan strategy, it does nothing to change the reality on  the ground in Iraq. The threats we face today will remain, and American  commanders will be forced to face those threats with one fewer tool  than they had the day before.   Repealing the 2002 AUMF without a replacement only undermines our  national security. It offers no real solution to the issues.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
