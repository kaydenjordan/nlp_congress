 Mr. President, first, let me say what a pleasure it  has been to work with Senator Crapo on these issues.   Our situation is pretty simple. We have a U.S. Navy that generates  spent nuclear fuel through its operations; we have a U.S. industry of  next-generation nuclear technology that needs that spent fuel in order  to test those innovative technologies; and we have extraordinary  National Labs with world-class expertise in handling that nuclear  material and supporting that innovation.   This amendment brings those three together. It allows the U.S. Navy's  spent fuel to be delivered to National Labs so that pursuant to a law  we just passed in the Senate recently, the cooperation between the  National Labs and the nuclear innovation community can move forward. We  have already passed that bill. I hope we will pass this bill.   I will close by saying there is something else in this that I think  is worth our consideration. We have an enormous national liability with  respect to our existing stockpiles of nuclear waste. Presently, we have  no realistic plan for dealing with that. There is a prospect--it is  definitely a maybe; I don't want to overpromise anything--there is  definitely a prospect and it is the intention of some of these next- generation technologies that we will be able to develop nuclear  technologies that will go through our nuclear waste stockpile and turn  that into productive electricity generation. If we can get there, that  would be a terrific Holy Grail. In the meantime, this is a smart and  efficient way to support American innovation in these technologies.    I urge all of my colleagues to vote yes. I, again, appreciate Senator  Crapo's leadership on this and the extraordinary National Lab that he  has in his home State.
