 Madam President, first, I want to offer congratulations  to longtime Senate staffer Ann Berry, who will soon be taking over the  responsibilities of a very important job as Secretary of the Senate.  This is a position that dates all the way back to April 8, 1789, 2 days  after the Senate achieved its first quorum for business.   Ann's nomination was approved by the Senate yesterday afternoon,  making her the first African American and only the eighth woman to ever  serve in that position. It would be an understatement to say Ann knows  the Senate well. She brings four decades of experience in the Senate to  her new office, having worked with Senator Leahy for many years, and,  more recently, with Senator Jones from her home State of Alabama.   She is going to do a fantastic job helping the Senate through its  day-to-day responsibilities, and I look forward to seeing her up here  on the dais when she assumes her new title in a few weeks.   Once again, another ceiling has been broken, and we welcome Ann Berry  as Secretary of the Senate.                                 Coronavirus    Madam President, next, COVID. One year ago, the United States  reported 11 confirmed cases of COVID-19. A few days later, a woman from  California became the first American to die from this disease.   Today, those numbers stand at over 26 million Americans infected and  over 450,000 Americans dead. Along the way, COVID-19 has turned life as  we know it  [[Page S414]]  upside down. It triggered the greatest economic emergency since the  Great Depression, tens of millions of lost jobs, shuttered schools,  collapsed businesses, and the greatest healthcare crisis since the  Spanish pandemic flu.   Congress has come together on several occasions to pass important  relief measures--measures that did a lot of good. They saved jobs and  lives and businesses. But it has not yet been enough. The crisis is  still with us. The economy has weakened. Everyday Americans are  struggling with the basic costs of living, of necessities.   So today the Senate is going to take the next strong step forward in  passing a rescue plan to lift the country out of a crisis and set it  back on the path to normal. Starting this afternoon, we begin the  process of debating amendments to the budget resolution. When that  process is complete at whatever hour, we will vote on final passage and  pave the way for Senate committees to begin crafting the rescue plan  itself, in coordination with House committees as well.   The amendment process here today will be bipartisan, it will be open,  and it will be vigorous. Democrats and Republicans alike will have the  opportunity to share their ideas. We welcome that. Of course, what  amendments our friends in the minority propose is entirely up to them.   Now, the Republican leader hinted yesterday that his conference is  preparing several messaging amendments that they hope might score  political points. That is fine. That is their right. But I sincerely  hope our Republican colleagues approach our work today with the  intention of having serious ideas considered, not using the debate over  pandemic relief to sharpen ephemeral, partisan talking points. This  should be a very serious debate, a very much needed debate. We are in  one of the greatest crises America has ever faced. If there are good- faith amendments from the other side, we look forward to them.   What we can't do, however, is think small in the face of big  problems. We cannot repeat the mistakes of the past. We cannot do too  little. We cannot lock our country into a long and slow recovery. We  must instead respond to the urgent needs in our country and chart a  bold path back to normal.   We must make sure that our country and its citizens have the  resources to survive the remaining months of challenge; that struggling  businesses can access loans and grants; that State and local  governments and, yes, Tribal governments are not forced to cut  essential services and millions of essential employees; and that our  doctors and medical workers can administer the vaccine as quickly and  as widely as possible. That is how we get back to normal. That is how  we survive the months in between until we get back to normal. And that  is what this budget resolution and the rescue plan are all about.                                 Impeachment    Madam President, now on impeachment, a few weeks ago, I laid out the  agenda for the Senate's opening few weeks: first, nominations; second,  major legislation to rescue the American people from the continued  effects of COVID-19; and third, an impeachment trial for Donald J.  Trump.   The Senate has made steady progress on the first two agenda items,  confirming several historic and exceptionally qualified nominees to  President Biden's Cabinet.   Tonight, we will be voting on the budget resolution--the first step  in giving the Congress the tools to pass a major relief bill.   On Tuesday, the Senate will begin to fulfill the third responsibility  that I outlined: the second impeachment trial of Donald J. Trump for  inciting a violent mob against the Capitol on January 6. They were  right near all of us--right near all of us.   It has been nearly a month since the attacks on the 6th. Time will do  its part to heal the scars left by that day, but we cannot allow it to  dull our sense of responsibility for holding to account those who  perpetrated and motivated the attack.   We were all witnesses to the events that day when a group of  insurrectionists, White supremacists, and domestic terrorists fed a  cavalcade of lies about the legitimacy of the American elections by the  former President, told to come to Washington by the former President,  whipped into a frenzy and directed toward the Capitol by the former  President, invaded and desecrated this sacred temple of democracy with  the intention of denying the counting of the electoral college vote-- the final act in certifying the former President's defeat.   The horrors of that day may have faded for some, not for others. Many  in this Chamber, staff, Senators, House Members, and House staff alike,  still live through this every single day--every single day. So it has  not faded for a lot of us. But as country, even for those for whom it  has faded, we cannot simply move on.    The U.S. Capitol Complex has been militarized, patrolled by the  National Guard, surrounded by a fence to safeguard the people's house  from the people themselves. Five people are dead. Just yesterday, we  held a memorial service in the Rotunda of this building for a Capitol  Police officer who was tragically killed during the attack.   There cannot be any healing without truth, without accountability.  The idea that we should sweep this under the rug and move on--one of  the greatest acts of perfidy against this government, against the  American people in our grand 200-some-odd-year history--no sweeping  under the rug.   So the trial will commence on Tuesday. Senators have already been  sworn in as judges and jurors. The House managers have filed their  brief. The former President's counsel have filed their answer. The  constitutional objection raised by some of my Republican colleagues has  been completely debunked by more than 150 scholars representing the  entire breadth of the political spectrum, including very prominent  conservatives like Steven Calabresi, the cofounder of the Federalist  Society.   We will move forward with a fair and speedy trial. The House managers  will present their case. The former President's counsel will mount a  defense. Senators will have to look deep into their consciences and  determine if Donald Trump is guilty and if so, ever qualified again to  enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.   We will pass judgment, as our solemn duty under the Constitution  demands, and in turn, history will judge how the Senate and each  Senator responds.                                Student Loans    Madam President, now on student loans, finally, later this morning, I  will join several of my Democratic colleagues from the House and Senate  to reintroduce our proposal to cancel up to $50,000 in Federal student  loan debt, a life-changing measure--life-changing--for Americans  struggling to stay afloat during this pandemic and secure financial  independence.   For tens of millions, especially people of color, college education  has represented the surest path to the middle class, but now that often  means taking on a mountain of debt that can take decades to pay off. It  makes it harder to own a home, save for retirement, and provide a  better life for loved ones. In the midst of a once-in-a-century crisis,  these Americans need relief fast. College has always been the ladder  up. For too many, it is now an anchor weighed down by huge amounts of  debt they almost can never see repaid in full.   I look forward to joining Senator Elizabeth Warren, as well as  Representatives Adams, Omar, and Jones, this morning to present our  plan for student loan debt cancellation.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak for 1  minute.    Madam President, as the Senate proceeds today on its  long string of rollcall votes, I rise at this moment to note that this  vote is different than the rest.   One of our most beloved, effective Members has just cast her 9,000th  rollcall vote in the course of her career.   Senator Murray, congratulations.   (Applause, Senators rising.)    It is a history-making accomplishment from a truly  history-making public servant   Madam President, as the Senate proceeds today on its long string of  rollcall votes, I rise at this moment to note that this one is  different from the rest--because, with this vote, our  [[Page S433]]  friend Senator Murray has now reached 9,000 rollcall votes over the  course of her career, a history-making accomplishment from a truly  history-making public servant.   Senator Murray was elected to this Chamber in 1992, the, ``Year of  the Woman.'' She began her tenure alongside Senator Feinstein, who will  also hit this significant milestone later today, and two other women in  a year that tripled the number of women who served in this chamber,  from two to six.   Over the course of her career, she was the first woman to serve in a  number of positions of Senate leadership, including chair of the Senate  Veterans' Affairs Committee and chair of the Senate Budget Committee.   In her time, she has been a leading voice on the biggest issues, from  healthcare, to the environment, to labor rights, pensions, standing up  for families and workers everywhere, possessing the rare gift of  explaining and presenting complex policy with extraordinary clarity.   As a close member of my leadership team, she has been a valued and  trusted partner and a dear friend.   So let us take this moment to recognize Senator Murray, a public  servant of extraordinary skill, and a Member we have all been honored  to serve alongside for all these years.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Would the gentleman yield?    It would help speed things along if we could have a set  amount. You keep handing us new sheets.   (Applause.)   And that is OK, but let's see the total amount of amendments, and  then we can try to move the time as quickly as possible. OK?    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Chamber for a minute.    Mr. President, we have another great accomplishment, one  right after the other, because they both came together. Earlier today,  we all congratulated our good friend Senator Murray for achieving a  historic  [[Page S442]]  milestone--9,000 rollcall votes. Well, we are pretty lucky because  today we get to celebrate another 9,000-vote accomplishment by none  other than the great senior Senator from California, Senator Feinstein.   (Applause.   Like Senator Murray, she was also elected during the Year of the  Woman, and she helped blaze a trail that many would follow.   Throughout her career, and through many of those 9,000 votes, she has  made her mark on some of the biggest issues of our time: the  environment, healthcare, gun safety, and much, much more.   Alongside Senator Boxer, she was the first woman to come to the  Senate from the State of California, the first Jewish woman to come to  the Senate from any State, and she became the first woman ever to serve  as chair of both the Rules Committee and Select Intelligence Committee.   One glass ceiling right after another in a storied and continually  impactful career.   I congratulate Senator Feinstein for today's accomplishment, and I  thank her for her many years of friendship.    We yield back our time.    Mr. President, we are going to now do 10-minute votes.  The Members should be warned. Stay in your seats. We are not holding  the vote open.   Not exactly, says Gary, but close enough. You know who runs the show  around here. All right, for 10 minutes or as close as we can come to  it.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order to call up the following amendments in the order listed and that  the amendments be reported by number and that the amendments alternate  with a Democratic amendment when one is available to be called up:  Kennedy, No. 782, SBA/riots; Paul, No. 441, roads; Lee, No. 770, oil  and gas on Federal lands; Cruz, No. 811, employment-based visas; Scott,  No. 872, border security; Capito, No. 655, navigable waters; Lankford,  No. 837, State and local/religion.   This is not the last list, my colleagues. There are another 10. So if  we stay in our chairs, we might make it by sunrise, but we really have  to cooperate here. Those are the ones we have so far.    Mr. President, we all want to finish this process. If we  all stay in our seats, we could avoid the recount and save a bunch of  minutes for each vote. I would urge and plead with every Member to stay  in their seat so we can get this done as quickly as possible.   I yield the floor.   (Chorus of Hear! Hear!)    Vote.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, upon  disposition of the Lankford amendment, No. 837, it be in order to call  up the following amendments in the order listed, the amendments be  reported by number, and the amendments alternate with a Democratic  amendment when one is available to be called up: Crapo No. 55, Hoeven  No. 887, Portman No. 816, Romney No. 803, and Lee No. 253.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in  order to call up the following amendments in the order listed, the  amendments be reported by number, and the amendments alternate with a  Democratic amendment when one is available.   We are not doing the Lee amendment. He withdrew it. Kudos to Mr. Lee.   We have Cruz No. 871, Murkowski No. 806, Sullivan No. 461, Rubio No.  651, and Sanders No. 804.    Mr. President, before we go to the amendment, please sit  in your--we are getting closer to the end. When everyone was in their  seats, it took us only 5 minutes to do these. Could people please  resume sitting in their seats.    Mr. President, I am about to offer a substitute  amendment that is the last step we need to ensure that the House can  move forward expeditiously and help bring the bold relief the American  people so need.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to call up  amendment No. 888, and that if the amendment is agreed to, it be in  order to call up the McConnell amendment; thereto, notwithstanding  adoption of the Schumer-Sanders amendment 888, that these be the only  amendments remaining in order.    I call up my amendment No. 888 and ask that it be  reported by number.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, thank you so much for being part of  this first big step to putting our country back on the road to  recovery. We very much appreciate your being here.   Just a brief word. I am so thankful that our caucus stayed together  in unity. We had no choice, given the problems facing America and the  desire to move forward, and we have moved forward. Many bipartisan  amendments were adopted, so this was a bipartisan activity. In fact,  the first amendment, which will help the restaurants, was done by  Senators Sinema and Wicker.   But we cannot underscore enough how much help America needs during  this awful crisis, and we cannot miss the point that we still have a  long way  [[Page S468]]  to go. This was a giant first step, a step in concord, and we are so  grateful that President Biden put together a plan, with input from so  many of us--both sides of the aisle--to bring America back, to overcome  this horrible crisis and then move America forward so that America can  once again feel the hope and opportunity that has been so, so much part  of this land but that we seem to have lost over the last 4 years and  particularly with the pandemic.   So we will keep working as hard as we can to pass this legislation  through the House, through the Senate, as we go through the  reconciliation process and hopefully put it on the President's desk.   A month ago today, two Senators from Georgia, two Democratic  Senators, were elected, and just a month from that day, we have taken a  giant step to begin to fulfill our promise to the American people that  a Democratic Senate, a Democratic House, and President Biden will have  their backs and move them forward during this awful crisis.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.
