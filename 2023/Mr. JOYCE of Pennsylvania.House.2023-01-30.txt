 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  work of Fire Captain Kirk Mitchell and to thank him for his service to  our country and to our community.   From becoming a volunteer firefighter at the age of 16 to joining the  United States Marine Corps at the age of 18, Kirk Mitchell set out  early in life to care for those in need of help and to protect those  who could not protect themselves.   Kirk would go on to work as an EMT, a public safety instructor, and  an emergency management officer.   His extensive work took him from California to Puerto Rico to aid  those who had been affected by wildfires and floods.   Throughout all of his work, Captain Mitchell has maintained a  connection with Blair County, Pennsylvania, serving as a steadfast  member of the Altoona Fire Department.   Kirk's commitment to protecting lives and supporting his fellow  firefighters has been a hallmark of his wonderful career.   On behalf of Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District, I wish Kirk  every continued success.               Socialist Policies Have No Place in Our Society     Mr. Speaker, it was 34 years ago that the  Iron Curtain finally fell, revealing to the world the horrible truths  of socialism and providing a stark contrast between the United States  and the enemies who wish to do us harm.   In the Capitol rotunda, we keep a warning of the dangers of  socialism. A piece of the Berlin Wall is embedded in the base of the  statue of President Ronald Reagan who championed the work of ending  socialism around the world.   From Venezuela to the Soviet Union, from Fidel Castro in Cuba to Kim  Jong-un in North Korea, every attempt to build a socialist or communist  society has only led to ruin.   Socialism is a tyranny that we can no longer afford to ignore.   As this administration continues to pick winners and losers in our  economy and as President Biden continues to cancel debts for liberal  elites on the backs of working Americans, it is time for us to clearly  state that socialist policies have no place in our democracy. It is  time for our country to return to the ideals of our Founding Fathers.   Our country was built on the belief that we are all created with  unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  These rights can only be fulfilled if we live in a Nation, a Nation  that is truly free. We must condemn socialism in all of its forms.   It was President Reagan who once said: ``Freedom is never more than  one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children  in the bloodstream. It must be fought for and protected.''   We cannot afford to let our country be governed by socialist  policies. We must protect our freedoms, and we must protect our  liberties at all costs.                            ____________________
