 Mr. Speaker, I would like to offer congressional  recognition to Detective Christopher Drury of the Sacramento County  Sheriff's Department.   Detective Christopher Drury began his career in 2011 and was hired as  a deputy sheriff on call. He was assigned to the Sacramento County Main  Jail. Detective Drury was hired as a full-time deputy sheriff in 2013,  where he remained assigned to the main jail.   In February 2015, Detective Drury was transferred to the Court  Security Division, where he remained until he was transferred to the  North Patrol Division in December 2015.   Detective Drury was selected to the Rancho Cordova Police Department  in 2017. The Rancho Cordova Police Department is a contracted city that  is fulfilled by the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office. While assigned  there, Detective Drury regularly interacted with the community during  his shift and answered numerous calls for service.   Detective Drury quickly became known for his tremendous work ethic  and commitment to the community. His proactive enforcement of violent  crime prevention was highly appreciated and noticed by his supervisors.   In 2019, Detective Drury was selected to be a narcotics detective in  the Impact Bureau. The Impact Bureau focuses on large-scale drug  trafficking, which operates from Kern County to the Oregon border.  Additional duties include the dismantling of drug clandestine labs.   While assigned to the Impact Bureau, Detective Drury has worked  several major narcotics investigations, which have led to the seizure  of hundreds of pounds of methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine, and  fentanyl. He continues to dismantle large-scale drug trafficking  organizations and positively interacts with the community in numerous  ways.   Despite having this very demanding position, in his off time,  Detective Drury actively contributes to the community. He was a regular  volunteer at his children's elementary school. He also volunteers for  Sacred Heart Home Tour, which is an organization that raises charity  proceeds to help individuals attend private Catholic school. The  organization raises roughly $200,000 a year for the charity.   Finally, Detective Drury is involved with the nonprofit Sponsoring  True Advocacy for Challenged Youth, or STACY. This nonprofit is an  organization advocating for children with special needs and their  families through diverse programs and partnerships in the greater  Sacramento area.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons and more, I am honored to include  Detective Christopher Drury of the Sacramento County Sheriff's Office  in the Third District of California's Police Honor Roll.                            ____________________     Secure the border. Mr. Speaker, this isn't something we  should have to insist upon. It shouldn't be controversial. It shouldn't  be a source of partisan contention. It is a basic and foundational  responsibility of government, and one that is currently being neglected  like never before with devastating consequences all across the country.   Perhaps the worst of those consequences is the fentanyl crisis. We  are seeing staggering amounts of fentanyl pour across the southern  border, flooding our communities with illicit and lethal pills killing  tens of thousands of Americans every year.   We know exactly where these drugs are coming from. The Biden  administration's own Drug Enforcement Agency admits that Mexican-based  cartels are responsible for the vast majority of fentanyl and meth that  is killing Americans. Just over the past year alone, the DEA seized 193  million deadly doses of fentanyl. This is now the leading cause of  death for young people  [[Page H2266]]  in our country--more than car accidents and more than suicides--more  than anything.   It is affecting every community in our country, including my own.  During the State of the Union, I was honored to have as my guests two  of the Nation's leading advocates for fentanyl awareness, and those are  the parents of a young man named Zach Didier, who tragically lost his  life. He was a senior at Whitney High School, a standout student with  no history of drug use, and from one pill, he tragically lost his life.  His parents had to go through the gut-wrenching experience of seeing  him get letters in the mail accepting him to some of our Nation's  leading universities after he had passed away.   There simply can be no doubt--it is beyond doubt--that the current  failure to secure our border is resulting in tragic and avoidable loss  of life every day.   Today, we have a chance to do something about it by passing H.R. 2.  This is one of the most important bills that will be considered in the  118th Congress. It is one of the most important pieces of legislation  that we will ever vote upon.   It is a comprehensive border security package, Mr. Speaker, and I  urge an ``aye'' vote.
