 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to  conclude my remarks before the vote begins.    Mr. President, about 50 years ago, William Proxmire rose in  this esteemed body and told us about government waste. He called it the  Golden Fleece Award. They were studying things like dating and love and  what makes love, and we had these great scientific studies about love.  These are William Proxmire's words from the early 1970s. He was a  conservative Democrat.   He says:         I object to this [study on love] because no one--not even       the National Science Foundation--can argue that falling in       love is a science; not only because I'm sure that even if       they spend $84 million or $84 billion they wouldn't get an       answer that anyone would believe. I'm also against [this       study on love] because I don't want the answer.        I believe that 200 million other Americans want to leave       some things in life a mystery, and right at the top of things       we don't [need] to know is why a man falls in love with a       woman and vice versa.    Stirring words. The Golden Fleece Award--I remember as a kid  everybody talked about it. It was in the newspapers. So what have we  done to curb the wasteful appetite, the abuse of government that has  happened at the National Science Foundation since 1972? Not a damn  thing.   Here is one of my other favorites from William Proxmire's days. The  FAA was named for spending $57,000 on a study of the physical  measurements of 432 airline stewardesses. These included the distance  from knee to knee while sitting and the length of the buttocks. Fifty- eight thousand dollars--this was your government money being put to  good use.   So fast forward, and we spend about $8 billion a year with the  National Science Foundation. Is it getting any better? Are they doing a  better job at overseeing their money? Well, I don't know. This bill is  going to increase their funding by 68 percent. There is $29 billion in  this bill for the National Science Foundation. So don't you think the  American people deserve to know where their money is being spent?   This was from their sister Agency, the NIH, but you know we can't get  started without talking about it. This is over $800,000 to study  whether or not Japanese quail are more sexually promiscuous on cocaine.  I am not making this up--$800,000 of taxpayer money to study whether  Japanese quail are more sexually promiscuous on cocaine.   Do you think we could have just polled the audience? Do you think we  could have just said: What do you think? Because that is sort of the  answer. The answer is yes. And yet your government spent 800 grand on  that. And then when we pointed it out 5 years ago, did they do anything  to reform it? No. They are here today to give the Agencies that are  doing this research more money.   Another one that I think is quite revealing is this study that is  about Panamanian male frog calls. You have about half a million  dollars, and they wanted to know whether or not the male mating call is  different in the country than it is in the city.   Now, coming from a rural State like Kentucky, I can tell you the male  mating call is different in the country than it is in the city. But  nobody in Kentucky wants a half a million dollars spent on a Panamanian  frog's male mating call. This is not a good use of money.   So if someone told you your government was spending this money, would  you give them more? Would you give the Agency more if they were doing  this or less? I think less.   In looking at the National Science Foundation's spending, we also  found that they spent $30,000 studying Ugandan gambling habits. Really?  We are studying why people gamble in Uganda, why there is a black  market in Uganda. Well, do you know what? I think we know the reason.  When government oppresses business and regulates business to death,  they go to the black market. If you make something illegal, you often  get more of it. But we spent $30,000 traveling over to Uganda to study  their gambling habits--utter waste of money. We should not reward these  people with more money.    We spent about half a million on a video game. This is an app for  your phone. I know we all need things to do when we should be working  or at school. This is an app for schoolchildren to teach them alarmism  over climate change. So you can click on the app, and it will scare you  to death that California is going to be underwater in 100 years--none  of which is true, all of which is alarmism, and a half a million  dollars spent by the government to alarm our schoolchildren is not a  good idea.   This next study points out a problem with funding, in general, in our  government. You give funds for something that ostensibly might be a  good cause. So a couple of years ago, they gave money for autism-- $700,000 for autism. And you think, well, autism, you know, even  myself, as conservative as I am, I  [[Page S3393]]  can probably say, well, that is something we ought to study, autism.  Well, they subcontracted 700 grand of it to a bunch of egghead  researchers to watch Neil Armstrong's statement on the Moon. Do you  remember the black-and-white photo? He is on the Moon, and he says,  ``[O]ne small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,'' or did he  really say: One small step for a man?   So these researchers took $700,000 to listen to that crackly old  cassette recording and find out, did he say ``man'' or did he say ``a  man''? So we studied the preposition ``a,'' and we spent 700 grand  listening to the tape over and over and over again. And do you know  what they determined? They just can't decide. They are unsure, but they  did recommend more money to study the problem further.   This is insulting to the American taxpayer. We should not be giving  these people more money; we should be giving them dramatically less  money.   But it also points out one of the reforms that I have proposed for  this Agency. One of the problems with the National Science Foundation  is, if I want to do research on Japanese quail snorting cocaine, guess  what, I can ask for the same people who are studying snorting cocaine  in animals--I can ask them to be on my peer committee. I can choose the  people on my peer committee. So if I want to study animals snorting  cocaine, I pick other researchers who are studying animals snorting  cocaine. Guess what. They tend to say yes. If they say yes, the  scientist gets on the next peer Commission, and he says or she says yes  for their snorting cocaine research.   This is crazy. We should not let these so-called scientists pick who  is on their committee. Not only that, I think we ought to have a  taxpayer advocate. Could we not have just someone with a good dose of  common sense who says we shouldn't take autism money, steal it, and  spend it on a bunch of idiots listening to what Neil Armstrong said  when he landed on the Moon? So that is part of the reform we should  have.   One of my other alltime favorites from the National Science  Foundation--this kind of goes back to William Proxmire and love and  happiness--they wanted to know if you take a selfie of yourself while  smiling and you look at it later in the day, will that make you happy?   Really? That is a half a million dollars. I don't think we need a  scientist to say that that is BS and that government has got no  business doing this kind of research. I don't even know how you could  even call this research with a straight face. But it goes on year on,  year on. We have been complaining about this since 1972, so you would  think maybe we would have less of it. We are giving them more money. So  we are now increasing their budget by 68 percent despite this kind of  research.   The last one I have is this. We spent $1.3 million on insect  ranching. This is money that was sent to study whether or not we could  put insects into animal feed. We spent another $3 million, though,  wanting to know if humans would eat ants to prevent climate change.   What will you do, America, to combat climate change? Will you eat  ants to combat climate change? That was a study. This is not science.  This is ridiculous in nature.   Actually, I lied. I have got one more example. We spent $1.5 million  studying lizards on a treadmill. So I know you have all been curious,  when lizards walk and they kind of waddle and they have a funny walk,  why do they walk that way? What is going on in their knee joints? What  do their hip joints look like when they waddle across the lawn?  Everybody wants to know that, but are you willing to spend $1.5 million  of your taxpayer dollars to take x rays--live, real-time x rays--of a  lizard walking on a treadmill? I tend to think, you know, maybe  Alzheimer's research, maybe cancer research, maybe heart research. But  spending good, hard cash on x rays of a lizard on a treadmill does not  strike me as the most pressing concerns of government.   I would argue that instead of increasing their money, we should be  decreasing their money. We also need to have oversight on where our  money is being spent. There is a great deal of circumstantial evidence  now that NIH money went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. There is a  great deal of evidence at least suggesting that the pandemic may have  started there. We don't know for certain. I am not saying that it did,  but there is evidence now that suggests that it might have. No. 1,  there is no animal host for COVID-19. We have not found--of the  thousands of animals we tested in the wet market, none of them had  COVID-19. When you take COVID-19 and you try to infect bats, which is  where most coronaviruses come from, what do you discover You discover  that COVID-19 is actually not very well infected in bats. The bats  don't catch it very easily. It seems as if COVID-19 is most adaptive  for humans. But if it came from animals, shouldn't there be an animal  host that is readily infected by this?    The other evidence we have in the last couple of days is confirmation  that three individuals at the Wuhan Institute got sick in November of  last year, sick enough to be in the hospital from a virus that was  previously undisclosed. They worked in the Wuhan Institute. We are told  this came from the wet market lab from exotic animals, but not one  animal tested positive for the virus.   We have an amendment we are hoping will be adopted by this body that  says gain-of-function research, as defined by the NIH in 2014, will not  be permitted in China. We will not fund it with American dollars.   But it is like so much waste in government, I think there is no  reason to be sending any money to China for research. They are a rich  country. For goodness' sake, we are worried about them outcompeting us,  stealing our intellectual property, and then we send them millions of  dollars to do research. Why don't they spend their own money? Do we  trust them enough? Are they open enough to tell us what is going on in  the lab that we want to give them money?   I think, without question, they have not shown this, and now we are  finding out that people were sick in the lab in November.   No more money should go to China for research on gain of function,  which means increasing the virulence or pathogenicity or the  transmissibility of COVID virus to humans. I urge this body to adopt my  amendment, which says, from here on out, China doesn't get any money to  create superviruses in a lab, and we should continue to investigate  this because 3 million people have died worldwide. We have disrupted  the entire world's economy over a virus. If it came from a lab, we need  to know it, and it needs to be fully investigated.    Mr. President, we may never know whether the pandemic arose  from the lab in Wuhan, but we do know that so far no intermediate  animal host has been discovered. Thousands of animals at the wet market  have been looked at. None of them have carried COVID-19. We have tried  to infect COVID-19 into bats. It doesn't grow well in bats. It seems  most adapted and suitable for humans. We may not know whether this ever  arose out of a Wuhan lab, but I think gain-of-function research, where  we take a deadly virus, sometimes much more deadly than COVID, and then  we increase its transmissibility to mammals is wrong.   In 2014, NIH stopped all of this research. I am using the same  definition to say any gain-of-function research should not be funded in  China with U.S. taxpayer dollars. I recommend a ``yes'' vote.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2003     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  interns in my office be granted floor privileges until August, 13,  2021: Daniel Rankin, Chip Wyatt, Jacob Patterson, Nick Lolli, Phil  Steinkrauss, Brett Abbott, Esther McGuire, and Justin Witt.
