 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of this short-term continuing resolution.   As I said last week, we have been negotiating night and day for weeks  to reach agreement on full-year appropriations bills and a coronavirus  relief package. I am proud that we have reached agreement that will  fully fund the government for the rest of the fiscal year and provide  more desperately needed relief for the American people and businesses  impacted by the coronavirus.   Passing this CR is simply a stopgap measure to give the House and the  Senate time to pass this bipartisan agreement and get it to the  President's desk for a signature. I urge my colleagues to join me in  voting in favor of this continuing resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
