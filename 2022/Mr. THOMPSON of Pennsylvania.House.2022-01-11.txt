 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate the 106th Annual Pennsylvania Farm Show, the largest indoor  agriculture show under one roof in the country.   Each year, I have the privilege to tour the Pennsylvania Farm Show  Complex, meet with commodity groups and industry leaders, and host a  public listening session.   I thank those who joined me in 2022: Pennsylvania Congressional  Delegation Members Congressman Keller and Congressman Meuser, and House  Agriculture Committee's Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy,  and Credit, Ranking Member Michelle Fischbach--all strong allies of the  agriculture community.   I also thank Pennsylvania's Secretary of Agriculture, Russell  Redding, for his participation, and the farmers and ranchers and  producers we visit with for sharing their concerns, voicing their  questions, and more importantly, clothing and feeding our great  Commonwealth, country, and world.   I know there is no experience that replaces the value of meeting with  our producers face to face. The Pennsylvania Farm Show truly does bring  together so many different people in the ag community on the local,  State, and Federal level. It is an event like no other.                            ____________________
