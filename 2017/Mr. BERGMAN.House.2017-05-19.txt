 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Michigan's police  officers for their selfless service and to honor the fallen.   Isaiah 6:8 says: ``Whom shall I send? And who will go for us? And I  said, `Here I am. Send me.' ''   Every time our law enforcement officers put on their uniform, they  are saying, ``Send me.''   In cities and small towns all over the United States, law enforcement  officers act as our protectors, defenders, and ambassadors of peace.  They hold that thin blue line between thriving, healthy communities and  chaos.   During the past few months, I have had the pleasure of getting to  know officers serving the Escanaba, Gaylord, and Traverse City  communities in specific, and all across the First District, and I can  say without pause that Michiganders are in capable and caring hands.   We owe a debt of gratitude, a debt of cooperation, and a debt of  consistent support to our law enforcement officers.   God rest the souls of the fallen. Keep their friends, families, and  fellow officers in your hearts and prayers.                            ____________________
