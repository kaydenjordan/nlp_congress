 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the career  of Monsignor Franklyn Casale, who will retire this coming spring after  serving as president of St. Thomas University for the past 24 years.   Monsignor Casale has led an exemplary life of service, including many  leadership positions. In south Florida, we are most thankful for the  monsignor's distinguished presidency of St. Thomas, which included the  expansion of campus facilities, positioning the university as a leader  in the fight against human trafficking, and the establishment of the  university's first doctoral program.   During his tenure, Monsignor Casale created a legacy of committed  service, which transformed St. Thomas into one of the Nation's leading  universities, and prepared thousands of his graduates to become leaders  in their fields.   Once again, congratulations, Monsignor Casale, on a well-deserved  retirement and on a remarkable career advancing St. Thomas' legacy of  academic achievement and spiritual development. Your lifelong emphasis  on Catholic values, diversity, and student success has helped empower  many students to take on the world with compassion and strong  conviction.   ``Congratulations, my friend,'' ``Felicidades, mi amigo.''                            ____________________
