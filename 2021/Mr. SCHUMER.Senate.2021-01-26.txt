 Mr. President, as we move through the first full week of  the Biden administration, the Senate will continue the important work  of confirming President Biden's Cabinet.   Today, the Senate will hold a confirmation vote for Tony Blinken to  be the next Secretary of State. Mr. Blinken is just the right person to  rebuild and reassert America's national security prerogatives on the  global stage and reestablish the first instrument of American power:  diplomacy.   For 4 years, the failed diplomacy of the Trump administration  weakened our alliances, strengthened and emboldened our adversaries,  and tarnished America's reputation abroad. We must reaffirm our  commitment to NATO and other critical alliances around the world. We  must hold Russia accountable for its malicious interference in  democracies. We must confront China's economic, political, and human  rights abuses. And we must work with the family of nations to combat  the existential threat of climate change.   Once confirmed, Mr. Blinken will also inherit a State Department  workforce in desperate need of a leader who knows that everyone on the  team plays a critical role in advancing America's interests abroad.  Under President Trump, our Nation's diplomats and State Department  civilians were relegated to the sidelines, and too many positions in  the State Department were left vacant or relegated to irrelevance.   None of this will be easy, but I am confident that Mr. Blinken is  exactly the right person for the job. I look forward to seeing this  Chamber confirm his nomination later today.   After that, both parties must keep working together to confirm the  rest of President Biden's outstanding Cabinet. We are off to a decent  pace with the confirmations of the President's Secretaries of Defense,  Treasury, and Director of National Intelligence. I appreciate the  Republican leader's cooperation and hope it will continue because our  country needs that.  [[Page S134]]    That pace must continue this week with the confirmation of the  Secretaries of Homeland Security and Transportation. After that, we  need a Health and Human Services Secretary installed to oversee the  public health response to COVID; an Education Secretary to facilitate  the safe reopening of the schools, guided by the science; and a  Secretary of HUD to help America's struggling families stay in their  homes during this horrible economic crisis. The Senate is working at an  encouraging pace, and we will not let up.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on the organizing resolution, well,  since the last time I addressed this Chamber, there has been notable  progress in my discussions with the Republican leader about organizing  the Senate. Last night, the Republican leader dropped his demand for  additional provisions on the organizing resolution and will agree to  the 2001 rules that last governed the 50-50 Senate--exactly what  Democrats proposed from the start.   I am glad the Republican leader finally relented, and we can move  forward now to organize the Senate, Senate committees, chairs, and  ranking members, and the process for moving bills and nominees to the  floor from committees with an evenly divided number of Members. I am  glad we are finally able to get the Senate up and running. My only  regret is that it took so long because we have a great deal we need to  accomplish over the next several weeks and months.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on COVID, in addition to the  confirmation of critical Cabinet nominees, the Senate will soon move  forward with legislation to address the twin crises facing our country:  the public health crisis and the economic crisis.   In December, Congress took the important step of passing interim  emergency relief to the country, but we left the job unfinished. I  understand that recent opposition from the political right for more  spending has increased in volume now that there is a Democrat in the  White House, but the pandemic doesn't particularly care that there has  been a change in the administration. The needs of our country are still  great, and the urgency to act is clearer than ever.   The Congressional Budget Office told us last fall that the COVID-19  pandemic has taken more than $17 trillion out of our economy--$17  trillion. No doubt, Congress has passed substantial relief, but looking  at the data, we are nowhere close to filling the COVID-sized hole in  our economy. Expanded unemployment insurance will once again expire in  March. State and local governments, which have already cut over a  million jobs, are still reeling from budget deficits and have not  received direct assistance. The amount of direct payments to the  American people in the previous bill was regrettably much lower than  many of us, including myself, wanted. We must continue supporting the  rapid and massive distribution of the vaccine to finally crush this  virus once and for all.   So the Senate is going to press forward on another COVID-relief bill.  We want to work with our Republican colleagues to advance this  legislation in a bipartisan way, and the work must move forward-- preferably, with our Republican colleagues, but without them if we  must.   We are still in the midst of a once-in-a-century crisis that has  reshaped our economy and altered nearly every aspect of American life.  Americans are still getting sick. Americans are still dying. Americans  are still losing their jobs. We must not suffer timidity or delay.  There is great urgency to continue the work of COVID relief, and that  is exactly what the Senate will do.   I yield the floor                            ____________________     Mr. President, at this time, pursuant to rule IV of the  Senate Rules on Impeachment and the U.S. Constitution, the President  pro tempore emeritus, the Senator from Iowa, will now administer the  oath to the President pro tempore, Patrick J. Leahy.    Mr. President, the theory that the impeachment of a  former official is unconstitutional is flat-out wrong by every frame of  analysis: constitutional text, historical practice, precedent, and  basic common sense. It has been completely debunked by constitutional  scholars from all across the political spectrum.   Now, the junior Senator from Kentucky read one clause from the  Constitution about the Senate's impeachment powers. He left out another  from article I, section 3: ``Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not  extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to  hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United  States.   If the Framers intended impeachment to merely be a vehicle to remove  sitting officials from their office, they would not have included that  additional provision: disqualification from future office. The  Constitution also gives the Senate the ``sole power'' to try all  impeachments.   So what did past Senates decide on this question? In 1876, President  Grant's Secretary of War, William Belknap, literally raced to the White  House to tender his resignation before the House was set to vote on his  impeachment. Not only did the House move forward with the impeachment,  but the Senate convened a trial and voted as a Chamber that Mr. Belknap  could be tried ``for acts done as Secretary of War, notwithstanding his  resignation of said office.''   The language is crystal clear, without any ambiguity. The history and  precedent is clear. The Senate has the power to try former officials,  and the reasons for that are basic common sense. It makes no sense  whatsoever that a President or any official could commit a heinous  crime against our country and then defeat Congress's impeachment powers  and avoid disqualification by simply resigning or by waiting to commit  that offense until their last few weeks in office.   The theory that the Senate can't try former officials would amount to  a constitutional get-out-of-jail-free card for any President who  commits an impeachable offense.   Ironically, the Senator from Kentucky's motion would do an injury to  the Constitution by rendering the disqualification clause effectively  moot. So, again, by constitutional text, precedent, and common basic  sense, it is clearly and certainly constitutional to hold a trial for a  former official. Former President Trump committed, in the view of many,  including myself, the gravest offense ever committed by a President of  the United States.   The Senate will conduct a trial of the former President, and Senators  will render judgment on his conduct.                               Motion to Table    Therefore, the point of order is ill-founded and, in any case,  premature. If Senators want this issue debated, it can and will be  argued during the trial. Therefore, I move to table the point of order,  and I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk called the roll.
