 Mr. President, I am happy to join my colleagues,  Senator McCain and Senator Cardin, in urging the Senate to approve  Montenegro's accession into NATO. It is long overdue, as they have both  said. This is something that has been approved by the Foreign Relations  Committee not once but twice--last year in the last Congress and again  in January of this year. We have heard expert testimony from a whole  bipartisan group of diplomats, national security experts, and former  administration officials, urging quick action on Montenegro's  accession. There is no reason for any further delay.   My colleagues here who have been such great leaders on the importance  of responding to Russia's actions, of addressing their interference in  our elections here in America, but also of addressing what they are  doing in Europe, have said it very eloquently. We need to get this  done; and 25 of the 28 member states have already ratified the  protocol, according to their own procedures. The Senate must act.   One of the priorities of the NATO summit last year in Warsaw was  bolstering NATO's resilience and its capacity to deter Russian  aggression against NATO's eastern flank. At that summit, NATO invited  Montenegro to become its 29th member.   As Senators McCain and Cardin have already said, Russia is opposed to  Montenegro's accession into NATO. It has warned Montenegro of  retaliation if it pursues NATO membership. Furthermore, we have seen  what that retaliation looked like.   During Montenegro's general election last October, 20 people were  arrested on suspicion of plotting, with support from Russia, to  overthrow the government and assassinate the Prime Minister--all  because he has supported NATO accession.   When we were in Munich for the security conference a couple of weeks  ago, Senator McCain and I and the congressional delegation that was  there heard from Montenegrin Prime Minister Djukanovic, who talked  about what he experienced from the Russians and about the Russian  effort to overthrow his government, a duly elected democracy.   Just last month, their chief special prosecutor announced that his  government had evidence that Russia's Federal Security Service was  involved in a failed coup.   Mr. President, I have two news articles about this story that I ask  unanimous consent be printed in the Record so that everybody  understands that it is very clear what is going on.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                         [From CNN, Feb. 21, 2017]               Montenegro: Russia Involved in Attempted Coup                  (By Milena Veselinovic and Darran Simon)         Montenegro's chief special prosecutor has told a local TV       station authorities believe Russian security services were       involved in a plot to kill the country's then-prime minister       and overthrow the government last October.        Milivoje Katnic said Montenegro officials have evidence       that Russia's Federal Security Service was involved in the       failed coup, according to his statements Sunday on Atlas TV.       The allegation drew an immediate rebuke and denial from       Russian officials.        Katnic said the plot was an attempt to stop Montenegro from       joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO.       ``Behind these events are nationalist structures from Russia,       but we now know that certain Russian state authorities were       involved also on a certain level,'' Katnic said.        Katnic said the alleged mastermind behind the failed coup       was a man named Eduard Sismakov, who is a former deputy       Russian military attache in Poland. Sismakov was deported to       Russia for espionage in 2014, according to the prosecutor.        According to Katnic, Sismakov is also known as Eduard       Shirokov, and was issued a passport with the different name       by Russian authorities.        ``The passport was given to him by certain Russian state       bodies under another name, and he is a member of the Russian       military structures,'' Katnic said. ``And his name is Eduard       Sismakov, that is his personal identity and we will charge       him under that personal identity.''        Katnic added: ``It is clear that the passport could not       have been issued under another name as well as everything       else--sending to Serbia, organizing everything--without the       involvement of certain structures.''        The Interpol Red Notice says Sismakov--listed under the       name Eduard Shirokov--prepared acts against the       constitutional order and security of Montenegro. The Interpol       Red Notice is an international database of suspects that is       shared with other law enforcement agencies. Sismakov's       country of birth is listed as Russia.        Katnic said another alleged plotter is Vladimir Popov.       Popov, who is of Russian origin, is also wanted by Interpol       for the same acts, according to the Interpol Red Notice.        Katnic said another alleged plotter, Nemanja Ristic, was       involved in the coup attempt, and Ristic has said he was       connected to Russia's Federal Security Service. His task was       to recruit a team to send to Montenegro to execute the coup,       Katnic said. Ristic is wanted by Montenegro for attempted       terrorism, according to Interpol's Red Notice.        The Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, on Monday dismissed       Katnic's accusations.        ``Day after day, we are faced with absurd accusations about       Russia. Day after day we  [[Page S1829]]       deny these accusations. We say absolutely that there cannot       be talk about the official involvement of Moscow in the       internal events in Montenegro. Russia does not get involved       and will not get involved especially in such countries as       Montenegro with which we have a very good relationship,''       Peskov said during a conference call with journalists.        Montenegro is in accession talks to join the alliance after       NATO formally invited the southeastern European county in       December 2015. The move spurred threats from Russian       officials, who are at odds with NATO over a multitude of       issues, including Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane in       December 2015.        At the time, Russian President Vladimir Putin called the       incident ``an enemy act.''        Becoming an official member of NATO would be significant       for Montenegro because, under the alliance's charter, any       attack on Montenegro would be seen as an attack on all NATO       members.        The ratification process for Montenegro to join NATO is in       its final stages, according to NATO.                                   ____                      [From the Guardian, Nov. 11, 2016]       Serbia Deports Russians Suspected of Plotting Montenegro Coup         Serbia has deported a group of Russians suspected of       involvement in a coup plot in neighbouring Montenegro, the       Guardian has learned, in the latest twist in a murky sequence       of events that apparently threatened the lives of two       European prime ministers.        The plotters were allegedly going to dress in police       uniforms to storm the Montenegrin parliament in Podgorica,       shoot the prime minister, Milo Djukanovic, and install a pro-      Moscow party.        The Russian fingerprints on the October plot have       heightened intrigue about Moscow's ambitions in a part of       Europe hitherto thought to be gravitating towards the EU's       orbit.        A group of 20 Serbians and Montenegrins, some of whom had       fought with Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine,       were arrested in Podgorica, the Montenegrin capital. In       Serbia, meanwhile, several Russian nationals suspected of       coordinating the plot were caught with =120,000 and special       forces uniforms.        According to a Belgrade daily, the Russians also had       encryption equipment and were able to keep track of       Djukanovic's whereabouts.        Diplomatic sources told the Guardian the Belgrade       government quietly deported the Russians after the       intervention of the head of the Russian security council,       Nikolai Patrushev, who flew to Belgrade on 26 October in an       apparent effort to contain the scandal. The country's       interior minister Nebojsa Stefanovic denied the government       carried out any deportations connected to the plot.        A source close to the Belgrade government said Patrushev, a       former FSB (federal security service) chief, apologised for       what he characterised as a rogue operation that did not have       the Kremlin's sanction. In Moscow, a Security Council       official told Tass that Patrushev ``didn't apologise to       anyone, because there is nothing to apologise for''.        The Serbian government was further rattled three days after       Patrushev's visit when a cache of arms was found near the       home of the prime minister, Aleksandar Vucic. The weapons       were discovered at a junction where Vucic's car would       normally slow down on his way to the house.        Stefanovic said there were ``strong suspicions'' that an       organised crime gang had been hired to kill Vucic for =10m,       but he would not specify who was behind the alleged plot,       saying further investigation would show whether people       ``outside the region'' were involved.        ``You know the people who don't like a strong Vucic or a       strong government of Serbia and who could contribute some       money, =10m or so, to see this kind of thing done,''       Stefanovic told the Guardian.        ``We know that the people who were potentially hired to do       this kind of thing were from the region, but not from Serbia,       and that there were crime groups that are operating in the       region that were involved. But these were just the trigger       persons,'' the minister added.        ``We believe that criminal gangs are just being used to do       the job, but the motives are not linked to the gangs. The       assassination of the prime minister is not something that       even they would do lightly, we believe they are being used.''        Since the discovery of the weapons, Vucic has announced       plans to shake up the intelligence service, saying the       security situation was ``even more serious than we       expected.''        ``There will be changes in the secret service,'' he told       the public broadcaster, RTS. ``I believed in the skills of       people who didn't show that they have these capacities, but       I'll take responsibility for this.''        It is unclear whether there is a connection between the       alleged assassination plots against Vucic and Djukanovic. But       the intrigue of the past month comes against a backdrop of       fierce east-west competition.        Djukanovic has been instrumental in pulling his country to       the verge of NATO membership--an accession protocol was       signed in May--which has dashed Russian hopes of securing a       naval foothold on the Adriatic. According to the Montenegrin       press, Moscow lobbied hard in recent years for transit and       maintenance facilities at the ports of Bar and Kotor.        The importance of such facilities was demonstrated late       last month when a Russian carrier and its battle group was       denied refueling in European ports along the way to support       the Russian military effort in Syria.        In Serbia, Vucic has been seeking a delicate balance       between NATO and Russia, and the country's armed forces have       conducted military exercises with both, although far more       frequently in recent years with NATO. Vucic has also refused       to grant diplomatic status to Russian officials staffing a       Serbian-Russian humanitarian center established in the city       of Nis in 2012, infuriating Moscow.        Western officials suspect the center of being a Trojan       horse, which could expanded as a hub for intelligence and       paramilitary operations in the region. Diplomatic status,       they point out, would have allowed equipment to be brought in       without oversight by Serbian customs.        Some analysts have suggested the operation could have been       mounted as a ``semi-freelance'' one, giving enough distance       from Moscow to be plausibly deniable if was uncovered.        ``Both sides have an interest in playing this as a       freelance, vigilante-type thing, it allows them both to save       face. Whether that's actually true is unclear. There's simply       not enough evidence either to support or disprove it,'' said       Vladimir Frolov, a Moscow-based analyst.        ``Judging from the amount of logistical and financial       support they got, it looks likely they acted with at least a       tacit understanding that this was sanctioned.''        A few days after the would-be coup, a former intelligence       officer, Leonid Reshetnikov, who ran a hawkish research       institute in Moscow, was relieved of his duties by Putin. The       Russian Institute for Strategic Studies has a branch office       in Belgrade, and Reshetnikov had given strong backing to the       anti-Nato opposition party in Montenegro.        A regional analyst who did not want to be named said his       understanding from intelligence sources was that the       incidents in the Balkans were probably linked to Russian       attempts to gain influence and leverage in the Balkans in the       run-up to an anticipated Hillary Clinton US presidency, which       was expected to take a harder line on Russian activity in the       region.        In Moscow, the Russian foreign ministry took a dim view of       this Guardian report on the Balkan events. Maria Zakharova,       spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry wrote: ``The       publication in the Guardian with a link to `sources' saying       that Patrushev apologised for `Russian nationalists' who had       planned to kill the prime minister of Montenegro is a classic       provocation aimed at spreading knowingly false information.''     The best thing we can do in the United States in the  Senate is to approve Montenegro's accession because that sends a very  clear message to Russia that we are not going to put up with that kind  of interference.   What I don't understand is why anybody in this body wants to prevent  us from approving this accession. Are they supporting Russia in their  activities? Are they opposed to NATO? What is the deal here? They need  to come forward and tell us what their objections are. Why aren't they  letting this go through? Why are they willing to stand up for Russia  and not for Montenegro and not for Europe and not for the United  States?   Those are the questions that I have, and I want whoever objects to  come to the floor and tell us why they are objecting, because  Montenegro and our NATO partners deserve at least that much.   It is now time to stand up strong for Montenegro, for their right to  self-determination, for their right to join NATO, for the West and for  NATO. I hope that we are going to be able to get this through this  afternoon.   I will defer to my colleague from Arizona to make the unanimous  consent request.   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from New  Hampshire and the Senator from Maryland. This issue probably doesn't  matter a lot to many of our voters. It probably is not something that  is uppermost in their minds. But because of your hard work here in the  Senate and your indepth knowledge of the issues and challenges that  face this country, in what is arguably the most uncertain and turbulent  time in the last 70 years, you have taken the time and the effort to  learn about this small country, this small beautiful country whose only  wish, whose only desire is to be a part of our community of NATO so  that they can come under the umbrella of protection and move forward  with a thriving democracy in a very volatile part of Europe.   I want to especially thank Senator Shaheen and Senator Cardin for  their advocacy, affection, and appreciation  [[Page S1830]]  of the citizens of the small country who are only seeking what we  sometimes take so much for granted. So I especially want to thank them.   I also want to thank the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee,  Senator Corker, who also was very involved in getting this through.   So, Mr. President, if there is objection--and I note that the Senator  from Kentucky is on the floor, and I will say before I read this, if  there is objection, you are achieving the objectives of Vladimir Putin.  You are achieving the objectives of trying to dismember this small  country that has already been the subject of an attempted coup.   I have no idea why anyone would object to this, except that I will  say, if they object, they are now carrying out the desires and  ambitions of Vladimir Putin, and I do not say that lightly.                unanimous consent request--executive calendar    So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be  determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic  leader, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider Calendar  No. 1, Montenegro, Treaty Document No. 114-12; that the treaty be  considered as having advanced through the various parliamentary stages  up to and including the presentation of the resolution of ratification;  that any committee declarations be agreed to as applicable; that there  be no amendments in order to the treaty or the resolution of  ratification; that there be 2 hours for debate, equally divided in the  usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate  proceed to vote on the resolution; that any statements be printed in  the Record; that if the resolution of ratification is agreed to, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that if  the resolution is not agreed to, the treaty be returned to the  calendar, and that there be no motions or points of order in order  other than a motion to reconsider; and the Senate then resume  legislative session.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.    Mr. President, I just have to follow up on Senator  McCain's comments. How disappointing it is that we saw the Senator from  Kentucky come to the floor to object to something that is clearly in  the national security interests of this country--to support  Montenegro's accession to NATO. It is in Europe's interest, in  Montenegro's interest, and it is in America's interest.   I have to agree with Senator McCain. He is working in support of  Russia's interests in America or he is holding this hostage for  something that is totally unrelated to what we are doing with  Montenegro's accession into NATO. In either case, it is totally  inappropriate.   When are people in the Senate going to stop holding hostage things  that are totally unrelated to the work on the floor of the Senate and  start acting like adults and doing what we ought to be doing in this  body? It is so hard to understand why somebody is here doing that, and,  you know, I am disappointed that he is not willing to come to the floor  and say why he is holding this up. If he has a good reason, he should  be here talking about that reason, and let's see if we can find a  compromise. But if he is not willing to come to the floor and talk  about it, what does that mean? What does that mean for the future of  this kind of treaty? And what is Montenegro's right to self- determination and our national security interests? It is just  unfathomable.   So I am going--I think we should all keep coming to the floor on a  regular basis, and I am hopeful that if we do that, we will eventually  be able to find out what Senator Paul's objection is and address that  because we can't let this stay in limbo in perpetuity.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.    Mr. President, I just wanted to say how pleased I am to  be able to join my colleague from New Hampshire on the floor for her  official maiden address. It is so nice to see so many of our women  colleagues here for this as well.   As she pointed out, I just wanted to echo the great work Senator  Hassan has done, especially as Governor, in expanding the Medicaid  Program in New Hampshire so that it provides treatment for so many  people, especially when it comes to the heroin and opioid epidemic, and  why we are so concerned about any efforts to roll that back--because  that would kick thousands of people in New Hampshire off of treatment  with nowhere else to go. I certainly plan to continue to join her as we  fight for this effort, and I know our colleagues are going to help us  in that. I believe that if we all work together, we can make progress,  as she has so eloquently stated.   So congratulations to Senator Hassan for her first official maiden  speech. I know it will be just one of many more to come.   (The remarks of Mrs. Shaheen pertaining to the submission of S. 630  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.)    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I come to the floor again today to speak  about a program I have been working on that has had bipartisan support  for a number of years; that is, the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa  Program. This program allows Afghans, including interpreters, who have  supported the U.S. mission in Afghanistan and who face threats as a  result of their service to apply for refuge in the United States. As I  said, this has had strong bipartisan support. I have worked with  Senators McCain, Tillis, Leahy, Graham, and so many others here in the  Chamber to try to make sure we provide enough visas for those Afghans  who are being threatened and who want to come to the United States.   I wish to point out that the Trump administration, even as it has  sharply restricted immigration and refugee programs, has made  exceptions for those who served alongside our soldiers and diplomats.  In fact, when the administration's original Executive order on  immigration was released, there was bipartisan anger that Iraqi  interpreters were not protected because this program has served not  just those in Afghanistan who have helped us but also those in Iraq. So  the administration recognized its mistake and has made an exception for  Iraqi SIV recipients, and now they have exempted Iraq from their  Executive order.   It is really past time that we rally renewed support for the Afghan  SIV Program. Last week, we learned that the State Department has  stopped interviewing applicants for the Afghan program because there  are more applicants in the final stages of the process than there are  visas. Unless Congress acts, the final visas will be exhausted by the  end of May. It is estimated that more than 10,000 applicants are still  in some step of the process of obtaining these visas.   For these Afghans, it really is no exaggeration to say that this is a  matter of life and death. Interpreters who served the U.S. mission are  being systematically hunted down by the Taliban, and unless Congress  acts, this program will lapse and we will abandon these Afghans to a  harsh fate.   The United States promised to protect those Afghans who served our  mission with great loyalty and at enormous risk, and it would be a  stain on our national honor to break this promise. It would also carry  profound strategic costs. U.S. forces and diplomats have always relied  on local people to help us accomplish our missions. We continue to  require this assistance in Afghanistan, and we will need this support  in other places in the future where we face conflict. So we have to  ask, if we don't keep our promise, why would anyone agree to help the  United States if we abandon those who assist us? This is exactly why  the former commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, GEN David Petraeus,  and his predecessor, GEN Stanley McChrystal, have pleaded with Congress  to extend the Afghan SIV Program. In a letter to Congress last year,  more than 30 additional prominent generals, including Gen. John Allen,  the former commander in Afghanistan, GEN George Casey, the former  commander in Iraq, and two former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  also urged Congress to extend the program.   In addition, our soldiers and marines are keenly interested in  protecting the interpreters who served with them in Afghanistan. Many  of them owe their lives to the interpreters who went into combat with  them. In recent years, I have gotten to know one of those servicemen, a  former Army captain, Michael Breen, who is a Granite Stater. He served  with the infantry in Iraq and led paratroopers in Afghanistan. He  speaks with admiration about one interpreter in particular who was an  Iraqi--part of the Iraqi program--a woman in her early twenties who was  named Wissam.   On one occasion, Captain Breen and his soldiers were at a small  forward operating base in Iraq. He said that a man approached,  frantically pointing to his watch and indicating an explosion with his  hands. The Americans didn't speak Arabic, so they couldn't tell if the  man was trying to warn them or threaten them. Wissam hurried over  toward Captain Breen to assist. Wissam was beloved by her American  comrades, always cheerful and eager to help. She listened to the man  and said that he was actually there warning of an improvised explosive  device on the main road.   As Captain Breen later told me, ``A trusted interpreter can be the  difference between a successful patrol and a body bag.'' He noted that  every night, he and his fellow soldiers would hunker down in their  heavily guarded perimeter, but Wissam would leave the compound and go  home. One evening after she left the American compound, three gunmen  ambushed her car. She was killed--one more interpreter who paid  [[Page S1843]]  the ultimate price for serving the American mission. As Captain Breen  later said, one day there will be a granite monument with the names of  all of the American servicemembers who died in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Wissam deserves to have her name on that monument, too, because she  took great risks and she gave her life while serving the United States.   To be eligible for a visa through the Afghan SIV Program, new  applicants must demonstrate at least 2 years of faithful and valuable  service to the U.S. mission. To receive a visa, they must also clear a  rigorous screening process that includes an independent verification of  their service and then an intensive interagency review.   We know that the service of these individuals has been critical to  our successes in Afghanistan.   Last month in Keene, NH, I met with a remarkable recent immigrant  from Afghanistan named Patmana Rafiq Kunary. Patmana had worked closely  with the U.S. Agency for International Development in Kabul. She went  door to door, encouraging women to take out microloans to start their  own businesses. Patmana eventually became vice president for operations  at the USAID-sponsored Microloan Program.   In fact, just today I talked to a woman reporter from Afghanistan who  wanted to know what message of hope I could provide to the women of  Afghanistan. Well, I told her about Patmana, and I told her that one of  the things that keep us in Afghanistan supporting our soldiers is  concern about what is happening to the women in Afghanistan.   For Patmana, going door to door and working closely with Americans-- this was dangerous work. She drew unwelcome attention wherever she  went, and she became a high-profile target for the Taliban and others.  And then one day in 2013, she got a call at her USAID office. It was  from the distraught wife of one of her USAID colleagues, another  Afghan. The caller's husband had just been murdered, apparently in  retaliation for his work with the Americans.   Realizing that her life was in danger, too, Patmana applied for a  special immigrant visa. For 2 years, she and her husband were subjected  to repeated interviews at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Her background was  checked and rechecked before visas were finally granted. She told me  that they would move frequently. They couldn't stay in one place very  long because the Taliban would find them. And she said occasionally  there was a knock on her relatives' door, saying ``We know where  Patmana is,'' and that would be a signal to move.   She and her husband now live happily in Keene, NH. I am pleased to  say her husband has found work as an auditor with a local financial  company, and they have a 2-year-old daughter. They are welcomed as  valued members of the Keene community and of our larger Granite State  family.   The many contributions of these Afghans--both in Afghanistan and now  as residents or citizens of the United States--those contributions help  explain why senior U.S. commanders and diplomats have urged Congress to  extend the Afghan SIV Program. Our Secretary of Defense, GEN James  Mattis, during the confirmation process, said: ``Most of our units  could not have accomplished their missions without the assistance,  often at the risk of their lives, of these courageous men and women.''   We would never leave an American warrior behind on the battlefield.  Likewise, we must not leave behind the Afghan interpreters who served  side by side with our warriors and diplomats.   We made a solemn promise to these brave people, and I am going to do  everything I can to ensure that we keep this promise. I know there is a  lot of bipartisan support in this body to do that. So today I am  introducing the Keep Our Promise to Our Afghan Allies Act with Senators  McCain, Reed, and Tillis. This legislation would authorize additional  special immigrant visas and would help ensure that the program does not  lapse and leave behind thousands of Afghans who helped us with the  threat by the Taliban.   In addition, I intend to work closely with Senators who are  negotiating legislation to fund the Federal Government in order to  ensure that additional visas are included. I urge my colleagues to join  me. Let's keep the promise we made to our Afghan allies and support  these efforts.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Brown, Mr. Markey, Mr. Cardin,          Mr. Casey, and Mr. Van Hollen):   S. 640.

A bill to provide for media coverage of Federal court  proceedings; to the Committee on the Judiciary.    Mr. President, I come to the floor again today to speak  about a program I have been working on that has had bipartisan support  for a number of years; that is, the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa  Program. This program allows Afghans, including interpreters, who have  supported the U.S. mission in Afghanistan and who face threats as a  result of their service to apply for refuge in the United States. As I  said, this has had strong bipartisan support. I have worked with  Senators McCain, Tillis, Leahy, Graham, and so many others here in the  Chamber to try to make sure we provide enough visas for those Afghans  who are being threatened and who want to come to the United States.   I wish to point out that the Trump administration, even as it has  sharply restricted immigration and refugee programs, has made  exceptions for those who served alongside our soldiers and diplomats.  In fact, when the administration's original Executive order on  immigration was released, there was bipartisan anger that Iraqi  interpreters were not protected because this program has served not  just those in Afghanistan who have helped us but also those in Iraq. So  the administration recognized its mistake and has made an exception for  Iraqi SIV recipients, and now they have exempted Iraq from their  Executive order.   It is really past time that we rally renewed support for the Afghan  SIV Program. Last week, we learned that the State Department has  stopped interviewing applicants for the Afghan program because there  are more applicants in the final stages of the process than there are  visas. Unless Congress acts, the final visas will be exhausted by the  end of May. It is estimated that more than 10,000 applicants are still  in some step of the process of obtaining these visas.   For these Afghans, it really is no exaggeration to say that this is a  matter of life and death. Interpreters who served the U.S. mission are  being systematically hunted down by the Taliban, and unless Congress  acts, this program will lapse and we will abandon these Afghans to a  harsh fate.   The United States promised to protect those Afghans who served our  mission with great loyalty and at enormous risk, and it would be a  stain on our national honor to break this promise. It would also carry  profound strategic costs. U.S. forces and diplomats have always relied  on local people to help us accomplish our missions. We continue to  require this assistance in Afghanistan, and we will need this support  in other places in the future where we face conflict. So we have to  ask, if we don't keep our promise, why would anyone agree to help the  United States if we abandon those who assist us? This is exactly why  the former commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, GEN David Petraeus,  and his predecessor, GEN Stanley McChrystal, have pleaded with Congress  to extend the Afghan SIV Program. In a letter to Congress last year,  more than 30 additional prominent generals, including Gen. John Allen,  the former commander in Afghanistan, GEN George Casey, the former  commander in Iraq, and two former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  also urged Congress to extend the program.   In addition, our soldiers and marines are keenly interested in  protecting the interpreters who served with them in Afghanistan. Many  of them owe their lives to the interpreters who went into combat with  them. In recent years, I have gotten to know one of those servicemen, a  former Army captain, Michael Breen, who is a Granite Stater. He served  with the infantry in Iraq and led paratroopers in Afghanistan. He  speaks with admiration about one interpreter in particular who was an  Iraqi--part of the Iraqi program--a woman in her early twenties who was  named Wissam.   On one occasion, Captain Breen and his soldiers were at a small  forward operating base in Iraq. He said that a man approached,  frantically pointing to his watch and indicating an explosion with his  hands. The Americans didn't speak Arabic, so they couldn't tell if the  man was trying to warn them or threaten them. Wissam hurried over  toward Captain Breen to assist. Wissam was beloved by her American  comrades, always cheerful and eager to help. She listened to the man  and said that he was actually there warning of an improvised explosive  device on the main road.   As Captain Breen later told me, ``A trusted interpreter can be the  difference between a successful patrol and a body bag.'' He noted that  every night, he and his fellow soldiers would hunker down in their  heavily guarded perimeter, but Wissam would leave the compound and go  home. One evening after she left the American compound, three gunmen  ambushed her car. She was killed--one more interpreter who paid  [[Page S1843]]  the ultimate price for serving the American mission. As Captain Breen  later said, one day there will be a granite monument with the names of  all of the American servicemembers who died in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Wissam deserves to have her name on that monument, too, because she  took great risks and she gave her life while serving the United States.   To be eligible for a visa through the Afghan SIV Program, new  applicants must demonstrate at least 2 years of faithful and valuable  service to the U.S. mission. To receive a visa, they must also clear a  rigorous screening process that includes an independent verification of  their service and then an intensive interagency review.   We know that the service of these individuals has been critical to  our successes in Afghanistan.   Last month in Keene, NH, I met with a remarkable recent immigrant  from Afghanistan named Patmana Rafiq Kunary. Patmana had worked closely  with the U.S. Agency for International Development in Kabul. She went  door to door, encouraging women to take out microloans to start their  own businesses. Patmana eventually became vice president for operations  at the USAID-sponsored Microloan Program.   In fact, just today I talked to a woman reporter from Afghanistan who  wanted to know what message of hope I could provide to the women of  Afghanistan. Well, I told her about Patmana, and I told her that one of  the things that keep us in Afghanistan supporting our soldiers is  concern about what is happening to the women in Afghanistan.   For Patmana, going door to door and working closely with Americans-- this was dangerous work. She drew unwelcome attention wherever she  went, and she became a high-profile target for the Taliban and others.  And then one day in 2013, she got a call at her USAID office. It was  from the distraught wife of one of her USAID colleagues, another  Afghan. The caller's husband had just been murdered, apparently in  retaliation for his work with the Americans.   Realizing that her life was in danger, too, Patmana applied for a  special immigrant visa. For 2 years, she and her husband were subjected  to repeated interviews at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul. Her background was  checked and rechecked before visas were finally granted. She told me  that they would move frequently. They couldn't stay in one place very  long because the Taliban would find them. And she said occasionally  there was a knock on her relatives' door, saying ``We know where  Patmana is,'' and that would be a signal to move.   She and her husband now live happily in Keene, NH. I am pleased to  say her husband has found work as an auditor with a local financial  company, and they have a 2-year-old daughter. They are welcomed as  valued members of the Keene community and of our larger Granite State  family.   The many contributions of these Afghans--both in Afghanistan and now  as residents or citizens of the United States--those contributions help  explain why senior U.S. commanders and diplomats have urged Congress to  extend the Afghan SIV Program. Our Secretary of Defense, GEN James  Mattis, during the confirmation process, said: ``Most of our units  could not have accomplished their missions without the assistance,  often at the risk of their lives, of these courageous men and women.''   We would never leave an American warrior behind on the battlefield.  Likewise, we must not leave behind the Afghan interpreters who served  side by side with our warriors and diplomats.   We made a solemn promise to these brave people, and I am going to do  everything I can to ensure that we keep this promise. I know there is a  lot of bipartisan support in this body to do that. So today I am  introducing the Keep Our Promise to Our Afghan Allies Act with Senators  McCain, Reed, and Tillis. This legislation would authorize additional  special immigrant visas and would help ensure that the program does not  lapse and leave behind thousands of Afghans who helped us with the  threat by the Taliban.   In addition, I intend to work closely with Senators who are  negotiating legislation to fund the Federal Government in order to  ensure that additional visas are included. I urge my colleagues to join  me. Let's keep the promise we made to our Afghan allies and support  these efforts.                                  ______
