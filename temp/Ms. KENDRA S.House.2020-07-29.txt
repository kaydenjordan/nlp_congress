 HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Scott  for allowing me to speak on this critical issue.   I rise in strong support of the Child Care Is Essential Act and am  grateful for the inclusion of my bill, the Children's Mental Health  Care Access Act.   Quality, affordable childcare is critical, not only for children and  families across the country, but investing in the physical health and  safety of our children as well as the mental health of our children is  critical.   After months of social isolation, disrupted schedules, and an  environment that has created stress, uncertainty, and anxiety for  families, children are included in this. I introduced the Children's  Mental Health Care Access Act to provide mental health services at  childcare facilities through the Child Care and Development Block  Grant.   Before the COVID-19 pandemic, a 2019 study showed that 16.5 percent  of American children experience mental health issues, and fewer than  half receive treatment. My bill ensures that caregivers have a support  system and are prepared with evidence-based and trauma-informed  solutions to help our children.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful my bill is included, and I urge support of  the Child Care Is Essential Act.
