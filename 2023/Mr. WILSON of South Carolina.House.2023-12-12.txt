 Mr. Speaker, I have warned over 110  times that the global war on terrorism is not over with appeasement in  Afghanistan leading to terrorist attacks on American families with  Biden open borders.   The threat is clear. We see the shocking number of trained, well- financed mass murderers invading America, this year reaching 169.  Ukraine was invaded, then Israel was invaded. Now America invaded.   House Republicans addressed the border issue earlier this year with  the Secure Borders Act, blocked by Senate Democrats. It promotes  restarting wall construction, advancing technology, adding border  patrol, ending catch and release, and reversing executive authorities.   Each Congressional office has a rally point in the event of an  attack.   I urge all families to plan a rally point. Communications may be  disrupted, and every family member should know where to gather for  safety before the roads are closed.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years. It is sadly clear, there will be more 9/11  attacks across America, imminent as the FBI has finally revealed last  week.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman  Marcy Kaptur for her leadership in promoting the bipartisan remarks  tonight, which reinforce what former Chairman  Greg Meeks has already  stated, and that is that there is  [[Page H6846]]  overwhelming bipartisan support, Democrats and Republicans, for the  people of Ukraine as they will achieve victory over war criminal Putin.   I support the supplemental with clear consistency. There should be  security for all borders--American borders, Ukrainian borders, Israeli  borders, and Taiwanese borders--to achieve peace through strength to  prevent global conflict.   On February 24, 2022, war criminal Putin launched a full-scale mass  murderous invasion of sovereign, democratic Ukraine, claiming Ukraine  does not exist. Patriotic Ukrainians, even grandmothers, raced to arm  themselves and protect their land and families.   The world underestimated the resolve of Ukrainians. I was in Kyiv in  December 2021, prior to war criminal Putin's murderous invasion, when  the planning for resistance and guerilla warfare was anticipated to be  overwhelmed. Ukraine valiantly fought back for freedom and proved the  world wrong.    I visited again in May of this year and saw firsthand courageous  Ukrainians led by the very courageous Volodymyr Zelenskyy.   Ukrainians are the front line in a conflict we did not choose as  dictators with rule of gun invade democracies with rule of law. The  axis of evil fights first for the death of Ukraine and then the death  of Israel, and then they chant ``death to America.''   All Americans should know that we have a treaty obligation to support  the territorial integrity of Ukraine. In 1994, with the signing of the  Budapest Memorandum between the United States, the United Kingdom, and  the Russian Federation, Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange  for security guarantees and territorial integrity.   A consequence now, sadly, is that other countries will not give up  nuclear weapon capabilities because Russia violates every treaty it  signs.   It is not realistic to believe that any peace can be achieved without  full Ukrainian victory, which is territorial integrity.   I appreciate that President Donald Trump worked to avoid the war  criminal Putin invasion by providing Javelin missiles to Ukraine,  placing American troops in Poland, and stopping the Nord Stream II  pipeline, which financed the dictatorship in Moscow.   Just as America would fight for territorial integrity, as there is no  State that we would abandon, there is no State that would abandon a  county.   We know that appeasement to invaders would actually promote something  warned by Speaker Mike Johnson. Speaker Johnson states that Putin would  continue his deranged dream of a resurrected Soviet Union, threatening  Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, and NATO members Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,  and Poland, along with all the countries of Central Asia.   The Republican tradition has been bipartisan for peace through  strength with Eisenhower-Nixon, reinforced by Barry Goldwater and: Why  not victory over communism? He also explained the alternative of  victory is defeat. Then there was the ultimate Ronald Reagan expression  to our enemies: ``We win. You lose.''   This is why it is so critical that we commit today to protecting the  borders of America, Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan for peace through  strength.
