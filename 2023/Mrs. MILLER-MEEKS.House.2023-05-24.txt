 Madam Chair, I thank my colleague for yielding  time.   Madam Chair, I rise today in support of HALT Fentanyl Act introduced  by my friends and colleagues, Morgan Griffith and  Bob Latta.   The fentanyl crisis is ravaging our Nation, and there is no question  this dangerous drug and its analogues should be scheduled. Fentanyl  accounts for roughly 150 overdose deaths per day, and the number of  deaths caused by fentanyl and other synthetic opioids is growing  exponentially each year.   The HALT Fentanyl Act would permanently schedule fentanyl-related  substances and provide law enforcement with the tools needed to keep  these lethal drugs off our streets.   Should the temporary classwide scheduling expire, drug traffickers  would be empowered to ramp up their operations without fear or  repercussions. At our border, U.S. Customs and Border Protection would  lose the authority to seize these substances, and the amount of drugs  coming into our country would skyrocket.   It is hard to imagine the border crisis becoming worse than it  already is, but should this scheduling expire, I am afraid the crisis  would escalate even further.   As a physician and the former director of the Iowa Department of  Public Health under whose purview substance use disorder and drug  addiction failed, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle neglect  to acknowledge a vast majority of people affected by this are not drug  addicts. One pill can kill.   Furthermore, news flash: This bill doesn't hamper any legal medical  use of fentanyl. Fentanyl is not only more deadly than cocaine or  morphine or heroin, it is significantly easier to produce and can be  sold for 100 times more than it costs to make. Bad actors will always  take advantage of bad situations, and this is no exception.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill to  protect our most vulnerable populations and keep fentanyl and its  analogues off the street.
