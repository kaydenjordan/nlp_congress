 Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the majority leader for yielding.   As the majority leader knows, we have 9 days remaining under the  present schedule. I understand that an extension of that to the 22nd  may be contemplated, but we have 9 legislative days remaining.   The gentleman has now just indicated that we are going to be voting  on Monday. I would join the gentleman in urging every Member to be  present on Monday. We are going to be casting very consequential votes  over the next few days. Whether we are voting on them in a timely  fashion or not, they will all be critically important, so I would urge  all my Members to be here.   We have much that needs to be done in the days that remain, as the  gentleman knows.   I want to raise two issues. Obviously the gentleman has indicated  that we are going to vote to go to conference on the tax bill if the  Senate passes the tax bill.   In addition to that, of course, there are two major pieces of  legislation and, frankly, many more, and I am not referring to,  obviously, the omnibus or a CR so that we can keep the government  funded, which everybody on this side of the aisle and I am sure  everybody on that side of the aisle wants to do. I hope we are able to  keep the government funded in a nondramatic way.   But as I have indicated to the majority leader on numerous occasions,  we feel very strongly, as the gentleman knows--and we have had positive  discussions on this--that we need to also pass before the end of the  year--and many of my friend's Members have raised that issue as well  and urged that we pass before the end of the year a resolution for the  children who were brought here as minors, some as young as 1 or 2 years  of age and who know no other country but the United States of America,  that we resolve their status  [[Page H9537]]  before the end of the year so they do not continue to twist in the wind  and agonize about whether they are going to be sent to a place they do  not know and they do not perceive as their country. They perceive  themselves to be American. So I would hope that we can deal with that.   In addition, my friend and I have had a discussion--there has been  much over the last 11 months--about healthcare. I think one of the  things that I think the gentleman and I agree on in a bipartisan way is  that we all believe that the children of our country ought to have  assurance of access to affordable, quality healthcare.   We passed the CHIP bill through the House. As the gentleman knows, it  was passed not in a bipartisan way. It sits now in the Senate and has  not moved yet in the Senate. I would hope that those two issues at the  very least--and there are many others, including the fiscal bills and  the omnibus--that need to be moved. I would hope, whether we are 9 days  or 13 days, however many days that we have remaining, that those two  issues in addition to others will be resolved before we leave.   I thank the gentleman for his announcement and giving us a heads-up  about Monday, but I would hope that we would also in the few days that  remain to us work very hard to try to get those issues and others  resolved before we leave for the year.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to say to my friend, the majority  leader, with all due respect we raise a lot of heat in this town.  Unfortunately, on the cusp of a meeting that was convened to try to  reach some agreements on very important issues to the American people,  the heat was raised very, very substantially by the President of the  United States. That was unfortunate.   Anybody who thinks that the heat wasn't raised and was saying that  there was not going to be a deal I think is incorrect.   But that is not why I asked for the 1 minute. Why I asked for the 1  minute is, Mr. Speaker, the American people are relying on us to come  together and agree on things they know are very important to them:  their families, their community, and their country.   Let us not accuse one another back and forth of bad faith, and let's  lower the heat and let's try to get that work done.    The gentleman wouldn't yield to me, but I am glad to yield  to him.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
