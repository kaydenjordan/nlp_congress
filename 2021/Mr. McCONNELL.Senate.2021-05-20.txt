 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, we know that competition with China  will shape America's security and prosperity for decades to come. That  is a fact. The legislation on the floor purports to deal with this  issue. It covers a huge range of topics, from economics to education,  to foreign and defense policy. Earlier this week, I voted with the  majority of Senators to proceed to this important debate, but as  Members have noted, this bill did not come out of committee quite ready  for prime time. It needs thorough floor consideration, with a robust,  bipartisan amendment process.    Today, we will vote on a very important amendment that I will be  proud to support. Ranking Member Inhofe and Vice Chairman Shelby have  legislation that will return the pivotal issue of the funding of our  national defense to the center of the conversation about competing with  China, and this is right where it belongs.   All the soft power in the world will only benefit us as long as we  have the hard power to back it up. We must maintain our military edge  against China and Russia. Yet, for all of this talk about competing  with China, the Biden administration's budget proposal seeks to cut  defense spending after inflation.   China's long-term military investments are paying dividends that  really should alarm us, but Democrats want to pump the brakes on our  own? Fewer resources for our own men and women in uniform? Less defense  innovation? What sense does that make?   If there is truly broad bipartisan support for taking our competition  with China more seriously, there ought to be big bipartisan support for  the Inhofe-Shelby amendment later today.   (Mr. HICKENLOOPER assumed the Chair.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, our Nation's  southern border is still in crisis. The Biden administration still  won't admit it. Much of the media would prefer not to cover it, but the  facts are clear, and they are unacceptable.   A few days ago, Customs and Border Protection issued its report on  the month of April. The number of encounters with illegal entrants was  3 percent  [[Page S3175]]  higher in April than it was in March. The crisis is still growing.  Encounters with single adults on the border were 613 percent higher  last month versus April of last year, when the Trump administration put  emergency measures in place. Encounters with unaccompanied children  were up 2,217 percent year over year. Let me say that one more time:  2,217 percent more kids, without parents, at our border on President  Biden's watch.   The administration has tried to boast that the number of  unaccompanied kids in the custody of the Department of Homeland  Security has gone down. It has. It is because they have transferred  large numbers of kids from DHS to HHS. There are now more than 19,000  children in the custody of Health and Human Services, and hundreds more  are arriving every single day.   We know why all of this is happening. When Washington Democrats spent  years reciting the mantra ``Abolish ICE; abolish ICE,'' people  listened. When our new President spent his campaign signaling he would  support a weaker border when he expressed that he supported providing  government healthcare to people here illegally, people actually took  note. Now the Democrats cannot get control of the crisis that they have  stoked.   The Vice President--supposedly, the point person to fix illegal  immigration--has yet to even visit the southern border.   Apparently, Secretary Becerra's operation at HHS has, in some  instances, left migrant children stranded on buses for multiple days-- exactly the kind of unacceptable mismanagement that Senate Republicans  feared we might see under an HHS Secretary without relevant healthcare  or management experience. Last week, HHS announced it would be taking  money that was meant to replenish the Strategic National Stockpile-- money to fight this pandemic and future pandemics--to help with the  migrant crisis.   Well, today, the Senate will consider another amendment from the  senior Senator from Wisconsin. It would stop the Biden administration  from canceling contracts that are already in place to build a wall on  our southern border. Perhaps our Democratic colleagues will help us  begin to address the border crisis this administration has caused.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on a completely different matter,  as Democrats have pushed their massive political takeover bill, S. 1,  Americans' First Amendment rights and privacy rights have been thrust  into center stage. The legislation contains multiple elements that  would chill Americans' exercise of free speech and let Washington  bureaucrats hoard more of citizens' private information without cause.  We know exactly how this could go wrong.   Remember President Obama's IRS scandal? Unelected bureaucrats treated  organizations differently and subjected Americans to unequal scrutiny  depending on their beliefs. Nonprofits with a whiff--just a whiff--of  conservative beliefs were slow-walked and singled out for unfair  treatment. Or think back to 2014. The Obama administration had to reach  a settlement after a government worker leaked confidential information  about a conservative group, which was in violation of Federal law.  Unsurprisingly, those private details found their way to a liberal  group that had plenty of ideas about what to do with them.   Courts have found that the State of California has repeatedly leaked  or inappropriately released confidential information about nonprofits'  donors. Last year, in remembering all of these incidents, the Treasury  Department finalized action on a basic, commonsense principle: If there  is no legitimate reason for the IRS to have certain information, then  the IRS shouldn't collect it.   It makes sense.   The prior administration had the IRS stop the blanket collection of  nonpublic information about citizens who make non---I repeat, non--- tax-deductible contributions to certain organizations. Contributions to  501(c)(4) organizations are not tax deductible. The IRS doesn't need  these details just for kicks and giggles, but now the Democrats'  politica takeover bills would roll back this step and open new fronts  in the far-left war on privacy and free speech.    S. 1 would narrow the protections of the First Amendment. It would  empower the Feds with new authority to track and police the speech of  Americans. This is the same bill that would essentially make Washington  Democrats the board of elections for every county and State in America.  I guess, somehow, maybe, that wasn't enough.   Well, I have worked with my colleague from Indiana, Senator Braun, on  legislation to nip one part of this nonsense right in the bud. Our bill  would codify the rule issued by the last administration. Americans  would remain free from a Federal dragnet collecting private information  that it neither needs nor uses for legitimate law enforcement  purposes--information that can be mishandled or, worse, used to target  and harass Americans based on their views.   So I am proud to stand with Senator Braun, with 39 Republican  cosponsors, and with citizens across America, across the political  spectrum, who don't need the IRS peering into their First Amendment  activities any more than is strictly necessary. I would certainly urge  all of our colleagues to support our simple bill.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, my Senate office  is losing a talented and dedicated young staffer this week.  Fortunately, he has just been on loan from his home State--our home  State--all along, and he is now heading back to the Bluegrass.   Kevin Grout started with me 5 years ago. This bright, sharp, and  cheerful, young McConnell Scholar from the University of Louisville  began as a staff assistant in the mailroom or, you might say, as sort  of my ``body man.'' But in this line of work, talent attracts  responsibility. Before long, Kevin had graduated to serve as the  speechwriter in my personal office. In 4\1/2\ years, he has helped me  craft more remarks, op-eds, and written statements than any of us could  possibly count--almost all focused on issues that matter most to  Kentuckians.   We are sorry to lose Kevin's talents here on the team, but Kevin and  his wife Addie are taking their careers and their young son Henry and  putting down roots where it all began. Washington will be sorry to see  them go, but it will be Kentucky's good fortune to welcome him back.                            ____________________
