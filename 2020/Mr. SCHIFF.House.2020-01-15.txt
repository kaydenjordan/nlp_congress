 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  resolution.   The task before us is a grave one, but one demanded by our oath.   The impeachment inquiry undertaken by the House of Representatives  found that President Donald J. Trump abused his power and sought to  cover it up with an unprecedented campaign of obstruction.   He withheld hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars in vital military  aid to Ukraine, a close ally at war with Russia, and withheld a coveted  White House meeting critical to the Ukrainian leader's international  legitimacy until Ukraine would commit to help President Trump cheat-- cheat--in the next election.   President Trump put his own personal interests above the national  interests, above our national security, and, if not stopped, he will do  it again.   For that reason, he was impeached. And for that reason, the House  managers will take the case to the Senate and to the American people,  because the appropriate remedy--indeed, the only remedy--is the  conviction and removal from office of President Donald Trump.
