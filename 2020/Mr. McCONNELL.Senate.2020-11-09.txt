 Mr. President, last week record numbers of Americans  exercised the right which generations risked everything to hand on to  us. I want to spend a few minutes this morning talking about what we  saw last week, where we are now, and where our great country will go  from here.   There is one aspect of last week that has gotten lost that I want to  single out right at the start. By every indication, the 2020 election  appears to be have been free from meaningful foreign interference.  There is no suggestion that our foreign adversaries were allowed to  undermine the integrity of our process.   According to the Director of the Cyber Security and Infrastructure  Security Administration, ``we have no''--no--``evidence any foreign  adversary was capable of preventing Americans from voting or changing  vote tallies.''   GEN Paul Nakasone, the head of the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command  reported Tuesday night, ``The actions we have taken against adversaries  . . . have ensured they're not going to interfere in our elections.''   The Trump administration and the Senate spent 4 years supporting the  State and local election authorities on the frontlines: new tools and  information-sharing partnerships; unprecedented coordination; hundreds  of millions in new funding; new, painful consequences for bad actors,  like Russia, if they interfere.   The absence of any reports of foreign interference is a ringing  endorsement--a ringing endorsement--of our bipartisan work, and it  slams the door on the embarrassing, irresponsible rhetoric that some  Washington Democrats spent 4 years broadcasting.   Too many voices tried to talk down our progress, urged Americans  actually not to have confidence, and smeared anyone as unpatriotic who  opposed far-left proposals to rewrite election laws.   Well, the people who pushed this hysteria could not have more egg on  their face than they do right now. None of their demands became law-- none of them. The Speaker of the House did not get to personally  rewrite election law. And yet, because of the sensible, bipartisan  steps that some of us championed, our defenses and countermeasures  proved to be in radically better shape than back in 2016.   So let's talk about where we are now. According to preliminary  results, voters across the Nation elected and reelected Republican  Senators to a degree that actually stunned prognosticators. Likewise,  the American people seemed to have reacted to House Democrats'  radicalism and obstruction by shrinking the Speaker's majority and  electing more Republicans.   And then there is the Presidential race. Obviously, no States have  yet certified their election results. We have at least one or two  States that are already on track for a recount, and I believe the  President may have legal challenges underway in at least five States.   The core principle here is not complicated. In the United States of  America, all legal ballots must be counted, any illegal ballots must  not be counted, the process should be transparent or observable by all  sides, and the courts are here to work through concerns.   Our institutions are actually built for this. We have the system in  place to consider concerns, and President Trump is 100 percent within  his rights to look into allegations of irregularities and weigh his  legal options.   Let's go back 20 years ago. Twenty years ago, when Florida came down  to a very thin margin, we saw Vice President Gore exhaust the legal  system and wait to concede until December.   More recently, weeks after the media had ``called'' President Bush's  reelection in 2004, Democrats baselessly disputed Ohio's electors and  delayed the process here in Congress.   In 2016 election laws saw recounts or legal challenges in several  States.   If any major irregularities occurred this time of a magnitude that  would affect the outcome, then every single American should want them  to be brought to light. And if the Democrats feel confident they have  not occurred, they should have no reason to fear any extra scrutiny.   We have the tools and institutions we need to address any concerns.  The President has every right to look into allegations and to request  recounts under the law, and, notably, the Constitution gives no role in  this process to wealthy media corporations.   The projections and commentary of the press do not get veto power  over the legal rights of any citizen, including the President of the  United States.   Now, more broadly, let's not have any lectures--no lectures--about  how the President should immediately, cheerfully accept preliminary  election results, from the same characters who just spent 4 years  refusing to accept the validity of the last election, and who  insinuated that this one would be illegitimate too, if they lost  again--only if they lost. So let's have no lectures on this subject  from that contingent.   In late August, Secretary Hillary Clinton said: ``Joe Biden should  not concede under any circumstances . . . I think this is going to drag  out, and . . . he will win it if we don't give an inch.''   That same month, Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leader both  stated: ``[President Trump] needs to cheat to win.''   In October, when Speaker Pelosi was shopping some conspiracy theory  about the Postal Service, she recklessly said--listen to this: ``I have  no doubt that the president . . . will lie, cheat, and steal, to win  this election.''   Now, does this sound like the chorus that has any credibility  whatsoever to say a few legal challenges from President Trump represent  some kind of crisis?   At this time last week, small business owners in cities across  America were boarding up their windows in case President Trump appeared  to win and far-left mobs decided to reprise their summer rioting.   Suffice it to say, a few legal inquiries from the President do not  exactly spell the end of the Republic.   Here is how two professors from Fordham Law School and New York Law  School put it: ``For centuries, we have asked people who are unhappy  with their fellow citizens or government agencies and institutions to  bring their claims to court.'' President Trump's is ``a traditional  response that affirms rather than undermines American institutions.''   This process will reach its resolution. Our system will resolve any  recounts  [[Page S6617]]  or litigation. In January, the winner of this election will place his  hand on a Bible, just like it has happened every 4 years since 1793.   What we know for sure is that the outcome is guaranteed to delight  tens of millions of Americans and disappoint tens of millions of  Americans. But we also know that we will wake up on January 21, still  blessed to live in the greatest Nation the world has ever seen. And in  no small part, that is because we respect the rule of law, we trust our  institutions, and neither of those things is outweighed by  pronouncements from partisans or the press.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning  business, with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes  each.    Madam President, I understand there are three bills at  the desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceeding en bloc.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 12 noon, Tuesday,  November 10; further, following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour  be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, and  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day  and morning business be closed; further, following leader remarks, the  Senate proceed to executive session and resume consideration of the  Knepp nomination and recess until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly  conference meetings. Finally, notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate  vote on confirmation of the nomination at 2:15 p.m. and, if confirmed,  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:50 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, November 10, 2020, at 12 noon.                            ____________________
