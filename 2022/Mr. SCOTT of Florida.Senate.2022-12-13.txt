 Mr. President, I would like to thank my  colleague from South Carolina for all of his work to promote school  choice. I have been proud to partner with him each year to cosponsor  the National School Choice Week resolution and promote the maximum  amount of educational choice for parents.   Since I have been in Washington, I have noticed how many different  school options are available for families in the area: public schools,  charter schools, private schools, religious schools, home schools, co- ops. There are all kinds of options for parents and their children  here.   DC is an example of a place where school choice has helped everyone,  as government-funded schools have generally failed.   Of course, Washington, DC, is also where our Nation's political elite  and their children reside. It is where diplomats from around the world  come and send their kids to the school of their choice. Bureaucrats,  politicians, and wealthy parents have all the choice in the world to  send their kids to get a great education. But why should that choice  only be available to the elite political class? Why is it that teachers  unions and Democratic politicians want to fight school choice and keep  students from middle and lower income families in failing schools?   It is a perfect example of how the swamp works: They will give every  advantage to their own kids, while pushing the working class down. The  elites have always had school choice, and like my colleague from South  Carolina, I simply want to extend that choice to every family.  [[Page S7118]]    During my 8 years as Governor of Florida, I was a proud champion of  school choice and charter schools. I have long believed that parents,  not the government, know what is best for their children.   Near the end of my time as Governor, Florida had 653 charter schools  operating across our great State. More than one in four K-12 public  school kids in Florida chose a school other than the one that they were  assigned to.   We were ranked third in the Nation for our number of charter schools  and the number of students enrolled in our charter schools. That  competition helped everyone, including our public school system. When I  was leaving, we ranked fourth in the Nation for K-12 student  achievement. In other words, our push for maximum choice helped their  students in all of our schools get ahead.   That didn't happen overnight, of course. But we had to work at it.  For example, I worked to expand access to Florida's Tax Credit  Scholarship Program. This tax credit encourages voluntary contributions  from corporate donors to scholarship funding organizations. These  organizations then award scholarships to students from low-income  families so they can attend private schools or get help transporting  them to a public school in another school district.   During my 8 years, the number of kids benefiting from that  scholarship program grew from 40,000 to 108,000. Sixty thousand more  students were able to attend a school that better met their needs  because we gave them that choice.   Similarly, I signed legislation creating open enrollment in Florida.  That bill allowed more than 280,000 students to attend any public  school in the State regardless of their ZIP Code.   I also signed legislation to expand access to scholarships for  students with disabilities so they could attend a public or private  school of their choice.   I also signed a bill creating the Schools of Hope Program. It  established high-quality educational options for students attending  persistently low performing public schools.   Instead of attending the lower performing school, we drew in charter  school networks that had a proven track record for operating high- performing charter schools in underserved communities. Because we  offered them increased autonomy and flexibility and gave them access to  grants and low-interest facility loans, these charter schools were  better able to serve Florida's neediest students.   Add to that, I signed legislation to give every student access to  virtual learning, with 428,000 students taking advantage of that  program in the 2017-2018 school year. That number was up by 312,000  students compared to 10 years earlier.   Parents could use Florida Virtual School to supplement what was  happening in person at school, and they could use a hybrid setup with  home school or do completely online learning--whatever best suited  their child's needs.   In Florida, school choice isn't just for the elites, it is for  everyone because every family deserves the chance to send their child  to the school that best meets their needs. Whether it was virtual  school, a private school, a religious school, home school, a charter  school, or a public school in a different district, I fought to give  the kids the best opportunity to get a quality education.    And the best part about it, this kind of choice and competition among  schools benefited everyone. It helped all of our schools, including our  public schools and neighborhood schools, to improve.   In October, a team of researchers from Northwestern University, UC  Davis, and Emory studied the outcomes of Florida students who remained  in public schools in the 2016-2017 school year--the same time we were  continuing to expand school choice.   I will read you what they concluded.         We find broad and growing benefits for students at local       public schools as the school-choice program scales up.        In particular, students who attend neighborhood schools       with higher levels of market competition have lower rates of       suspensions and absences and higher test scores in reading       and math.        And while our analysis reveals gains for virtually all       students, we find that those most positively affected are       students with the greatest barriers to school success,       including those with low family incomes and less-educated       mothers.    In other words, school choice helps students of poor and working  class families, like the one I grew up in. I was born to a single mom  with an 11th grade education and never met my birth father. My adoptive  father never had more than a sixth grade education. We were poor and  didn't have much to brag about. We lived in public housing and moved  around a lot. But my mom pushed me to work hard in school and get a  good education. And by God's grace, I was able to live the American  dream. That is why I am here--because school choice shouldn't only be  for the elites, it should be for everyone.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, let me begin with a simple  question: When are we going to say enough?   The American people are saying it. Heck, even traditionally liberal,  mainstream news outlets are getting there.   But here in Congress, it is nothing but business as usual. We just  keep letting it pile up month after month, year after year. Now it is  burying our country.   The ``it'' should be obvious. I am talking about America's massive  Federal debt, now more than $31 trillion. It has grown by nearly $5  trillion since President Biden took office, and it was growing like a  weed before that too.   We should all be disgusted with the reckless spending in Washington  that has caused this massive debt.   Just look at what it is doing to our country. Historic inflation is  raging across America, hurting families and businesses, and pushing the  American Dream out of reach, as prices skyrocket and interest rates  follow closely behind.   Reckless spending approved by this Chamber and our colleagues in the  House has caused this.   I have been in the Senate for almost 4 years. In this time, I have  talked a lot about my childhood. Maybe you have heard my story of  someone who was born to a single mom, grew up poor, and lived in public  housing.   It is a hard place to start your life, and, today, folks in the same  situation are struggling more than ever to get by and make ends meet as  they deal with sky-high inflation. In most places across the world,  people who grow up like me have no hope of being anything but what they  were born into--for me, that was poor and watching my mom struggle  every day to get by. That is untrue in America.    This is the greatest Nation on Earth because a kid who grows up  watching their parents struggle and living in public housing can work  hard and be anything.   But that promise isn't guaranteed. We have to protect that by being  responsible with taxpayer money and not allowing inflation and debt to  ruin us.   Throughout my life, I have run businesses big and small, from a  couple of hundred employees to hundreds of thousands of employees. Here  is one thing that doesn't change no matter how big you get: If you  don't live within your means, you fail. Same goes for any family. No  family or business in any of our States gets to burn through money with  no consequences. The only place that has become acceptable is here in  Washington. Why? Because Congress stopped doing what it got elected to  do.   As I said, I have been in Washington for about 4 years now. One thing  I have learned is that in Washington, compromise means everyone gets  everything so nobody has to make a tough choice. The result is gross  fiscal mismanagement and unsustainable debt. Instead of standing up to  this broken status quo in Congress--something I think most of us ran  on--too many people get elected, come to Washington, and become a  rubber stamp for more spending.   So here we are again, just days away from a government funding  deadline. Some of our colleagues are again pushing a massive omnibus-- what we are calling the Pelosi-Schumer spending bill--which keeps this  inflation-bomb deficit spending going.   I asked earlier: When are we going to say ``enough?'' Will it be when  the deficit hits $35 trillion, $45 trillion, $50 trillion? Can you  imagine $50 trillion worth of debt? No. The answer has to be now. We  say enough is enough today. And we should start by saying no to a  massive omnibus spending bill and approving a simple continuing  resolution being offered by my good friend Senator Lee of Utah.   Doing this allows the new Congress to put together a real budget that  is balanced, which is what we should be doing anyway.   I don't like continuing resolutions any more than I think anyone here  does. Since my first day in the Senate, I have been vocal about needing  to pass a budget--a full budget--that is balanced and gets America's  finances in order. But that is not going to happen in the next 3 days  or before the next Congress begins, for that matter.   So the thought of passing a Pelosi-Schumer spending bill now, just  weeks before a new Republican majority takes power in the House, is  insane. It is as bad an idea as I have heard of up here.   It also goes against decades of precedent. As Senator Lee has said,  since 1954, control of the House has changed five times, and there has  never been an instance of Congress passing an omnibus spending bill  before a new House majority takes power.   Given that America is now in more debt than ever before and inflation  is the highest it has been in 40 years, why should we choose now to  break precedent and green-light more reckless spending?   And let's not forget what Democrats wish to do with the hard-earned  tax dollars of American families. The last time Democrats passed a  spending bill, they approved $80 billion so that the IRS can hire  87,000 new agents to target working families and small businesses.  Worse still, Democrats are now  [[Page S7127]]  forcing every American to report any transaction of $600 or more to the  IRS, giving the Federal Government unprecedented access into the  personal finances of American families. We can expect more of the same  from them now.   Maya Angelou was right when she said:         When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first       time.    Now, we just heard what our Democrat colleagues are saying in  objecting to this commonsense solution to avoid a government shutdown.  They are saying that our proposal will cut services. Passing the CR  into next year will not result in any cuts to funding or services; it  will simply continue government operations just as they are today.   Here is the deal. For too long, the failed and ridiculous thinking in  Washington has been that budgets don't matter and inflation doesn't  matter because voters will never tie wasteful spending to inflation.  The only way to get some things done is to shove them into a giant  spending bill negotiated in secret and pass it before anyone has any  time to read it. That is wrong, and the American public is disgusted  with this. It is not how any family or business operates.   In the real world, you make plans, you meet deadlines, you make  choices and live within your means, because failing to do so means  failing to survive and prosper.   Congress shouldn't be treated any differently. Congress has been  broken and unaccountable for too long.   I yield the floor.
