 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to give honor, along  with the members of the Georgia delegation, to my friend of  longstanding for almost 50 years, Mr. Thomas Dortch of Atlanta,  Georgia.   Thomas is a fine gentleman, a Fort Valley State University graduate,  a strong alumnus, a big supporter of the Fort Valley Foundation, and he  is a founder of the National Black College Alumni Hall of Fame  Foundation.   He is a stalwart, a pillar of the 100 Black Men of the United States,  and he has done so much for so many in mentoring youngsters.   Winston Churchill said, ``We make a living by what we get, but we  make a life by what we give.'' Tommy has given so much to so many for  so long, and we are so delighted to honor him and his legacy today.                            ____________________
