 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2359) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to submit  to Congress a report on the Department of Veterans Affairs advancing of  whole health transformation, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2359         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Whole Veteran Act''.       SEC. 2. REPORT ON DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS ADVANCING OF                     WHOLE HEALTH TRANSFORMATION.         (a) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs       shall submit to Congress a report on the implementation of       the Department of Veterans Affairs memorandum dated February       12, 2019, on the subject of Advancing Whole Health       Transformation Across Veterans Health Administration.        (b) Matters Included.--The report under subsection (a)       shall include the following:        (1) An analysis of the accessibility and availability of       each of the following services at medical facilities of the       Department of Veterans Affairs (including community based       outpatient clinics, vet centers, and community living       centers):        (A) Massage.        (B) Chiropractic services.        (C) Whole health clinician services.        (D) Whole health coaching.        (E) Acupuncture.        (F) Healing touch.        (G) Whole health group services.        (H) Guided imagery.        (I) Meditation.        (J) Hypnosis.        (K) Yoga.        (L) Tai chi or Qi gong.        (M) Equine assisted therapy.        (N) Any other service the Secretary determines appropriate.        (2) An assessment of the health outcomes derived from the       services specified in paragraph (1).        (3) An assessment of the resources required to expand such       services to the entire Veterans Health Administration.        (4) A plan to provide the services referred to in paragraph       (1) to veterans who reside in a geographic area where no       community-based outpatient clinic, medical center, Vet       Center, or community living center is located.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 2359.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, before I begin my comments on H.R. 2359, let me  acknowledge the centennial year of women's suffrage and the wonderful  yellow roses we are wearing in acknowledgment of that centennial year.  Happy 100th year to women's suffrage in America.   Madam Speaker, American healthcare systems are grappling with the  need to redesign the delivery of care model to better meet the needs of  veterans struggling with mental health conditions.   Two decades of increased social isolation, economic inequality, and  prohibitive healthcare costs have seen an increased use of  complementary and alternative medicine such as health coaching,  chiropractic services, acupuncture, yoga, meditation, and equine  therapy.   The Veterans Health Administration is one of the first healthcare  systems to redesign care with a focus on maintaining patient well-being  and early intervention, rather than a system designed to treat  conditions and diseases only after they have occurred.   This redesign, VA's whole health transformation, will accommodate the  veteran population and their unique needs while empowering veterans to  control their health and well-being.   By improving well-being, veterans build resiliency that assists in  the early intervention and identification of mental healthcare symptoms  that, left untreated, can advance to the point of crisis. In 2017, VA  launched the whole health transformation program at 18 flagship sites,  with positive early outcomes.   According to a February 2019 memo on VA's whole health  transformation, VA plans to expand the full program to an additional 18  sites by summer 2019, and 140 medical centers have elements of this  program.   The pace, efficacy, and reach of the whole health program are not  known to Congress. H.R. 2359, as amended, offered by Congressman Lamb,  requires the delivery of a report on VA's whole health transformation.  It will contain an analysis of the accessibility of critical services  so that Congress can better inform its efforts to ensure veterans are  treated as whole people and not just episodes of care. This is  particularly true for socially isolated veterans and veterans living  far away from a VA facility.   A two-pronged strategy is needed to effectively address the veteran  suicide public health crisis. The second prong is treating those  veterans in crisis and making treatment more accessible. The first  prong must address the complex set of social determinants that can lead  to a crisis.   Early interventions in mental healthcare can prevent veterans from  falling into crisis and having suicidal ideations. This legislation  falls under the first prong of the strategy, which will support  creating opportunities for early, pre-crisis intervention.   Congress must understand how VA has rolled out the initial expansion  outcomes and the resources needed to continue the whole health program.  This body must do everything in its power to reduce the number of  veteran suicides in this country because this is a sustained,  prolonged, and frustrating national public health crisis.   Sadly, over the weekend, yet another veteran died by suicide at a VA  Hospital.   This bill is the first of five measures we will consider today to  address mental healthcare and suicide prevention efforts at VA. Our  work, however, does not end today. We will write more legislation. We  will hold more bipartisan hearings.   In fact, a hearing right this very moment, this afternoon, with the  Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel and our Health  Subcommittee brought VA and DOD to the same table to help end this  crisis. It is a joint hearing through this joint subcommittee between  the Veterans' Affairs Committee and the Armed Services Committee.   We will do whatever it takes to end these tragic incidents of  suicide. I am fully committed to this effort. Losing 20 veterans a day  is unacceptable.   I will be voting ``yes'' on this critical piece of legislation, and I  call on every Member of this body to do the same and help reduce  veteran suicide.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Lamb), my good friend, the vice chairman of the House  Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and the author of H.R. 2359.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Ryan), my good friend and cosponsor of H.R. 2359.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I also would like to take this moment to  ask my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 2359, as amended.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1812) to amend title 38, United States Code, to furnish Vet  Center readjustment counseling and related mental health services to  certain individuals, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1812         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Vet Center Eligibility       Expansion Act''.       SEC. 2. EXPANSION OF VET CENTER SERVICES.         Section 1712A of title 38, United States Code, is amended--        (1) by striking ``clauses (i) through (iv)'' both places it       appears and inserting ``clauses (i) through (vi)'';        (2) by striking ``in clause (v)'' both places it appears       and inserting ``in clause (vii)'';        (3) in subsection (a)(1)(C)--        (A) by redesignating clauses (iv) and (v) as clauses (vi)       and (vii), respectively; and        (B) by inserting after clause (iii) the following new       clauses:        ``(iv) Any individual who is a veteran or member of the       Armed Forces, including a member of a reserve component of       the Armed Forces, who served--        ``(I) on active service in response to a national emergency       or major disaster declared by the President; or        ``(II) in the National Guard of a State under orders of the       chief executive of that State in response to a disaster or       civil disorder in such State.        ``(v) Any individual who participated in a drug       interdiction operation as a member of the Coast Guard,       regardless of the location of that operation.''; and        (4) in subsection (h), by adding at the end the following       new paragraphs:        ``(4) The term `active service' has the meaning given that       term in section 101 of title 10.        ``(5) The term `civil disorder' has the meaning given that       term in section 232 of title 18.''.       SEC. 3. PLAN TO PROVIDE VET CENTER SERVICES TO VETERANS                     LIVING IN AREAS WHERE NO VET CENTER IS LOCATED.         The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall submit to the       Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of       Representatives a plan to provide Vet Center services to       veterans living in geographic areas where no Vet Center is       located, including in the United States insular areas.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 1812.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the VA is authorized to provide counseling through Vet  Centers to a broad group of veterans and servicemembers. These veterans  and servicemembers include National Guard and Reserve members, those  who have served on Active Duty in any combat theater or area of  hostility, veterans and servicemembers who experienced military sexual  trauma, those who provided direct emergent medical care or mortuary  services to casualties of war, or servicemembers and veterans who  deployed to combat zones or areas of hostility in a direct support  role.   However, members of the National Guard, Reserve, or Coast Guard who  participated in a drug interdiction or who served in a response to a  national emergency, major disaster, or civil disorder are currently not  eligible to receive Vet Center care. This is all despite the effects  such experiences can have on mental health.   H.R. 1812, as amended, the Vet Center Eligibility Expansion Act,  introduced by Ranking Member Roe, would correct this oversight by  extending eligibility for Vet Center care to these individuals.   It would also require the VA to submit a plan to Congress for  providing Vet Center services to geographical areas in which no Vet  Centers are located. These areas include territories of the United  States, rural, and insular areas.   By assessing the steps necessary to provide access to Vet Centers for  veterans living in these underserved areas, the Vet Center Eligibility  Expansion Act is ensuring veterans, servicemembers, reservists, and  members of the Coast Guard and National Guard are allowed access to the  lifesaving services Vet Centers provide.   This legislation increases access to services that provide early  intervention for mental healthcare issues, which can reduce the risks  associated with suicide.   The sad statistics show that, of the 20 veterans and military  servicemembers who die by suicide, 14 of those 20 have not received VA  healthcare. This bill is one step towards changing this tragic number.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, Dr. Roe, for his work on  this important measure, and I call upon all of our colleagues to join  us in voting ``yes'' on this life-changing piece of legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Levin), my good friend and fellow Californian, the  chairman of the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee, and also a cosponsor  of H.R. 1812.    Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues in the House  to support H.R. 1812, as amended, so we can finally pass it into law  and get justice for these veterans.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2326) to amend the Social Security Act, to amend the  Dignified Burial and Other Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2012,  and to direct the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs, Defense, Labor, and  Homeland Security, and the Administrator of the Small Business  Administration, to take certain actions to improve transition  assistance to members of the Armed Forces who separate, retire, or are  discharged from the Armed Forces, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2326         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Navy SEAL Chief Petty       Officer William "Bill" Mulder (Ret.) Transition Improvement       Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. TAP DEFINED.         In this Act, the term ``TAP'' means the Transition       Assistance Program under sections 1142 and 1144 of title 10,       United States Code.       SEC. 3. ACCESS FOR THE SECRETARIES OF LABOR AND VETERANS                     AFFAIRS TO THE FEDERAL DIRECTORY OF NEW HIRES.         Section 453A(h) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.       653a(h)) is amended by adding at the end the following new       paragraph:        ``(4) Veteran employment.--The Secretaries of Labor and of       Veterans Affairs shall have access to information reported by       employers pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for       purposes of tracking employment of veterans.''.

(c) Conforming Repeal.--Subsection (f) of such section is       repealed.       SEC. 5. GRANTS FOR PROVISION OF TRANSITION ASSISTANCE TO                     MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES AFTER SEPARATION,                     RETIREMENT, OR DISCHARGE.

(11) Other criteria the Secretaries and the Administrator       of the Small Business Administration determine appropriate.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2326.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2326, as amended, the Navy  SEAL Chief Petty Officer William ``Bill'' Mulder (Ret.) Transition  Improvement Act of 2019.   I would like to recognize the Economic Opportunity Subcommittee  chairman and ranking member, Mr. Levin and Mr. Bilirakis, for their  bipartisan focus on this issue, and the bipartisan way in which they  have crafted this piece of legislation and have moved it forward.   Almost 30 years ago, the National Defense Authorization Act created  the first transition policy to assist servicemembers entering civilian  life. This law provides that those who are being separated from Active  Duty are provided services for counseling, training opportunities,  finding employment, and other related information and services.   These services, more commonly known as the Transition Assistance  Program, or TAP, were amended recently by the VOW to Hire Heroes Act of  2011. This legislation called for mandatory participation of all  servicemembers and improved transition resources by lengthening the  process and lowering the class sizes.   While our veterans have found the TAP program to be highly  beneficial, they find the sheer amount of information too overwhelming  to absorb. Today, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 2326, as amended,  which aims to solve this problem.   This legislation would do several things to make TAP more effective.   First, this act would create a pilot program offering transition  training off military bases, making the transition process easier to  access for veterans and spouses. A review by the Government  Accountability Office concluded that a program held off base would be  beneficial, and the committee believes that such a program is worth  examining in further detail.   In my own visits to TAP classes, I heard from servicemembers who felt  they needed to attend TAP multiple times before they transition to  civilian life because the resources aren't available off base. The  legislation would create a grant program for organizations to provide  multiple transition assistance services such as resume assistance,  interview training, and job recruitment training from one program,  location, and source.   Next, this act would give the Department of Labor's Veterans'  Employment and Training Service and VA access to the Social Security  Administration's resources to track in real time when a participant  receives a new job. This is going to help improve programs and provide  a better accountability of services provided by the VA.   Lastly, this bill would require a 1-year independent assessment of  the effectiveness of TAP, as well as a 5-year longitudinal study of TAP  which compares the effectiveness of using the program.   The 1-year independent assessment of the Transition Assistance  Program's effectiveness shall be conducted not later than 90 days after  the enactment of this act. The legislation requires the VA enter into  an agreement with an entity with experience in adult education to carry  out an independent assessment of TAP.   It also requires the Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Veterans  Affairs, and the Small Business Administration to conduct a 5-year  longitudinal study of TAP to determine the need for TAP off base and  determine if this program  [[Page H4037]]  would ease the process of participation for servicemembers, veterans,  and spouses who may have had difficulty attending classes on bases.   Upon completion of the respective 1-year and 5-year studies, the  Secretary of the VA shall submit the findings to Congress, where we  can, again, assess the quality of transition resources provided to  veterans and servicemembers.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Levin), my good friend, the chairman of the Economic  Opportunity Subcommittee, and also the author of H.R. 2326.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Cunningham), my good friend and member of the  Economic Opportunity Subcommittee and cosponsor of H.R. 2326.    Madam Speaker, let me say that I extend my commendations  to the work of my colleague from Texas (Mr. Arrington). I thank him  also for naming the bill after such a distinguished warrior and someone  who exemplifies the need for this legislation. We certainly wish Chief  Petty Officer Navy SEAL Bill Mulder all the success in the world.   Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am prepared to  close, so I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, before I begin my closing comments, I want to correct  my remarks. I misunderstood. Chief Petty Officer Bill Mulder is  deceased, and so I mean no disrespect to his family. We certainly are  honored to have this piece of legislation carry his name in the hopes  that it is going to serve many more veterans.   In his memory, I am most honored and privileged to make sure that  this legislation passes.                                time  1615    Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Levin and Mr. Bilirakis for these  necessary improvements to the Transition Assistance Program. A  testament to their work is the broad support they received from  committee members on this bill, and I look forward to their future work  on this as they continue to focus on and redefine the program.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 2326,  as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2333) to direct the Comptroller General of the United States  to conduct an assessment of the responsibilities, workload, and vacancy  rates of Department of Veterans Affairs suicide prevention  coordinators, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2333         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Support for Suicide       Prevention Coordinators Act''.       SEC. 2. COMPTROLLER GENERAL ASSESSMENT OF RESPONSIBILITIES,                     WORKLOAD, AND VACANCY RATES OF DEPARTMENT OF                     VETERANS AFFAIRS SUICIDE PREVENTION                     COORDINATORS.         (a) Assessment Required.--The Comptroller General of the       United States shall conduct an assessment of the       responsibilities, workload, training, and vacancy rates of       Department of Veterans Affairs suicide prevention       coordinators. Such assessment shall include a determination       of--        (1) the extent to which the use and staffing of suicide       prevention coordinators varies between Department facilities;       and        (2) the extent to which the Secretary provides oversight of       suicide prevention coordinators.        (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than one year after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General       shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the       Senate and House of Representatives a report containing the       findings of the assessment required by subsection (a).     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 2333.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, according to the National Suicide Data Report for  2005-2016, approximately 20 veterans, Active Duty servicemembers, and  members of the National Guard and Reserves die by suicide each day.   This rate is disproportionately higher than that of the civilian  population. Of those 20 a day, 14 are not enrolled in the VA healthcare  system. Part of the VA's effort to combat veteran suicide is by  strengthening the role of the suicide prevention coordinator. The VA is  the only healthcare system that has full-time employees dedicated to  suicide prevention.   Suicide prevention coordinators identify high-risk veterans and  ensure they receive appropriate care, conduct outreach, and promote  awareness and best practices within the VA system. As of April 2019,  the VA had approximately 444 suicide prevention coordinators stationed  at medical centers across the country.   These coordinators manage care for almost 30,000 veterans who are  high risk for suicide, in addition to managing their other duties as  assigned.   In fiscal year 2018, these coordinators conducted more than 20,000  outreach events, reaching almost 2 million people. During the oversight  trips to VA facilities, VA committee staff heard from coordinators who  are overworked and struggled to keep up with their casework.   Last week, I visited the Atlanta VA Medical Center and one of three  Veterans Crisis Line call centers. Last year, the Atlanta VA crisis  line received 3,600 referrals. The Atlanta suicide prevention team is  staffed with only eight social workers and one employee for  administrative support to respond to all crisis line referrals and  approximately 200 veterans identified as high risk for suicide.   Let me repeat that. They have eight social workers to manage 3,600  referrals and 200 high-risk patients a year. This team does all it can  to keep up with the staggering number of referrals, but they simply do  not have the capacity to conduct outreach to veterans in the community  who may need help.   Suicide prevention team staffing shortages in Atlanta and at VA  medical facilities across the country is why H.R. 2333, introduced by  Congressman Brindisi, is so important.   It would direct the Government Accountability Office to access the  workload and vacancy rates of VA suicide prevention coordinators. This  report is essential to better informing Congress of the current state  of suicide prevention coordinators, the resources at the facilities  where they work, and the challenges they face in addressing the needs  of our most vulnerable veterans.   The role of these coordinators is vital to combating veteran suicide,  and this report will illustrate where the gaps in care delivery exists,  especially for the clinicians, social workers, and suicide prevention  coordinators working on the front lines.   I fully support this bill and I really want to thank Mr. Brindisi for  championing this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes''  on H.R. 2333.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Brindisi), my good friend and the author of H.R. 2333.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As I said in my remarks related to Mr. Brindisi's legislation, I  visited the Atlanta VA Medical Center and it receives 3,600 referrals  per year from the Veterans Crisis Line, which is the highest number of  crisis line referrals any individual veteran medical center receives  nationwide.   I know that at the medical center itself that there is a 22 percent  vacancy rate among mental health professionals. They have lost eight  psychiatrists across their hospital and outpatient clinics since the  beginning of the year. Staff who resigned have cited salaries and  workload stress as their main reasons for leaving the VA.   Mr. Brindisi's legislation goes to, however, the position of suicide  prevention coordinators, and currently, the coordinators at this  particular medical center are staffed up, but we are trying to figure  out where these staff coordinator positions across the country may be  vacant or insufficient because we know these crisis lines are being  used. We have to make sure that we have the coordinators to respond to  them.   But in addition to that, we need coordinators to do the outreach  events to reach those veterans who are not connected with the VA. So  the VA medical center in Atlanta is just one example of the staffing  shortages in VA hospitals and clinics throughout the country. We know  that beyond the stress and strain of our psychiatrists and of our  suicide prevention coordinators, which Mr. Brindisi's bill addresses,  there are nearly 50,000 vacancies at VA.   If we want to fully address the veteran suicide crisis in this  country, we need to make sure that suicide prevention teams are  sufficiently staffed and do more to address mental health clinician  understaffing.   Mr. Brindisi's legislation is a significant step in making sure all  of this happens.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Madam Speaker, I certainly appreciate the partnership and  the spirit of the ranking member of the committee in addressing this  national crisis of veteran suicide, and H.R. 2333 is an essential and  significant step that we are taking to address this crisis.   Madam Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in passing H.R.  2333, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2340) to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide  to Congress notice of any suicide or attempted suicide of a veteran in  a Department of Veterans Affairs facility, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2340         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fostering Intergovernmental       Health Transparency in Veteran Suicides Act'' or ``FIGHT       Veteran Suicides Act''.       SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL NOTICE OF SUICIDES AND ATTEMPTED                     SUICIDES OF VETERANS IN DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS FACILITIES.         Section 1720F of title 38, United States Code, is amended       by adding at the end the following new subsection:        ``(l) Congressional Notice Requirements.--(1) In the case       of the suicide or attempted suicide of any veteran that       occurs in, or on the grounds of, a Department facility, the       Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs       of the Senate and the House of Representatives and the       Senators and member of Congress representing the district in       which the facility is located and the Senators and member of       Congress representing the district in which the veteran       resides the following notices:        ``(A) Not later than seven days after the date on which the       suicide or attempted suicide occurs, notice of--        ``(i) the suicide or attempted suicide; and        ``(ii) the name of the facility and location where the       suicide or attempted suicide occurred.        ``(B) Subject to subparagraph (C), not later than 60 days       after such date, notice of the following information (if       available) regarding the veteran who committed or attempted       to commit suicide:        ``(i) The enrollment status of the veteran with respect to       the patient enrollment system of the Department under section       1705 of this title.        ``(ii) The most recent encounter between the veteran and       any employee or facility of the Veterans Health       Administration before the suicide or attempted suicide       occurred.        ``(iii) Whether the veteran had other medical insurance or       coverage (including TRICARE, Medicare, and Medicaid).        ``(iv) The Armed Force in which the veteran served.        ``(v) The time period when the veteran served in the Armed       Forces.        ``(vi) The age of the veteran.        ``(vii) The marital status of the veteran.        ``(viii) The employment status of the veteran.        ``(ix) The housing status of the veteran.        ``(x) The gender identity of the veteran.        ``(xi) The sexual orientation of the veteran.        ``(xii) The race of the veteran.        ``(xiii) Confirmation that the Secretary has provided       notice to the immediate family members of the veteran       regarding any Department support or assistance for which such       family members may be eligible.        ``(C) In collecting and reporting information under       subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall take all steps the       Secretary determines necessary to respect the privacy and       dignity of the veteran and the family of the veteran.        ``(2) Each notice submitted under subparagraph (A) or (B)       of paragraph (1) shall include a copy of guidance developed       by the Secretary for purposes of dissemination that is       designed to--        ``(A) deter the sensationalism of suicide;        ``(B) provide information regarding warning signs that are       often exhibited by veterans at risk of suicide; and        ``(C) provide notice of the resources the Department offers       to veterans who may be at risk of suicide, including the       Veterans Crisis Line and readjustment counseling provided       through Vet Centers.''.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2340, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, since the beginning of this year, seven--seven-- veterans have died by suicide in or on the grounds of VA facilities.  Sadly, another suicide occurred at a VA hospital in Washington just  this weekend.   Currently, VA staff notify both the House and Senate Committees on  Veterans' Affairs of the events as a matter of courtesy; however,  should the Department's leadership change, there is no assurance this  courtesy would continue.   I have made veteran suicide prevention the top priority for the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs because 20 suicides a day is far too  many. One suicide is far too many. But to address this alarming trend,  Congress must be informed when a suicide occurs on a VA campus and must  be provided all relevant data.   This information will allow the committee to conduct appropriate  oversight, write legislation that will improve outcomes, and, when  necessary, hold individuals accountable when there are clear failures  that impact the timely and adequate care for veterans.   As such, H.R. 2340, as amended, the FIGHT Veteran Suicides Act, would  require the VA Secretary to notify Congress following an attempted or a  completed suicide by a veteran in or on the grounds of a VA facility.   This measure also requires VA to provide Congress with communications  guidance to deter the sensationalism of suicide, provide information on  identifying the warning signs often exhibited by veterans at risk of  suicide, and identify resources offered by the Department for at-risk  veterans, including the Veterans Crisis Line and Vet Center  readjustment counseling.   It is essential that this information be shared, regardless of  leadership at  [[Page H4042]]  VA, what party controls Congress, or who occupies the White House.   I thank Congressman Rose, a combat veteran, for leading the fight  against this tragic national public health crisis, and I want to  commend him for his leadership and for writing this important  legislation that will ensure Congress has all the data it needs to  truly understand and reduce veteran suicide.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in voting ``yes'' on this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I, too, ask my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 2340, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1200) to increase, effective as of December 1, 2019, the  rates of compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities  and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the  survivors of certain disabled veterans, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1200         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Compensation Cost-      of-Living Adjustment Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. INCREASE IN RATES OF DISABILITY COMPENSATION AND                     DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION.         (a) Rate Adjustment.--Effective on December 1, 2019, the       Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall increase, in accordance       with subsection (c), the dollar amounts in effect on November       30, 2019, for the payment of disability compensation and       dependency and indemnity compensation under the provisions       specified in subsection (b).        (b) Amounts To Be Increased.--The dollar amounts to be       increased pursuant to subsection (a) are the following:        (1) Wartime disability compensation.--Each of the dollar       amounts under section 1114 of title 38, United States Code.        (2) Additional compensation for dependents.--Each of the       dollar amounts under section 1115(1) of such title.        (3) Clothing allowance.--The dollar amount under section       1162 of such title.        (4) Dependency and indemnity compensation to surviving       spouse.--Each of the dollar amounts under subsections (a)       through (d) of section 1311 of such title.        (5) Dependency and indemnity compensation to children.--      Each of the dollar amounts under sections 1313(a) and 1314 of       such title.        (c) Determination of Increase.--Each dollar amount       described in subsection (b) shall be increased by the same       percentage as the percentage by which benefit amounts payable       under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et       seq.) are increased effective December 1, 2019, as a result       of a determination under section 215(i) of such Act (42       U.S.C. 415(i)).        (d) Special Rule.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may       adjust administratively, consistent with the increases made       under subsection (a), the rates of disability compensation       payable to persons under section 10 of Public Law 85-857 (72       Stat. 1263) who have not received compensation under chapter       11 of title 38, United States Code.       SEC. 3. PUBLICATION OF ADJUSTED RATES.         The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall publish in the       Federal Register the amounts specified in section 2(b), as       increased under that section, not later than the date on       which the matters specified in section 215(i)(2)(D) of the       Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)(2)(D)) are required to       be published by reason of a determination made under section       215(i) of such Act during fiscal year 2020.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1200.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1200, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living  Adjustment Act of 2019 would require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs  to increase the rates of disability compensation for service-connected  veterans and the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for  survivors of veterans, effective December 1, 2019.   Now, this bill would also increase these rates by the same percentage  as the percentage by which Social Security benefits are increased  effective December 1, 2019, and require that VA publish the increased  rates in the Federal Register.   To me, the actual cost-of-living adjustment to veterans' benefits,  otherwise known as COLA, is much more than a rate adjustment tied to  inflation. In reality, it is a quality-of-life guarantee in retirement  years, especially for veterans suffering with service-connected  disabilities and ailments.   It also comes with the assurance for veterans that their survivors  will not see a steady decline in benefits if the economy changes and  costs rise after they are gone. This guarantee is a great source of  comfort for veterans as they age. I know this because they tell me this  everywhere I go.   The yearly COLA increase is a recognition and appreciation of a  grateful nation of the service and sacrifice of those who volunteer to  wear the uniform of our country.   Participating in this gesture of appreciation is one of the most  rewarding responsibilities of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. As  chairman, I am honored to be leading this effort to say thank you.   I want to recognize the work of the Disability Assistance and  Memorial Affairs Subcommittee chair, Elaine Luria, and ranking member,    Mike Bost, for sponsoring H.R. 1200 and for bringing this bill to the  floor today.   I am pleased that we are considering this bill early this year so  veterans will not be concerned about its passage by the December 1  deadline.   I wholeheartedly support H.R. 1200 and urge all my colleagues to do  so as well.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Luria), who is my good friend and the chairwoman of the  Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee and also a  cosponsor of H.R. 1200.    Madam Speaker, I, too, join my ranking member in asking  all of our colleagues to pass H.R. 1200.   I thank Chairwoman Luria and Ranking Member Bost of the Subcommittee  on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs for their hard work.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1200, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2372) to direct the Comptroller General of the United States  to conduct an assessment of all memoranda of understanding and  memoranda of agreement between Under Secretary of Health and non- Department of Veterans Affairs entities relating to suicide prevention  and mental health services, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2372         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Care Quality       Transparency Act''.       SEC. 2. COMPTROLLER GENERAL ASSESSMENT OF MEMORANDA OF                     UNDERSTANDING AND MEMORANDA OF AGREEMENT                     BETWEEN UNDER SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND NON-                    DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS ENTITIES                     RELATING TO SUICIDE PREVENTION AND MENTAL                     HEALTH SERVICES.         (a) Assessment.--Not later than 270 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the       United States shall conduct an assessment of the       effectiveness of all memoranda of understanding and memoranda       of agreement entered into by the Under Secretary of Veterans       Affairs for Health and a non-Department of Veterans Affairs       entity relating to--        (1) suicide prevention activities and outreach; and        (2) the provision or coordination of mental health services       during the five-year period preceding the date of the       enactment of this Act.        (b) Contents of Assessment.--The assessment required by       subsection (a) shall include an assessment of--        (1) the size of the catchment area of each such entity;        (2) the staffing structures of such entities;        (3) any accreditation or licensure any such entity has       obtained in relation to the services the entity provides;        (4) any variances in the subpopulations of veterans served       by such entities;        (5) any limitations any such entity may face in carrying       out its obligations under the memorandum of understanding or       memorandum of agreement;  [[Page H4044]]         (6) the extent to which the Under Secretary provides       oversight and tracks outcomes of such entities;        (7) any variations in the structure or requirements of the       memoranda of understanding and memoranda of agreement;        (8) a breakdown of the percentage of such entities that       serve--        (A) women veterans;        (B) minority veterans;        (C) veterans who are over the age of 55;        (D) veterans between the ages of 18 and 34;        (E) veterans who reside in United States insular areas; and        (F) veterans' families; and        (9) any measures taken to ensure the secure exchange of       data and information between such entities and the Department       of Veterans Affairs.        (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 270 days after the       completion of the assessment under subsection (a), the       Comptroller General shall submit to the Committees on       Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and House of Representatives       a report on the results of the assessment.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2372, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, to meet the needs of veterans, VA has long relied on  community partners to provide outreach and services, particularly to  address mental health needs and suicide prevention.   The number of mental health- and suicide prevention-related  agreements between VA and these organizations has increased  exponentially since 2014. It is anticipated that these relationships  will continue to grow in the months following the signing of Executive  Order No. 13861 on March 5, 2019.   Now, this executive order seeks to establish grants to local  communities to better collaborate and integrate service delivery and  resources for veterans. As reliance on outside groups grows, Congress  must better understand the effectiveness of the programs and mental  health services these private organizations offer. VA must also ensure  such partnered organizations are able to provide quality, culturally  competent, evidence-based services to veterans.   Congresswoman Underwood's legislation, H.R. 2372, as amended, would  require the Government Accountability Office to study the effectiveness  of these partnerships between VA and organizations providing services  related to suicide prevention and mental healthcare.   When complete, GAO would report their findings to the House and  Senate Veterans' Affairs Committees. As part of the assessment, GAO is  required to look at several factors, such as the staffing structure of  the organization, its accreditations or licensures, the level of  oversight and tracking of outcomes by VA, and the secure exchange of  data and information.   The GAO would also be required to study the ability of these  organizations to serve unique subsets of the veteran population,  including, women, minorities, older and younger veteran cohorts,  families, and veterans who reside in U.S. insular areas.   I thank Ms. Underwood for introducing this legislation because it  will ensure VA is responsibly leveraging its community partnerships to  reduce veteran suicide and support VA in its transformation to a public  health approach to suicide prevention. This public health approach  focuses on prevention and intervention before veterans are in crisis.   As I previously mentioned, a two-pronged strategy is necessary to  address the national crisis of veteran suicide. These Federal, State,  and local partnerships are integral to the first prong of the strategy  of prevention and early intervention.   It is critical that we develop these partnerships as part of an  infrastructure to support veterans. This legislation will ensure we are  using taxpayer funds effectively to partner with those organizations  providing quality, evidence-based programs.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to support this legislation, and I  encourage all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2372, as amended.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Underwood), my good friend, member of the Disability  Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee, and author of H.R. 2372.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to thank Congresswoman Underwood for introducing H.R. 2372,  and the tremendous, tremendous professional background she brings to  her role in Congress, and for introducing legislation that will ensure  that we hold private organizations to the same standard of care that we  impose internally on the VA.   So I do urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 2372, as  amended.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2045) to amend title 38, United States Code, to establish  the Veterans Economic Opportunity and Transition Administration and the  Under Secretary for Veterans Economic Opportunity and Transition of the  Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2045, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, when our servicemembers conclude their military  service, they are taxed with returning to civilian life after putting  their lives on hold for years. This is the sacrifice they make for our  security.   In exchange, we owe them more than a thank you and well wishes. We  owe them a commitment that their transition to civilian life will go  smoothly, and a VA that responds to their needs.   That is why we passed the first GI Bill nearly 75 years ago, and why  we continue today to make improvements to provide veterans with the  benefits they have earned.   Unfortunately, VA has struggled to track the effectiveness of  education and employment programs and, consequently, Congress has  struggled to determine the Department's resource needs. We have  identified a contributing factor through hearings and discussions with  our Veterans Service Organizations that the Veterans Benefits  Administration is simply asked to do too much.   With the focus on managing countless compensation claims, the  responsibility of managing transition education, and housing benefits  often takes a back seat.   To put it in perspective, the Veterans Benefit Administration's  structure has not significantly changed since the creation of the  Department of Veterans Affairs in 1930.   During the last 89 years, the services needed by veterans have  drastically changed, and that is why our committee has an Economic  Opportunity Subcommittee. It is time for the VA to understand this as  well.   The VET OPP Act, as amended, would create a new administration within  the department to manage educational assistance, vocational  rehabilitation and employment, education and career counseling  programs, and broadly defined transition assistance programs that are  shared across agencies.   Now, that means veterans' education, housing, and economic programs  will have a dedicated Under Secretary for Veterans Economic Opportunity  and Transition. The Veterans Economic Opportunity and Transition  Administration will solely focus on fulfilling these promises to  veterans, so that they get the education that that they want, the  housing they need, and the careers they deserve.   During our April 9 Economic Opportunity legislative hearing, this  proposal received support from the Veterans of Foreign Wars, American  Enterprise Institute, and the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors.   Now these organizations know firsthand how hard it is to navigate the  process of using benefits, so I want to thank the hard work of our  Economic Opportunity Subcommittee for holding hearings on H.R. 2045, as  amended, where this legislation received universal acclaim from our VSO  community.   I also want to thank our VSO community, and the American Federation  of Government Employees, who worked with us to make this legislation  work for all veterans and all employees currently employed at the VA.   This is a bipartisan bill because we are not trying to make a  political point or attack the VA. Instead, we simply want to make the  VA run more effectively for the veterans it serves.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Levin), my good friend, chairman of the Economic  Opportunity Subcommittee, and also a cosponsor of H.R. 2045.     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might  consume.   Madam Speaker, if anyone thinks that business as usual is working at  the VA, I would only ask you to look at the implementation of the  Forever GI Bill. My good friend the ranking member knows that there  were definite issues with the implementation. It did not go well. We  are still months away from implementation, which should have happened  last year.   When the IG and others evaluated what went wrong, one thing was very  clear: There was no accountable leader.   That is what happens when programs are buried in layers of  bureaucracy, and that is why I urge my colleagues to join me in passing  H.R. 2045, as amended, the VET OPP Act, which will establish an  accountable leader at VA for all of those programs that we have under  the purview of our Economic Opportunity Subcommittee.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1947) to amend title 38, United States Code, to exempt  transfers of funds from Federal agencies to the Department of Veterans  Affairs for nonprofit corporations established under subchapter IV of  chapter 73 of such title from certain provisions of the Economy Act, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1947         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXEMPTION OF CERTAIN TRANSFERS.         Section 7364(b)(1) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended by adding at the end the following new sentence:       ``Any amounts so transferred after September 30, 2016, shall       be available without regard to fiscal year limitations,       notwithstanding section 1535(d) of title 31.''.

The amount of monthly stipends shall be       determined in accordance with such subsection (c) and may not       be accelerated under this paragraph.        ``(2) Educational counseling.--An individual may make an       election under paragraph (1) only if the individual receives       educational counseling under section 3697A(a) of this title.        ``(3) Charge against entitlement.--The number of months of       entitlement charged an individual for accelerated payments       made pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be determined at the       rate of two months for each month in which such an       accelerated payment is made.''.        (c) Flight Training at Public Institutions.--Subsection       (c)(1)(A) of such section 3313 is amended--        (1) in clause (i)--        (A) by redesignating subclauses (I) and (II) as items (aa)       and (bb), respectively;        (B) by striking ``In the case of a program of education       pursued at a public institution of higher learning'' and       inserting ``(I) Subject to subclause (II), in the case of a       program of education pursued at a public institution of       higher learning not described in clause (ii)(II)(bb)''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following new subclause:        ``(II) In determining the actual net cost for in-State       tuition and fees pursuant to subclause (I), the Secretary may       not pay for tuition and fees relating to flight training.'';       and        (2) in clause (ii)--        (A) in subclause (I), by redesignating items (aa) and (bb)       as subitems (AA) and (BB), respectively;        (B) in subclause (II), by redesignating items (aa) and (bb)       as subitems (AA) and (BB), respectively;        (C) by redesignating subclauses (I) and (II) as items (aa)       and (bb), respectively;        (D) by striking ``In the case of a program of education       pursued at a non-public or foreign institution of higher       learning'' and inserting ``(I) In the case of a program of       education described in subclause (II)''; and        (E) by adding at the end the following new subclause:        ``(II) A program of education described in this subclause       is any of the following:         ``(aa) A program of education pursued at a non-public or       foreign institution of higher learning.        ``(bb) A program of education pursued at a public       institution of higher learning in which flight training is       required to earn the degree being pursued (including with       respect to a dual major, concentration, or other element of       such a degree).''.

SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1947, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on Veterans' Affairs be authorized to file a supplemental report on the  bill, H.R. 1947, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, this comprehensive legislation addresses funding for  VA research and gives the VA authority to work with grieving families  to memorialize their loved ones. It also closes a loophole that has  allowed contracted flight schools to charge public schools unlimited  tuition and fees to train veterans using the GI Bill.   The first section of the measure addresses VA research. VA's Office  of Research and Development improves the lives of veterans, contributes  to the national public health, and develops lifesaving biomedical  breakthroughs that change the world.   In its 90-year history, the VA's medical and prosthetic research has  produced some of the world's greatest advances. The VA developed the  pacemaker in 1960 and the shingles vaccine in 2005. It created an  effective smoking cessation program and increased life expectancy for  people with spinal cord injuries.   VA researchers were responsible for beginning the first international  antiretroviral drug therapy trial to find the optimal treatment for  patients with AIDS, for whom all therapy had failed.   These research efforts usually aren't performed alone. They are often  in collaboration with nonprofits, universities, other Federal agencies,  and international bodies.   When research is funded from non-VA grants, it is managed by a for- profit corporation, otherwise known as an NPC, established at a VA  Medical Center, which allows flexible research funding.   Last year, the VA's Office of General Counsel uncovered an  appropriations law limitation that prevents funding transfers to these  nonprofit research corporations for longer than 1 fiscal year. This has  negatively affected several ongoing multiyear projects across the  country.  [[Page H4050]]    Dr. Roe's legislation, H.R. 1947, as amended, would provide explicit  authority for NPCs to administer research funding without regard to  fiscal year limitations.   To ensure this legislation does not raise spending, section 2  addresses a loophole in GI Bill flight school benefits.   This loophole had been exploited by flight schools that had  contracted with public institutions of higher learning to offer flight- related degrees. In some cases, bad actors were exploiting GI benefits  that resulted in the VA paying out over $500,000 in tuition and flight  payments to one student.   H.R. 1947 fixes this loophole by marrying the cap on tuition at  private institutions with a cap on flight school tuition at public  institutions.   In addition, to ensure that the fewest possible students are  impacted, the legislation also includes a provision to allow flight  school students to accelerate their GI Bill benefits. This will allow  them to be better used for flight school, which is regularly more  expensive but takes fewer months to complete.   Finally, section 3 of H.R. 1947, as amended, authorizes VA to replace  a veteran's headstone or marker in a private cemetery so that an  inscription may be added to remember a deceased spouse or a child  following their deaths.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative LaMalfa for introducing the  original legislation and Ranking Member Roe for offering the  legislation as an amendment during markup.   This bill is another example of our committee working on a bipartisan  basis to get it right for all veterans.   This legislation allows veterans to memorialize their loved ones in  the way they want and where they want. Every veteran deserves to know  that their wish to be remembered in perpetuity alongside spouses and  their children will be granted. The same is true for surviving spouses  and children who want reassurance that they, too, will be memorialized  with their veteran spouse or parent.   Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. Roe for his tireless efforts to care for  veterans, and I commend him on this bill. I look forward to joining him  in voting ``yes'' on this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in passing H.R. 1947.   Before I close, let me say that I appreciate the kind words of the  ranking member, Dr. Roe of Tennessee, and I associate myself with his  eloquent tributes to his classmates and the people who did not get to  live the full lives that he, himself, has been able to live.   I, myself, have also known people who have served our country and who  have also paid the ultimate price. I certainly do share his sentiments  as we enter this Memorial Day weekend, as all Americans reflect on the  ultimate sacrifice of all the people buried in our national cemeteries  and cemeteries that aren't national cemeteries that are marked by VA  grave markers.   It is always a poignant moment to walk through my national cemetery  and to watch the Girl Scouts and the Cub Scouts planting American flags  on each and every grave and to see it all happen within 20 minutes  because there are so many Americans who want to come to my cemetery to  make sure that every grave is honored.   To my colleague from Tennessee, I wish him a pleasant Memorial Day  weekend, but, also, to all Americans, let us reflect on what Memorial  Day weekend does mean to our Nation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
