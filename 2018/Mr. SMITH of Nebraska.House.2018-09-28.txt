 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his time  and certainly his leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this bill to make permanent  the tax cuts for families and small businesses we passed last year  through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I am particularly pleased this bill  also makes permanent the grain glitch fix we enacted last spring.   This important provision ensures producers and buyers across  agriculture could benefit from tax reform as intended. This bill also  continues the treatment of property taxes on agricultural land and  property as a fully deductible business expense, which is vital to ag  producers in Nebraska's Third Congressional District as well as across  the country.   The initial version of tax reform we moved out of the Ways and Means  Committee and passed in this House last year provided permanent tax  relief, and our families, farmers, ranchers, and small businesses  deserve the certainty of knowing their taxes will not increase. I am  disappointed we could not get this permanence through the Senate last  year, but I am pleased we have another opportunity to do so.   This year our economy is booming with economic growth continuing  above 3 percent, and the certainty of permanence will allow our small  businesses to make future investments and families to know they can  keep more of their paychecks as well as plan for the future.   Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support for this bill.
