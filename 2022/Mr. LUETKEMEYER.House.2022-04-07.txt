 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3807, as amended. Here we  are today to discuss yet another spending bill that will add to our  Nation's debt and deficit and continue to spike inflation; another bill  that creates a new government program without regard to the  effectiveness or management of existing programs; another bill that has  been rushed to the floor without a committee markup or a CBO score.   In fact, the latest draft of this legislation was sent out last  Friday night and has been amended since. This is not how we should  legislate, Mr. Speaker. We must do a better job for our Nation's small  businesses that create two out of every three new jobs in America.   I am sure I am not the only one who has experienced deja vu by my  colleagues' agenda to spend now and think later.   This agenda is not working for Main Street America. The Small  Business and Entrepreneurship Council conducted a recent poll of small  business owners and found that only 5 percent of small business owners  report that ``Congress' policies are helping the economy and small  businesses like mine.'' Just 5 percent, so that means 95 percent, Mr.  Speaker, don't like what is going on.   While we are sitting here in Washington, D.C., deciding whether to  spend more money for certain industries, Main Street is experiencing  price shocks that have not been felt in over 40 years.   Inflation is burning through our Nation at a rapid pace. From food  and shelter to gas and energy, prices in every category of life are  increasing exponentially with no end in sight.   The Consumer Price Index stands at 7.9 percent annually, and the  producer price index, which is the wholesale price index, is now at 10  percent. That makes short-term inflation look pretty bleak from the  standpoint that if the wholesale price index is 10 and the CPI 7.9, we  are going to have some more inflation, some high prices. There is no  doubt about it.   American families are feeling the pain, Mr. Speaker. Businesses feel  this pain. The Nation's smallest firms are suffering. In fact, small  business owners are reporting that their number one problem is  inflation.   The second most pressing issue for small business is the price of  gas. These price shocks hit them every single day.   Today, we are considering injecting more money into the system, which  will simply fuel the fire of inflation.   There is no doubt that small businesses suffered from the COVID-19  pandemic and the lockdowns that shut down Main Street. It has been just  over 2 years since the CARES Act was signed into law. Since that time,  we have spent approximately $6 trillion as a Nation to fight COVID-19.   Small businesses alone have received $1.2 trillion in forgivable  loans and other grants. I am proud of the bipartisan relief that  Congress provided small businesses throughout this pandemic, including  the Paycheck Protection Program, which supported many small businesses,  including restaurants, in keeping their businesses afloat and employees  on the payroll.   The goal then was to quickly get dollars out the door to support our  Nation's job creators during this time of crisis. But now, our Nation  as a whole has learned much more about this pandemic. We have learned  how to safely go about our lives.   This bill is a disingenuous attempt to posture to small businesses by  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. If Democrats were serious  about helping restaurants and small businesses, they would have called  for an end to the ever-changing mandates and lockdowns that forced so  many businesses to close their doors. They would have accepted my  amendment during committee to adequately fund this program from the  start. They would have considered my bill when it was introduced in  July, the ENTREE Act, which responsibly refills the Restaurant  Revitalization Program and is fully paid for, which this bill we are  here for today is not.   When the government attempts to solve problems without the input of  small businesses, they create more problems, Mr. Speaker.   Have my Democrat counterparts on the other side ever asked a small  business owner if they are now capable of opening and operating safely?   Have they ever asked them whether they can now unlock their doors,  turn on their lights, and protect their workers?   Have they ever asked them if they are able to now welcome customers  and community members back into their storefronts carefully?   I have, and the answer from small businesses is a resounding yes.   Small businesses are some of the most innovative and nimble  enterprises in America. They can pivot quickly, and most importantly,  they can adapt to any situation with speed.   They are the entrepreneurs of our country that drive our country.  They can figure out how to slice the bread thinner. They know how to do  this. We saw this over the last 2 years.   At this time, small businesses need the freedom to operate  independently without Washington watching over them. We must end the  COVID economy of government handouts.   Furthermore, this bill creates another new grant program at the SBA.  The SBA, in my judgment, is incapable of operating grant programs.   Let's briefly examine how they have performed over the last 2 years,  Mr. Speaker. The Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, known as EIDL,  is filled with fraud and identity theft issues. This is per the IG, the  inspector general, in his report.   The SBA is a black hole when it comes to answering questions for  constituent businesses. We have all had businesses in our district  struggle with getting information for the grant application.   Frankly, this direct lending and direct grant program in the SBA has  been a disaster with a 30 percent fraud rate. That is the IG report  number. Yet, the SBA continues to defer EIDL payments.   The second program was the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program.  The SVOG was signed into law in December 2020. Disappointingly, and  after long delays, the SBA attempted to launch this program in April, 4  months later.   My colleagues and I sent multiple letters to the SBA regarding this  delay. The night before it went live, SBA's inspector general sent out  a warning signal. He said: SBA, you are not ready to do this. You are  not up and running yet.   But did they listen? Of course not. They went ahead anyway, and  within hours, the whole program crashed. The program then took 2 more  months to launch.   This is unacceptable, Mr. Speaker. We have to do a better job than  this. They have to do a better job than this.   The last program was the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. I would like  to remind everyone that this program was woefully underfunded by my  Democrat colleagues.   However, more shocking was the fact that congressional Democrats, the  Biden administration, and the SBA prioritized certain businesses over  others. The RRF program was fundamentally unfair. They picked winners  and losers with American taxpayer dollars.  [[Page H4406]]                                     time  0930    It was so bad, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals declared this  program unconstitutional, Mr. Speaker. They declared the whole program  unconstitutional.   The Court's majority opinion stated that the SBA injected explicit  racial and ethnic preferences into the priorities.   Enough is enough. If you judge the future by the past, as my dad once  said, it is clear the SBA is unable to properly and prudently manage  grant programs and safeguard American taxpayer dollars.   Not only does the SBA have a disastrous past of administering grant  programs, but any new dollars flowing will add fuel to the inflation  fire.   I want to be clear; this bill is supposedly paid for by recovered  funds. At best, this is an IOU, Mr. Speaker. It is not a real or  immediate offset. I agree that we need to track down and hold  fraudsters accountable, and I applaud that process. I support it  entirely. But this process takes time, and it is not going to get all  those dollars back.   For example, according to testimony provided by SBA's inspector  general at a hearing in January, the total recoveries by his office in  fiscal year 2021 was $4.2 billion. In the same testimony, and in  collaboration with Secret Service, the inspector general reports that  they have seized another $1 billion in the EIDL program. And lastly,  and, again, according to the IG, financial institutions returned  approximately $3.1 billion in fraudulent funding. That is not near  enough to cover the $55 billion that this program wants to spend.   Now more than ever, small businesses need to escape the overbearing  reach of the Federal Government.   If we want to help small businesses, then we need to stop this out- of-control spending. We should prioritize lowering taxes so small  business owners and their workers can keep more of their hard-earned  money. We must reduce regulations that bog small businesses down with  paperwork and compliance costs.   I would argue that the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is the reason we  have the good economy we have today because we continue to allow the  business individuals to keep their hard-earned dollars and invest them  as they see fit, whereas, if we tax them to death, those dollars come  out of the system, and we limit their ability to drive our economy.   We simply need to move on from this COVID economy.   In my judgment, this is an irresponsible bill. I urge my colleagues  to oppose it. This is about economic independence.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the majority leader's  remarks. I also support trying to help restaurants. That is the reason  we are here this morning.   But I do have a bill that is paid for that this one does not do. And  I think that the preferences that were allowed that were shown to be  unconstitutional is the reason we are here this morning, so we can find  a way to fund the rest of those folks, which I think is important for  our communities. And I agree, and I appreciate those remarks by the  leader.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams), the vice ranking member of the  Committee on Small Business and a small business champion in his own  right.    Mr. Speaker, I am not sure what ruthless, idiotic  ideology the gentleman was just talking about, but I think capitalism  is a pretty good ideology with which to generate the kind of activity  it takes to make an economy go. I think we saw the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act of 2017 has done that job.   Whenever they talk about the largest increase in employment history,  it is pretty easy to have a low bar when you start talking about where  we were in the pandemic. The bar you should be talking about is where  we were prior to the pandemic, and we are still below that number.   Mr. Speaker, it is exciting for me this morning to be able to yield  such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Meuser), who is the ranking member of the Small Business Subcommittee  on Economic Growth, Tax, and Capital Access.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining on each side?    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. Donalds), one of our  newest members on the committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne), who is the ranking  member on the Small Business Subcommittee on Oversight, Investigations,  and Regulations. In that position, she has been leading the way in  protecting small businesses.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Madam Speaker, we discussed this bill thoroughly this morning, and I  think everybody understands that we have a $42 billion section of it  that is wanting to help restaurants. I thoroughly support trying to get  restaurants back on their feet.   In fact, it has been mentioned a number of times, we have an  alternative bill called the ENTREE Act that actually fixed the  constitutional problem that existed because the bill as originally  structured, the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, was incorrectly  structured. It prioritized groups over something else and was quite  unconstitutional.   It was underfunded. I told everybody at the time that the bill came  through committee that was the case. I offered an amendment to try to  fix it, and it was defeated. Today, here we are trying to fix a bill  that I said wasn't structured right, it was underfunded, and we tried  to fix it.   I have a bill to do that. It is paid for. This bill suddenly has no  chance because it has never even been in committee yet. We can't get a  hearing on it.   Why? Who knows?   We have known for a long time we had this problem. Suddenly, last  Friday this particular bill shows up, and now, all of a sudden, we  recognize we have a problem. We have said this for a long, long time, 6  months or more already.   Number two, we have a second part of this which hasn't been discussed  very much this morning, which are the hardest-hit industries. We have  $13 billion there. I can guarantee you, Madam Speaker, this isn't going  to come close to fixing that problem. If you open this up to every  single business that has been hard hit, we are going to wind up being  back here--which is fine--but I am just telling you right now this is  not going to fix it.   I think one of the comments made earlier was that this bill is about  economic resilience. I think our businesses are resilient. That is why  our economy has continued to bounce back. But it is not going to be  resilient if we strangle it with higher inflation, pouring more money  into this, higher energy prices, and more regulation.   This is about freeing up the entrepreneurial spirit of our people and  our small businesses that drive this country, taking those burdens off,  lowering inflation, quit spending money we don't have, and give them  the support they need instead of choking them off with all these other  sorts of things.    We have a bill before us that can fix this if we allow it to come up.  But we are not doing it this morning. Instead, we have a bill that is  poorly structured again. I guarantee you, Madam Speaker, it is not  funded correctly either. We are trying to find a way to claw back money  which we don't even know for sure if we can. We have got some so far,  but we don't have enough.   So where is the rest of it going to come from?   It is going to be printed. That is not how we should operate as a  Congress. That is not what the American people expect of us. They  deserve better than this.   Madam Speaker, let me just close by saying that enough is enough.   Whenever we don't let alternatives be heard, to be able to hear the  voice of the minority and to be able to be heard, then we don't have a  bipartisan atmosphere that this body should be operating under.   When you have one-party rule and you throw bills on the floor without  going through proper order, this is what you get--another bill that is  poorly structured, that is not going to have a chance in the Senate  because nobody has worked together to find a way to solve a problem  which we all recognize exists.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
