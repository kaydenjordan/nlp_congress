 Mr. Speaker, last week, we celebrated our Nation's  birthday, a day that conjures up images of flags and fireworks, family  barbecues and patriotic parades.   But in my district, the dominant image on July 4 was a mint green  child's bicycle. That little green bike lay untouched in the street in  the Kingsessing neighborhood for days after it was abandoned by its  innocent owner when a man wearing combat gear and a mask stalked his  neighbors, shooting randomly, killing five and injuring four others.  One of the victims was 13. Another was on his dinner break from work.  Two-year old twins  [[Page H3483]]  and their mother were injured when their family car came under fire.   My district was not the only one that was the scene of such horrors  during the holiday week. There were mass shootings in Baltimore, Fort  Worth, and Wichita.   From sea to shining sea, on a day when we should have been  celebrating the greatness of our Nation and the blessings of liberty,  we saw senseless, needless death and destruction.                                time  1015    With the memory of the Highland Park shooting last July Fourth  reinforced by more recent shootings, people across the country decided  to skip parades and public celebrations because they were afraid of  being shot.   Today is the 175th day of 2023, and so far this year, there have been  over 370 mass shootings.   The bloodshed is daily. American families are scared and traumatized.   Americans are tired of living in fear at the grocery store, church,  school, community celebrations, and parades. It does not have to be  like this.   There are commonsense laws that can stem the bloodshed of gun  violence, and House Democrats are committed to passing them.   On June 13, House Democrats introduced three discharge petitions that  would ban assault weapons like the one used by the Kingsessing shooter  last week; require universal background checks, which have been proven  to prevent shooters from obtaining weapons; and close the Charleston  loophole.   Those bills should get a vote, and Members of this House should be  willing to put on the record where they stand.   We have other bills that would ban ghost guns, which the shooter also  carried, and implement red flag laws, which have been proven to save  lives by preventing suicides and allowing law enforcement to remove  weapons from troubled individuals--again, like the Kingsessing  shooter--before they kill someone.   These are bills that we know have the power to save lives, and they  are popular, too.   Republicans in Congress just need the courage, the guts, to act.  Anyone without the guts to act allows this unending epidemic of mass  shootings to continue.   Americans do not and should not have to live like this. We don't need  more neighborhoods with devastated families, abandoned children's  bicycles, and people afraid to leave their homes.   Mr. Speaker, I will continue fighting to protect your families and  mine, and I urge every Member of this body to join me.                            ____________________
