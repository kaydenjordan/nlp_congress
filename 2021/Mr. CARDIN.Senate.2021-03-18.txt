 Mr. President, today, I am introducing, along with  Senator Wicker, a resolution that celebrates Romani American heritage.   As a member of the U.S. Helsinki Commission and the OSCE  Parliamentary Assembly Special Representative on Anti-Semitism, Racism  and Intolerance, I have long worked to improve the situation of Roma  throughout the OSCE region. This includes efforts to advance human  rights compliant policing, ending ethnic and religious profiling,  supporting diversity and inclusion in the U.S. national security  workforce and human rights training for foreign service officers, and  supporting free and fair elections in the OSCE participating States. I  also supported the appointment of Dr. Ethel Brooks to the U.S.  Holocaust Memorial Museum Council, on which I also currently serve.   The resolution we are introducing today does four things.   First, it recognizes and celebrates Romani American heritage. Roma  have come to the United States with every wave of European migration  since the colonial period. In the United States, there may be as many  as one million Americans with some Romani ancestry, whether distant or  more recent. Romani people have made distinct and important  contributions in many fields, including agriculture, art, crafts,  literature, medicine, military service, music, sports, and science.   Second, it supports International Roma Day and the Department of  State's robust engagement in activities to that occasion. In 1971, on  April 8th, 1971, the First World Romani Congress met in London,  bringing Roma together from across Europe and the United States with  the goal of promoting transnational cooperation among Roma, combating  social marginalization, and building a positive future for Roma  everywhere. April 8th is now celebrated as ``International Roma Day''  around the world. U.S. ambassadors and our embassies across Europe are  frequently asked to participate in April 8th celebrations across the  region. I commend the important work they are doing as they demonstrate  U.S. commitment to inclusive societies not only on April 8th, but also  throughout the year.   Third, this resolution commemorates the destruction of the so-called  ``Gypsy Family Camp'' at Auschwitz. It is estimated that between  200,000 and 500,000 Romani people were killed in death camps and  elsewhere throughout Europe. On August 2-3, 1944, Nazis murdered  between 4,200 and 4,300 Romani men, women, and children in gas chambers  when the Nazis decided to liquidate this camp. A number of governments  in recent years have taken important steps to commemorate the genocide  of Roma, to remember the victims, and educate future generations.  Germany took an important step when it opened in Berlin a memorial for  Sinti and Roma victims of National Socialism. I also welcome the Czech  government's decision to remove the pig farm at the site of the Lety  concentration camp the role of the Museum of Romani Culture in ensuring  a proper memorialization of that sensitive site.   Finally, this resolution commends the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum  for its critically important role in promoting remembrance of the  Holocaust and educating audiences about the genocide of Roma. The U.S.  Holocaust Memorial Museum is the preeminent federal institution  dedicated to serving as a living memorial to the Holocaust. I am  honored to serve as a member of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum  Council, and I welcome the initiatives of the Museum to ensure that  Romani victims are remembered and that related scholarship is  supported.   I am pleased that Sen. Wicker has joined me in introducing this  resolution and urge other colleagues to join us in celebrating Romani  American heritage.                            ____________________
