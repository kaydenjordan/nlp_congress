 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to President  Biden's executive order to revoke the permit for the Keystone pipeline.   This decision was political, provides no benefit to the environment,  and it came at a cost of approximately 11,000 good-paying American  jobs.   President Biden cited concerns regarding climate change for his  reason on stopping the pipeline. But under President Obama and Vice  President Joe Biden, the State Department conducted a review and found  the pipeline to have minimal impact on the environment.   Now, instead of having the pipeline, the oil from Canada will now be  transported in less safe ways like trucks and railways.   Axing the Keystone pipeline destroyed thousands of jobs, won't reduce  the greenhouse gas emissions, and only will deepen the divide on the  issue of climate change.                            ____________________
