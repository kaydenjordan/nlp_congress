 Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in  strong support of the CAPTA reauthorization measure that is before the  House today.   I want to thank Chairman Scott and Ranking Member Foxx for their  leadership and for the bipartisan work on this legislation that has  brought us to this point.   This measure provides an overdue but critical reauthorization of  programs authorized under the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act  (CAPTA). These changes would, among others, address child abuse and  neglect related to families impacted by substance use disorders, racial  bias in the child protective services system, and improving efforts to  combat child sexual abuse.   The bill also contains language based on my Family Poverty is Not  Child Neglect Act, which aims to stop families from being ripped apart  not because of neglect or abuse, but for issues rooted in poverty. In  these situations, services to help families and support them and their  children are a much better approach than family separation.   I appreciate the support from the chairman and bipartisan support and  efforts of Rep. Susie Lee and Rep. Bob Good to ensure this language was  included in the bill.   I also worked with Rep. Joseph Morelle and Rep. Van Taylor to include  the Study and Report on Marital Age of Consent examining the prevalence  of forced child marriages in the United States and their impact on  children's safety and well-being.   I am pleased that we are taking steps to refresh and strengthen our  efforts, with states and local authorities, to protect our children. I  urge my colleagues to vote yes.
