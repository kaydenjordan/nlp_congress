 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 504, I call  up the bill (H.R. 3005) to direct the Joint Committee on the Library to  replace the bust of Roger Brooke Taney in the Old Supreme Court Chamber  of the United States Capitol with a bust of Thurgood Marshall to be  obtained by the Joint Committee on the Library and to remove certain  statues from areas of the United States Capitol which are accessible to  the public, to remove all statues of individuals who voluntarily served  the Confederate States of America from display in the United States  Capitol, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. It directs the Joint  Committee on the Library to replace the bust of Chief Justice Roger  Taney in the Old Supreme Court Chamber with a bust of Justice Thurgood  Marshall. It also directs the removal of statues and busts of  individuals who served the Confederacy, and other white supremacists.   The United States Capitol is a beacon of democracy, freedom, and  equality, visited by millions of people each year before COVID hit, and  soon we hope to be visited by millions of people again. What and who we  choose to honor in this building must represent our values.   Chief Justice Taney, who, in the Dred Scott decision, declared that  African Americans could never be citizens of the United States and had  no constitutional rights, does not meet this standard; and neither do  the white supremacists and Confederates we continue to honor with  statues today.   Justice Taney's decision continued and permitted the expansion of  slavery. Those who founded, served, and fought for the Confederacy were  willing to spill American blood in defense of it.   In his infamous Cornerstone Speech, Confederate Vice President  Alexander Stephens said that slavery and white supremacy were the  cornerstone of the Confederacy.   There is no shortage of American figures like Justice Thurgood  Marshall, the first African American to serve on the Supreme Court,  more deserving of the honor of being displayed in our Capitol.   There are some who argue that this action is an attempt to erase and  forget our history. Nothing could be further from the truth. We must  never forget our Nation's shameful periods of slavery, segregation, and  racism.   This is, instead, about who we choose to honor, who we choose to  literally put on the pedestal and display as emblematic of our values.   We are just months removed from January 6, when a mob of  insurrectionists looking to violently overturn a Presidential election  stormed this very building. During that awful attack, the same  Confederate flag carried into battle against the United States in the  19th century was again carried into battle against the United States  and into this very Capitol.   It is long past time to remove from a place of honor in our Nation's  Capitol the statues and busts of those who favored war against the  United States in support of the so-called government founded on a  cornerstone of racism and white supremacy.   Outside the Old Supreme Court Chamber, before you get to the Taney  bust, you pass another sculpture, which depicts the figures of History  and Justice. Today, we can demonstrate to the Nation and the world that  we have learned from our history and we continue to pursue justice.   Put another way, we can follow the advice of the great American poet  and civil rights activist Maya Angelou. This is what she said: ``Do the  best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do  better.''   Let us now show ourselves and the world that we are who we claim to  be. Let us do better.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  3005, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, before yielding to the gentleman from  North Carolina, I would like to correct the record. The Joint Committee  on the Library organized last Wednesday. Until last Wednesday, the  Joint Committee was chaired by Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a  Republican Senator, and I have now been chair for 6 days and hope to  act promptly on the North Carolina matter.   Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Butterfield), the distinguished chair of the Election Subcommittee  in the House Administration Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, before yielding, I just want to note, for purposes of  clarifying the historical record, that the Republicans of the 19th  century and the early 20th century bear almost no resemblance to the  Republican Party of today. Similarly, the Democratic Party bears no  resemblance to the Democratic Party of the 19th and early 20th  centuries. They are the same parties in name only.   In the 19th century, the Republicans were generally the party of the  northerners, and the Democrats were the party of the South, and that  has switched.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the majority whip. We are so lucky to  have as our whip someone who started his public service as a fighter  for civil rights. Like our colleague, the late John Lewis, our whip put  his life on the line for civil rights and for voting rights.    Madam Speaker, just a note of the process. In fact,  Arkansas is now selecting an artist to develop the Bates statue that  has to be approved before we can proceed. Meanwhile, even though they  want to get rid of that statue, it stays here. If we pass this bill,  the statue will be gone while Arkansas pursues a replacement.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin), my colleague, a member of the Committee on House  Administration, and a scholar and former constitutional law professor.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green).    Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time remains on both  sides.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Bass).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader.    Well, the other speakers we are expecting I think are  caught up in a long appropriations markup, so you may proceed. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Just a couple of clarifications because I think it may be confusing  to the general public hearing about what is really a rather arcane  process for States to add and remove statues.   The Joint Committee on the Library ultimately approves it, but the  process is driven by the States, the Architect of the Capitol does all  of the heavy lifting, looking at the statues, making sure that the  replacement statue meets the engineering requirements and the like. I  would just like to note that until last Wednesday, Senator Roy Blunt  was chair of the Joint Committee on the Library, and I have been chair  of the Joint Committee on the Library now for 6 days.                                time  1630    In that time, I actually have approved the reopening of the Botanical  Gardens. I have approved the replacement of the Kansas statue that I  received the letter on Friday. And I have just received the information  on North Carolina, and I plan to work on that very hard and, hopefully,  very promptly get a decision.   So I don't think that speaks to undue delay in the 6 days that I have  been chair of the Joint Committee on the Library.   I do think it is important that we take the step to remove these  Confederates and segregationists and pro-slavery statues from our  Statuary Hall. In some cases, States have either started the steps to  remove them. But while that process is ongoing, these individuals are  on a pedestal. And we cannot forget our history, but we don't have to  put segregationists and pro-slavery historical figures on a pedestal.  We don't honor them, although we do remember them.   So let's adopt this measure to deal with those statues.   But there is another thing. There are situations such as the statue  of Justice Taney that were not sent here by any State, and only we can  remove them expeditiously. We have said, and we have heard from people  more eloquent than I about why Justice Taney should not be honored.   In 1865, a few years before the Taney bust was ultimately  commissioned, the Senate debated it. They debated whether to commission  the bust of Justice Taney for the Supreme Court room. And during that  debate, Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts said this: ``I object  to that; that now an emancipated country should make a bust to the  author of the Dred Scott decision. Judgment is beginning now; and an  emancipated country will fasten upon him the stigma which he  deserves.''   Now, it may have taken longer than Senator Sumner envisioned, in  fact, 156 years to attach the stigma that belongs to Justice Taney, but  we will attach that stigma today if we pass this bill.   In closing, I just want to say that all of us are here for a few  years. Some longer, some shorter, but we are just here for a little  slice of history. And I feel fortunate that my little slice of history  allowed me to be here the same time as the late John Lewis. I can  almost imagine him standing here on the floor. How fortunate I am to  have served with him. And how fortunate I am to serve with our majority  whip, Mr. Clyburn, who put his body on the line to fight against  segregation and to fight for voting rights. They are leaders of our  country. I am proud to serve with them. Let's show how much we honor  them by voting for this bill.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
