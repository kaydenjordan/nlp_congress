 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mohawk Valley  Community College on its historic 75th anniversary this year.   MVCC first opened its doors to students in October of 1946. Back then  it was known as New York State Institute of Applied Arts and Science.  Since those early days, MVCC has grown tremendously and today boasts  more than 6,000 full- or part-time students. MVCC was founded on the  principle of adapting its programs to fit the needs of our region, and,  boy, they have done that.   It has played an important role in developing our workforce and  empowering students to achieve their goals and be of service to our  community.   MVCC molds students into leaders and continues to be an incredible  institution for our community. It is one of the great 11 colleges and  universities in New York's 22nd District.   I want to personally thank President Randy VanWagoner for his  leadership and wish MVCC the greatest successes over the next 75 years.   I am grateful to MVCC for all they have done, and for being a college  near my neighborhood.               Congratulating Canastota Girls Field Hockey Team     Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the Canastota  Girls Field Hockey team, for becoming the New York State section III  class C champions after a win this weekend. Way to go girls.   The Canastota Raiders prevailed 3 to 1 against Vernon-Verona-Sherrill  in a dramatic battle for the class C championship.   Chance Jaquin, Kory Matteson, and MacKenzie Snyder all scored goals  for the Raiders, sealing the victory. The Raiders have now won 11  straight games and will face off against Little Falls for the State  playoffs this week.   I am wishing them all the best as they prepare for the championship  game this week. I also want to congratulate Vernon-Verona-Sherrill on  what I know was a hard-fought season. I wish the best of luck to the  girls.                     Honoring the Life of Majeedah Razzaq     Mr. Speaker, today, I recognize a Binghamton woman who  was a larger than life, a fixture at community events, a staple in the  very communities that needed her most, and the adopted grandma of kids  who looked up to her for advice through adolescence and well into  adulthood.    As a life skills coach, Majeedah Razzaq used her own mix of street  psychology with a strong dose of rule enforcement, consistency, and  most of all, accountability. In her work with Greater Opportunities for  Broome, Ms. Razzaq was a fighter for local issues, someone who  encouraged and worked for new investments in local communities,  investments in the children who needed it most.   As a staple at the city of Binghamton's Community Development  Advisory Committee, Ms. Razzaq had a unique ability to sort through the  fluff, then address the real issues. Ms. Razzaq lived an amazing life  which, unfortunately, was cut short this past winter by COVID-19.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to please join me and the citizens  of Broome County, New York, in remembering and honoring Majeedah Razzaq  for her years of community service. Binghamton and the Southern Tier  were lucky to have such a beautiful person advocating on their behalf.   May God bless her soul.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask where is the  administration? It is certainly not at our southern border. The crisis  at the border continues to go unaddressed.   In September, more than 192,000 illegal immigrants were apprehended  by our Border Patrol agents. That is a 233 percent increase over last  September, and DHS has warned this month we could see as many as  400,000.   Mr. Speaker, I ask: Where are my Democrat colleagues on this crisis?   Under the leadership of the other side of the aisle, this House has  not considered a single piece of meaningful legislation to address the  issue. The strategy appears to be pretend as if the problem doesn't  exist. Meanwhile, a record 1.2 million people have been caught trying  to cross the border illegally this year. Imagine how many tens of  thousands have evaded capture--who might be dangerous to our local  communities--and made it into this country.   Rather than solving this crisis, this body is instead considering  legislation that will pave the way for mass amnesty. It is  irresponsible.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to step up, come to the table, hold  real bipartisan discussions and focus on this crisis.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Velazquez and Ranking  Member Luetkemeyer, as well as Representative Phillips and  Representative Meuser, the cosponsors of H.R. 4481, the Small Business  7(a) Loan Agent Transparency Act, for their work on this bill.   The Small Business Administration's 7(a) loan program leverages the  private sector and community banks to expand capital to small  businesses at affordable rates. Throughout my district, this program  has provided countless small businesses the resources they need to  expand their operations and hire additional employees. Small businesses  still dominate in my district.   Today, these loans have taken on even more importance, allowing  employers to stay solvent through the pandemic. Overwhelming bipartisan  majorities in Congress have voted to increase the size and loan limit  of the program because of its vital importance.                                time  1315    These past 2 years have also shown us there is still room for  improvement. While the SBA can currently track loans originating from  lenders, it cannot do the same for loans originating from loan brokers  or agents. That lack of transparency must be addressed.   That is why I support H.R. 4481, the 7(a) Loan Agent Transparency  Act. The bill will correct this shortcoming and protect the 7(a) loan  program and taxpayer funds. As an outspoken advocate for transparency  and New York taxpayers, I am pleased to see this legislation move  forward.   This bill will allow SBA to evaluate the performance of loan agents,  permitting businesses and policymakers to see who is most effective in  helping employers secure financing. It will also make it easier for SBA  to spot fraud and track bad actors who abuse taxpayer resources.   I urge my colleagues to stand with small business owners and  taxpayers today and pass the bipartisan 7(a) Loan Agent Transparency  Act.
