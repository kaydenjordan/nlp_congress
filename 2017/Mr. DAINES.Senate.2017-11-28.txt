 Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk  that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I object to further proceeding.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 343, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
