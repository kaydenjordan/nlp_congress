On any legislative day during the period from       November 1, 2019, through November 11, 2019--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 5.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 4 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.

Sec. 7.  Each day during the period addressed by section 4       of this resolution shall not constitute a legislative day for       purposes of clause 7 of rule XV.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko),  pending which I yield myself such time as I  [[Page H8551]]  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, the Rules Committee met last night and  reported House Resolution 656, providing for consideration of H.R. 823,  the Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy Act; H.R. 1373, the Grand  Canyon Centennial Protection Act; and H.R. 2181, the Chaco Cultural  Heritage Protection Act, each under a structured rule.   The rule provides each bill with 1 hour of general debate equally  divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking member of the  Committee on Natural Resources. The rule makes in order 13 amendments  total: 10 Republican amendments and 3 Democratic amendments. The rule  also provides each bill with a motion to recommit.   Finally, the rule provides recess instructions from November 1  through November 11.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bills in this rule: H.R.  823, H.R. 1373, and H.R. 2181. These important bills recognize the need  to protect unique and irreplaceable American landscapes--public lands  that belong to all of us, not to the highest bidder and not to any  individual Representative or party.   President Theodore Roosevelt once said: ``Of all the questions which  can come before this Nation . . . there is none which compares in  importance with the great central task of leaving this land even a  better land for our descendants than it is for us.''   And that is what these three bills attempt to do. They represent the  culmination of years of locally driven efforts. These bills protect  some of our most iconic lands and resources.   H.R. 823 is the result of collaborative efforts among a diverse set  of local stakeholders with a shared interest in providing long-term  protections for public lands in Colorado. The bill builds on earlier  proposals to protect roughly 400,000 acres of public lands for the  benefit of the people of Colorado and all Americans.   H.R. 2181 would withdraw lands within a longstanding, 10-mile buffer  zone around the Chaco Culture National Historical Park. This withdrawal  would protect an ancestral site for the Puebloan and Tribal  communities. It would prevent damage to previously undiscovered  cultural resources. Chaco Culture National Historical Park, a UNESCO  World Heritage Site, was the hub of trade and culture for thousands of  ancestral Puebloans from 1850 to 1250 A.D.   Lastly, H.R. 1373 would permanently prohibit new mining claims on  approximately 1 million acres of public land surrounding Grand Canyon  National Park, the crown jewel of our National Park System--of course,  not counting Everglades National Park or Biscayne National Park in  south Florida.   In south Florida, we are all too familiar with what can happen if we  fail to protect our most vulnerable and most unique lands and waters.  Whether the Everglades, Big Cypress, and the Miami River or the Grand  Canyon, Chaco Culture National Historical Park, and public lands in  Colorado, we have a deep obligation to conserve and restore these  lands. And science tells us, as the climate crisis intensifies, these  efforts have never been more urgent.   Mr. Speaker, I proudly support these historic steps forward. Let us  pass these bills.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared  to close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, with all due respect to my distinguished colleague and  friend from Arizona, these bills recognize that some places, lands that  belong to Coloradans, to Arizonans, to the ancestral Pueblo peoples,  belong to all Americans, and they are just too precious to exploit.   I would like to close, once again, by quoting our conservation  President, Teddy Roosevelt. ``We have fallen heirs to the most glorious  heritage a people ever received, and each one must do his part if we  wish to show that the Nation is worthy of this good fortune.''   Mr. Speaker, today we are doing our part.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Lesko is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 656         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 8. That immediately upon adoption of this resolution,       the House shall resolve into the Committee of the Whole House       on the state of the Union for consideration of the resolution       (H. Res. 659) affirming that States should maintain primacy       for the regulation of hydraulic fracturing for oil and       natural gas production on State and private lands and that       the President should not declare a moratorium on the use of       hydraulic fracturing on Federal lands (including the Outer       Continental Shelf), State lands, private lands, or lands held       in trust for an Indian Tribe unless such moratorium is       authorized by an Act of Congress. The first reading of the       resolution shall be dispensed with. All points of order       against consideration of the resolution are waived. General       debate shall be confined to the resolution and shall not       exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair       and ranking minority member of the Committee on Natural       Resources. After general debate the resolution shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. All       points of order against provisions in the resolution are       waived. When the committee rises and reports the resolution       back to the House with a recommendation that the resolution       be adopted, the previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the resolution and amendments thereto to adoption       without intervening motion. If the Committee of the Whole       rises and reports that it has come to no resolution on the       resolution, then on the next legislative day the House shall,       immediately after the third daily order of business under       clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole       for further consideration of the resolution.        Sec. 9. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H. Res. 659.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the resolution affirming the United  States' record on the Armenian genocide. This resolution is long  overdue on the genocide of 1.5 million Armenians and thousands of  Maronites, Chaldeans, Amalekites, Assyrians, and others who were part  of the Ottoman Empire.   Mr. Speaker, my grandparents left the Ottoman Empire to escape that  genocide just ahead, but their relatives were not as lucky. My  grandparents were Maronites.   I remember my grandmother's tears as she spoke of their Armenian  friends and the many Maronites and Amalekites who were slaughtered by  the Ottoman Empire.   As a child, I remember the tears and the suffering of our Armenian  neighbors and the many members of the other communities whose tears I  could not erase.   As a child, I could not erase those tears, but for them, I proudly  support this resolution.
