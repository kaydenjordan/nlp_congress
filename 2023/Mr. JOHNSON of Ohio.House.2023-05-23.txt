 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in strong  support of H.R. 467 to make class-wide scheduling of fentanyl-related  substances permanent.   This hits close to home for me. I represent the men and women of  eastern Ohio, a region of the country that has been hit particularly  hard by this deadly drug. If the current order is allowed to expire,  law enforcement will lose their ability to seize some of these  fentanyl-related drugs. They will effectively be street legal.   Here are two staggering truths: Fentanyl poisonings are now the  number one cause of death in the country of adults between 18 and 49.  Over three-quarters of teen overdose deaths in 2021 were caused by  fentanyl. That is 75 percent. In many of these instances, those taking  the fentanyl had no idea they were doing so. That is what makes this  lethal and heavily addictive drug so dangerous.   Sadly, it is very clear that the Biden administration is not serious  about  [[Page H2521]]  solving this epidemic. If they were, they wouldn't be allowing our  southern border to be overrun by the cartels and their drug mules. Who  is paying the price for these policies and lack of border enforcement?  It is the families of those that have become addicted. It is those that  have overdosed and died from fentanyl. We have even had law enforcement  officials in eastern Ohio that have been exposed to fentanyl and almost  died during the conduct of their work busting up drug rings.   We should not be relaxing the penalties for that. We should be  stiffening the penalties for fentanyl. Just 19 grams of fentanyl, what  would fill a saltshaker in a restaurant, could kill 10,000 people.   Here is the bottom line: This legislation is necessary to make the  temporary class-wide scheduling order for fentanyl-related substances  permanent. If this body doesn't act, we should all be ashamed.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues Mr. Latta and Mr. Griffith for  their leadership here, and I urge quick and overwhelming passage of  this lifesaving bill.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 429, I  call up the joint resolution (S.J. Res. 11) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Environmental Protection Agency relating to ``Control  of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle  Standards'', and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on S.J. Res. 11.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 11, which rescinds EPA's  rule requiring impractical emission standards for heavy-duty trucks,  with huge new restrictions on F-250s, semitrucks, and everything in  between--trucks that not only deliver all the goods we rely on but also  trucks for our farmers and ranchers, building contractors and  landscapers, and countless other workers and small businesses that  quite literally keep our country running.  [[Page H2524]]    The EPA even acknowledges that the new standards are 80 percent more  stringent than existing emission standards, but the Agency ignores the  fact that new trucks already have 98 percent fewer nitrogen oxide  emissions than trucks manufactured 35 years ago.   At a certain point, you start to see diminishing returns.   EPA's regulatory efforts are just the latest step by the Biden  administration to electrify the transportation sector and burden  American families in the process. The Agency itself emphasizes that the  rule will cost truckers between $39 billion and $55 billion. In fact,  the rule is expected to increase the cost of a semitruck anywhere from  $8,000 to $42,000 per truck.   As we all know, the cost of these senseless regulations would  inevitably be passed on to the American consumer through higher retail  prices and increased inflation.   Ohio sits at the crossroads of America, and thousands of trucks  travel across my State to transport goods to my constituents and  businesses throughout the Nation. An unworkable rule like this one  would stop some of these deliveries, cause delays for many others, and  lead to shortages for some of our most basic staples.   We should ensure the delivery of essential goods and protect the  quality of life for all Americans by passing the resolution before us  today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S.J. Res. 11, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I once again have to point out that  we are not only fighting for the right kinds of policies, but we have  to fight against outrageous claims that are simply patently false.   That comment by my colleague that 100,000 people per year die from  air pollution, that was a figure from 1990. By 2019, that figure had  dropped to 60,000 people.   Now, that is not acceptable either, and I think one of the reasons  that it dropped so far was because NOX emissions from  truckers had dropped some 98 percent since the late 1980s. So, we are  already making great progress with this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Nehls), the sponsor of the House companion bill.    Mr. Speaker, I proudly yield 2\1/2\ minutes to  the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), the chair of the Energy  and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Weber), another very passionate member of the Energy  and Commerce Committee.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Allen), my good friend and another colleague from the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Idaho (Mr. Fulcher).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Palmer), my good friend and another member of the  Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentlewoman from Iowa.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong), the vice chair of the Committee on  Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this EPA rule would go into effect for model year 2027,  which is an extremely tight timeline for compliance. The Truckload  Carriers Association commented that the rule outpaces available  technology, which means there is not even technology there yet to do  the kinds of things that this rule is requiring.   I also point out that there are significant key groups that support  S.J. Res. 11: American Trucking Association, Owner-Operator Independent  Drivers Association, Transportation Intermediaries Association,  National Tank Truck Carriers, Truckload Carriers Association, and the  National Federation of Independent Businesses, which represents  literally thousands of small businesses, many of them small trucking  operations across America.   There are some very, very serious technical issues with this rule, as  well as some real economic concerns.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I will close by starting with something that Mr. Carter  from Georgia just reminded us all of: A Democratic-controlled Senate  passed S.J. Res. 11--a Democratic-controlled Senate. Democrats in the  Senate said that this rule is unnecessary and too onerous. They passed  the CRA, and they have asked us to do the same.   I heard several things today that I want to put an exclamation point  on. I heard from my colleague and my friend, the ranking member of the  Energy and Commerce Committee, that the EPA's job is to protect the air  and water, the environment.   I actually agree with that, but let's look at the environmental facts  that surround this particular rule--a 98 percent reduction in  NOX emissions since the late eighties and early nineties.  Look at the cost that this is going to place on the American economy:  $39 billion to $55 billion.   Many trucking companies are not going to be able to comply with this,  so they are not going to buy the new trucks. Instead, they are going to  continue to use the old trucks. It is going to defeat the very purpose  that this rule was set out to do in the first place. They are just  going to keep driving those trucks until they drive the tires off of  them.    I heard one of my Democratic colleagues say earlier that if we  overturn this rule by passing S.J. Res. 11, we are going to create an  unlivable future for our children and our grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, let me tell you what an unlivable future looks like in  rural America, where inflation is already at a 40-plus-year high.  Americans--parents and grandparents--are having to raise their own  grandchildren because of things like the drug epidemic and having to  work two jobs to make ends meet. They are having to choose between  putting fuel in the car and buying groceries or paying the electric  bill or having health insurance. That is an unlivable future.   When we do something like this rule that continues to cause inflation  to go up and up, it puts more strain on American families who are  living paycheck to paycheck.   I also heard the term ``environmental justice.'' What about  environmental injustice? Mr. Speaker, come to Appalachia. Ride up and  down the roads and see the farmhouses where people live paycheck to  paycheck and where they struggle like I just described.   The EPA puts forward rules that have no consideration for the  economic impacts on the people whom it is going to hurt the worst.  Those are the people who get up every day and put their work clothes  on.   Ninety-six percent of the trucking industry are small operators.  Ninety-six percent are small fleet companies. They are the ones who are  the least able to go out and buy this new technology, and they are the  ones who are going to more quickly go under and go out of business  because of this onerous rule.   Mr. Speaker, this CRA is the right thing to do. Democrats in the  Senate said so, and Republicans in the Senate said so. I urge today in  the U.S. House that we also say so. Tell the EPA this is a bridge too  far.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S.J. Res. 11. Let's  overturn this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
