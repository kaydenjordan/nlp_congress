 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 44) providing for a joint  hearing of the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives  and the Senate to receive a presentation from the Comptroller General  of the United States regarding the audited financial statement of the  executive branch, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                              H. Con.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I don't have to tell you that these are partisan  times. We don't often get to consider something that is supported by  both Democrats on the Rules Committee and Republicans on the Rules  Committee. Not only that, an idea that was also recommended by the  truly bipartisan Select Committee on the Modernization of the Congress.   That is what we have before us with H. Con. Res. 44, the Fiscal State  of the Nation Resolution.   This measure from Congresswoman Rice of New York is coming before us  at an especially important time, a time that finds us discussing  matters like the debt ceiling, government spending, transportation, and  reconciliation legislation.   It requires the director of the Government Accountability Office to  deliver an annual address to a joint hearing of the House and Senate  Budget Committees on the financial position and condition of the  Federal Government.   Members of the media would be able to cover the hearing so the  American people and not just the Members of Congress can better  understand the realities about what we face today; all with the goal,  Madam Speaker, of promoting greater transparency surrounding our  Nation's fiscal health. That way, we have more clarity as Congress  makes spending decisions in the months and years ahead that will impact  every single American.   A companion measure has already been introduced in the United States  Senate, since the House alone cannot tell our friends on the other side  of the Capitol what to do; although, I must admit, sometimes I wish we  could, Madam Speaker.   There are more than 100 cosponsors of this resolution. As I said  earlier, the Select Committee on the Modernization of the Congress has  already recommended this concept in their final report of the 116th  Congress. I think that is because of a simple reason: We all want to  make the most informed spending decisions and develop the most sensible  ways to combat our debt.   You can't properly address these issues unless you fully understand  them. With this resolution, through the work of the House and Senate  Budget Committees, we can all better understand the fiscal reality that  we face.   Don't get me wrong, Madam Speaker, I am sure we will still have many  debates on this floor about what to do in response. I sure as hell  would never support anything that punishes the very Americans who can  least afford it.   For example, when we talk about fiscal health, I want us to  acknowledge that America's tax code rewards wealth and power at the  expense of working families. There has been a dramatic reduction in  taxes paid by the very rich in this country over the last 60 years.   So when some say all we need to do is cut, cut, cut, I have to say I  get a little confused. I think cutting Medicare, privatizing Social  Security, and slashing funding for important programs that help working  families is an awful idea.   Instead, I want those at the top to contribute their fair share and  pay it  [[Page H6135]]  forward so everyone else can access the opportunities and possibilities  they get to enjoy.   Let me also say, taking on big problems will cost money. But in the  long run, the consequences of an action oftentimes will be more  expensive. Hunger is an issue that I deeply care about. It is estimated  to cost Americans over $160 billions every year in lost productivity  and poor healthcare outcomes.   In contrast, it would cost us just a fraction of that number to  completely end hunger in America. By investing in solutions up front,  we can often save a boatload of money and pass on those savings to the  American taxpayer.                                time  1245    Now, many Members on my side feel the same way. But I get it. Many of  my Republican friends probably view things differently. We can have  those debates here on the floor and in the relevant committees. But  because of this resolution, hopefully, Democrats and Republicans and  Members of the House and Senate would at least be dealing with the same  set of facts.   John Adams called facts stubborn things, and I have to tell you,  Madam Speaker, he was absolutely right. But sometimes, it can feel like  each side uses different statistics to talk past each other.   This measure will, hopefully, help ground our discussions about  fiscal policy, so I urge all of my colleagues to join with the more  than 100 Members of this body who support this resolution and with the  Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress, which recommended  this idea.   Let's allow Members of the House and Senate to hear directly from the  GAO so that we can follow the facts and make better informed decisions  about our Nation's bottom line.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from the State of Washington (Mr. Kilmer), who is the  distinguished chairman of the Select Committee on the Modernization of  Congress.    Madam Speaker, I would just say to the gentleman I  would hate to hear what he would say if he actually opposed the bill.  But the bottom line is the bills that we are trying to move through  this Chamber right now that would be transformational are fully paid  for. I just can't be lectured by anybody who advocated for a tax cut  bill that benefited mostly the wealthy and well-off in this country  that was not paid for at all and that added $2 trillion right to our  debt. So spare me the lectures.   I reserve the balance of my time, Madam Speaker.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I would just remind the gentleman this is a bipartisan  bill put forward by a bipartisan commission, and I am glad to hear him  talking about the debt. I wish some of my colleagues would have talked  about it when they controlled the House and the White House, but the  debt that we are talking about was accumulated by Republican Presidents  and Republican Congresses and Democratic Presidents and Democratic  Congresses.    President Biden has only been in office 9 months, and the spending  that he is proposing is to be fully paid for, with a recognition that  we do not want to see an increase in our deficits and our debt.   But this is a bipartisan moment, and we should celebrate it. But  maybe I am sounding a little eccentric when I say that.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, this is a bipartisan resolution. It was presented to  us by a bipartisan select committee. I think we should all appreciate  this particular moment.   It is about making sure that Congress is provided a presentation of  the facts about our Nation's fiscal health as we make decisions that  will impact America's bottom line. Democrats and Republicans could then  fight it out over the next steps. We have different priorities and  different values on a lot of things.                                time  1300    But there should be no disagreement about this resolution right now.  And, surely, even in this day and age, we can all still agree on the  need to get the facts in the light of day for us and the people who we  represent.   Again, I want to thank Congresswoman Rice from New York for her  leadership on this issue, and I want to thank my colleague on the Rules  Committee Congressman Burgess for cosponsoring this legislation. There  should be no controversy over this.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my  legislation, H. Con. Res. 44, the Fiscal State of the Nation  resolution.   This resolution would require the Comptroller General of the United  States to present an annual report on the fiscal health of the federal  government to a joint hearing of the House and Senate Budget  Committees, open to ALL members of Congress.   This nonpartisan presentation will offer an objective analysis of the  nation's finances and allow Congress to demonstrate to the public that  we are serious about improving our fiscal decision-making.   As we finalize historic investments to rebuild our infrastructure and  help families and small businesses recover from this pandemic, it is  more important than ever that we act as responsible stewards of the  American people's tax dollars.   Every lawmaker, citizen, and media outlet should be able to reference  a single, unbiased source when discussing the current and future fiscal  health of our country. And the Fiscal State of the Nation would provide  that valuable information with transparency and accuracy.   I'm incredibly proud this bipartisan resolution has garnered over 100  cosponsors, almost evenly split between Democratic and Republican  members.   I'd like to thank my friend, Representative Andy Barr from Kentucky,  for co-leading this legislation with me, and I urge its swift passage  on the Floor today.
