 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), my friend, the majority leader of the House.    Mr. Speaker, there are a few bills that we have been  hearing might come that weren't discussed, and I know the gentleman  alluded to the CHIPS Act. I know the Senate still hasn't finalized  anything there. We are hearing they may.   There are some other bills we have been hearing might come over. Of  course, it seems like we keep hearing talk that something on Build Back  Better may come back over on budget reconciliation, whether it is the  trillion plus, whether it is something different, whether we would come  back in August to deal with that.   I don't know if the gentleman can touch on what he might be hearing  from the Senate, and if there would be any plans beyond next week to  come back in August where it is currently not scheduled to be a  legislative period that we would be in session. I am not sure if the  gentleman is willing to share that, but I will yield.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I appreciate  especially the concern about that first 2 weeks because as with my  family and a lot of families, those first few weeks where the families  are still together before everybody goes back to school, you know, a  lot of plans are made.   We have a lot of work to do. We also have families, and you don't  want to, you know, lose that element of having people be able to spend  the time back in their districts and back with their families. If  schedules have to change, at least give some lead time. I know Members  on both sides appreciate that.   Clearly, a lot of this depends on what the Senate does or doesn't do.  For those of us that would prefer the Senate work in a bipartisan way  or especially work in a way that focused on addressing and being aware  of the inflationary problems in the country, and, of course, we just  saw last week, 9.1 percent inflation, 40-year high, a lot of that  driven by the spending in Washington.                                time  1215    There is still talk that the Senate is trying to reach some agreement  that would lead to a potential large amount of tax increases. A  trillion dollars is a number that keeps being thrown around. It seems  like trillions of dollars keep getting thrown around to the point where  inflation has gotten out of control from the spending.   We all know how much families are paying for so many things: gas  prices, when they go to the grocery stores, all the things that they  buy, if they can afford to buy them, those things are dramatically  higher.   Hopefully, the Senate doesn't keep adding to that inflation by coming  up with more ways to spend money that we don't have. We will see.   There is also talk that as part of the ObamaCare subsidies--you know,  that is an entirely different conversation--that bill still needs heavy  subsidies that are not affordable, but they are talking about drug  price controls that would be paired with that.  [[Page H6944]]    Again, more a message to our friends on the other side of the Chamber  in the Senate, just for situational awareness when countries do price  controls, there is a cost in terms of lifesaving drugs that are not  available in countries where they have done price controls. When you  look at the United States, clearly a leader in innovation--we have seen  it with Operation Warp Speed where we were able to get three different  vaccines approved in less than a year because we encourage innovation  in this country, we don't penalize that innovation.   But there are countries that do try to fix prices. While it might  sound populist to do it, the cost for those countries is that many  lifesaving drugs are not available in those countries. We all hear  about Canada. Canada clearly is a country that fixes prices. France is  a country that fixes prices. You can see here, almost half of the drugs  that are available in America that save lives are not available in  Canada and France.   I know there is a temptation, as they are negotiating over in the  Senate, to get into the price-fixing business. I am not sure which  lifesaving drugs the Senate would like to remove off the shelves of the  United States, but there will be lifesaving drugs removed off the  shelves. Let's not do to drug manufacturing and lifesaving innovation  in America what they have done to baby formula in America, where you  can't even find it on the shelves. You will not be able to find many  lifesaving drugs on the shelves in America if they go to price fixing.   I know it is a heated negotiation over there. They haven't come to an  agreement. Hopefully, they won't come to an agreement on something that  would actually take lifesaving drugs off the shelves in this country.   I would yield to the gentleman.    I know there has been a lot of work by Members on both  sides on the CHIPS Act. Mr. McCaul on our side, through the China Task  Force, put out a number of recommendations. The CHIPS Act was one of  them. Of course, one of the concerns we are seeing, as that bill  continues to be negotiated in the Senate, it is not being negotiated  more narrowly, it is being loaded up to the point where we are hearing  numbers of well over $100 billion in unpaid-for new spending as part of  that bill.   As we talk about inflation, any economist will tell you, inflation is  too much money chasing too few goods, and if we already acknowledge  there are too few goods, to put another $100-plus billion, maybe $150  billion--it keeps growing every day--of borrowed money, none of that-- they are not prioritizing existing money. Everything we are hearing is  all of it would be completely borrowed money.   Next week, we are hearing the Fed is going to raise interest rates  maybe up to another point, and that is without $100-plus billion of  additional debt being added on. If the Fed is telling us that the  spending is leading to higher interest rates, which makes it harder for  low-income families to buy their first home, for people to maybe expand  their business where they can hire more people to go and meet the needs  of the supply chain, they won't be able  [[Page H6945]]  to do that if interest rates keep going up.   And yet, as interest rates are about to go up again next week, the  Senate is trying to figure out how to keep adding and adding and adding  on top of what is already probably well over $100 billion in borrowed  money that they are going to send over here.   I hope that we would keep that in mind as we are also trying to  address these other problems like gas prices. I know we have talked  about this many times. I shared it with the majority whip last week and  would ask the majority leader again. We have identified a number of  bills that have strong support that would address the many problems we  are hearing that are leading to an inability to produce energy in  America.   We saw the President go hat in hand to Saudi Arabia last week. As I  and many others predicted, we all knew that they were going to tell the  President no, but I also suggested that if the President just saved the  11,000-plus miles on Air Force One and stayed here and called places  like Port Fourchon, Louisiana, they would say yes to producing more  energy, not in Saudi Arabia where their carbon emissions are much  higher, but here in the United States where nobody in the world does it  better, does it cleaner, or more efficiently.   That would create more jobs in our country, and it would give more  energy security to our country. It would allow us to lower gas prices,  not just for us but for our allies around the world. And yet, instead  of working with us on these bills, the President chooses to go to  foreign countries who have no interest in lowering gas prices, and so  we still end up in this situation.   I don't know if there is an opportunity to get any or all of these  bills brought up where we could actually come to an agreement on some  things that would move the needle and help families in America lower  gas prices. Today, we are still over double what the price of gasoline  was before President Biden took office.   Wherever the price moves, up or down, when families are paying over  $150 to fill up their car, it is taking a huge hit out of low- and  middle-income families' budgets, and that is one of the driving factors  behind the sluggish economy.   I don't know if the gentleman wants to make an announcement of some  of these bills coming to the floor. I would welcome that, and I would  yield.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. This debate will  continue. It would be great if we were debating these bills next week.  I stand to be surprised and happily surprised if the announcement comes  out over the weekend that some or all of these bills will be brought to  the floor.   I would give the gentleman a prediction that if the House were to  take up and pass these bills, we would see a dramatic reduction in the  price of gasoline. I will leave that out there for the gentleman to  consider as one more reason why these would be good debates to have,  where we could talk together in support of good policy.   We are both blessed with good staff that help us identify really good  pieces of legislation that we could bring to address these big, big  problems that families are facing.   Mr. Speaker, unless the gentleman has anything else, I yield back the  balance of my time.                            ____________________
