 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1044,  the ``Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2019.''   H.R. 1044 will help alleviate the massive immigrant visa backlog by  eliminating the 7 percent ``per-country'' limit on employment-based  visas and increasing the family-based per-country limit from 7 percent  to 15 percent.   The bill will also ease backlogs for certain family-sponsored  immigrants by modifying the per-country limits in the family-sponsored  green card system.   Specifically, H.R. 1044 provides for the phased elimination over  three years of the ``per country'' cap for employment-based immigrant  visas so that all workers are treated fairly.   The legislation raises the ``per country'' cap from 7 percent to 15  percent for family-sponsored immigrant visas and restores 1,000  employment-based visas per fiscal year to the People's Republic of  China, that have historically been set aside for green card applicants  under the Chinese Student Protection Act of 1992.   Mr. Speaker, the United States makes 140,000 green cards available  every year to employment-based immigrants, including many who first  come here on temporary H-1B or L visas.   Current law, however, provides that no more than 79 percent of these  green cards can go to nationals of any one country--even though some  countries are more populous than others.   This bipartisan bill alters the per-country limits for employment- based immigrants so that all are treated equally regardless of their  country of birth.   Mr. Speaker, I have been a strong supporter of the H-1B program.   Without it, American employers would not be able to hire enough  highly educated professionals for the ``specialty occupations.''   A ``specialty occupation'' is employment requiring the theoretical  and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge.   This includes doctors, engineers, professors and researchers in a  wide variety of fields, accountants, medical personnel, and computer  scientists.   An American employer who wants to bring an H-1B employee to the  United States must, among other requirements, attest that it will pay  the H-1B employee the greater of the actual compensation paid to other  employees in the same job, or the prevailing compensation for that  occupation.   Additionally, the employer must attest that it will provide working  conditions for the H-1B visa holder that will not cause the working  conditions of the other employees to adversely be affected; and that  there is no applicable strike or lockout.   The employer also must provide a copy of the attestation to the  representative of the employee bargaining unit or, if there is no  bargaining representative, must post the attestation in conspicuous  locations at the work site.   Mr. Speaker, as important as it is that the H-1B program enables our  country to benefit from the services of foreign professionals who have  skills and knowledge that are in short supply in this country, is the  fact that American businesses use the program to alleviate temporary  shortages of U.S. professionals in specific occupations and to acquire  special expertise in overseas economic trends and issues.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1044  to help alleviate the immigrant visa backlogs and enhance the nation's  economic competitiveness.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding;  and I thank the two cosponsors, the gentleman from Pennsylvania and the  gentlewoman from Pennsylvania, for a very important initiative that not  one of us have, unfortunately, not heard of one of our law enforcement  officers in recent years, in recent times, or in recent months  committing suicide. That incident has occurred in my own community.   It is clearly important to be able to provide this extra support, the  Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis Act of 2019, the STOIC Act.  It is crucial because it also impacts these families. These officers  every day deal with such catastrophic incidences. In my own community,  we have seen six little children killed over the last couple of months.                                time  1545    The individuals who arrive first to the scene are law enforcement  officers, and they are moms and dads with children. And I cannot  imagine the impact that those scenes, those crime scenes, have day  after day on these officers who have joined the force to do good and to  help people.   We often say when we call 911, we are looking for the men and women  in blue, and we are looking for them to strengthen those families who  are broken or in crisis. This particular act would revitalize the DOJ's  grant program for Law Enforcement Family Resources, in addition to  allocating funds to establish suicide prevention, stress management,  and mental health programs.   We know that just as our military men and women face the devastation  of  [[Page H5331]]  PTSD, members of our various law enforcement agencies who work to  protect us also experience post-traumatic stress disorder.   This program to enhance the grants that departments can secure will  be able to fill in the gap and work with families and also deal with  the question of those experiencing mental illness. Post-traumatic  stress disorder can come in the form of depression, burnout, and other  mental-health related issues and anxiety.   We know that over the years, suicides have increased, but in 2017, an  estimated 140 officers died from suicide, which exceeds the 129 that  were killed in the line of duty.   Mental illness is a silent, but lethal killer. We are working in the  Judiciary Committee on the Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act  which will emphasize some of the protocols for improving, policing,  working on professionalism, and working with the 18,000 police  departments across America. I can't imagine waiting to pass this  legislation to reignite the grant program to be able to help those who  are now presently suffering.   I am glad that this is a bicameral initiative. I hope that this will  move quickly to the President's desk to sign, and I hope those funds  will get to the Houston Police Department, the Harris County Sheriff's  Department, constables' offices, and various police departments across  America.   A healthy police officer, physically and mentally, is the best  community relations that you could ever have. A healthy officer who  works with children, who works with communities, who works with  families, and shows up when the civic club asks them to come and speak  about safety and security in the neighborhood, that is who we hope will  be the kind of officer who will come to work every day.   These grant programs will ensure that. Most of all, I would like to  close by saying: for those law enforcement officers who are, many  times, former military personnel and committed to the idea of service,  go and get help. We are standing ready to help. These grant programs  will allow police departments, cities, counties, and States to put out  an effective and strong response to the needs of our law enforcement,  and to thank them for their service   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary,  and on Homeland Security, I rise in strong support of S. 998, the  ``Supporting and Treating Officers in Crisis Act of 2019,'' known for  short as the ``STOIC Act''.   The STOIC Act would reintroduce and revitalize the DOJ's grant  program for Law Enforcement Family Services, in addition to allocating  funds to establish, suicide prevention, stress management, and mental  health programs.   Mr. Speaker, as late as 2017, there were more than 600,000 law  enforcement officers employed in the United States, charged with  protecting their communities.   Daily, the nation's law enforcement officers witness and experience  all manner of trauma in the line of duty.   As these brave members of our nation's various law enforcement  agencies work to protect the individuals of their communities, the  difficulties they experience often leave them with post-traumatic  stress disorder (PTSD), depression, burnout and other mental health  conditions related to anxiety.   These anxiety-related illnesses can even result in suicide.   In 2017, an estimated 140 officers died from suicide, which exceeds  the 129 that were killed in the line of duty, making mental illness the  silent killer and most lethal threat to law enforcement professionals.   There is no doubt that these men and women suffering from mental  health issues that occurred as a result of their efforts to protect and  serve their communities, deserve our support throughout their recovery  and treatment.   By passing S. 998, officers combating anxiety related mental health  conditions, and their families, will receive improved support and care.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 998 to ensure that  the nation's law enforcement officers, and their families, receive the  mental health care and rehabilitation they deserve.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on  the Judiciary and on Homeland Security, I rise in strong support of S.  744 the ``Effective Prosecution of Biological Toxins and Agents,''  which amends 18 U.S.C. 175b to prohibit the possession, transport, or  sale of biological agents and toxins by individuals.   S. 744 also prohibits the transport, possession, or shipment of any  biological agent or toxin in interstate or foreign commerce.   Biological agents and toxins disseminate disease-causing organisms or  toxins to harm or kill humans, animals or plants.   In addition to strategic or tactical military applications,  biological weapons can be used to infect livestock or agricultural  produce to cause food shortages and economic loss, create environmental  catastrophes, and introduce pandemics.   Biological agents can also be deployed in missiles, bombs, hand  grenades, and rockets to deliver death and destruction.   Mr. Speaker, there have also been documented efforts to develop  delivery devices for assassinations or sabotage operations, including a  variety of sprays, brushes, and injection systems as well as means for  contaminating food and clothing.   It should concern us all that recent technological advances increase  the likelihood that these weapons could be acquired or produced by non- state actors, including terrorist organizations and mentally unstable  individuals.   This is a major threat to our national security as well as the safety  of all American citizens.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 744.   In doing so we provide an added measure of security for our homeland  by prohibiting the creation and proliferation of biological weapons as  well as the sale of such weapons.    Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman for  yielding and let me thank the sponsor of the legislation, the 21st  Century President Act.   I wanted to affirm Congressman Pocan for the leadership that he has  given to an issue that many might not pay attention to, and the term is  appropriate, the 21st Century President Act, which deals with  criminalizing threats against former Presidents and their families as  well as providing security for those individuals who may be impacted.   For example, section 879 of title 18, enacted in 1982 after the  assassination attempt on then-President Ronald Reagan, makes it  unlawful to threaten to kill, kidnap, or inflict bodily harm upon a  former President, President-elect, or Vice President-elect or major  candidate for President or Vice President or an immediate family  member. In the terminology, as has been indicated, the terms are  defined as ``wife,'' ``her,'' and ``widow,'' which presumes that the  President of the United States will always be a man and his spouse will  always be a woman.   We are very fortunate to have any number of wonderful Americans  running who will have the opportunity to serve. Many women are running.  Certainly, individuals from our LGBTQ community will be in the future  mix for President of the United States.   I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for bringing us into the 21st  century, being enthusiastic about recognizing the importance of  ensuring the safety and security of those who may be running as  candidates, those who may be serving who come from the wide, vast  diversity of America.   It is clear that the time has come for the language to change to a  neutral term of ``spouse'' to refer to the partner of the President of  the United States.   It is also important that we update our laws to welcome  enthusiastically the idea that America, excitingly, will have an  opportunity to elect a unique and different person to the Presidency of  the United States, competent, qualified, and able to serve.   I rise to support the 21st Century President Act. The language speaks  to the idea of the new and exciting opportunity for this great country.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 677, the ``21st  Century President Act,'' introduced by my good friend, the gentleman  from Wisconsin, Congressman Mark Pocan.   I support this legislation, which updates the current statutory  provision set forth in 18 U.S.C. 879 criminalizing threats against  former presidents and their families.   It does this by removing the gendered terms from the statute.   Section 879 of title 18, enacted in 1982 after the assassination  attempt on then-President Ronald Reagan, makes it unlawful to threaten  to kill, kidnap or inflict bodily harm upon a former President,  President-elect, or Vice President-elect, or a major candidate for  President or Vice President, or [an] ``immediate family'' member.   ``Immediate family,'' however is defined with terms such as `wife,'  `her,' and `widow'--which presumes the president will always be a man  and his spouse will always be a woman.   H.R. 677, the 21st Century President Act makes an important  contribution in recognition of the historic progress we have made in  our country.   In 2016, the Democratic party, one of America's two major political  parties, nominated a woman to be its standard bearer and nominee of  President of the United States.   The change that will be made by enacting the 21st Century President  Act is particularly appropriate at this moment.   Competing for the 2020 presidential nomination of their party are six  women candidates and a member of the LGBTQ community.   It is clear that the time has come for the language to change to a  neutral term of ``spouse'' to refer to the partner of the president.   Under current law, it is assumed that the President of the United  States is male, and the spouse is female.   This accords with America's past, but does not reflect its future.   It is time for Congress to change the law.   Equality is a principle that we must always embrace and affirm, and a  principle that we must always keep working to advance and secure for  every American.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 677  to amend federal law to recognize that persons other than men  [[Page H5334]]  can and will be President, and presidential spouses will not always be  female.
