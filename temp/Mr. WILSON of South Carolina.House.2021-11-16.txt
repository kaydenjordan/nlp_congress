 Mr. Speaker, the Bureau of Labor  Statistics reports that the October Consumer Price Index has increased  6.2 percent in a year with Biden inflation. Annualized, this means  inflation is going to be 7.4 percent, which would make it the highest  rate since 1982, the highest rate of inflation in over 40 years.   At the same time, in 7 of the last 9 months, real wages have fallen  and workers lost 2.6 percent of their salaries by the end of the first  Biden year. Biden and the Democrats are accelerating inflation with  insane spending bills, which now total over $5 trillion.   Democrat elite think they are smarter than anyone, and they think  Democrat voters are ignorant to believe $5 trillion in spending costs  zero dollars. You pay with Biden inflation.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.                            ____________________
