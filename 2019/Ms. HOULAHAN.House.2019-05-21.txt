 Madam Speaker, ``Young girls need to see role models in  whatever careers they may choose just so they can picture themselves  doing that job some day. You can't be what you can't see.''   Madam Speaker, Sally Ride, the first American woman in space, spoke  those words. She was a personal hero of mine, one of the few women in  STEM I could look up to as a child. And to this day, I am grateful to  Sally because she showed me, as a young girl, that being a woman did  not prevent her from pursuing her dream, from entering a male-dominated  world and space.   Yesterday, I spoke on television with my friend Representative Mikie  Sherrill, about the launch of the first ever Servicewomen and Women  Veterans Congressional Caucus, and it turns out another young girl was  watching.   ``Why do those two girls have the same necklace on?'' she asked her  father, referring to my and Representative Sherrill's pins. Her father  explained the meaning of the pin, explained how we were two women  elected to serve in the United States Government.   True equality can only be achieved when every young girl can look up  to her leaders and see herself reflected, see a legitimate path for  achieving her dreams. For that, we need more women in leadership, more  people of color. Our elected representatives need to be a more accurate  reflection of America that we represent.   Maybe that young girl yesterday will go into politics, maybe she  won't, but she saw two women who were elected by their peers to serve.   ``You can't be what you can't see.''                            ____________________
