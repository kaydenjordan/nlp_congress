 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  bill before the House today because at this very moment, thousands of  children are waiting to be saved.   The internet can be a dangerous neighborhood for anyone, but  especially vulnerable children. The ever-expanding reach of the  internet has  [[Page H8752]]  fueled an exploding multibillion-dollar market for child pornography.   Tragically, this market exploits the graphic images that result from  the horrific sexual assault of more children. The pandemic only  exacerbated the problem, as our world shifts more online.   But these are not just heinous online images, they are crime scene  photos created by a thriving industry that uses children as sexual  commodities.   Almost 15 years ago, I introduced the Providing Resources, Officers,  and Technology to Eradicate Cyber Threats to Our Children Act of 2007.  With the support of Mr. Jordan at a House Judiciary hearing on that  bill, we heard from a very brave young woman, Alicia Kozakiewicz. She  was abducted by an internet predator at just 13, held captive in his  dungeon basement, and sexually tortured for 4 days.   The FBI found Alicia because the Virginia Internet Crimes Against  Children Task Force, or ICAC, had the technology to lift the digital  fingerprints of this perpetrator's crimes.   They were able to discover the location where he held her captive,  chained to the floor, connected to a collar around her neck. Internet  crimes officers tracked the IP address back to his door, and literally  rescued her from death.   I remember her testimony like it was yesterday. It moved many of the  members of that committee, including myself, to tears.   In the 20 years since her abduction and torture, Alicia still shares  her personal nightmare to help protect other young people.   Over that next year, we learned a lot about these offenders: who they  are, how they operate, and most important, where they are. We saw  detailed law enforcement maps that showed the locations of hundreds of  thousands of sexual predators, 5 percent of whom had actual child  victims waiting to be rescued.   It was a truly harrowing environment they described.   And Congress acted.   With then-Senator Joe Biden as my Senate partner, we passed  legislation establishing the National Internet Crimes Against Children  Task Force Program, or ICAC, a specialized group of law enforcement  officials dedicated to the protection of children.   The task forces grew from 42 to 61, and arrests and child rescues  doubled. They doubled. Literally thousands more predators were  apprehended and children rescued. An untold number of sexual assaults  were prevented.    Mr. Speaker, the PROTECT Our Children Act, the  bipartisan legislation that I introduced this week with Senator Cornyn,  and Representatives Chabot, Kuster, and Reschenthaler reauthorizes the  National Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force Program, the  national network of coordinated law enforcement task forces  investigating and prosecuting those who sexually exploit our most  vulnerable constituents--our children.   According to estimates, half of the arrests made by ICAC teams led us  to the door of a hands-on offender, and thus, a child waiting to be  rescued.   We must make the protection of these children the focus of all of our  efforts. Please think about these precious children being victimized.  If you are a parent, God forbid, it was your own child.   Let's give these ICAC teams the resources they need to rescue as many  as possible.   An impressive and deeply troubling investigation by The New York  Times described the forces arrayed against these ICAC teams as an  ``insatiable criminal underworld,'' and one in which tech companies are  not always able or totally willing to confront.                                time  1600    But if we empower these ICACs with today's reauthorization, thousands  more innocent children will be protected from these unspeakable crimes.  We owe them that.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their indulgence.
