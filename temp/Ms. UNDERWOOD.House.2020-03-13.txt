 Mr. Speaker, the hour is late, but I wanted to rise to  speak to my constituents.   We are facing a novel illness in the coronavirus. I know that many  are feeling nervous and uncertain with this type of disease, but I want  to remind my community in northern Illinois that we have some tools at  our disposal, commonsense solutions, like making sure to wash our hands  and use hand sanitizer, to sanitize frequently touched surfaces, and to  refrain from touching our faces. But we also need to make sure that we  are extending common courtesies, kindness, and respect to our  neighbors.   If you are feeling sick, stay home. If you are really feeling sick,  please call ahead to your healthcare provider so that they can be ready  to accommodate you.   Together, our country will survive the coronavirus and make it  through this challenging time.                            ____________________
