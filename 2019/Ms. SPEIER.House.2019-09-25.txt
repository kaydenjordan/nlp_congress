 Madam Speaker, I thank the chair of the committee for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, this is a powder keg. This is not as my colleagues on  the other side are trying to suggest it is, but they are dealing with  alternative facts.   As co-chair of the Whistleblower Caucus, I can point to the fact that  $54 billion has been returned to the taxpayers of this country because  men and women had the courage to stand up and point out tax evasion,  fraud, abuse, and waste.   Now, we have a whistleblower here who was defined as not being a  whistleblower by the Attorney General, and now we are all saying he is  a whistleblower. He doesn't even have the protections of a  whistleblower based on the analysis by the Attorney General.   One thing is very clear here, Members: But for the fact that this  whistleblower came forward, but for the fact that the inspector general  found that it was both credible and urgent, and but for the fact, after  the DNI did not deem it to be sent to the committee, it was the  inspector general who had the courage to contact the chair of this  committee to inform him that there was a whistleblower pending that  brought this all to the fore.   So let's be very clear: There was a concerted effort by the  administration to shut down this whistleblower, to restrict the money  that was supposed to go to Ukraine on June 18--or July 18.
