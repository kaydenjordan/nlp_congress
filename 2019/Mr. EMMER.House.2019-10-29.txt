 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Zimmerman City  Administrator Randy Piasecki who recently celebrated his 25th  anniversary with the city.   Wherever you are in Zimmerman, you can see Randy's work. Randy had a  major hand in improvements and development of the city. From Zimmerman  Middle High School to the latest apartment complex in downtown  Zimmerman, Randy has facilitated its construction and completion. In  his office, Randy proudly displays an article boasting Zimmerman as one  of the 10 fastest growing cities in Minnesota, in major part thanks to  him.   The legacy of his work proves how much Randy loves Zimmerman. We hope  he continues for many years to grow the city with the thoughtfulness  and care he has shown for nearly three decades.   Congratulations, Randy, and thank you for your 25 years of service to  the people and city of Zimmerman.                  Hometown Hockey Player Succeeds in the NHL     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and celebrate a  graduate of Blaine High School in my district, St. Cloud Husky Jonny  Brodzinski, for signing a contract with the NHL San Jose Sharks.    Following Jonny's successful career at Blaine High School, he went on  to play for St. Cloud State University, which is also in Minnesota's  Sixth Congressional District. He skated there for three seasons with  the great Huskies. His hometown watched and cheered him on as he  advanced to the American Hockey League to play for the Ontario Reign  and celebrated when he was signed by the Los Angeles Kings, officially  making him an NHL hockey player. As he joins the San Jose Sharks, we  will be there to show our support.   Congratulations, Jonny. We are proud you call Minnesota's Sixth  District and the State of Minnesota your home. We will continue to  cheer you on as you play the game we all love.    On Behalf of Minnesota's Agriculture Industry, Thank You Ashley Kohls     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank Ashley Kohls from the  Minnesota State Cattlemen's Association for her commitment and service  to our State's agriculture community and to congratulate her on her new  role as Director of Government Affairs for the Nebraska Cattlemen's  Association.   During her time as the executive director of the Minnesota State  Cattlemen's Association and a member of our Agriculture Advisory  Committee, Ashley has worked closely with our office, educating members  and our staff about agriculture and cattle farming, in particular. As a  cattle farmer herself, Ashley and her husband, Craig, run a fourth- generation family farm with their children, Avery and Bennet.   Ashley is a strong leader and an example to young women who are  interested in the agricultural industry. As an example, she  participated as a panelist at our annual Young Women Leadership Program  where she shared with the high school-aged women what it is like to run  a farm, be a mother, and run a large-scale advocacy association. It was  an honor to have her participation.   Ashley, Nebraska is going to be lucky to have you. We wish you and  your family the best.             The Honorable Mayor Tom Ryan: A True Public Servant     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  Mayor Tom Ryan, a great public servant for the city of Blaine in  Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District. Mayor Ryan's life is the  definition of public service.   Mayor Ryan grew up in St. Paul. He was drafted and served in the U.S.  Army in South Korea. He was honorably discharged in 1966 and returned  home to Minnesota where he settled in what is now the city of Blaine.  For decades he has served the city as a councilman and now mayor. He  also serves as co-leader of Blaine's Beyond the Yellow Ribbon program  which provides community support to our servicemembers and their  families.   Recently, Mayor Ryan received the Seven Seals Award from the Employer  Support of the Guard and Reserve. This award recognizes his commitment  to help servicemembers find work upon their return home.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mayor Ryan, for the city of Blaine, and for our  servicemembers, and congratulations him on his Seven Seals Award.     Recognizing Presidential Excellence Award Winner Professor Eugenia                                   Paulus     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Professor Eugenia  Paulus for her Presidential Award for Excellence in Science,  Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring. Professor  [[Page H8545]]  Paulus teaches chemistry at North Hennepin Community College in  Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District.   Professor Paulus has been mentoring students at North Hennepin  Community College and participating as a science fair judge for local  high schools through the North Hennepin mentoring program for  approximately 15 years. During this time, Professor Paulus has mentored  about 100 students with amazing results.

This Presidential Award is not the first time Professor Paulus has  been recognized for her success with students. In fact, she was  previously awarded for extraordinary undergraduate teaching from the  Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
