 Mr. Speaker, I rise as a proud Member to support the 13th  Congressional District.   My district is the third poorest Congressional District in the  country, and direct funding and aid to support our most vulnerable  communities is so critical to communities like mine.   I want to take a moment to uplift the work that my team and I have  done to deliver for our residents through the community projects  funding.   I don't know if folks know, but we have the oldest Boys and Girls  Club in the Nation, and they are going to see $2 million in investments  to improve the facility in Highland Park so more of our young people  can come into a building that is safe and a building that is going to  be able to help them thrive.   Also, the Urban Neighborhoods Initiative's Southwest Detroit Creative  Connections Collaborative; they are going to be able to create a safe  space, community space for our families, especially our youth. This is  the community I grew up in, with 20 different ethnicities.  [[Page H4199]]    We are also going to be able to help Detroit homeowners receive home  repair grants for energy efficiency. Enterprise Community Partners is  so eager to be able to work with my seasoned residents; and my seasoned  residents are eager to see their homes become not only energy  efficient, but also accessible, as many are struggling with access  because of disability.   The Eastside Community Network is going to be able to establish the  Stoudamire Wellness HUB for the eastside Detroit residents who are,  right now, struggling to access healthcare.   We are also going to be able to help, some relief--and this is just  the beginning--to help many of our families in Dearborn Heights and  Wayne County address the number of families that continue to be  impacted by flooding because of Ecorse Creek's challenges.   We are also going to be able to support ProsperUS Detroit Micro  Lending to support some of our small businesses and expand some of the  work they have already done to Detroit all the way to western Wayne and  Inkster.   I am also so proud of the investment that we are going to have in the  Ruth Ellis Center to provide safe, affordable, identity-affirming  housing for marginalized Black and Brown Detroiters, especially my  LGBTQ-plus youth.   I am also going to be able to stand there with my City of Wayne  residents to see, finally, the Goudy Park Amphitheater space be able to  be rehabbed. It is a space that many of our schools use for  graduations, for gatherings, and just really truly coming together as a  community.   We are also going to be able to see over 300 of our high school  students in the Western Wayne School District, along with the  partnership of SEMCA, be able to access vocational technology, career- tech programs.   We are also going to see a $2.5 million investment in our Inkster  Senior Wellness Center. This is one of--again, Inkster has some of my  spectacular seasoned residents, and they are eager, again, to have a  space to come together, especially after the challenges during the  pandemic.   I want to thank Chairwoman DeLauro and the Appropriations Committee  staff, and the incredible hard work of my team, for a thoughtful and  engaging process that really targeted communities with the most needs.   I am proud and committed to continued engagement with all of my 13th  Congressional District communities to find funding to address the needs  because they truly deserve it.                            ____________________
