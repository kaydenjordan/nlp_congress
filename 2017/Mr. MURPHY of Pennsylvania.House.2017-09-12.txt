Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Chair, I want to speak on this  amendment, which provides some additional funding for assisted  outpatient treatment.   The underlying bill has in it $15 million, and we are asking for it  to be raised to $20 million. First of all, I want to say where the  money is coming from. This is within the budget of SAMHSA. This is not  new spending. It is not additional spending. But over my years of  investigating mental health in the United States and the conditions,  and then led to my introduction of the Helping Families in Mental  Health Crisis Act, which, by the way, this House passed 442-2, this  level of funding was authorized in the bill. It is already authorized  there. It is to come from the SAMHSA account, not new spending.   Let me describe what assisted outpatient treatment is. Understanding  that there are about 60 million Americans with mental illness, and 10  million have severe mental illness, it is important to note that our  prisons are filled with people who have mental illness. On some level,  60 to 80 percent of people in jail have a mental illness. That is no  place to be treating someone. But, unfortunately, they may have a crime  they committed, and in many cases it could simply be vagrancy, it could  be other issues, too, where they may have become violent, they may have  had other problems associated with that, but a person with mental  illness is 10 times more likely to be in prison than to be in a  hospital bed.   We don't have enough hospital beds. Ninety percent of the psychiatric  hospital beds in this country have been closed down since the 1950s.  Now we need 100,000 more, but instead what we do as a society, we throw  them in prison.   A few years ago, when New York passed Kendra's Law, when a young  woman was killed by a mentally ill person, they realized that had he  been in treatment, it likely never would have happened.                                time  1900    So rather than having someone, if we can't put them in a hospital,  can't get  [[Page H7289]]  them treatment, the idea of assisted outpatient treatment is, when a  patient can be stabilized by remaining on their medication, by having  their counseling, perhaps supportive housing, supportive education,  supportive employment, their life can turn around.   So what happens is, a court, a judge, protecting this person's own  rights, civil rights on every level, will say to this person: I am not  going to involuntarily commit you to a hospital. Your crime doesn't  rise to the level--it is not a felony or something like that--it  doesn't rise to the level of prison, but what they say is: We are going  to require, however, that you stay in treatment, require that you take  your medication, that you stay in counseling, and you do other things  as prescribed by the court.   Now, most States allow this, but here is the problem: in many  counties in America, they don't have the ability to pay the  administrative costs to handle this. So this amendment provides a  mechanism whereby people can do this.   So understand, the assisted outpatient treatment is a civil-legal  procedure whereby a judge can order an individual with a serious mental  illness to follow a court ordered treatment plan in the community.   Here is another thing about this: Does it work? And the answer is  yes. In a Duke University study of the New York AOT program, it said 90  percent of the people said that AOT made them more likely to keep  appointments or to take medication; 88 percent said they and their case  manager agreed on what is important for them to work on; 87 percent of  them said they were competent in their case manager's ability to help  them; 87 percent had fewer incarcerations; 83 percent had fewer  experienced arrests--and the point is, they had an increased number of  arrests prior to being in AOT, and then afterwards it declined  precipitously.   Eighty-one percent said AOT helped them get and to stay well; 77  percent fewer experienced psychiatric hospitalizations; 75 percent  reported that AOT helped them gain control of their life; 74 percent  fewer experienced homelessness; 55 percent fewer experienced suicide  attempts or physical harm to themselves; 49 percent fewer abused  alcohol; 48 percent fewer abused drugs; 47 percent fewer physically  harmed others; 46 percent fewer damaged and destroyed property; and  costs were cut in half.   This small amount of money--and believe me, it would cost perhaps 10  or 20 times more to really do this thoroughly--is there to help people  in mental health crisis. We could either continue to throw people in  jail, continue to see crimes happen--and by the way, when a mentally  ill person is in prison, 80 percent of them get no treatment. We put  them back on the streets and the problems occur again.   The House passed this. It came out of committee unanimously. We need  to do this for America. We don't want to read more statistics on a  mentally ill person who harmed someone, primarily because they were not  in treatment.   This is our opportunity to save lives. This is our opportunity to do  something about this. And I do ask that the House pass this small  amendment out of an existing budget, no new spending, to provide an  additional $5 million for assisted outpatient treatment.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my  time.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Chair, as the designee of  Ranking Member Lowey, I move to strike the last word.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Chair, I rise today in  support of amendment 155, the assisted outpatient treatment, $5 million  increase; $20 million total.   As the original cosponsor of H.R. 2646, the Helping Families in  Mental Health Crisis Act of 2016, I recognize the importance of funding  for outpatient treatment.   As a former chief psychiatric nurse at the VA hospital in Dallas,  Texas, I have witnessed the unintended consequences of the  deinstitutionalization process. Many of my own patients, diagnosed with  severe mental illnesses, were discharged with 30 days of prescription  medicines and did not have stable housing.   Once they ran out of their prescriptions, their condition worsened,  they suffered psychotic breaks, and they became homeless or  incarcerated. Individuals with untreated psychiatric illness now make  up one-third of the Nation's estimated homeless population. That totals  600,000.   In Texas, there are 35,000 incarcerated individuals with a severe  mental illness, but only 4,500 psychiatric beds are available in all of  the Texas hospitals combined.   This amendment increases court-ordered assisted outpatient treatment  by  [[Page H7290]]  $5 million to meet the fully authorized amount of $20 million in  support of the severely mentally ill, thereby allowing them to get  treatment in the community without incarceration or hospitalization.   This outpatient treatment reduces incarceration, homelessness, and  emergency room visits by upwards of 70 percent.   I urge support of this amendment. This country has neglected the  mentally ill, and this country is suffering because of it. We have got  to recognize the need, and I urge everyone to support this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I just want to say,  investing in the AOT program, Congress says it is worth it to ensure  the most vulnerable among us have the treatment they need, instead of  being in ERs, or jails.   This pilot is extremely important. It saves money. It saves lives.  And for Members to reflect back on this, I hope they would rather say:  I helped fund a program known to save lives. SAMHSA has been reported  many times by the GAO to waste a lot of money. This saves lives, and I  urge people to vote for this amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania  will be postponed.            Amendment No. 156 Offered by Mr. Kelly of Pennsylvania    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 156  printed in House Report 115-297.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division F (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  For ``Health Resources and Services       Administration--Maternal and Child Health'' for establishing       and carrying out grants to eligible entities to develop,       maintain, or enhance infant and early childhood mental health       promotion, intervention, and treatment programs for children       up to 12 years of age, as authorized by section 399Z-2 of the       Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 280h-6) there is hereby       appropriated, and the amount otherwise provided by this Act       for ``Health Resources and Services Administration--Program       Management'' is hereby reduced by, $5,000,000.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is for  infant and early childhood mental health promotion, intervention, and  treatment. It provides $5 million in grants to develop, maintain, or  enhance infant and early childhood mental health promotion,  intervention, and treatment  [[Page H7303]]  programs, including programs for infants and children at significant  risk of developing or showing early signs of or having been diagnosed  with mental illness, including serious emotional disturbance. This was  passed and authorized in the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis  Act last year in Congress in which it was passed 422-2--near unanimous.   The importance of this is that, across the United States, up to one  in five children suffers from a mental disorder in a given year,  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This  equates to more than 17 million young people who meet criteria for  disorders that affect their ability to learn, behave, and express  emotions. This small $5 million amount is about 29 cents per child,  hardly enough to do much when distributed over that many, but it can do  a great deal when distributed for a few.   If you follow the course of children with mental illness, untreated  mental illness, of course, leads to very troubled adults and other  problems. I might add that this is National Suicide Prevention Week,  and among children, suicide rates are climbing. In fact, over the last  20 years, suicide rates have climbed overall in this country. But,  tragically and alarmingly, they have grown a great deal among children.   How do we tell families of children who have completed a suicide or  attempted a suicide that we couldn't come up with the money for this,  and, instead, we thought other programs were more important?   This money comes from the existing programming budget. It does not  take away from vital programs. But I want you to know that there has  been a 54 percent increase of suicides among children under age 12.  Thirty-seven percent of those child suicides are Black children. The  rate among African-American children ages 5 to 11 has doubled over the  last decade.   This provides critically important services for children. It appears  that schools are the most important place where treatment can take  place. Only 23 percent of prekindergarten programs have onsite or  scheduled visits from psychiatrists and psychologists, according to the  Child Mind Institute.   The current workforce consists of approximately 7,500 child and  adolescent psychiatrists. We need 32,000. Eighty-five percent of all  psychotropic medications for children are written by primary care  practitioners, not psychiatrists, so we end up with serious problems  here as suicides grow and as mental health problems grow. This small  amount of money is taken from existing funds, not from any other  programs, to make sure we are providing services for these children.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have  remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 1\1/2\ minutes remaining.    Mr. Chairman, let me add to this. Yes,  there was money in the Cures bill for opioid abuse for 59,000 people  who had died from drug overdoses, but 350,000 people will die this year  related to mental health problems.    I want to make sure that Congress is not, once again, in a situation  where we are having another moment of silence for some suicide, for  some child or young adult that got violent and shot someone or ran  their car into a crowd, or something else. We have got to start putting  money into these programs. Five million dollars barely scratches the  surface, but it is like that old adage of the man who came across a  child throwing a starfish back in the ocean. The person said: ``You can  never take care of all of them.'' But the child said: ``It will make a  difference for this one.''   This will make a difference to a few children.   How do we explain this to a parent whose child is suffering, who  can't get services, that what we have is we couldn't transfer money  within an existing account, it doesn't add any more, and it doesn't  eradicate any programs, but it is something there especially at a time  when this is so life threatening?   You can't explain that to a mom or a dad.   During all the time in the course of working this bill, we heard from  thousands of people telling their horrific and sad stories. I spent the  last 42 years of my life working as a psychologist. I have seen the  faces of those who have gone to the funerals and seen those wasting  away in prisons. I do ask that this amendment be adopted.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division F (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  For ``Health Resources and Services       Administration--Maternal and Child Health'' for carrying out       the Pediatric Mental Health Care Access grant program, as       authorized by section 330M of the Public Health Service Act       (42 U.S.C. 254c-19), there is hereby appropriated, and the       amount otherwise provided by this Act for ``Health Resources       and Services Administration--Program Management'' is hereby       reduced by, $9,000,000.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment increases  access to pediatric mental healthcare by providing $9 million in grants  to improve access to behavioral integration and pediatric primary care.   I thank the chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services,  Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee for his agreement to our  other amendment to boost the workforce. We have a massive workforce  shortage in the field of mental health.   What good is it to have good wishes among Members of Congress for  treatment, yet people can't get it?   There is a shortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists for the 17  million children with a mental health condition. We have 9,000. We need  over 30,000. There is a shortage of psychologists, and 36 States have a  shortage of psychiatric nurses. As a matter of fact, half of the  counties in America have no psychiatrists, no psychologists, and no  clinical social worker. So for children with primary mental health  problems, it is a desert for treatment.                                time  2115    They sit on long waiting lists. Their symptoms worsen.   A study called the RAISE Program--Recovery After an Initial  Schizophrenia Episode--found that if we provided treatment initially  for those who show their initial psychotic episode, it improves their  prognosis over their lifetime. But delaying treatment actually causes  them harm.   When you have no care, you have that harm. For those few  psychiatrists and psychologists out there, what are they told to do in  rural areas?   Travel from one office to another to try and give them access, with  valuable hours of time taken up. They can't provide that care.   This $9 million helps provide mechanisms by which pediatricians and  family practices can have telemental health. We know that when a warm  handoff occurs in the office--and that is when the family or the child  at that point meets a psychiatrist or that psychologist--the actual  follow-up rate is over 99 percent. A large number--over 80 percent-- continue follow-up right through treatment.   However, when they are given a referral, that actual follow-up is  around 50 percent, and only 11 percent of people complete treatment.  That is why you need to have some level of face to face.   This issue of at least providing telemental health gives people that  face-to-face approach.   Since 50 percent of serious mental illness cases emerge by age 14,  and 75 percent by age 24, this is the critical period in the life of  someone who is developing serious mental illness to have care. We can  no longer just say that we are going to let pediatricians be the  primary providers for mental illness treatment when that is something  that they do not have the specialty and training.   The number of psychiatrists there to treat children is declining  relative to the needs. The problems among children, as I mentioned  previously, continue to go up.   I might also add here that this does not reduce any spending among  the critical funded and authorized programs within SAMHSA.   But let me say where some of the money goes in these SAMHSA programs.  The GAO did a study and found that 80 percent of the grants are not  using it for evidence-based care. SAMHSA, instead, spends their money  on ridiculous, embarrassing programs: making fruit smoothies if you are  stressed, $400,000 on a website for toddler sing-along songs, getting  in touch with your inner animal workshops, making masks, making  collages, a website and crisis hotline for people in the Boston area  who had snow anxiety during a snowstorm, teaching people interpretative  dancing, $25,000 for a painting of people sitting on a rock at SAMHSA  headquarters, an alternative conference funded by SAMHSA at the  luxurious Boston Park Plaza Hotel.   And we can't fund something that will save children's lives?   It makes no sense to me.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have  remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 1 minute remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, let me say this: I have got  to tell you that this is distressing to me. I know what my colleague  meant by false crisis, but this is a crisis for children.   The children in America with mental health problems cannot get care.  Members of Congress have an opportunity to put a small amount of money  to make a big difference for children who cannot get that care.   What we can do and what my colleague from Oklahoma said is we need to  cut some things. One of them is stop the ridiculous wasteful spending  at SAMHSA. If they can fund $400,000 websites and going to luxurious  hotels, they can certainly do something that actually puts providers  there so children can change the trajectory of their lives.   I have just known too many families who suffer through this. I hope  that as Members vote on this, they remember those families in their  districts and decide this is a way to send a signal that we can make a  big difference in the lives of many.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division F (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  For ``Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services       Administration--Mental Health'' for establishing and       operating the National Mental Health and Substance Use Policy       Laboratory, as authorized by section 501A of the Public       Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290aa-0), there is hereby       appropriated, and the amount otherwise provided by this Act       for ``Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services       Administration--Health Surveillance and Program Support'' is       hereby reduced by, $5,000,000.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Chairman, I want to restate the  problems that exist at SAMHSA.   The General Accounting Office, during the multiyear investigation of  the subcommittee which I chair, the Oversight and Investigations of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce, came back and said that 80 percent of  the grants for SAMHSA are not evidence-based. There is a serious  problem in that agency.   Instead, they funded absurd programs, such as making fruit smoothies;  and a $400,000 website for toddlers to sing-along songs, which they  told us was about prevention.   We asked: What are you preventing?   They said: We will get back to you on that.   They also had workshops on getting in touch with your inner animal,  making masks and collages; interpretive dancing; a website and crisis  line for people in the New England area when they had heavy a snowfall  so they could call in.   They have workshops on how to tell people to get off their  medications. They had a $25,000 oil painting for their office, which  graces their hall, of people sitting on a rock, which gives them mental  health awareness. I might add, the only thing I am aware of is a total  waste of money. And, of course, an alternative conference, which  continues this year as well, spending, I think, $150,000 or so to hold  their conference at the luxurious Boston Park Plaza Hotel.   I don't want to hear from that agency that they don't have money.  This particular program redirects them so they get reset in terms of  evidence-based care. It forms a panel of people with expertise in  medical psychiatric areas, including consumers.   It is there to provide direction and guidance for an agency that has  been without direction and guidance. It is there to make sure that we  redirect the way SAMHSA is going so that it gets in the area of really  treating mental illness.   Let me say this--let me use the words of Dr. Elinore McCance-Katz,  the current Assistant Secretary of Mental Health and, therefore, the de  facto head of SAMHSA.   She said: ``. . . SAMHSA does not address the treatment needs of the  most vulnerable in our society. Rather, the unit within SAMHSA charged  with addressing these disorders, the Center for Mental Health Services,  chooses to focus on its own definition of `recovery,' which generally  ignores the treatment of mental disorders, and, as a major initiative  under `recovery' services, focuses on the development of a `peer  workforce.'   ``There is a perceptible hostility toward psychiatric medicine: a  resistance to addressing the treatment needs of those with serious  mental illness and a questioning by some at SAMHSA as to whether mental  disorders even exist.''   For example, they state that psychosis is just a different way of  thinking for some experiencing stress. They also focus on activities  that don't directly assist those who have serious mental illness.   She adds that: ``Significant dollars are spent on hotlines for  callers who may be experiencing suicidal thinking. . . . ''   But I might add that during this whole time, while death rates  decline for heart disease, lung disease, AIDS, and accidental deaths,  et cetera, they went way up for suicide. They increased steadily for  substance abuse.   It is a failed agency, along those lines.   She says that there are pressing needs, but nowhere in SAMHSA's  strategic initiatives do they even address psychiatric treatment of  mental illness as a priority.   I know we have to change this. I would like to ask of my dear friend,  the chairman of the subcommittee, is there a way we can talk more about  this and address this in the future to see that this is addressed  adequately?    I yield to the gentleman from Oklahoma.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        September 12, 2017, on page H7305, the following appeared: Mr.  MURPHY of Pennsylvania.

Amendment No. 179 Offered by Mr. Murphy of Pennsylvania    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 179  printed in House Report 115-297.  [[Page H7306]]         Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the  desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division F (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  For ``Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services       Administration--Mental Health'' for carrying out the       Strengthening Community Crisis Response Systems grant       program, as authorized by section 520F of the Public Health       Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290bb-37), there is hereby       appropriated, and the amount otherwise provided by this Act       for ``Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services       Administration--Health Surveillance and Program Support'' is       hereby reduced by, $10,000,000.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.    Mr. Chairman, this is the last of my  amendments on this. Although this House overwhelmingly passed the  authorization for these, as did the Senate, money was not allocated  towards it.   While I understand there is a priority to treat substance abuse, but  even with that, many times there is nowhere for someone to go.   Back in the 1950s, we had over half a million psychiatric hospital  beds in this country. I think at the time the population of the United  State was 150 million. Now, with a population close to 317 million to  318 million, we have about 40,000 hospital beds and a shortage of  100,000. The only State that actually has an adequate number of beds is  Mississippi. All the rest are at a critical shortage.   So what happens when a person has a drug overdose and needs to get  into treatment? What happens when a person has a psychiatric breakdown?   Well, generally what happens is the police arrive, not the  paramedics. They arrest the person. Many States actually say: Let's put  these people in a jail cell, because there is no bed.   Or, if they take them to the hospital, the hospital says: Let's just  give them some medication to stabilize them and let them back out  because we can't hold them. We have no place for them to go.                                time  2130    What happens, many times these people are boarded, that is, they  remain in an emergency room bed, which is no place for someone with a  psychiatric crisis. Sometimes they will be tied to their gurney;  sometimes they are in the hallways; sometimes they are, for days or  weeks or several weeks, waiting for a psychiatric bed and nothing opens  up.   I thought when Dorothea Dix said let's close down the jail concept,  that was prevalent in our country back then, let's have nice hospitals  for them. Historically, they said that was a good move, but what  happened is these psych beds closed down starting widely in the 1980s  and continuing until now. There simply is no place for them to go.   Let's remember that President Kennedy's last bill he signed before  his assassination was to begin this process of closing the beds but  having community-based treatment, but America and Congress have not  kept that promise.   There is a story of a Senator from Virginia by the name of Creigh  Deeds. Some may remember in the news when his son Gus had a crisis and  Senator Deeds took his son to a hospital. There they waited hour after  hour after hour while the hospital tried to find a hospital bed  available for him. Finally, he said they couldn't find any beds: Take  young Gus home, and let's see what happens in the future.   When Senator Deeds took his son home, his son stabbed Senator Deeds,  trying to kill him; and when Senator Deeds ran to get help, he  survived, but his son did not because he shot himself with a bullet-- because there were no beds.   Now, this particular amendment doesn't create beds, but what happens  is sometimes there are beds available in other communities; but short  of a hospital calling hospital after hospital after hospital to find a  bed for someone, which may be an hour or two drive away, there is no  place for them.   Surely, we understand the idea: Do we continue to put these folks in  hospitals and jail cells? Do we dump them back in the street and let  them be the forgotten homeless whom we walk over? Do we send them back  home and risk further harm to them? Do we have them tied to a gurney  and given a chemical sedation, a chemical straightjacket to wait until  something opens up?   What this amendment does is it is $10 million in grants to develop  and maintain or enhance the database of inpatient psychiatric  facilities and crisis stabilization units so we can begin to address  this bed shortage. Rather than lead people away from care, this is a  way of helping hospitals get that care and instill States to put  together programs to speed this up.   We still have to work with CMS to create more beds and stop some of  the ridiculous rules that they have in there, but what do we continue  to tell the mentally ill? ``We will get around to it''? ``We couldn't  do it this time''? ``Good luck''? ``I am sorry your son died''?   When does this end? Will we hear more excuses that we can't do  anything about it because we had a $5 billion cut? What do we do with  Americans who are dying from this over and over?   Thomas Jefferson once said: ``I tremble for my country when I reflect  that God is just, that His justice cannot sleep forever.'' We have a  chance to make a difference in the justice for the mentally ill, or  will we once again turn a blind eye and say we can do nothing?
