 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chatham Police  Chief Peter Volkmann, my guest for the State of the Union Address.  Chief Volkmann has been a pioneer in addressing the opioid epidemic in  upstate New York and founded the highly successful Chatham Cares 4 U  program.   Chatham Cares 4 U encourages residents struggling with the disease  that is addiction to walk into the police station, turn over their  drugs, and ask for help. Instead of being charged, individuals are  placed into a treatment program, regardless of financial means or their  insurance coverage.   This highly-successful initiative has been modeled throughout our  region, and I was proud to have Chief Volkmann share his success with  our community at my opioid epidemic panel last year.   Our work to address this urgent priority is ongoing and will require  both the attention and continued cooperation of all levels of  government, law enforcement, and our first responders.   In that vein, I hope to hear from the President on Tuesday that he is  committed to bipartisan, comprehensive solutions to address the opioid  crisis in upstate New York and all across this country.                            ____________________
