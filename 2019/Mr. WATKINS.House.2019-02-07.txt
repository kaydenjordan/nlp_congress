 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Black History Month.   Kansas is no stranger to the fight for equality. At times in our  Nation's history, Kansas has led the charge.   Bloody Kansas was a series of violent civil confrontations, in the  1850s, surrounding slavery. Brown v. Topeka Board of Education helped  end racial segregation.   In 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., chose Kansas to deliver his  speech, titled, ``The Future of Integration.'' In that speech, he said  that, if democracy is to live, segregation must die.   Let us strive to live up to his memory; let us strive to come  together; and let us choose greatness.                            ____________________
