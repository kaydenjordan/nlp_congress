 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the  outstanding achievements of the Brigham Young University women's soccer  team. This past season, the team closed out a record-breaking year,  culminating in their first ever contest for the NCAA Division One  Women's College Cup on December 6, 2021.   Although the final match did not end in victory, the Cougars  displayed extraordinary determination and tenacity in the championship  game against Florida State University. During the entirety of  regulation play, followed by two overtime periods, the BYU women's  soccer team denied every goal attempt by their No. 1 ranked opponents.  Only after an exhaustive overtime did the squad fall just short in  penalty kicks, during which the victors are ultimately decided by a  great deal of luck.   Despite this heartbreaking final result, the women achieved historic  successes. Tallying 77 points during the season, the team led the  country in overall goals and was the top scoring offense in the Nation,  averaging 3.5 goals per game. They also led the Nation with 226 corner  kicks, rounding out their impressive 18-5-1 season record.   Veteran coach Jennifer Rockwood has led the BYU soccer program to a  total of 22 NCAA tournament appearances in her 27 years of coaching, a  remarkably impressive record. For their efforts, BYU's staff, including  Rockwood, Brent Anderson, Steve Magleby, Madie Gates, Rachel Jorgensen,  and Carolyn Billings, all earned United Soccer Coaches' 2021 West  Regional Staff of the Year awards and the NCAA DI Women's Staff of the  Year award.   While the entire team had an exemplary season, individual players  received numerous accolades. Mikayla Colohan was named a finalist for  both the Class of 2022 Honda Sport Award for Soccer and the 2021 MAC  Hermann Trophy. Additionally, forward Cameron Tucker signed a 2-year  deal with Gotham FC of the National Women's Soccer League upon  graduation.   Individual performances and accolades are built on the strong  foundation of a great team. BYU's impressive team includes seniors  Grace Johnson and Makaylie Moore, juniors Ashton Johnson and Natalee  Wells, and sophomores Bella Folino, Zoe Jacobs, Ellie Maughan, Rachel  McCarthy, Becken Mozingo, Kendell Petersen, Jamie Shepherd, Laveni  Vaka, and Olivia Wade. Rounding out the team were freshmen Haven Empey,  Savannah Empey-Mason, Paola Garcia, Addie Gardner, Brooke Hale, Ruby  Lladek, Kelsey Hoopes, Abbie Kotter, Josie Shepherd, Olivia Smith,  Caroline Stringfellow, Daviana Vaka, Tara Warner, and Jacey Wood.   Congratulations to the entire BYU women's soccer program for their  historic season. I wish them the best of luck in their continued  athletic, academic, and professional pursuits.                            ____________________
