 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 439,  the ``National FFA Organization's Federal Charter Amendments Act.''   H.R. 439 updates the charter of the Future Farmers of America (FFA)  to include the Department of Education on its board and governing  committee in line with other Congressionally chartered organizations by  changing the makeup of the board to consist of the Secretary of  Education, or the Secretary of Education's designee who has experience  in agricultural education, the FFA, or career and technical education  and other individuals representing the fields of education,  agriculture, food, and natural resources.   The changes will provide the National FFA Organization more autonomy  while allowing it to collaborate with federal agencies on matters of  mutual interest.   H.R. 439 also shifts the purpose of the FFA toward agriculture career  and technical education, provides for online publications, and allows  its headquarters to be located outside of Washington, D.C.   The shift in purpose of the FFA allows it to become an integral  component of instruction in agricultural education, including  instruction relating to agriculture, food, and natural resources, and  helps prepare students for successful entry into productive careers in  these fields.   This legislation helps to advance comprehensive agricultural  education by supporting contextual classroom and laboratory instruction  and work-based experiential learning.   With the changes promulgated by H.R. 439, the National FFA  organization will be allowed to develop education materials, programs,  services, and events as a service to State and local agricultural  education agencies while being a resource and support organization that  does not select, control, or supervise State association, local  chapter, or individual member activities.   The FFA's mission, which remains the same, is to ``make a positive  difference in the lives of students by developing their potential for  premier leadership, personal growth, and career success through  agricultural education.''   FFA has a strong and positive impact in the state I represent.   The Texas FFA was chartered in 1929, and boasts one of the largest  state memberships with over 123,000 members of which more than a third  are young women.   I am a strong supporter of educational organizations like the FFA.   For instance, each year the Texas FFA conducts career development  events over topics such as agricultural advocacy, food science and  natural resources, entomology, land evaluation, and public relations.   In 2018, the Texas FFA awarded over $2 million in scholarships to  graduating seniors who are ``the most capable and deserving FFA  members'' who will be pursuing a bachelor's degree from a Texas college  or university.   The FFA gives its members the opportunity to discover their  individual talents and values while discovering careers in agriculture  and developing leadership skills.   Agriculture is the nation's largest employer, with more than 23  million jobs.   Updating the FFA's Federal Charter means that the 653,359 FFA members  in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands will have a  national organization that is in a better position to offer them the  support and resources they need.   For these reason, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R.  439.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia, and  I congratulate him and Mr. Chabot for this legislation. I am glad that  this is one of the early bills that we are moving forward. It sets the  tone for this Congress, and it sets the tone for bipartisanship. It  also sets the tone for the Democratic-led Congress on the continuation  of working on the idea of ensuring that justice is truly rendered.    This bill, H.R. 498, the Clean Up the Code Act of 2017, essentially  repeals many unused statutes currently in the criminal code. Mr.  Speaker, you have to pay a fine, but some of them even have jail time.  It is right in line with the concept of ending mass incarceration just  to incarcerate.   It is well-known that this Nation has the largest number of people  incarcerated in Western civilization, some 2 million-plus, added to, of  course, by a number of individuals who are being held in detention  centers across the Nation. It is emblematic of what is terribly wrong  with our criminal justice system and sheds light on why it is  imperative to have an overhaul of our Federal Criminal Code while  addressing the ripple effects it creates within our criminal justice  system.   We had a task force entitled the Over-Criminalization Task Force in  the Judiciary Committee which made an effective start on looking at  Federal laws across the Nation to find out how we can best secure and  safeguard the American people, bring justice to those who have done  wrong, but also provide, if you will, a pathway of reasonableness as it  relates to nonviolent crimes, crimes that don't have a major impact  such as the concept of utilizing the Smokey Bear theme, if you will.   We began our journey several Congresses ago to work in a bipartisan  way to address the ills of our criminal justice system, as I have  indicated, and I look forward to having the Over-Criminalization Task  Force reestablished.   As this bill seeks to promote, we must take initiatives to clean up  our Federal Criminal Code, which in large part criminalizes many acts  that can easily be addressed in other forms such as smaller fines. When  we over-criminalize, we place an undue burden on the taxpayers and  create long-term human costs on families and other communities. What we  do is we create a criminal offense and we create a criminal record.   We should penalize where necessary to ensure public safety and  security and hold accountable those criminals who have done major  damage and who would tend to offend, where appropriate. But we should  also look for ways in which we could enhance our communities, human  relations with civilians and law enforcement, and promote an entirely  new approach to our criminal justice system.   For all of the foregoing reasons and as well to suggest that Smokey  Bear and Woodsy Owl would prefer being left alone as opposed to being  held up in a criminal court as a reason for that particular offender  being held to a fine of a large amount or jail time, I think this is an  important bill and an important step.   I congratulate the authors, both the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Johnson)  [[Page H969]]  and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot). I look forward to supporting  this legislation, and I ask my colleagues to support the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 498, the  ``Clean Up the Code Act of 2019.''   This legislation essentially repeals many unused statutes currently  in the criminal code.   It is emblematic of what is terribly wrong with our criminal justice  system and sheds light on why it is imperative to have an overhaul of  our federal criminal code, while addressing the ripple effects it  creates within our criminal justice system.   We began our journey several Congresses ago to work in a bipartisan  way to address the ills of our criminal justice system through our  Over-criminalization Task Force, which I intend to re-establish in this  Congress.   As this bill seeks to promote, we must take initiatives to clean up  our federal criminal code, which in large part, criminalizes many acts  that can easily be addressed in other forums.   When we over-criminalize we place an undue burden on the taxpayers  and create long term human costs on families and on our communities.   We should penalize where necessary to ensure public safety and hold  accountable criminals where appropriate.   We should also look for ways in which we could enhance our  communities, human relations with civilians and law enforcement, and  provide an entirely new approach to our criminal justice system.   For all the foregoing reasons, I support this bill and ask my  colleagues to do the same.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  676, critical legislation that expresses the unified opposition of  Congress to any attempt by the President to withdraw from the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and reaffirms that it is the policy  of the United States to remain a member in good standing of NATO and  its commitment to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty and its  principle of collective defense.   In the aftermath of World War II, the greatest conflict in all of  human history, the United States, Canada, and their Western Europe  allies founded the North American Treaty Organization (NATO) on April  14, 1949 in Washington, D.C.   Founded on the principle of collective defense, Article 5 of the  North Atlantic Treaty states that, ``The Parties agree that an armed  attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be  considered an attack against them all.''   In the 69 years since the Treaty's ratification, Article 5 has only  been invoked once, following the terrorist attacks of September 11,  2001, when NATO members came to the aid of the United States.   NATO sent seven planes with 830 crewmen from 13 countries to protect  American skies until May 2002, marking the first time in American  history that the continental United States was protected by foreign  forces.   NATO allies and partners have stood with the United States in joint  operations in the Western Balkans, Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere  around the world.   Until the current President took office, every American president  since the treaty's signing in 1949--Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy,  Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton, George  W. Bush, and Obama--has publicly reaffirmed the American commitment to  Article 5.   American presidents have affirmed this nation's commitment to come to  the aid of any NATO member that is under attack.   That is the symbolic meaning of the immortal words spoken by  President Kennedy in  [[Page H979]]  West Berlin at the Brandenburg Gate in 1963: ``Ich bien ein Berliner.''   Mr. Speaker, the principle of collective defense is the core of  NATO's founding treaty and the NATO alliance has been the backbone of  American national security and foreign policy for nearly 70 years.   The strength and solidarity of this western alliance kept Western  Europe whole, prosperous, and free and paved the way for the collapse  of the Soviet Union and the liberation of the nations of Eastern and  Central Europe, many of which have now been integrated into NATO.   The Constitution of the United States grants Congress the sole power  to declare war, but Article 5 does not increase the chance of war.   Rather, NATO is a bulwark against the outbreak of war because it  deters aggression by any adversary.   As a result, NATO is the most successful military alliance in world  history, successfully deterring the outbreak of a third world war,  seeing the Cold War to a victorious conclusion, and protecting the  principle of territorial integrity.   This is why I strongly support H.R. 676, which reaffirms the  commitment of the Congress to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty.   The legislation also expresses support for the agreement reached at  the 2014 NATO Wales Summit calling upon each NATO member nation to  allocate at least two percent of its gross domestic product to defense  by 2024.   The legislation also expresses congressional support for robust  United States funding for the European Deterrence Initiative, which  increases the ability of the United States and its allies to deter and  defend against Russian aggression.   Finally, H.R. 676 provides that no funds are authorized to be  appropriated, obligated, or expended to take any action to withdraw the  United States from the North Atlantic Treaty signed on April 14, 1949,  in Washington, D.C., between the United States of America and the other  15 founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty 16 Organization.   I urge all Members to join me in affirming the commitment of the  United States to the North Atlantic Treaty, which has kept the peace on  the European continent for nearly 70 years and continues to serve as a  bulwark and deterrent to Russian aggression and its long-held strategic  objective of splitting the Western Alliance that has done more than any  other collective enterprise in history to preserve and maintain  international peace.
