 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Every life and every job depends on safe drinking water.  Unfortunately, our water systems have been underfunded for decades, and  the EPA has been unable to finalize new national standards since 1996.   Division I will enhance our drinking water infrastructure, its  quality, and its affordability. This bill includes the investments and  the policy reforms that will make the Safe Drinking Water Act actually  live up to its name.   It significantly increases funding for the State Revolving Fund. It  funds lead line removals to the full extent. It addresses PFAS  contaminations, which are an endangerment to public health.   This is a down payment on critical public health infrastructure that  must be part of our infrastructure investments moving forward. We know  our water systems need these dollars; and our constituents deserve to  have safe, reliable, and affordable water, free from lead, from PFAS,  and other dangerous contaminants.   We need to be stronger partners with those at the local levels of  government. So I encourage support of this measure.   I thank Rick Kessler, Jacqueline Cohen, Anthony Gutierrez, Rebecca  Tomilchik, and last, but not least, Brendan Larkin from the committee  staff for their long hours put into this effort and their diligence as  it relates to this division.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill.
