 Mr. Speaker, the Triple Crown is one of the most  significant achievements in all of sports, but especially in the sport  of horse racing.   In fact, it is such a rare achievement that only 13 times since 1875  has it been accomplished. This year, Mike Earl Smith, also known as  ``Big Money Mike,'' jockeyed his thoroughbred horse, Justify, to  achieve the Triple Crown.   Now, the Triple Crown, in order to win it, you must win the Kentucky  Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes all in the same  racing season. And Mike did just that. It was only the second time in  the last 40 years that it has occurred.   Mike is the oldest jockey to ever win the Triple Crown. He was born  in Roswell, New Mexico, and raised on a farm outside of Dexter, New  Mexico. He has been racing since age 11. He won his first professional  race in 1982 at the Downs at Santa Fe.   At one point, he broke his back and returned from that. In 2003, he  was inducted into the National Museum of Racing Hall of Fame; in 2013,  into the New Mexico Sports Hall of Fame. Winner of nearly 5,500 races,  these three this year set Mike into the history books.   Congratulations, Mike.  [[Page H5667]]                                ____________________
