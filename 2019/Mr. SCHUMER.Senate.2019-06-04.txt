 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, too much of our conversation about  migrants seeking to enter at the southern border has to do with what  happens when they get here. Not enough of our conversation concerns how  we deal with the problems in the countries from which the migrants are  coming. Many of these migrants are fleeing vicious gang violence,  corruption, domestic abuse, drug cartels, and economic hardships that  are so severe that they would risk a journey of 1,000 miles on foot  rather than to stay where they are.   We simply have to do more to help the countries from which these  folks are coming to fix the problems that are causing their people to  flee. That is getting at the root causes here, not at just putting on a  bandaid after they get to the border, and that may be the most  effective way to deal with the overall issue. Unfortunately and as  usual, the Trump administration has done the opposite. Its policies are  exacerbating the vicious conditions in these Central American  countries.   President Trump has cut $450 million in security assistance to  Central American countries and has provided no information about why  the cuts have taken place and where the money will go. As usual, it  seems it is sort of on a whim. He gets this idea in his head and spews  it out without checking it and without explaining it even when it has  the consequence he doesn't want, which is more people coming to our  southern border.   Now what the President has proposed are tariffs on Mexico that would  be massively destabilizing to our economy and theirs--a policy that  will only lead to more migration. These whimsical and erratic proposals  by the President that seem to pop into his head and with which he goes  forward without  [[Page S3173]]  checking are making a mess of what is going on at the southern border.   So I would say to the President: There is a much better way to  address the migration issue than with tariffs. Deal with the problems  in the Central American countries that are causing the migration in the  first place.   The Democrats have proposed legislation that would do just that--stem  the tide of migrants and help to reduce the backlog of cases. How?   First, allow asylum seekers to apply for asylum in their home  countries. If the people under all of this gang violence and  viciousness and economic hardship would be able to apply for asylum in  Honduras or in Guatemala or in El Salvador instead of having to take a  dangerous and often expensive 1,000-mile trek, they would do it. Why  don't we do that? Let's increase the number of immigration judges so  there could be adjudication rather quickly, and let's build the  capacity of Central American countries to crack down on the violent  gangs and vicious drug cartels.   Our bill would provide $1.5 billion in security assistance to these  countries, which is far more than the Trump administration has cut, but  it is still nonsensical to have cut this money. This administration  gets in its own way almost every day, but the solutions we proposed are  the types we should debate.    So we are going to push forward with these proposals. Democrats will  seek to add these policies to any package of border legislation that  comes here before the Senate. If no legislation dealing with the border  comes up, Democrats will seek to add security assistance for Central  American countries to an appropriations bill and push for language that  requires the administration to use it. This is so important that we  will push hard in whatever vehicle we can find to move this proposal.   Again, all of these policies would have a far greater impact, with  far less disruption, than slapping tariffs on one of our Nation's  largest trading partners.   Now, frankly, I don't believe President Trump will actually go  through with the tariffs. When he doesn't, we should be ready to  proceed to these commonsense policies instead.   President Trump has a habit of talking tough and then retreating  because his tough talk can't be implemented or doesn't make sense.  President Trump has a habit of proposing asinine and dangerous policies  before backing off, and President Trump has a habit of pretending that  the very act of not following through on a misguided policy is somehow  a victory. I wouldn't be surprised at all if President Trump didn't  follow through on these tariffs either.   We Democrats have proposed a much better solution to the problems the  President is talking about, and when the President backs off on  tariffs, as I believe he will, this is a solution ready to go that can  get bipartisan support that can actually stem the problems we have at  our southern border.                   100th Anniversary of the 19th Amendment    Madam President, next, on the 19th Amendment anniversary, today we  observe the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment by the U.S.  Senate--a critical step in the long march for equality that began at  the very founding of our country, when Abigail Adams importuned her  husband to ``remember the ladies'' when drafting the Constitution, a  reminder that fell on deaf ears. It was a march that gathered numbers  and force at Seneca Falls, under the leadership of brave New Yorkers  like Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and found expression in the abolitionist  movement.   While that march for equality under the law achieved a great and  long-overdue victory 100 years ago, it is still not over. We have a lot  to do. Wearing the yellow rose is wonderful, but it is not enough.   When women in the workplace do 100 percent of the work but only earn  80 percent of the pay as a man in the same position, the march is not  over.   When good legislation like the House-passed Violence Against Women  Act to provide justice to survivors of domestic violence and stalking  languishes in this Chamber in a legislative graveyard because the NRA  is opposed to it, that march is not over.   When the States are passing laws making it harder for minorities to  vote, when State parties gerrymander districts to limit minority  representation, and when the Supreme Court pretends that discrimination  no longer exists in this country and guts the Voting Rights Act, the  march to equality and universal suffrage is not over.   Without universal suffrage, democracy is incomplete. That was the  lesson of the women who organized, protested, and compelled their  government to pass the 19th Amendment by the slimmest of margins. So  let us not consider June 4 a day to look back with complacency and  remark on our historical progress, but rather as a day to look forward  and recognize what we still must achieve.   There is no shortage of good work we could take up here in the  Senate--paycheck fairness, Violence Against Women Act, the Equality  Act, voting rights, election reform--to make sure all Americans can  enjoy the full blessings of liberty. These pieces of legislation have  passed the House and ended up in the legislative graveyard of the  Senate. I can think of no better way to honor the legacy of the  suffragists than to continue their work on breaking down barriers and  strengthening our democracy.
