 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on day 4 since the United Auto  Workers' contract expired to encourage all leaders of management and  the union to find common ground to ensure workers receive their fair  share of the success of the auto industry.   For Indiana's First Congressional District, I represent the  incredible UAW members from Region 2B in Indiana and also members that  work at the Ford plant across the State line in Illinois out of Local  551.   The steel and manufacturing industries of northwest Indiana are also  critical suppliers for the automobile manufacturers.   Throughout our history, organized labor has been on the front lines  fighting for fair pay, access to affordable healthcare, safe working  conditions, and sound retirement benefits. That fight continues today  on day 4.   I again encourage all parties at the table to recognize the inherent  value of the UAW workers and their essential contributions to the  success, not just in the auto industry, but for the economic success  for our communities and the expansion of the middle class.   I also wish my mom a happy 89th birthday.                            ____________________
