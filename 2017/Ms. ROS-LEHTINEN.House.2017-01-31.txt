 Mr. Speaker, I am heartened by the administration's  announcement that it will preserve workplace protections for LGBT  Federal contractors. This is a meaningful and positive step toward  ending discrimination against hardworking LGBT Americans who only want  to earn a living and provide for themselves and their families.   For many years I have been working with my congressional colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to protect skilled, qualified, and motivated  LGBT employees. Too often these individuals experience rejections at  job interviews, are denied promotions, or face other types of  harassment in the workplace simply because of their sexual orientation  or gender identity.   This shameful practice of discrimination on the job runs counter to  our core values of fairness and equality. I hope that the  administration and Congress can work together to extend equal rights to  LGBT individuals in every sector.                            ____________________
