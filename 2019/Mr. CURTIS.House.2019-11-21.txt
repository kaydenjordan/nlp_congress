 Madam Speaker, I rise today to share my concerns with  patient access to groundbreaking and lifesaving ALS treatments. This is  a very personal issue to me as some of my close friends and neighbors  have been affected by this difficult disease.   I applaud the enactment of the Right to Try Act, allowing some people  another option to receive the treatments they need. However, this  should not be the end of the conversation.   It is important to acknowledge that the passage of this act has not  opened all the doors we expected, and many are still denied access to  treatments.   The FDA's lengthy approval process continues to limit patient access,  at times forcing my constituents to spend large sums of money traveling  overseas for treatment or, more commonly, forfeiting treatment  altogether.   The use of stem cells to treat ALS, widely used and deemed safe in  other countries, has been studied in the U.S. for over 12 years but has  yet to be approved, despite its fast-tracked status.   Delaying approval of this treatment, commonly known as NurOwn, is  putting lives at risk. I urge the FDA to prioritize its approval and  give access to thousands of ALS patients.                            ____________________
