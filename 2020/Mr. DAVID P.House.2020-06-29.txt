 ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I rise today in  opposition to H.R. 1425, which doubles down on the flawed premise  underlying the ACA and threatens access to lifesaving treatments in the  middle of an ongoing public health epidemic.   All of us agree in this country that there is a dire need for  healthcare reform. Our current system costs too much, is too complex,  and often doesn't promote quality or value. This hasn't changed since  the ACA was first passed into law.   Remember, the premise of the ACA was to lower costs and increase  access. The scheme that the Democrats set up to accomplish this was an  individual mandate to force people to purchase insurance they sometimes  couldn't afford, a requirement for all plans to cover government- mandated essential health benefits--10 of them, to be exact--community  rating to drive costs up for the youngest consumers, and massive  subsidies that, today, are available to families of four with incomes  as much as $104,000.   In addition, the bill requires States to greatly expand their  Medicaid programs, a requirement that was subsequently mitigated by the  Supreme Court.   What are the results? The CBO estimated 4 million individuals would  receive coverage through the ACA. In reality, approximately 9 million  received coverage, 80 percent of whom are on a highly subsidized plan.  Costs exploded, as they tend to do with highly subsidized care, and  plans responded by raising copays and deductibles.   I said it before and I will say it again: If you have a $5,000 out- of-pocket, Madam Speaker, for most folks, you don't have insurance; you  have a card.   Meanwhile, the competition and plan choice that was promised never  materialized. Plan options have decreased over time.   Seventy-five percent of the increases in coverage most likely would  have occurred with two reforms: allowing individuals to stay on their  parents' plan until age 26, which I agree with, and a simple Medicaid  expansion.                                time  1315    Here we are again. Democrats appear to have learned none of the  lessons that have become plainly evident since they passed their first  government takeover of healthcare. Today we are considering legislation  that will significantly expand premium subsidies for ACA insurance  while prohibiting the 1332 waivers from States designing their own  plans for their populations' unique needs.   One of the best examples of these waivers is Maryland--hardly a  conservative State--which reduced premiums for its residents an average  of 13 percent in 2019 and an average of 10 percent in 2020. The  Democrats want to block this. I have no Earthly idea why.   That is not all.   The most outrageous aspect of this legislation is that it would  offset the cost expansion of the ACA by allowing government bureaucrats  to set drug prices. This is a provision that--if it sounds familiar, it  is, because it was the heart and soul of H.R. 3, the Democrats' flawed  drug pricing plan from December--that would have reduced access to new  lifesaving treatments. Every study that examined H.R. 3 concluded that  it would stop cures from coming to market. They only disagreed on how  many cures it would stop. Our country currently leads the way in  bringing new medications to market. It would save lives and improve  patients' quality of life.  [[Page H2637]]    In fact, at this very moment American innovators are working at light  speed to develop and mass-produce a COVID vaccine. The idea of passing  legislation that discourages this type of innovation is absurd.   My first in-patient pediatric rotation in medical school in Memphis  was at St. Jude's Children's Hospital. At that time, Madam Speaker, 80  percent of those children that I saw died. Today, 80 percent of those  children live. If we don't stifle innovation, my prayer is that 100  percent of these children will survive in the future.   While Democrats continue to double down on the failure of ObamaCare,  the Trump administration has been working to implement reforms that  actually work and has acted aggressively in these last few months, in  particular, to modernize our healthcare system and ensure patients  continue receiving care during this pandemic. The Trump administration  has been working to give patients new insurance options through short- term plans which cover only benefits essential to that patient. They  have a potentially game-changing rule to increase transparency in  hospital prices. They have expanded telehealth in Medicare--which I use  today--given States the authority to experiment with plan design and  encouraged States to innovate with their Medicaid programs.   This should be a time for Congress to work together and pursue  patient-centered policies that will ensure we have a strong healthcare  system to come back to. I hope my Democratic colleagues will work with  Republicans in a bipartisan manner to advance policies that increase  access to quality care, lower costs for all Americans, and put patients  back in charge of their healthcare decision-making.   Madam Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues to vote against H.R.  1425.
