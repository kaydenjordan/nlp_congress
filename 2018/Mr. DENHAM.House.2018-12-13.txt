 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my humblest gratitude for  the opportunity to serve my community, my country, and the U.S. House  of Representatives for the last 8 years.   Anybody who has lived the life of public service knows that you have  to surround yourself with good people,  [[Page H10192]]  meaning you have got to have a great team, both in the district, as  well as here in the U.S. Capitol; from the legislative side of things,  as well as making sure that your constituency has the best customer  service there is.   We have had an amazing team. To be able to help people in our  community with all of the different challenges they have faced with  Social Security, or VA benefits, or visas, we have had an amazing team  there to help out. To help our veterans receive the benefits that they  deserve and have earned, we have had a great team to help out.   We have passed a number of pieces of legislation because we have had  a team here in Washington, D.C. that is focused on delivering for our  community, for our State, and for our country.   And for that, I need to thank our entire team, from my chief of  staff: Jim Kjol in the State Senate; to Jason Larrabee here, starting  from my first days; to now, Bret Manley, my current chief of staff. We  have had teams that have been managed by great individuals.   On the personal front, you can't do this job without having a spouse  that is there with you through all of the challenges of campaigns,  schedules, and traveling. I have had the best partner, friend, and  companion. Sonia has put up with a lot, and she has also enjoyed the  ride that we have had together.   It has been an amazing journey that my kids have taken part in, to  have my son and daughter not only face the challenges of kids growing  up in a political family, but also having the great accomplishments  side by side with their father.   Mr. Speaker, I will address the rest of my remarks in the coming  minutes.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, continuing with my family, Sonia, from our  earliest days of dating and putting up with the travels of my  commitment to serve my country in the Air Force, to my kids facing the  challenges of traveling in this job, I thank them.   I also want to thank those who have elected me and who put their  faith and trust in me to allow me to work hard for them. It has been a  tremendous journey, one that I have been privileged to have had, both  from my family and from our community.   I have made great friendships here, from the wolf pack to my  legislators who have come here with me, some amazing relationships, and  it has been a great honor to serve with them, to work with them, and to  enjoy our time together.   Lastly, to my parents, my mom, who has been so proud of me: Mom, I  just say to please stay off Facebook. Thank you to my father, who has  passed, for giving me the strength and the confidence to do anything  that I wanted to do in life, and to my grandfather, who encouraged me  to get into public service. It has been their support as well as my  brother, sister, and business partner who have allowed me to spend my  time serving my community and serving my country.   Mr. Speaker, it has been a great ride, and I thank them all.                            ____________________
