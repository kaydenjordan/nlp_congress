 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Madam President, now that the United Kingdom has  separated from the European Union, it is our opportunity to sit down  with the United Kingdom and do some business. Therefore, I am pleased  that the United States and the United Kingdom are making strides in our  negotiations to complete a free trade agreement.   Our two countries, as you know, have a centuries-old relationship.  That relationship will be further strengthened by a comprehensive deal  that presents economic opportunities for our farmers, our  manufacturers, and our service providers to the benefit of both sides  of the Atlantic.   I will continue to insist that an agreement reached between our two  countries will allow us to reach our full potential as trading  partners, particularly when it comes to agricultural trade.   The United Kingdom has been subject to very restrictive European  Union rules that have no scientific basis. We call those sanitary and  phytosanitary rules.   I urge the administration to work with the United Kingdom negotiators  to achieve greater marketing access for U.S. farmers. In other words, I  am tired of the EU restrictions that we have had over the last couple  of decades on our GMO grains.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
