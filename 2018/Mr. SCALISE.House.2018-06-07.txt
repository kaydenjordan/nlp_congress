 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Appropriations  Committee for yielding.   I rise in strong support of this rescissions package.   I want to commend President Trump for bringing this bill to Congress,  a bill that would, once passed, be the largest rescissions package in  the history of our country. This is a process that has been used by  Republican and Democratic Presidents alike over decades, and it is an  important process to make sure that we keep our fiscal house in order.   Mr. Speaker, I know some of my colleagues on the other side are  feigning concern over the Children's Health Insurance Program, and most  of them, by the way, voted against the funding for the CHIP program in  the first place when that bill was before Congress due to a full  funding. In fact, we overfunded the CHIP program, and so, as that  surplus money was identified, we made sure that that money is going to  be able to be used to help reduce the deficit and go to other things.   This letter from the Congressional Budget Office confirms that not  one child will lose insurance when this bill is passed because we  overfunded the CHIP program.   Mr. Speaker, I include this letter from the Congressional Budget  Office in the Record.                                                     U.S. Congress,                                     Congressional Budget Office,                                        Washington, DC, May 8, 2018.      Re Proposed Rescissions for the Children's Health Insurance           Program.       Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Leader: At your staff's request, the Congressional       Budget Office has reviewed the Administration's proposed       rescissions R18-15 and R18-17 for the Children's Health       Insurance Program (CHIP) that were transmitted to the       Congress on May 8, 2018. The proposals would rescind       approximately $7 billion. Of this, $5.1 billion would be       rescinded from the unobligated balances made available by       section 301(b)(3) of Public Law 114-10, and $1.9 billion       would be rescinded from amounts made available for fiscal       year 2018 under the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund,       section 2104(n)(2) of the Social Security Act.        Specifically, you asked for our assessment of the proposed       rescissions' effect on federal spending and insurance       coverage. Authority to distribute the funds to states made       available under section 301(b)(3) expired in 2017. In       addition, based on information from the Centers for Medicare       and Medicaid Services, CBO projects that the rescission from       the Child Enrollment Contingency Fund would not affect       payments to states over the 2018-2028 period. For these       reasons, CBO estimates that rescinding the unobligated       balances would reduce budget authority by $7 billion, but       would not affect outlays, or the number of individuals with       insurance coverage.        I hope this information is helpful to you.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall,                                                          Director.     Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that, as there  was a  [[Page H4874]]  concern about a potential Ebola outbreak, we were able to go back and  work with our OMB Director, Mick Mulvaney, who worked really closely  with us to make sure that this bill was put together properly to  address what the President wanted, while also making sure that we were  able to respond to any potential Ebola crisis.   I especially want to thank my colleagues Jeff Fortenberry and General   Don Bacon from Nebraska for making sure that we will, with this bill's  passage, still be able to respond to any possible Ebola outbreak.  Hopefully, we don't have one, but we will be prepared in that event  thanks to the hard work of Congressmen Fortenberry and Bacon.   So, overall, Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill to help us reduce  the deficit, keep our fiscal house in order, while properly funding  those programs like CHIP that were so important to so many of us who  did vote for it. I am glad that my colleagues who voted against it are  now realizing it is an important program. Maybe they will support it  next time.   But, in the meantime, I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for  this bill, and then I further encourage the Senate to take this bill up  quickly because it only requires 51 votes to pass, not 60. I would urge  full passage. Let's get this on the President's desk.
