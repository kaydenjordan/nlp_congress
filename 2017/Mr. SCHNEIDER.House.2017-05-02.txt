 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Small Business Week  in recognition of the entrepreneurs and small-business owners that form  the foundation of our American economy.   More than half of all working Americans either own or are employed by  small businesses.   In Congress, our job is to promote an environment where small  businesses grow and succeed and communities and working families can  prosper. To do that, we need to educate our kids to close the skills  gap too many businesses face in trying to find the talent they need to  grow their companies.   We need to reimagine and renew our crumbling infrastructure for the  21st century economy. We can help small businesses invent things here,  make things here, and ship them around the world.   We need to reform our immigration system to reduce the complexity  employers face when trying to legally hire talented, industrious  people.   I urge my colleagues to consider this week, Small Business Week, what  we can do together to support American small businesses--the greatest  job creation engines of our economy.                            ____________________
