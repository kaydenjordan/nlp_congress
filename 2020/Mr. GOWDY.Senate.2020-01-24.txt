 I can just tell you in the private interviews       there is never any of what you saw Thursday. It is one hour       on the Republican side, one hour on the Democrat side--which       is why you are going to see the next two dozen interviews       done privately. Look at the other investigations being done       right now. The Lois Lerner investigation that was just       announced, was that public or private?    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. If this process was good enough for other  Presidents, why isn't it good enough for President Trump?   Representative Gowdy finished that statement by saying: ``The private  ones have always produced the best results.'' ``The private ones,''  according to Trey Gowdy, ``have always produced the best results.''   President Trump complained that his counsel was not afforded the  opportunity to participate during the Intel Committee's proceedings.  But neither President Nixon nor President Clinton were permitted to  have counsel participate in the initial fact-gathering stages  [[Page S558]]  when they were investigated by special counsel, independent counsel.   President Nixon certainly had no attorney present when the  prosecutors and grand juries began collecting evidence about Watergate  and related matters. President Nixon did not have an attorney present  in this distinguished body when the Senate Select Committee on  Watergate began interviewing witnesses and holding public hearings. Nor  did President Clinton have an attorney present when prosecutors from  the Office of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr deposed witnesses and  elicited their testimony before a grand jury.   President Trump's attorney could have cross-examined the Intel  Committee's counsel during his presentation of evidence before the  House Judiciary Committee. That would have functioned as the equivalent  opportunity afforded to President Clinton to have his counsel cross- examine Kenneth Starr, which he did, at length.   President Trump was provided a level of transparency and the  opportunity to participate consistent with the highest standards of due  process and fairness given to other Presidents who found themselves in  the midst of an impeachment inquiry.   The President--and I am winding down--the President's next procedural  complaint is that it was unconstitutional to exclude agency counsel  from participating in congressional depositions. The basis for the rule  excluding agency counsel is straightforward. It prevents agency  officials who are directly implicated in the abuses Congress is  investigating from trying to prevent their own employees from coming  forward to tell Congress and the American people the truth. It is  common sense. The rule protects the rights of witnesses by allowing  them to be accompanied in depositions by personal counsel, a right that  was afforded to all of the witnesses who appeared in this matter.   Agency attorneys have been excluded from congressional depositions of  executive branch officials for decades under both Republicans and  Democrats, including Republican Chairman Dan Burton, Republican  Chairman Darrell Issa, Republican Chairman Jason Chaffetz, Republican  Chairman Trey Gowdy, Republican Chairman Kevin Brady, and Republican  Chairman Jeb Hensarling, just to name a few.   Again, the Constitution provides the House with the sole power of  impeachment and the sole authority to determine the rules of its  proceedings, which were fair to all involved. Given the Constitution's  clarity on this point, the President's argument that he can engage in  blanket obstruction is just dead wrong.   President Trump also objects that the House minority lacked  sufficient subpoena rights. But the subpoena rules that were applied in  the Trump impeachment inquiry were put into place by my good friends  and colleagues on the other side of the aisle, House Republicans, when  they were in the majority. We are playing by the same rules devised by  our Republican colleagues.   President Nixon did not engage in blanket obstruction. President  Clinton did not engage in blanket obstruction. No President of the  United States has ever acted this way.   Lastly, we should reject President Trump's suggestion that he can  conceal all evidence of misconduct based on unspecified confidentiality  interests. Those are his exact words, ``confidentiality interests.''  Not once in the entire impeachment inquiry did he ever actually invoke  executive privilege.   Perhaps that is because executive privilege cannot be invoked to  conceal evidence of wrongdoing. Perhaps that is because executive  privilege does not permit blanket obstruction that includes blocking  documents and witnesses from the entire executive branch. Perhaps  President Trump didn't invoke executive privilege because it has never  been accepted as a sufficient basis for completely and totally defying  all impeachment inquiries and subpoenas. Or perhaps President Trump  didn't invoke executive privilege because when President Nixon did so,  he lost decisively, unanimously, clearly before the Supreme Court.  Whatever the explanation, President Trump never invoked executive  privilege. So it is not a credible defense to his obstruction of  Congress.   President Trump has lastly suggested that his obstruction is  justified because his top aides are ``absolutely immune'' from being  compelled to testify before Congress. Every Federal court to consider  the so-called doctrine of ``absolute immunity'' has rejected it.   In 2008, a Federal court rejected an assertion by the 43rd President  of the United States that White House Counsel Harriet Miers was immune  from being compelled to testify, noting that the President had failed  to point to a single judicial opinion to justify that claim.   And on November 25 of last year, another Federal judge rejected  President Trump's claim of absolute immunity for former White House  Counsel Don McGahn. The court concluded:         Executive branch officials are not absolutely immune from       compulsory congressional process--no matter how many times       the Executive branch has asserted as much over the years--      even if the President expressly directs such officials [not       to comply].    The court added: ``[Simply stated], the primary takeaway from the  past 250 [-some-odd] years of recorded American history is that  Presidents are not kings.''   The President is not a King.   President Trump tried to cheat. He got caught, and then he worked  hard to cover it up. He must be held accountable for abusing his power.  He must be held accountable for obstructing Congress. He must be held  accountable for breaking his promise to the American people.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         My foreign policy will always put the interests of the       American people and American security above all else. Has to       be first, has to be. That will be the foundation of every       single decision that I will make.    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. What does it mean to put America First? America  is a great country, but, above all else, I think America is an idea--a  precious idea. It is an idea that has withstood the test of time--an  enduring idea--year after year, decade after decade, century after  century, as we continue a long, necessary, and majestic march toward a  more perfect Union. America is an idea: one person, one vote; liberty  and justice for all; equal protection under the law; government of the  people, by the people, and for the people; the preeminence of the rule  of law. America is an idea. We can either defend that idea or we can  abandon it. God help us all if we choose to abandon it.    The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                                    RECESS
