 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Ben Quinn, Sr., from  Glasgow, Kentucky, for his induction into the University of Kentucky  College of Engineering Hall of Distinction.   Ben graduated from the College of Engineering in 1966, and has over  50 years of experience in civil engineering. Thirty-five years ago, he  started his own company, American Engineers, Inc., with only two  employees, in Glasgow. Now, American Engineers has over 100 employees  in Kentucky and Georgia.   American Engineers has worked on several projects in Kentucky's  Second District, including the William H. Natcher Parkway, the  Owensboro Health Regional Hospital, and the Western Kentucky University  baseball field.   Next week is Small Business Week, and I cannot think of a better  example of building a small business from the ground up than Ben, his  wife, Dianne, and his family. Ben is an outstanding member of our  community, and I am proud to recognize his achievements.                            ____________________
