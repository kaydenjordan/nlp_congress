 Mr. President, I intend to object to any unanimous  consent request relating to the nomination of Helaine Ann Greenfeld, to  be an Assistant Attorney General at the Department of Justice, PN459,  and Christopher H. Schroeder, to be an Assistant Attorney General at  the Department of Justice, PN370.   Last week, at the Senate Judiciary Committee's executive business  meeting, I noted my intent to vote for both nominees but object to any  unanimous consent request for their confirmation. Ms. Greenfeld will  lead the Justice Department's Office of Legislative Affairs and Mr.  Schroeder will lead the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel.  Both of these components are at the heart of my congressional oversight  requests and the Department's failure to respond. I have made this  decision clearly not on the basis of their credentials but on the basis  of the Justice Department's failure to respond to congressional  oversight requests.   To date, the Justice Department has failed to provide a full and  complete response to any of my oversight requests. I said the same  thing when I objected to any unanimous consent request relating to the  Kenneth Polite nomination on June 22, 2021. Nothing has changed.   For example, on July 15, 2021, my staff had yet another call with the  Justice Department's Office of Legislative Affairs, the very office Ms.  Greenfeld will be in charge of. On that call, the Department wanted to  know why I had a hold on Mr. Polite and whether they could do anything  to change my mind. My staff made clear to the Department that the  issues before them are quite simple: Attorney General Garland must  respond to my oversight letters and records requests.   The Department asked for that call with my staff, and the Department  did not provide my staff a substantive update on any of my oversight  requests. It is absurd for the Department to schedule a call relating  to my hold on Mr. Polite, which was done due to the Department's  consistent failure to respond to my oversight requests, and then have  no updates relating to any of my oversight requests.   As one of many examples of unanswered questions and requests, on  February 3, 2021, and March 9, 2021, Senator Johnson and I requested  information from the Justice Department relating to Nicholas McQuaid.  Mr. McQuaid was Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal  Division, the position Mr. Polite now holds. In those letters, we  raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest in light of the  fact that Mr. McQuaid was employed at Latham & Watkins until January  20, 2021, and worked with Christopher Clark, whom Hunter Biden  reportedly hired to work on his Federal criminal case.   This arrangement presents an ongoing potential conflict of interest  given the fact Mr. McQuaid is still employed at the Criminal Division  as the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General. A core function of  congressional oversight is to ensure that governmental departments and  agencies are free of conflicts of interest. That is especially so with  the Justice Department and FBI. If conflicts infect them, those  investigations and prosecutions--the very purpose of the Department's  existence--could be undermined.   As a part of my oversight, I have requested a recusal memo for Mr.  McQuaid. I have also requested to know, as a threshold issue, whether  one even exists.   Attorney General Garland has failed to answer and provide the  requested records. I have noted to the Department that in 2016, I  received from the Department Andrew McCabe's recusal memo to illustrate  precedent exists for such a production to Congress. Still, the Justice  Department refuses to provide the same for Mr. McQuaid.   On the July 15, 2021, call with my staff, they again raised my  questions about Mr. McQuaid. The Department was unable to provide any  legitimate basis upon which it could not answer my questions and again  failed to provide any update on the Department's response.   As I have noted before with respect to the Federal Government's  failure to respond to legitimate congressional oversight requests,  there is nothing more eroding of public faith than an unresponsive  executive branch that believes it only answers to the President and not  the U.S. Congress and, perhaps most importantly, ``We the People.''   This administration's continued, ongoing, and blatant lack of  cooperation has again forced my hand.  [[Page S5067]]    Thus, unfortunately, I must object to any consideration of these  nominees. My objection is not intended to question the credentials of  Ms. Greenfeld and Mr. Schroeder in any way. The executive branch must  recognize that it has an ongoing obligation to respond to congressional  inquiries in a timely and reasonable manner.                            ____________________
