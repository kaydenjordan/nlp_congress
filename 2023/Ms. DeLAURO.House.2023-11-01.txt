 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the House Republican 2024  Legislative Branch funding bill.   This bill falls short of ensuring we can continue to grow a strong  and well-functioning legislative branch that is essential to our  democracy.   As an institution, we should be increasing our ability to serve our  constituents and recruit and retain talented staff and United States  Capitol Police officers. We should not merely be treading water.   This bill eliminates the Office of Diversity and Inclusion and does  nothing to facilitate the use of funds for collective bargaining rights  for congressional staffers.   This bill also does not allow legislative branch agencies to employ  individuals who are authorized for employment under the Deferred Action  for Childhood Arrivals Act, DACA.                                time  1645    We made progress in the last Congress, but this bill will take us  backwards.   Ranking Member Espaillat said during the markup of this bill, but I  believe it is a point that we should emphasize again today: We all have  an obligation to make sure that our staff, whether they serve here in  Washington, D.C., or if they serve in our home districts, are safe.   I support my colleague's efforts to increase funding to bolster that  safety.   This bill is not an appropriate venue for divisive and partisan  language, especially the extreme and offensive culture wars riders that  House Republicans have placed in each one of the appropriations bills  that we have considered.   We should be working together to ensure that the Congress is able to  serve the American people, complete the people's business safely,  securely, and efficiently, our political differences notwithstanding.   Bipartisan, bicameral legislation is required to keep the government  open. Otherwise, the President will not sign a bill. Bipartisan,  bicameral legislation is required to fully fund the legislative branch.  It is time for House Republicans to abandon a partisan path to nowhere  and to join House Democrats at the negotiation table.   We have wasted enough time. Let us move forward. We are here. We are  ready to get to work for the American people.   For all of these reasons, I cannot support this bill, and I ask  others not to support it.
