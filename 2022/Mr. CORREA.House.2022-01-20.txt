 Mr. Speaker, today, we honor the life and memory of  Officer Bobby Reed.   He was born November 23, 1951, and Bobby Reed's life was about  service to his community and to his country.   As a marine, he was deployed overseas to Vietnam, where he served  honorably and attained the rank of staff sergeant.   When he returned home to Santa Ana, California, my hometown, he  decided to join the local police department to continue protecting and  serving his community.   During his 28 years of service on the Santa Ana police force, Officer  Reed was honored many times over by his colleagues and his community  for his exemplary service and character. Multiple civic organizations,  such as Kiwanis and MADD, recognized him with many awards.   He was also elected as a board member of the Santa Ana Police  Officers Association, showing, again, his leadership and his positive  influence on others.   As we celebrate Bobby's life, may his example continue to shine for  the next generation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support of the EVEST  Act.   All gave some, and many made the ultimate sacrifice. America has made  a promise to our veterans that we will take care of them when they  return home.   I represent Orange County, California, and many of my constituents  have served their country proudly. One of my constituents, Billy Hall,  from the city of Orange, enlisted at the age of 15, served from 1941 to  1945 in World War II, and again from 1948 to 1967 in the Korean and  Vietnam wars.   Every servicemember deserves our respect and gratitude, and most of  all, all the benefits and care that we promised them when they would  return home.   This bill is very simple but very important. It automatically enrolls  veterans in the healthcare system. It provides veterans healthcare  without the red tape.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the EVEST Act and pass this  simple and important commonsense legislation for our veterans.    Mr. Speaker, today we honor the life and memory of Manny  T. Padilla, a leader in our community and my very, very good friend.  [[Page H274]]    Manny served on many boards, commissions, and organizations in Orange  County, and he also served 9 years on the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce  of Orange County's Board of Directors.    Among his many accomplishments, he was honored as Volunteer of the  Year by the University of Georgetown, as well as receiving the Lifetime  Achievement Award from the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of the State of  California.   Manny's story started in New Mexico when he was 17. Then his high  school principal chose two of the best students in his high school to  be part of the Boys State program. Manny was one of those students.   He moved to Washington, D.C. later on and attended Georgetown  University while he worked for then-Senator Dennis Chavez. Years later  he attended law school where he met his wife, Betty, at the same time  while working at the Department of Labor. They had four children. And  Manny had a very long career in the private sector working for State  Farm Insurance.   As we celebrate his life, we know his memory will serve as a great  example to this next generation.
