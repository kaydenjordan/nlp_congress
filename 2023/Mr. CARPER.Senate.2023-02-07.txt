 Mr. President, I stand today on behalf of  Delaware's congressional delegation to recognize the 100th anniversary  of the broiler chicken industry and its contributions to the region's  economy, our Nation's food supply, and its innovations in farming  practices over the last century. Raising broiler chickens is a way of  life for the more than 1,300 farm families on Delmarva whose hard work  provides food for hundreds of thousands of people in our country and  around the world.   The industry all started with an accidental delivery. In 1923, Ocean  View, DE, resident Cecile Steele ordered 50 chickens, but instead she  received 500. This led Cecile and her husband, Wilmer, to start the  first broiler chicken farm on Delmarva. Within 3 years, their new  business grew exponentially, and the Steele family built enough coops  to house 10,000 chickens. This new kind of farm--one dedicated to  raising chickens for meat instead of laying eggs--paved the way for the  modern U.S. broiler chicken industry we know today.   The industry may have started with an accidental delivery, but we can  look back on it now as an amazing economic opportunity for Delmarva and  the thousands of families it supports. Farms in our region now produce  567 million chickens a year; 200 million of those chickens are raised  in Delaware. The poultry industry has $13.6 billion in economic impact  and supports more than 51,900 jobs. It also purchases $1.3 billion  worth of crops like corn, soybeans, and wheat annually, making this  industry a major purchaser for hundreds of other farmers.   I have long known that many farmers are among our best environmental  stewards since my days as Governor of Delaware when my administration  worked with farmers to create common-sense, effective environmental  strategies like the farmer-led Nutrient Management Commission. Today,  the adverse impacts of chicken farming on our environment has greatly  decreased. Compared to 1960, it now takes 75 percent fewer resources to  produce the same amount of chicken than it did back then, and more than  95 percent of poultry litter is recycled and reused as organic, locally  produced fertilizer for crops like corn, soybeans, wheat, and  mushrooms.   It is with great pleasure that I rise on behalf of U.S. Senator Chris  Coons and U.S. Representative Lisa Blunt Rochester to honor the 100th  anniversary of the Delmarva chicken industry. Along with the hard work  of the many farmers, suppliers, employees, not to mention the Delmarva  Chicken Association that is celebrating its 75th anniversary this year,  the Delmarva chicken industry keeps Delaware's economy  thriving.                            ____________________
