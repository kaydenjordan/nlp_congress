 Mr. Speaker, in November, thousands of  marines will graduate from Marine Corps Infantry Training Battalion.  These brave men and women will go on to serve and protect the United  States and our allies across the world.   One such marine is Rece T. Rader from Winston-Salem. His mother,  Angela, recently wrote to me about his graduation from boot camp at  Parris Island and his subsequent move to Camp Geiger.   In her letter, she spoke passionately about how COVID-19 has made it  incredibly hard for military families to celebrate alongside their  loved ones who have completed their program requirements.   Her story applies to so many families, and it highlights the  importance of recognizing the many accomplishments of these airmen,  marines, soldiers, sailors, and guardsmen.   COVID-19 has disrupted the lives of all Americans in many ways.   It is, however, very unfortunate that COVID-19 has deprived the  servicemembers of the physical and moral support that comes with the  attendance of their families at graduation ceremonies.    To all servicemembers who are currently preparing for duty: We are  incredibly proud of you. Your hard work and dedication have not gone  unnoticed, and you serve as the role models that young people look to  for inspiration.   Today and every day, we should celebrate your accomplishments and the  strides you continue to make.   Though we may not be able to congratulate you all in person, please  know we will always celebrate you no matter how close or how far away  you may be.   May God bless you, your families, and the United States of America.                               Life Is Winning     Mr. Speaker, life is winning.   Recently, a great new book by Marjorie Dannenfelser, President of the  Susan B. Anthony List, has been published that is entitled, ``Life Is  Winning.''   Currently, I am halfway through the book, but can wholeheartedly  recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning about the fight  for life in our country and to learn more about the role of elected  officials in this fight.   Many people, publicly known and unknown, have been working diligently  to preserve what our Declaration of Independence says we are  guaranteed: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   Mr. Speaker, without question, life is the fundamental component to  liberty and the pursuit of happiness.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Marjorie, all the staff at Susan B. Anthony, the  staff at National Right to Life, and the wonderful people at the State  and local levels who pray diligently and work every day to promote the  culture of life, which we know is supported by a majority of Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I thank President Trump and Vice-President Pence for  their steadfast support of life. They understand that life must be  protected and fought for at every turn.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  call up H.R. 8265 to extend the Paycheck Protection Program to keep  millions of employees on the payroll of America's small businesses.    Mr. Speaker, our colleagues across the  aisle try to convince Americans that this bill is a compromise and  bipartisan. That is a joke, Mr. Speaker. Compromise, to Democrats,  means do it their way.   When it comes to spending taxpayer dollars, hard-earned money,  though, the Democrats just can't seem to help themselves. The latest  example is this $2.2 trillion socialist wish list, which is riddled  with radical left priorities that are unrelated to the pandemic.   For example, it props up failing pension plans for select community  newspapers. What does this have to do with the COVID-19 pandemic? The  newspaper industry has been in decline for decades, and these companies  have had a longstanding inability to meet their pension obligations.   The bill also forgives up to $10,000 of private student loan debt.  Again, this does nothing to combat COVID-19. But massive loan  forgiveness, despite the high cost to taxpayers, has long been a  Democrat objective.   So why are we considering this partisan scheme? Because come election  day, Democrats are hoping to cash in on this bill's many empty  promises.   It is disingenuous and it is disappointing. We all must vote ``no.''    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, Blake Lovette, a  true giant not only in the North Carolina agriculture community, but in  the civic community, passed away unexpectedly.   Blake was a good friend, and to say he made a profound impact on the  Wilkes County community would be an understatement.   From his time on the Wilkes Board of Education to his role as the  president of ConAgra Poultry, Blake was never satisfied with the status  quo and believed that complacency was never an option. As chairman of  the Wilkes County Republican Party, Blake exercised a level of  diligence and grace that was second to none.   To Blake's family, I pray that God will continue to bless you and  give you comfort during this difficult time.                            ____________________
