 Mr. President, as we continue our  efforts to tackle the effects of COVID-19, both in terms of healthcare  and the economic fallout, CARES 2 could be a critical piece to the  puzzle.   Americans continue to mask up, social distance, and do what we can do  as individuals to slow the spread of the virus. Here, in the Senate, we  know that we must find additional ways to keep our people as healthy as  possible while we reopen our economy as safely as we can.   We also know that low wage and service industry workers have taken  the hardest economic hit from the virus. This stems, in part, from  restaurants either being closed or operating at a limited capacity. In  April, one out of four individuals to lose their jobs lost their jobs  in the restaurant industry. That is 5.5 million Americans who lost  their jobs in the restaurant business.   While those losses have certainly begun to recover, and even as our  restaurants adjust and innovate to find new ways to serve customers,  there is no doubt they need some additional help. That is why I worked  on the provision in this legislation that will provide a 100-percent  deduction for business meals--up from 50 percent.   We know that through outdoor dining, carryout, delivery, and, in some  places around the country, limited indoor dining, we can keep folks  safe. This incentive will lead to more orders that will translate into  more take-home pay and more hours for wait staff and kitchen staff and  more revenues for millions of small businesses. That is a great thing  and an easy thing to accomplish with this simple provision.
