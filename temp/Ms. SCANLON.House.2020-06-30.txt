 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Morelle for yielding to me, and  I second his remarks regarding Russian bounty. I am proud to rise in  support here today of H.R. 2.   H.R. 2 will make meaningful, long-overdue investments in our roads,  bridges, airports, ports, and transportation systems. It will invest  billions in zero-emission, and modernize road systems to reduce  gridlock, something we can all cheer about in my district.   This is game-changing, economy-altering legislation. So when I hear  my colleagues talk about the price tag on a bill like this, I have to  wonder where exactly they think this money is going. This bill invests  directly in American families, in workers, and in the communities in  which we live.   Stakeholders in my district have been crying out for a comprehensive  infrastructure bill for years. I represent Pennsylvania's Fifth  District, which is the gateway to the Philadelphia region. My district  is home to the Philadelphia port and shipyard, home to one of the  busiest airports in the country, home to the Eastern Seaboard's  passenger and freight rail lines, plus commuter rails, streetcars,  subways, and a network of interstate bridges and roads, all of which  are in serious need of upkeep.   But this bill is not just about the concrete that will be poured to  fix potholes or the steel used to renovate a bridge. It is an  investment in the American people at a time when it is needed most.    H.R. 2 will provide good-paying, stable jobs that can support  American workers and their families. At a time when we are facing  double-digit unemployment in the United States, a massive investment in  our people is exactly what we need.   This bill will put people back to work, prevent further erosion of  our environment, and give children and families the support they  desperately need.   In doing so, this bill lays down the important principle that when we  invest in our infrastructure and our economy, we must do so in a way  that builds for the 21st century and beyond rather than trying to re- create an unsustainable or inequitable past.   H.R. 2 also includes one of my priorities, the Reopen and Rebuild  America's Schools Act, which will invest $130 billion into rundown,  obsolete, and often dangerous school facilities that pose risks for  students, teachers, and staffs.   Many of the communities I represent are in dire need of these funds,  and I would be willing to bet that many of your communities are as  well.   This isn't an urban vs. rural issue. Public schools nationwide have  been underfunded for decades, and our children have paid the price.   In the last 18 months and before being sworn in, in my prior career,  I had visited far too many schools that lack basic facilities, like  working water fountains, space for physical education, or a library. I  have visited schools that have crumbling plaster and lead paint on the  walls and asbestos in the insulation, schools that have exposed  radiators and pipes in classrooms that can give a child second-degree  burns. This legislation is critical, and I am proud to support it.                                time  1115
