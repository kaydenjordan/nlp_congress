 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Head  Start Awareness Month.   Since 1965, Head Start has been one of our best tools in the war on  poverty, helping over 35 million children from ages 0 to 5 reach their  full potential through high-quality early education.   This month, as we paid tribute to the game-changing program, I rise  to honor Head Start programs in California's 21st Congressional  District and the vital work they do to support Central Valley  communities.   This summer, I brought my esteemed colleague Congresswoman Barbara  Lee to the Rosa Parks Learning Center in Hanford, a top-tier Head Start  center operated by the Kings Community Action Organization. It was  truly an honor to see talented Central Valley educators at work and to  join them in the classroom. We even got to read a couple of books to  the classes, as well.   We all know that even part-time early childhood education has a  lasting impact on young kids, helping them develop reading, writing,  math, and even social skills on an accelerated timeline.   I am also proud to support legislation like the Community Services  Block Grant Act so we can keep providing quality education to all of  our kids regardless of ZIP Code.                            ____________________
