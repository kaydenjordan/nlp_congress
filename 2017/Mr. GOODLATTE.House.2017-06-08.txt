 Mr. Chair, I would first like to thank Chairman  Hensarling for introducing this important piece of legislation.   The CHOICE Act replaces the orderly liquidation authority under title  II of Dodd-Frank with a new bankruptcy procedure developed by the  Committee on the Judiciary in the Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act.   In 2008, our economy suffered one of the most significant financial  crises in history. In the ensuing years, experts from the financial,  regulatory, legal, and academic communities have examined how best to  prevent another similar crisis from occurring and to eliminate the  possibility of using taxpayer moneys to bail out failing firms.   The Judiciary Committee has advanced the review of this issue, with  the aim of crafting a solution that will better equip our bankruptcy  laws to resolve failing firms, while also encouraging greater private  counterparty diligence in order to reduce the likelihood of another  financial crisis.   The Financial Institution Bankruptcy Act is the culmination of a  multiyear, bipartisan process that solicited and incorporated the views  of a wide range of leading experts and relevant regulators. The CHOICE  Act incorporates all of the provisions of the Financial Institution  Bankruptcy Act, providing a balanced approach that increases  transparency and predictability in the resolution of a financial firm.   Furthermore, it ensures that shareholders and creditors--not  taxpayers--bear the losses related to the failure of a financial  company.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
