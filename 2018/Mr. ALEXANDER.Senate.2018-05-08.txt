 Mr. President, for the sixth consecutive year,  ObamaCare insurance rates are going up, and Democrats are already  running around pointing fingers, trying to find someone else to blame.   About 10 days ago, the distinguished Democratic leader came to the  floor and warned that, very soon, health insurance companies will be  announcing rates for 2019 in each State across the country. He said  that many health insurance companies will propose rate increases.   Today, several Democratic Senators held a press conference saying  that insurance rates are going to go up in 2019. Well, they are exactly  right. Insurance premiums are going to go up in 2019, just as they have  for the 5 previous years of ObamaCare. But they are exactly wrong about  who to blame.   The Democrats wrote the bill. They wrote ObamaCare, and they voted  for ObamaCare--every single one of them. Not a single one of us voted  for ObamaCare. They wrote the bill. If they are looking for someone to  blame, they should look in the mirror.   Running around, pointing fingers, and trying to find someone else to  blame is a little like selling somebody a house with a leaky roof and  then blaming the new owner for the leaky roof. Democrats built the  house with the leaky roof. They built these insurance markets--the  individual markets, where no one can find insurance. They wrote the  sloppy law. They failed to make the markets competitive, and they  erased the ability of consumers to have choices. They didn't follow the  law when they paid out cost-sharing payments that were designed to help  low-income Americans pay for their out-of-pocket expenses, and--this is  the very worst--when Republicans were prepared 1 month ago to stabilize  these markets and, according to the Oliver Wyman healthcare experts, to  lower rates by up to 40 percent over 3 years, the Democrats said no.   President Trump asked Speaker Ryan and he asked Senator McConnell to  put that bipartisan proposal in the omnibus spending bill that passed.  The Republicans said yes, and the Democrats said no. So the rates are  going up because Democrats wrote the law, and they said no to lowering  the rates.   What Democrats don't say--but every American should know very well-- is that health insurance rates didn't start increasing when President  Trump took office 15 or 16 months ago. Insurance rates have been  increasing since ObamaCare took effect more than 5 years ago.   In 2010, there was a big discussion at the Blair House. I was invited  to make the Republican case for President Obama, who stayed there all  day and listened.   I said: Respectfully, Mr. President, the Affordable Care Act will not  work. I said directly to him that ObamaCare would send an unfunded  Medicaid mandate to States. It did.   I said: It will cut Medicare by one-half trillion dollars. It did.   I said: There will be new taxes in it. There were.   I said: It will mean that for millions of Americans, premiums will go  up because when people pay those new taxes, premiums go up, and they  will also go up because of the government mandates--and they have, for  5 years. Now the Democrats are pointing out that their law, which they  passed, will cause rates to go up for the sixth consecutive year.   Back in 2010, I said: Our country is too big, too complicated, too  decentralized for Washington, DC--just a few of us here--to write a few  rules about remaking 17 percent of the economy all at once. That is the  size of the healthcare economy. That sort of thinking works in the  classroom, but it doesn't work very well in the big, complicated  country which is the United States of America. Since the  [[Page S2544]]  ObamaCare exchanges opened in 2014, history has proved this--what I  said--to be right.   The Affordable Care Act has not worked the way Democrats promised. It  certainly hasn't worked that way for Marty, a farmer in Tennessee who  stopped me at a Chick-fil-A last December. She wanted to tell me that  before ObamaCare her rates were $300 a month. She is in the individual  market. She doesn't get a subsidy. She pays these rates herself. This  year, it is $1,300. Next year, it will be more.   Rates in Tennessee for people like Marty went up 58 percent this past  year. That is a lot of money. People can't afford it. She is one of  thousands of others in Tennessee who have seen their premiums increase  176 percent since 2013, the year before the ObamaCare marketplaces  opened.   The Affordable Care Act hasn't worked for the 9 million Americans,  like Marty, who purchased their health insurance in the individual  market and received no government subsidy. They have been hammered by  skyrocketing insurance premiums, and Democrats come to the floor and  say: Well, they are going up for the sixth straight year.   If I were them, I would want to keep it quiet. But, no, they are  looking for somebody to blame. They don't want to look in the mirror.  They wrote the bill. They are the reason the rates are going up. They  have rejected any reasonable attempt to change the law. They will not  even support changes that they are for--that they know aren't working.   The Affordable Care Act does not work because it is too Washington,  DC, focused. It has made insurance too expensive, and it is hurting the  American people. So last year, Republicans tried to repeal the law to  help make health insurance work again for people like Marty, the farmer  I met at Chick-fil-A. We came up short.   While I hope that Senators Graham and Cassidy can build a coalition  to try again, there is still the urgent problem of skyrocketing  ObamaCare premiums. It did not have to be this way. The Senator from  Washington, Mrs. Murray--the lead Democrat on the Senate HELP  Committee--and I last year announced that we would hold hearings to see  if there were steps Congress could take to stabilize and strengthen the  individual health insurance markets so that Americans could buy  insurance at affordable prices in 2019.   President Trump called me in August of last year, and he asked me to  work with Senator Murray to try to come up with a temporary solution so  people who were hurt by the skyrocketing ObamaCare prices would not be  hurt while Congress concluded what to do in the long term. In  September, our committee hosted four bipartisan hearings. We invited  all of the Senators to come to meetings before the hearings. We had  about half of the Members of the Senate involved in those meetings and  hearings. Out of those meetings and hearings, we came up with three  proposals that Congress could pass that would temporarily lower rates  over the next 3 years, according to Oliver Wyman, one of the most well- respected healthcare experts in the country, by up to 40 percent over  those 3 years.   No. 1, our proposal had 3 years of reinsurance grants at $10 billion  a year so States could create funds to insure the needs of the very  sick. You take the very sick out of the pool, care for them, and then  you can lower the rates for everyone in the individual market. That is  3 years and $10 billion a year. That was the first proposal.   No. 2 is 3 years of cost-sharing reduction subsidies to help low- income Americans pay out-of-pocket expenses. It is counterintuitive,  but when you pay those expenses, you actually lower the deficit. You  lower the cost to taxpayers because it lowers the premiums, and that  lowers the subsidies. You actually save taxpayer money when you pay  those 3 years of cost-sharing subsidies.   No. 3, we took a provision that is in the Affordable Care Act called  the innovation waiver--it was already there, and it wasn't working--and  we agreed to streamline it so that it would work and the State might  make an application and say we have a better idea.   We said: You can't change the essential health benefits and you can't  change the prohibition on lifetime limits. You still have to give  people an offer of insurance if they have a preexisting condition. All  of those provisions and protections were still in our bill, but that  new flexibility would have allowed Iowa and other States to increase  their choices and lower premiums. It would have allowed New York,  Minnesota, and New Hampshire to do things their Democratic Senators  said they badly wanted to do and their Governors said they badly wanted  to do.   There was new authority for a catastrophic insurance policy with  lower premiums and higher deductibles that people could choose. That  was in there too. This is the package that the Oliver Wyman expert said  if you are a contractor and you are making $60,000 and your insurance  is $20,000, it could reduce your premium from $20,000 to $12,000 over 3  years. That was the package.   Almost all Democrats liked those three ideas. The truth is, a lot of  Republicans and conservative groups were skeptical about them because  they said it would ``shore up ObamaCare.'' But the Congressional Budget  Office said that if the scoring reflects the cost-sharing payments  being paid, our proposal would actually save taxpayer dollars by  lowering premiums and, therefore, lowering subsidies.   So this would sound like a very good proposal; wouldn't it? It is  something that at one point Democratic leaders said every Democrat  could vote for, something that more than half of the Senate  participated in--reinsurance, cost-sharing subsidies, and more  flexibility without changing the basic guarantees of the Affordable  Care Act. That sounds very much like a proposal that might come from  the other side of the aisle, not the Republican side of the aisle. Yet,  on the Saturday before we passed the omnibus spending bill, President  Trump called Speaker Ryan and Senator McConnell and said: Will you  please put that provision in the omnibus spending bill?   They said yes. The Democrats said no.   The Democrats have written this ObamaCare bill, which for 6 years has  raised rates. Then, we come up with a proposal that every Democrat  should like, and they say no. They will not even support changing one  sentence of a law, even if it changes parts that don't work and that  they are for.   What was their reason? Here is their reason. They would not apply to  our proposal the traditional Hyde compromise language regarding Federal  funding for elective abortions. What that basically says is that there  may be no Federal funding for elective abortions, but States may do  what they want. That has been the compromise since 1976. Since 1976, in  every omnibus appropriations bill, Democrats have voted for that. In  fact, all those weren't omnibus bills. Some of them were different  appropriations bills. Since 1976, in every appropriations bill,  Democrats have voted for the Hyde amendment. In the omnibus  appropriations bill that we passed a month ago, Democrats voted for the  Hyde amendment more than 100 times in other proposals, but they would  not vote to lower health insurance rates by 40 percent over 3 years.   I will say that again. Even though they voted for the Hyde language  every year since 1976 and voted for it 100 times in the omnibus bill,  they would not vote for it. They would not vote for our proposal to  lower rates even though it was bipartisan because they didn't want to  apply that same compromise Hyde amendment to health insurance.   Howard Baker, the Senate majority leader, once said that the essence  of Senate leadership is becoming an eloquent listener. That means  hearing and understanding what people have to say because what they are  saying is not always what they mean.   My conclusion is that, by their words and by their actions, what  Democrats really were saying is this: We will not change one sentence  of ObamaCare, even the parts that obviously are not working and even  when most of the Democrats would support the policy and the changes.   Given the Democrats' attitude, I know of nothing that Republicans and  Democrats can agree on to stabilize the individual health insurance  market. I know of nothing.   No one regrets Congress's failure to reach an agreement on this more  than  [[Page S2545]]  I do. I ran for the U.S. Senate because I wanted to achieve bipartisan  results on important issues. I have often been able to do that, but I  literally struck out here.    When Democrats blocked these proposals from being included in the  omnibus in March, I said: ``Now let's look down the road . . .  insurance companies will announce their rates for 2019 . . . and rates  will continue going up instead of going down.''   They are right about that. Already in the last few days, it has been  announced that rates will go up in 2019. Millions of Americans will be  hearing more about that. The Democrats could have worked with us to  lower premiums by up to 40 percent. They instead chose to cling to an  unworkable law, to skyrocketing rates, and to reject any change that  would have temporarily reduced rates, even though the President and the  Republican leaders were willing to support ideas that the Democrats, as  a matter of policy, almost unanimously support.   For relief, we will have to turn to the Trump administration and to  the States. I am encouraged by Labor Secretary Acosta's proposed rule  on association health plans. It would help some self-employed  Americans, like Marty, the farmer, and employees of small companies to  buy the same kind of insurance with the same lower cost and the same  protections that roughly 160 million Americans who work for large  employers have today. In other words, if you work for IBM, you in  effect get about a $5,000 average tax break because of the way the tax  law applies to employer insurance. We would like to give the same  opportunity to the self-employed and to people in small businesses.   The Trump administration has also proposed a rule that would reaffirm  the role of States in regulating short-term health insurance and that  could provide a coverage option for Americans who are uninsured because  plans in the Affordable Care Act markets are too expensive. Neither of  these changes require the approval of Congress.   I am talking with Secretary Azar and Seema Verma, the Administrator  of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, about other  administrative actions they can take to give States more flexibility  within the current law to help lower health insurance premiums,  especially for the 9 million working Americans who do not receive a  Federal subsidy in the individual market.   Those are the ones who are getting hammered. Those are the one whose  rates we could have reduced by up to 40 percent over the next 3 years,  but the Democrats said no.   I will be encouraging Governors and State insurance commissioners to  do everything they can to repair the damage caused by the Affordable  Care Act, but my own efforts as chairman of the HELP Committee will  turn to other pressing healthcare issues, including the opioid crisis,  overall healthcare costs, electronic healthcare records, prescription  drug prices, and the 340B program.   Contrary to the Democratic leader's speech, this is not a crisis of  Republicans' making. Democrats should look in the mirror. The last 5  years and the upcoming 6 years of premium increases are the fault of a  law designed, drafted, and voted on exclusively by Democrats.   Last year, Republicans freed Americans from the individual mandate  requirement, which was a tax on the poor that forced many Americans to  buy insurance they couldn't afford or didn't meet their needs. We tried  to provide even more freedom from this unworkable law, but, as I have  detailed, Democrats said no.   If you have an insurance premium that is going up 40 percent next  year, on top of the more than 105 percent increases since 2013, you can  thank the Democrats. If you would like greater choice and an  opportunity for lower premiums, you should support Republicans.   I yield the floor.
