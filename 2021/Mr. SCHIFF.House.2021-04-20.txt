 Madam Speaker, an open letter to President Joseph Biden:   Mr. President, in just 5 days, the world will mark the 106th  anniversary of the beginning of the Armenian genocide, the systematic  murder and displacement of 1.5 million Armenian women, men, and  children by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923. This will be the  first April 24 of your Presidency and your first opportunity to follow  through on your promise to recognize the genocide and your decades of  leadership on this issue.   On behalf of hundreds of thousands of Armenian Americans, the  children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of genocide survivors,  I ask you to keep that promise and recognize the Armenian genocide.   The facts of the genocide are not in serious dispute. They were  recorded in real time by American diplomats who lacked a name for the  barbaric and systematic extermination of the Armenian people but knew  that it was without precedent in human history. Millions of Armenians  were beaten, raped, killed, and marched across deserts by the Ottoman  Empire.   From the blood and rubble, the Armenian people survived. Tens of  thousands of orphaned children owe their lives to the generosity of  Americans who created the Near East Relief Foundation. Those children  and their descendants crossed the ocean to build lives in Los Angeles  and across the Nation.   You know these facts well, and you have spoken about them directly,  including as a candidate for President. As President, it is now in your  power to help right decades of denial and in so doing give meaning to  your statement last year when you acknowledged the genocide and said  that silence is complicity.   As a candidate and now as President, you have spoken of your  commitment to human rights. You have spoken of an America who leads not  by example of our power, but by the power of our example. If that  principle is to have meaning, we cannot waver from it just because it  may be inconvenient.   The word genocide is significant because genocide is not a problem of  the past, it is a problem of today, including in Xinjiang where Uighurs  face a relentless campaign by the Chinese Communist Party to wipe out  their culture. And it is a danger today in Artsakh where Turkey  assisted Azerbaijan in making war on the Armenians again, and in so  doing, threaten another potential genocide. What a comfort it would be  to the perpetrators of crimes against humanity in the present day if  the most powerful nation on Earth could be cowed into silence about the  events of a century ago.   In recognizing the genocide, you will be joining both the House and  the Senate who voted overwhelmingly in 2019 to do so.   Mr. President, we must not resort to euphemisms or half-truths. The  murder of 1.5 million Armenians was an atrocity--that is surely true-- but it was more than that. The act of seeking to destroy a people and a  culture is a different kind of evil, and it was not until Raphael  Lemkin coined the term genocide that we had a word to describe it.   Millions of Armenians, in Yerevan and across the world, tens of  thousands of my constituents, Mr. President, will look to you later  this week to see if you will join leaders in France, Germany, the  European Union, the Vatican, and in 49 States in recognizing the  genocide.   It is my deepest wish that you will speak the truth in all of its  horror and recognize the Armenian genocide.                            ____________________
