 Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I rise today to voice my strong opposition to the 2018  Republican farm bill.   As a member of the House Committee on Agriculture, I have  participated in countless hearings about the needs of our Nation's  farmers and families that depend on SNAP to fight hunger.   Tragically, this bill doesn't reflect any of that testimony. It is a  shortsighted, partisan bill that will have a detrimental impact on  communities like mine. I cannot support it.   In my home county of Mecklenburg, North Carolina, more than 55,000  households depend on SNAP to eat every day. This bill would rob them of  access to quality nutrition programs. In North Carolina, it is  estimated that more than 133,000 people will lose their SNAP benefits  if this bill passes, including over 51,000 children. Nationwide, 2  million people would be kicked off the program and an estimated 265,000  children would lose access to free or reduced meals at school. No  eating at home. No eating at school.   Adding new work requirements through an unfunded, untested mandate  will bankrupt States and force more needy people out of the program.  Let's scrap this flawed partisan farm bill and let's work together in  regular order to draft a bill that helps America's farmers and families  who depend on nutrition assistance.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from Mecklenburg County,  North Carolina, opposing H.R. 2 because of the detrimental effects and  impact that it will have on our children and families there.                                             Mecklenburg County,                          Charlotte, North Carolina, April 17, 2018.      Congresswoman Alma Adams,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman Alma Adams: As you mark-up of the Farm       Bill reauthorization, H.R. 2 this week, I write to you in       support of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program       (SNAP) funding, formerly known as Food Stamps, which has       historically made up a significant part of this legislation.       This vital program offers nutrition assistance to millions of       eligible, low-income individuals and families and provides       economic benefits to communities. In total, more than 40       million low-income people depend upon this program to keep       their families fed.        The Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (H.R. 2) is the       legislative vehicle for reauthorizing and reforming the       programs of the Department of Agriculture through fiscal year       2023. The last enacted Farm Bill (PL 113-79) is set to expire       on September 30. The proposed reauthorization bill is       scheduled for markup with the House Agriculture Committee       this Wednesday, April 18. It contains several provisions and       budget cuts that are troubling and could detrimentally impact       our community.        The bill includes provisions that expand work requirements       and punish the least fortunate members of our community who       are often times unable to find employment. Specifically, the       bill makes it mandatory that recipients of SNAP, who are       able-bodied adults, ages 18 to 59, are either employed or are       participating in state-run employment or job-training       programs. Participants could be denied benefits for not       meeting the new work requirements. The first suspension of       benefits would be for 12 months, while a second suspension of       benefits would be up to 36 months. Under current law, the       SNAP program already has work requirements for able-bodied       adults aged 18 to 49. Additionally, the new Farm Bill would       include spending cuts, which would make fewer people eligible       for benefits and directly harm working-poor families.       Mecklenburg County has real concern that these proposed       changes in H.R. 2 would negatively impact some of our poorest       citizens and cause serious difficulties for our community's       most vulnerable populations.        Mecklenburg has 55,472 households that rely on SNAP to help       provide sustenance. The County also has specific concerns       with language in H.R. 2 that reduces spending by $5 billion       over 10 years through the ending of a broad-based categorical       eligibility that allows states to consider working poor       beneficiaries with higher incomes that put them above 130       percent of the federal poverty level.        We look forward to working with you on this important       effort. Please feel free to contact me if you have any       questions.            Sincerely,                                                    Dena R. Diorio,                                        Mecklenburg County Manager.
