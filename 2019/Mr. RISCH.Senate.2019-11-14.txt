 Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  However, in honor of Veterans Day on November 11, this month I will  honor a veteran-owned small business for each of the 10 days the Senate  is in legislative session. The personal sacrifices made by America's  veterans have protected the very freedoms and values that give each of  us and our children the ability to achieve the American dream. The  skills veterans learn as members of the military are invaluable and  undoubtedly contribute to Idaho's flourishing veteran business  community. I am proud of the sacrifices veterans have made to protect  our country and that they are choosing Idaho to call home when they  complete their service in the military.   As your United States Senator from the great State of Idaho, it is my  pleasure to recognize Critical Power Products and Services in Post  Falls as the Veteran-owned Idaho Small Business of the Day for November  14, 2019. Critical Power is owned and operated by U.S. Army veteran  Will Alt. The company is a proven leader in backup power and cooling  system recycling and redistribution. The company serves customers who  want to dispose of and purchase backup diesel and natural gas  generators, air-handling equipment, uninterrupted power supply systems,  power distribution units, chillers, cooling towers, and raised access  floors. The company provides its services to small regional firms as  well as international Fortune 500 companies across all sectors.   Alt opened Critical Power Products and Services in Post Falls in  2018. Alt served in the U.S. Army for 5 years, which included multiple  overseas tours attached to a multinational special operation team.  Critical Power attributes much of its success to Alt's time serving our  Nation, stating ``it ingrained professionalism, discipline, and  dedication into his work ethic that is second to none.'' The company  employs several veterans and even has a Fallen Soldiers Memorial in  front of their 18,000 square foot Post Falls facility.   Congratulations to Will Alt and all of the employees at Critical  Power Products and Services for being selected as the Veteran-owned  Idaho Small Business of the Day for November 14, 2019. You make our  great State proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and  success.                            ____________________
