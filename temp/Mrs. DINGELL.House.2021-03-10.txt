 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1446.   This is a commonsense bill that would extend the time allowed for the  completion of background checks for firearm sales from 3 to 10 days,  giving time for a complete background check.   I want to be clear. I lived with a man who slept with a gun under his  pillow until the day he died. He was a responsible gun owner. And I  lived in a home with a man who shouldn't have had a gun, and I remember  the fear that I could die any day and that my siblings would die. A gun  in a household with someone emotionally unstable, angry, is plain and  simply dangerous.   Mass shootings and tragic acts of gun violence have become far too  common in the United States. I think my baby sister is not alive today  because of the trauma of living with someone who should not have had a  gun.   Yet, I don't want to take a gun away from a responsible gun owner.  Every American deserves the right to live safely.                                time  1645
