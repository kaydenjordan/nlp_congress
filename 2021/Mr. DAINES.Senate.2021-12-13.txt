 Madam President, today I have the distinct honor  of recognizing Craig Price of Richland County as Montanan of the Month  for his generosity and service to the Sidney community.   Craig embodies the values and spirit of a Montanan. Through his  upbeat attitude, generosity, and passion for volunteerism, Craig has  become a pillar of the Sidney community. He has been an active member  of the Sidney Lion's Club for 46 years, where he has helped with  important initiatives, including Highway Clean Ups and the Meals on  Wheels program.   Craig's enthusiasm for supporting Sidney's youth has made the  difference in the lives of countless young Montanans. After working for  18 years as an educator and guidance counselor, Craig has dedicated  countless hours to mentoring Sidney High School students involved in  the school's Leo Club and instilling in them the same Montana values of  generosity and service to their community. He also works with young  students each year through the Lion's Club Plus Optics program,  screening children for eyesight problems.   Craig's selflessness and passion for volunteerism has not gone  unnoticed. He has rightfully received numerous awards for his service  including the Lion's Club International President's Award and the  Outstanding Achievement Award from the Sidney Leo Club. Craig also  received the Citizen of the Year award in 2021.   I have no doubt that the Sidney community is eternally grateful for  Craig's countless hours of service and his devotion to instilling  Montana values in the next generation. It is my honor to recognize  Craig for his commitment to serving his neighbors in the Sidney  community and for making Montana a better place. Keep up the great  work, Craig. You make Montana proud.                            ____________________
