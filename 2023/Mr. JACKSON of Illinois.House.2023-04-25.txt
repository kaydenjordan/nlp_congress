 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include any extraneous material on the subject of  this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I  rise today to coanchor this CBC Special Order hour along with the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick), my distinguished  colleague.   For the next 60 minutes, members of the CBC have the opportunity to  speak directly to the American people on the default on America act,  Speaker McCarthy's draconian plan to default on our debt. The act  proposes drastic cuts to vital government programs such as SNAP, Social  Security, and housing programs, which serve as lifelines for our  communities.   There is a group within the Republican Party that are holding these  programs hostage in exchange for paying the debt we have already  incurred. However, the CBC is here tonight to declare that this  approach is a nonstarter, and we will not negotiate over paying the  Nation's bills that we have incurred. We advocate for a clean debt  limit, a bill that will protect the well-being of our citizens and our  Nation's financial stability.   This issue holds great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus,  to our Congress, the constituents we represent, and all Americans.   I now yield to my coanchor, the Honorable Congresswoman Sheila  Cherfilus-McCormick.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my deep  concern with Speaker McCarthy's reckless plan to address the debt  ceiling, which will impose a hardship on working Americans. Instead of  solving problems, House Republicans are holding our Nation hostage and  demanding that their ransom be met.   Let us not beat around the bush: Caps equal cuts, and Speaker  McCarthy's brinkmanship is dangerous. If extreme Republicans have their  way, communities across the country will suffer.   The 320-page proposal from the other side of the aisle pushes forward  drastic cuts to government programs, programs that families in my  district desperately need.   The Republican Party seems to be more focused on padding the pockets  of large corporations and billionaires instead of lending a hand to  working Americans. The GOP framework is nothing short of a catastrophe.   It includes sweeping cuts to SNAP and food assistance programs that  low-income families depend on. It destroys President Biden's student  loan debt agenda under the guise of fiscal responsibility. It imposes  cruel Medicaid work requirements, ripping healthcare coverage directly  from people's hands. It would rescind $80 billion allocated to the IRS  through President Biden's historic Inflation Reduction Act. It would  repeal clean energy tax credits, which have proven crucial in  addressing the climate crisis.   What Republicans are proposing is just not in the best interests of  our working people. The American people need a government that works  for them, not against them. There will certainly be an opportunity to  debate the GOP's rightwing policy proposals down the road, but doing so  at the expense of the American people through gamesmanship is reckless  and irresponsible.   We need to all work together to make life easier, not harder. Members  of Congress have a responsibility to serve the American people. I urge  Speaker McCarthy and the Republicans to stop playing political games  with our economy and those we are elected to serve.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Waters).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Waters) for her keen words and precise insight.   Mr. Speaker, fellow Americans, I come before you today with a heavy  heart and a deep sense of concern for the future of our beloved Nation.   It appears we have reached a crucial juncture where our democracy's  very essence is being challenged. The Republican proposed budget, also  known as the default on America act, seeks to slash a minimum of 22  percent from nondefense discretionary programs as a condition for  raising the debt ceiling.   Mr. Speaker, this money has already been spent. It has benefited the  American public. This is a game of brinksmanship, but it has dire  consequences even for us having the conversation.   The plan contains severe cuts to essential programs like SNAP. SNAP,  the acronym meaning Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. I  shall repeat: Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program. This is for  people that simply do not have enough to eat in our great country.   This plan also contains severe cuts for Social Security and housing  assistance, which act as crucial lifelines for all of our communities.   This minority group within the Republican Party is callously using  these indispensable programs as bargaining chips, bargaining on the  backs of the most vulnerable. This strategy not only endangers our  economy but undermines the foundation of our society.   For residents of my district in Illinois, the First Congressional  District, the consequences of not raising the debt ceiling and  defaulting on the debt would be dire.   I am compelled to share some startling statistics with you today. Mr.  Speaker, 7,000 jobs would be lost alone in the First Congressional  District in Illinois. Over 103,000 people in the First District nearing  retirement would lose on average $20,000 out of their 401K. Mr.  Speaker, 95,300 households in the First District would have their  Social Security checks at risk.   These devastating impacts not only affect the families who are  directly involved but would also disrupt the local economy.   In the First District alone, $151 million a month would be removed  from Social Security income from families.   Moreover, the health benefits of over 305,000 residents in the First  District on Medicare, Medicaid, and veterans coverage would be  jeopardized.   It is clear that we must demand a clean debt limit that addresses the  needs of our communities without threatening the livelihoods of the  most vulnerable.   As a member of the Agriculture Committee, I am particularly upset and  appalled about the suggested cuts to our food and nutrition assistance  programs.   We have been in committee for over 100 days now and have not had a  single meeting on the largest portion of the ag bill, the SNAP food  portion, which comprises 75 percent of our funding.   The bill, proposed by the House Agriculture Committee with over 20  Republicans, would dramatically expand the population of people subject  to policies that take SNAP away from those not meeting onerous work and  work reporting requirements.   I want some of my fellow colleagues to understand. Some people are in  transit deserts where they do not have easy access to mass transit or  private transportation.   Many people that are on the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance  Program are women and children. Eighty percent.   Some people have to care for aging parents and have to care for  disabled children. I think it is more complicated than what is being  shared.   This punitive and ineffective work will put SNAP's grocery benefits  at risk for adults up to age 65 and many families with school-age  children, in which parents or other adults are unable to work or cannot  find jobs or cannot find enough hours.   In the last 2 weeks, in my district again, Mr. Speaker, Walmart, the  Nation's largest employer, has pulled out of two stores directly in the  district. We are now having a work crisis where we don't have enough  employment, and new employment has to be created.   In Illinois' First Congressional District, over 54,000 households,  about 20 percent of all of our residents, receive SNAP benefits. Of  these recipients, a staggering 85 percent are African American.   The median income of households on SNAP is a mere $20,289. Mr.  Speaker, that is $390 a week where people are having to pay their rent,  their transportation, and trying to get food.   Not only is it $20,289 annually, $390 a week, which comes out to  simply $55 of income a day. These statistics paint a clear picture of  the most vulnerable populations in our society; those who are  struggling to make ends meet, those who are disproportionately affected  by systemic inequalities, and those who desperately need our support to  ensure their basic human rights to healthy supplemental food.   Our people need shelter and dignity, and they should not be used as  bargaining chips to advance anyone's agenda.    In the face of these proposed cuts, we must acknowledge the  catastrophic impact that they would have on our Nation's housing, a  fundamental human right that is critical to the health, safety, and  dignity of all of our citizens.   If these cuts were to be implemented, 640,000 families across the  Nation would lose access to rental assistance if we go through with the  draconian 22 percent proposed cut across the board.   We are talking about more than 430,000 low-income families facing  eviction from Section 8 housing.   This would result in an unparalleled loss of affordable housing for  older adults, families with disabilities, families with children, and  our veterans--individuals who have already confronted adversity and who  deserve our unwavering support and protection.   Yet, these threats to housing are not the only concern we must  address. Amid these proposed budget cuts, we must also be vigilant of  the detrimental effects on the central services provided by the Social  Security Administration.   The cuts would necessitate the closure of field offices and limit  access to persons having in-person visits, imposing undue burdens on  those seeking assistance.   Furthermore, people applying for disability benefits would experience  an additional 2-month delay in the processing of their claims,  prolonging the struggle to access crucial financial support.   This is a moment that demands our outrage, our empathy, and our  unwavering commitment to justice. It is a moment that calls upon each  and every one of us to stand up and say, ``no more,'' not to negotiate  with the debt ceiling.   The bills are already due, and our Nation has the character and the  capacity. Now we must furnish the will. I hope Wall Street is watching  tonight because the chasm and the gap between the proposals is stark,  and the time is limited.   We will not allow policies that perpetuate inequality to widen the  chasm between the haves and have nots.   We will not be complicit in the erosion of the very foundation upon  which this great Nation was built. The belief that all people are  created equal and endowed with certain inalienable rights; among them,  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   It is our moral and ethical obligation to stand against these  proposed budget cuts and call for a clean raising of the debt ceiling.   It has happened three times before in the previous administration.  Close to  [[Page H1940]]  $5 trillion was added. These are America's bills. We can be responsible  and meet our obligation.   The consequences of such actions would be dire and felt by those who  are already struggling the most. Overall, a default on the U.S. debt  obligation would trigger a loss of nearly 7 million jobs, push the  unemployment rate north of 8 percent, eliminate $10 trillion in  household wealth, and reduce real GDP by greater than 4 percent,  according to the Congressional Budget Office.   This is not a path we can afford to take. Our future and the very  fabric of our society depend on us defending the rights of the most  vulnerable among us and protecting the essential programs that have  sustained our communities for generations.   Together, let us stand strong against these cuts and fight for the  betterment of all Americans. We must ensure that every person has a  fair chance to thrive and that the promise of equality and justice  remain at the heart of our great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, may God bless these United States.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cherfilus- McCormick).   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much  time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman form  Florida (Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick) for her remarks.                           Honoring Harry Belafonte     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to  a man whose life, legacy, and unwavering commitment to justice and  equality has left an indelible mark on our Nation.   I speak of none other than the incomparable Mr. Harry Belafonte who  passed away today at the age of 96.   At a time when segregation was still deeply entrenched and Black  faces were scarce on screens, both large and small, Mr. Belafonte's  historic rise to the pinnacle of show business broke barriers and paved  the way for future generations.   Mr. Belafonte's exceptional music career earned him numerous  accolades and awards. A three-time Grammy Award winner, including the  prestigious Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, he was recognized for  his enduring contributions to the world of music.                                time  2030    His exceptional talent transcended mediums, earning him an Emmy Award  for his work on television and a Tony Award for his brilliance on  stage.   In 1989, he received one of the highest honors bestowed upon artists  in the United States: The Kennedy Center Honors. Our Nation continued  to recognize his extraordinary contributions when, in 1994, he was  awarded the National Medal of Arts for his significant impact on  American culture.   In 2014, Mr. Belafonte received the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award  at the Academy's Sixth Annual Governors Awards. In 2022, the world of  music paid homage to his influence by inducting him into the Rock and  Roll Hall of Fame in the early influence category.   As we celebrate Mr. Harry Belafonte's life and memory, let us also  remember that he was much more than an extraordinary entertainer. I  have had the privilege and honor of meeting and knowing Mr. Belafonte,  and what attracted me to him the most is that he was a tireless  advocate for civil rights, using his fame and fortune to further the  cause of equality and uplift the lives of countless African Americans.  He used his celebrity, his wealth, his power, and his influence to  transcend the racial divisions of our day and time.   He contributed to Reverend Martin Luther King at the height of the  civil rights challenges in America. That says something about where you  stand in times of challenge.   Belafonte's close friendship and support of Reverend Martin Luther  King exemplified the duality of his life's work. He stood beside Mrs.  Coretta Scott King and Duke Ellington at the ``Salute to Montgomery''  in 1956, raising funds for the civil rights movement when it was not  popular, but it was the right thing to do.   Part of the legacy he leaves behind is a call for our current  generation to use their celebrity, their influence, and their access as  they walk the corridors of power to give truth in high places.   During the tumultuous 1960s, Belafonte continued to provide much- needed financial assistance to the Southern Christian Leadership  Conference, most notably during the Birmingham, Alabama, campaign.   He opened his home and his heart, inviting prominent individuals for  a meeting where Reverend King and Fred Shuttlesworth laid out their  plans and appealed for support. Belafonte answered the call, not  seeking a car, not wanting a bigger house, not wanting to boast about  his earnings. He raised over $50,000 and donated it to the civil rights  cause to keep Reverend Martin Luther King's movement and our movement  alive to enable the campaign to proceed, even while Reverend Martin  Luther King was in jail in Birmingham writing the ``Letter From a  Birmingham Jail.'' Mr. Belafonte worked the outside, while Reverend  Martin Luther King worked the inside.   In the aftermath of Reverend Martin Luther King's tragic  assassination, it was Mr. Harry Belafonte, not the entertainer but the  activist, who continued to fight for his dream, who gave the King  family financial support after their father was slain with four young  children at home, serving as the executor of King's estate and chairing  the Martin Luther King Memorial Fund. His commitment to civil rights  and humanitarian issues never wavered, and his voice rang out in  support of those who sought justice and equality both at home and  abroad.   My fellow Americans, as we honor the life and memory of Harry  Belafonte, let us remember his unwavering dedication to the cause of  justice,  [[Page H1941]]  and let us strive to carry on his legacy by standing tall in the face  of challenge and controversy. Reverend Martin Luther King said it is  not where you stand in moments of comfort and convenience but where you  stand in moments of challenge and controversy.   Let us, like Harry Belafonte, be champions of equality guided by the  principles of compassion, empathy, and love. It is said: ``Each and  every one of us has the capacity to be an oppressor. I want to  encourage everyone to interrogate how we might be an oppressor and how  we might be able to become liberators for ourselves and for each  other.''   In the spirit of these words, let us forge ahead harnessing the power  of our collective talents and passions to drive change and create a  more just and equitable world for all. Let us not only celebrate his  achievements but also emulate his unwavering actions and dedication to  the cause of justice. Let us strive to become liberators for ourselves  and for each other, working tirelessly to ensure that the torch of  equality and freedom continue to burn brightly for generations to come.   May the life and legacy of Mr. Harry Belafonte serve as the guiding  light as we navigate the challenges that lie ahead. Together, let us  work toward a life and a world where justice, equality, and love will  prevail.   Mr. Speaker, God bless us all.   I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick).   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the third  time in opposition to Speaker McCarthy's debt ceiling brinksmanship,  which would deliver a crushing setback to the numerous successes of  President Biden and House Democrats.   Just look at how far we have come. Annual inflation has declined in  the last 9 months. Gas prices are much lower than the record highs we  saw in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year. The price of  many foods like chicken and fruits and vegetables have declined in  March.   Labor force participation is at record-high levels. Unemployment has  reached a 50-year low of 3.5 percent. Within the Black community,  unemployment has never been this low.   Real income has risen both for low-income Americans and across the  economy as a whole. All the while, our deficit has dropped more than  $1.7 trillion in 2 years. We are not out of the woods yet. There is  always more we can do and could be done to reduce the financial burdens  faced by American families and making things even just a little bit  easier.   Let's give credit where credit is due. Since taking office, President  Biden has passed legislation that has created a strong foundation for  the economy to grow and he has invested in the middle class. The  administration has worked tirelessly to reduce the cost of living and  bringing down the cost of prices.    President Biden's Inflation Reduction Act has also been  transformative, slashing kitchen table costs for working families,  forcing pharmaceutical companies to negotiate lower drug prices,  capping insulin at $35 per month for Medicare patients, and cutting  healthcare insurance premiums for millions of Americans.   President Biden's budget proposal stands in stark contrast to what  Speaker McCarthy has floated. It is bold, compassionate, and puts  working families over politics. Not only would President Biden's  proposal reduce the deficit by $3 trillion over the next 10 years, but  it does so while investing in our Nation. It lowers costs for working  families by making childcare, healthcare, and housing more affordable.  These are all things that are crucial to our economy and to the  American people at this present time.   Now is the time for my Republican colleagues to put aside partisan  politics and work with us to pass a budget that reinforces America's  promise to our constituents. House Republicans should not stand in the  way of this progress.    Mr. Speaker, you have heard from our  distinguished colleagues about the American debt cliff that we are  facing. All of these issues are of great importance to the  Congressional Black Caucus, our constituents, the Congress, and all  Americans tonight.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
