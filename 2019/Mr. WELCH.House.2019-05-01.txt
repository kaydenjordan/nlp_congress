 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 9, the  Climate Action Now Act.   Climate change is here, and it is worth highlighting some of the  impacts that are underway.   This year, we have seen record flooding in the Midwest, unprecedented  wildfires in the West, and record temperatures across the country.   In Vermont--and talk about economic impacts--the ski season is  getting shorter. In one study, it has noted that, even under the most  optimistic climate change models, all the ski areas in southern New  England will no longer be economically viable by 2040. That would be  thousands of jobs melting away as a result of climate change.   We have had 16 disasters in 2017 with damage exceeding $1 billion,  spending $306 billion on weather-related disasters that year.   Climate change is a priority for young people and local officials. It  now must become a priority for Congress.   The Climate Action Now Act takes an important step in this direction  by keeping us--or getting us back into the Paris climate agreement and  not taken out by the action of a single person. This bill is just the  start of fulfilling our obligations and our opportunity to slow climate  change.   Now, some folks are fearful about the economic consequences of  addressing climate change, but a confident nation faces its problems;  it doesn't deny them. It is in facing these problems that we are  actually going to create jobs, not lose jobs.   So, Madam Speaker, I commend Representative Castor for her leadership  on this legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this bill as the  beginning of undertaking the opportunity that we have economically to  build a stronger and safer environment.
