 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to my Republican  colleague's amendment mandating a study before the bill can go into  effect.   This is not an earnest attempt to look into the Supreme Court's  impact on age discrimination cases. It is a delay tactic and nothing  more.   We know that age discrimination happens. In fact, not long ago, we  heard compelling witness testimony in the Education and Labor Committee  highlighting the need for this very legislation.   Ageism is one of the most common and, sadly, most accepted forms of  discrimination in the workplace. Last year, the EEOC received over  14,000 age discrimination complaints, accounting for over 20 percent of  all discrimination charges filed in this country.   This is a problem that impacts not just workers but our entire  economy, and it particularly harms women and people of color. According  to the AARP, nearly two-thirds of women and more than three-quarters of  Black workers age 45 and over say they have seen or experienced age  discrimination in the workplace.   We don't need a study to tell us that a substantially higher burden  of proof for some forms of discrimination makes it more difficult for  workers who can prove discrimination to get their day in court and to  prevail. That is just common sense.   What we need is a return to a mixed-motive standard, which says that  any consideration of age, as opposed to ability to perform a job, is  impermissible in employment decisions.   We can look at two cases that were proceeding under a mixed-motive  standard but were dismissed following the Supreme Court's precedents.  Courts dismissed both of these cases on the grounds that the facts,  which were sufficient under a mixed-motive standard, were no longer  sufficient under the heightened but-for standard.   First, there is the case of Jack Gross, an older gentleman who had  been demoted after refusing a buyout when his employer underwent a  merger. As he and many older workers were demoted,  [[Page H3063]]  his younger colleagues received promotions.   Mr. Gross challenged his demotion under the Age Discrimination in  Employment Act and won his case at trial under the motivating factor  framework. However, after the Supreme Court changed the rules and  required him to retry his case under the new and more stringent but-for  causation standard, he lost despite the fact that he had proved the  same set of facts with the same parties in the same courts as before.                                time  1600    Second, consider the impact of the Nassar case on anti-retaliation  claims under the Civil Rights Act. In the case of Shumate v. Selma City  Board of Education, an elementary school cafeteria worker alleged that  she had been passed over for promotion due to having filed earlier  discrimination claims, and that those claims had been discussed by the  interview panel.   The district court denied the employer's motion for summary judgment  on her retaliation claim. However, the Nassar decision was issued a few  months later and the employer moved for reconsideration under the new  causation standard. This time, the district court dismissed the  worker's retaliation claim and granted summary judgment to the  employer, stating that, ``the Supreme Court has changed the rules since  then.''   Same facts. Same case. Different causation standard, and a win was  turned into a loss.   The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act reinstates  the legal standard for proving age discrimination and aligns it with  the existing standard for proving discrimination based on sex, race, or  national origin.   Mr. Speaker, there is simply no excuse for discrimination of any kind  in the workplace, and there is no reason to delay this legislation any  further. We have already had a 12-year delay in restoring justice.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject the Allen amendment and  support the underlying bill.
