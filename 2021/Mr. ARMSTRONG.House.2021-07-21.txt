 Mr. Speaker, throughout the consideration of this bill  in committee, at Rules, and now here, several of my Democratic  colleagues have argued CERCLA liability only attaches to two legacy  chemicals, and we don't have to worry about others. Unfortunately, that  is not the case.   This bill requires regulatory determination on 9,250 different  chemicals, individually or in groups, on whether they will be CERCLA  hazardous substances.   My colleagues argue that people don't have to worry about Superfund  liability if they don't cause environmental harm. This argument is  false.   Superfund liability is strict liability. If a party has any  involvement, they are liable, period, end of story. That strict  liability is what causes concern and is why Mr. Burgess offered an  amendment to make only those who cause the pollution pay for its  cleanup. For some reason, the majority found issue with that amendment  and prevented its commonsense consideration.   If there is interest on the other side of the aisle in changing the  overall rules of Superfund liability, I am sure we would be happy to  consider it. Short of that improvement, my colleagues should not take  comfort that only reckless, willful, or irresponsible parties will be  held liable under future CERCLA designations.    Madam Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 217, ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 216, and ``nay'' on rollcall No. 215.
