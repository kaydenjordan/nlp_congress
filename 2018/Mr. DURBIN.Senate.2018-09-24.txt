 I announce that the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Merkley) is  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Merkley) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, earlier this month, we received the sad  news that Mayor Lorraine Morton had passed away just a few months short  of her 100th birthday. For decades, she was a force for change in  Evanston, IL. For so many people, she was the ``Principal of  Evanston.''   In June of this year, more than a hundred people gathered with  Lorraine at the Northwestern University Segal Visitors Center to  celebrate the premier of the documentary ``Lorraine H. Morton: A Life  Worthwhile.'' The title comes from something her father instilled into  her, ``Only a life of service is a life worthwhile.'' Her life of  service was extraordinary as a teacher, mentor, friend, and Evanston's  first African-American mayor.   Lorraine's story is that of shattering boundaries and bringing  Evanston into the 21st century. Lorraine was one of the first Black  teachers to break the color barrier in a community that was integrated  statistically, but not geographically. She championed desegregation  efforts and pioneered equity in Evanston's schools. As one of the few  Black educators on the North Shore, her firsts were many: from serving  as the first Black educator to teach summer school, to breaking the  color line at Nichols Middle School, to leading the Haven Middle School  as principal.   Haven was on the frontier of all the changes coming to the community  in the 1960s and 1970s. As principal, Lorraine thrived and developed a  reputation for kindness and listening.   In the early 1980s, then-Mayor Jay Lytle asked Lorraine if she were  interested in joining the city council as the Fifth Ward alderman.  After he talked her into it, Lorraine took the job in 1982. Three years  later, she ran again and was elected alderman with the support of the  families she had taught. Lorraine had a successful 9-year run on the  council.   While Fifth Ward alderman, she served on the housing and community  development, police services, planning and development, human services,  and rules committees, as well as on the unified budget panel.  Additionally, she also served on special committees on fair housing,  libraries, and gangs, and she was Evanston's legion commissioner.   In 1989, Lorraine stepped away from her role as Haven Middle School  principal to focus on politics. Word started to go around that then- Mayor Joan Barr was considering stepping down. Many of Lorraine's  former students recommended she run. She had a built-in power base in  all the schools she taught and made a difference, but the race was no  easy picnic. Lorraine nabbed second place out of five candidates. This  set up a runoff election where Lorraine came from behind to win.  Lorraine went on to be the longest serving mayor in Evanston's history  in 1993.   Lorraine led the city through the development of partnerships with  Northwestern University and changing the culture of the city council  itself. Downtown Evanston is filled with Northwestern buildings these  days. The university has a deep relationship with Evanston and the  Chicagoland area, but it was Lorraine that brought Northwestern closer  to the community through programs like increased student-to-student  tutoring and donating resources like a firetruck.   Downtown Evanston's large-scale renovation and revitalization also is  a part of her legacy. Anyone seeing a movie in the Century Theater  should thank her. An agreement negotiated by Lorraine and the city  council with Northwestern to create a research park eventually led to a  mixed-use zone, including that movie theater and all those restaurants  and bistros.   In the 16 years she was mayor, she was a role model to future mayors.  She was tough on the budget, making every dollar stretch as much as  possible. There were many budget battles, but more business came to  Evanston, and it grew again. Lorraine did it famously with an open-door  policy to all constituents. Her successor continued many of her  policies.   At the end of Lorraine's time as mayor, the city dedicated the  Lorraine H. Morton Civic Center on Ridge Avenue as a thank you for a  legendary career. After stepping down from mayor, she continued to  serve the community as a representative for the mayor on an economic  board. She remained active till the very end as the ``Principal of  Evanston,'' having a life of service that was worthwhile.   I always enjoyed working with Lorraine. She was professional,  cheerful, and her focus was always on building a better Evanston. I can  still see her sitting on the reviewing stand at the end of Evanston's  legendary Fourth of July parade, with a big smile and appreciation for  all of the people who came to join in celebrating her hometown.   Lorraine is survived by her daughter, Elizabeth Morton Brasher, and  two granddaughters, Elizabeth Keziah and Constance Moriah Brasher.                            ____________________     Mr. President, earlier this month, we mourned the loss of  a wonderful public servant in Illinois. Naperville's mayor emeritus,  Arthur George Pradel, passed away at the age of 80. He was a soldier, a  policeman, a mayor, father, and friend.   To some, George was ``Officer Friendly.'' Local radio called him the  Nicest Mayor in the World. I just was honored to be one of his  friends--but so was everyone around him. He had a supernatural ability  to know everyone and always have time to say hi. George was  Naperville's longest serving mayor, with a tenure of 20 years.   When George was a small child, his family packed up from Chicago's  Hyde Park and moved to Naperville in 1939. The town had just 4,500  people at the time. When George finished his tenure as mayor in 2015,  Naperville had grown to a population of 142,000.   George graduated from Naperville Community High School in 1955 and  served in the Marines as two of his uncles had done during World War  II. After 3 years in the Marines, George came home to Naperville.   George's dream job was to be the head of an orphanage, but in the  1950s, the orphanage system had changed. Smaller group or children's  homes and foster care had replaced much of it. George was in a bit of a  quandary. A friend of his encouraged him to consider police work. When  an opportunity at the Naperville Police Department came up in 1966, he  applied immediately. It was a beginning of a 29-year career with the  Naperville Police Department.   There was just one small problem. George was not even 57" in height.  Naperville Police Department required officers to be at least 511" at  the time. After acing his interview with the Board of Police and Fire  Commissioners, the board had to consider if they could let him into  their ranks, even though he was too short. One of the board members  asked a marine family member if someone like George could make it. The  family member told him that anyone who could get through Marine Corps  training could be a great police officer. The board agreed.   George earned the nickname ``Officer Friendly'' in his almost 30  years on the force by visiting schools and speaking to children. He  wanted youth to understand that police were not to be feared, but they  were there to protect them and give guidance. George worked to bring  Safety Town, a miniature village where children learn pedestrian, bike,  and railroad safety, to Naperville in 1977 and was the first police  instructor. The ``town'' village now bears his name and that of his  late wife Pat.   George retired as a lieutenant when he was elected mayor, despite no  previous political experience in 1995. He originally envisioned  retiring from the police force and being a greeter at Walmart, but a  bunch of residents asked him to run. He never really mastered the art  of diplomatically saying no. George wasn't even planning to win the  race, but all those children that knew him as Officer Friendly were  adults now, and they voted for him. He was so surprised that he did not  even have an acceptance speech prepared for when he won.   As mayor, George continued being Naperville's greatest champion. His  schedule was packed with events from collecting food for charity  shopping events for Loaves & Fishes Community Services to charity  dinners, fundraising walks, anniversaries, and graduations. He even did  first flush ceremonies for toilets in a new building. When snow fell,  he would hop in a city  [[Page S6272]]  plow and help out. Helping people and trying to make Naperville better  was his nature.   I used to kid him that he was my favorite Republican. I invited him  as my guest to a State of the Union address in Washington awhile back,  and he was a joy to be around.   George always had time for people. His door was open to anyone. A  Chicago columnist wrote a sarcastic piece about Naperville, and George  invited him to tour the town and changed his opinion. His state of the  city addresses had a flare to them, as he sported a tuxedo and silk  tophat to present them.   George loved Naperville and thought the best of it. When he stepped  down from being mayor to spend more time with his wife in 2015, his  successor invented the title mayor emeritus so George could still stay  involved with the community and represent the mayor on occasion.   In addition to Safety Town, a park, a street, and an Officer Friendly  statue all bear George's name in Naperville. He even has a bobblehead  in his likeness, which I own, too. Because George loved chicken wings  and the lunch buffet, Braconi's Restaurant and Pizzeria has a room  named after George. At Schmaltz's Deli, George is the only person to  have a sandwich named after him. Why did all these places name things  after him? Because they loved him the way he loved Naperville.  Naperville will miss him, and so will I.   George is survived by his children Carol, Gary, and George.                            ____________________     Mr. President, last week, Chicago lost a giant in media  when Ken Smikle passed away at the too young age of 66. For over 40  years, Ken redefined coverage of the Black American experience and  brought to light the economic potential of Black communities in the  United States.   It is hard to believe that an audience with $1.2 trillion in buying  power in 2017 did not have a publication geared toward understanding  the African-American market 30 years ago, but that was the reality  before Ken founded Target Media News in 1987. Ken saw the potential  there throughout his career.   Hailing from Harlem, NY,--in 1974, Ken, his brother, Dawoud Bey, and  friend, Gerald Gladney started a business that published two magazines.  They did this with no financial backing besides savings from various  jobs.   Ken wrote for several publications, including Essence Magazine and  the National Leader Magazine. He went on to serve as the arts editor  for Harlem's Amsterdam News, the Black music editor at Record World  Magazine, and the editor of the Philadelphia Inquirer.   In 1983, Ken's life had a revolution. He became the senior editor at  Black Enterprise magazine. Ken also met the love of his life, Renee  Ferguson, who was among the first female African-American women to work  at CBS Network News in New York. Both of them were dedicated to telling  the untold story of African Americans. It was at Black Enterprise that  Ken got the idea that no one was tracking what businesses were doing to  market to Black consumers.   In 1987, Ken and Renee moved to Chicago. Ken founded Target Market  News, while Renee worked as an investigative reporter for NBC5 News.  Target Market News became the leading publication showing the research  into marketing to African Americans. His work was pivotal in changing  the way corporations viewed African Americans as an economic force. He  published an annual ``Black Buying Power'' report for many years. For  many years, Ken was the only one doing it, until Forbes and the  University of Georgia Selig Center joined the bandwagon.   Ken was the expert quoted on marketing to African Americans in  numerous publications. He cofounded the African American Marketing and  Media Association, hosted annual conferences, and was a proud member of  the National Association of Black Journalists.   In Chicago's Hyde Park's Kenwood community, Ken and Renee were  staples for 30 years. They were neighbors to a young couple named  Barack and Michelle Obama. Before Barack Obama was President Obama, he  was Ken's friend at the Hyde Park co-op.   While trailblazing the marketing industry, Ken was a Little League  basketball coach at the YMCA. He was a loving father to his son, Jason,  going to his son's baseball, basketball, and swimming competition.   Ken loved his jazz and the music of life. His leadership and vision  will be missed.   Ken leaves behind his wife, Renee, son, Jason, brother, Dawoud Bey,  and sisters, Sandra Bernard and Georgianna Machicote.   (At the request of Mr. Cornyn, the following statement was ordered to  be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
