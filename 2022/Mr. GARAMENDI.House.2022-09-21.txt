 Madam Speaker, on January 6, America witnessed the  first and most serious attempt since the Civil War to stop our  democracy. It was an insurrection engineered by the then-President,  Donald Trump, so that he could put forth a coup and remain in power. It  did not succeed.   We came here that night over blood-stained floors and smashed doors  and windows, and we voted. We voted to put in place the will of the  voters of America to transfer power. Fortunately, the attempt by the  President was unsuccessful.   Nevertheless, in Hollywood, there is always a sequel, often to a very  bad movie. We are headed for a new sequel in 2024. Unless we change the  1887 Electoral Count Act, we will see a sequel. We know, all across  this Nation, that it is being set up.   There are candidates running for critical offices--secretaries of  state, various county offices--with the intent to use the 1887  Electoral Count Act to put in place a sequel to the January 6, 2021,  violent insurrection. It is in place now. It is an attempt happening  now to have a new coup, to use the 1887 law.   We must pass this bill. We must change the law. It is ancient. It has  already been proven by January 6 and the attempted coup then to use  that law to install in the Presidency a person who was not legitimately  elected by the people of America.   We have to do this. It is our task. It is our work, and this bill  does it.
