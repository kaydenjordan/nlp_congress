 Madam Chair, I thank the chairman of the committee for  this opportunity.   Madam Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment, which will  require the Secretary of Defense to report on the current level of  threat sharing between the Department of Defense and the defense  industrial base related to cybersecurity.   Our defense industrial base faces increasing threats from our  adversaries, including Russia and China. The loss of research and  information to cybersecurity hacks is putting our Defense Department's  investments at risk and eroding the warfighting advantage the United  States maintains over our adversaries.   In June 2018, The Washington Post reported that a contractor working  with the Navy on a supersonic anti-ship missile was hacked by the  Chinese Government.   In December 2018, a Defense Department Office of Inspector General  audit found that the Army, Navy, and Missile Defense Agency were  failing to take basic cybersecurity steps to ensure that information on  America's ballistic missile defense system won't fall into the hands of  our adversaries.                                time  2015    I commend the work that the Department has already undertaken to  address this need, but more must be done.   The Department of Defense must play an active role in identifying  current threats and helping to fortify the cybersecurity of our defense  industrial base, which includes many small and medium-sized businesses,  as well as academic institutions.   This amendment asks the Secretary of Defense to include a section  within an existing report that examines the current level of threat  sharing between the Department and the industrial base.   Madam Chair, I thank the committee for allowing this amendment to be  included in the en bloc, and ask the committee's indulgence in support  of the amendment. I thank the chairman, again, for his willingness to  allow me to speak on behalf of the amendment.
