 Mr. President, I oppose H.J. Res. 58, another  Congressional Review Act resolution that would roll back an agency's  efforts to implement a law and prevent it from doing its job in the  future.   In this case, we are considering eliminating Department of Education  regulations on teacher preparation programs. In the 2008  reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, Congress required States  to assess and identify low-performing teacher preparation programs to  ensure that every teacher graduates ready for the classroom. Following  a process that began in 2011, the Department of Education released a  draft rule in 2014. That draft wasn't perfect and needed more  flexibility for States and institutions of higher education. After an  extended comment period, the Department revised the rule 2 years later.  Though it may not satisfy everyone, the final rule provides clarity in  line with Congress's direction.   Congress has the opportunity, with the reauthorization of the Higher  Education Act, to improve upon these provisions. We can build on the  State-driven assessment that this rule provides and further refine the  system to make sure that data is being used to better prepare a more  diverse class of teachers for our schools.   If the Trump administration does not want to wait for further  legislation, it can engage in a new rulemaking, but as with all  Congressional Review Act resolutions, this resolution is a meat ax  rather than a scalpel. It repeals the rule and prevents the Department  from carrying out its responsibility to ensure high-quality teacher  preparation programs. This is simply the wrong approach, and I urge a  no vote.  [[Page S1664]]     Mr. President, we have now had a little more than 24  hours to get a peek at the Republican plan to get rid of the Affordable  Care Act. Now we know why they kept it in hiding for as long as they  did--because it is a total mess and it will wreak havoc on the  healthcare system in the United States of America and severely harm  millions of Americans. After 7 years in waiting, is this really the  best they can do? The first thing people need to know about the  Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act--let's be clear.  This is no replacement. This is a fake replacement. The first thing  they need to know about it is, it will strip away affordable healthcare  for millions of Americans in order to give the wealthiest households a  huge tax cut.   How big is that tax cut? First of all, it goes to households who make  over $250,000 a year. Here is the thing. The richer you are, the more  money you make over $250,000 a year, the bigger the tax cut you are  going to get under the Republican healthcare plan, under TrumpCare. In  fact, if you are a millionaire, you are going to get a tax cut, on  average, of about $50,000--to be precise, a $49,370 average tax cut for  millionaires. If you are in the top one-tenth percent of American  households, you are going to get, on average, a $200,000 tax cut under  the Republican plan to get rid of the Affordable Care Act.   That is great news if your name is Donald Trump or you are one of the  billionaires or millionaires in his Cabinet. It is great news if you  have loads of money. I want to be clear. I have nothing against  millionaires. The more millionaires, the better in terms of growth in  the economy, but certainly at this point in time, they don't need a tax  cut, and they certainly shouldn't have a tax cut when the impact of  that is to harm tens of millions of Americans and hurt their  healthcare.   I guess we are beginning to learn exactly what President Trump meant  when he said that his healthcare was going to be ``much better.'' Yes,  if you are one of those folks in the top one-tenth percent of American  income earners, if you are in the wealthiest strata of this country,  you are going to get a big tax break. So I guess it is much better for  you from that perspective.  [[Page S1680]]    You know whom else this is going to be better for? It is going to be  better for insurance companies and their CEOs. It is really hard to  believe, but if you look at the House bill--and now I know why it was  under lock and key for so long. If you look at it, you are going to  find that their plan gives insurance companies a new tax break when  they pay their CEOs multimillion-dollar bonuses. In fact, the bigger  the bonus the healthcare company pays to the CEO, the bigger tax break  the corporation gets, the more American taxpayers will be subsidizing  those bonuses for those insurance CEOs.   So you know what, you are a CEO of an insurance company, you raise  the premiums, the company makes more money, and you get a bigger bonus.  Taxpayers foot the bill in terms of larger taxpayer subsidies to those  CEOs. All in all, when you add up all the tax breaks for these CEOs and  the insurance companies and the wealthiest Americans, it is a tax break  windfall of $600 billion. That is the number by the experts in the  Joint Committee on Taxation here in the Congress. These are the  nonpartisan experts who look at legislation and determine what the  fiscal impact will be. What they say is that the TrumpCare bill will  provide tax breaks in the amount of $600 billion over the next 10  years. I guess that is what President Trump must have been referring to  the other day when he tweeted about his ``wonderful new healthcare  bill.'' It will be wonderful for those who are getting those big tax  breaks.   We know who the winners are. Who are the losers? Well, just about  everybody else ends up on the short end of the stick--just about  everybody else in America. That is why you are seeing such strong  opposition coming from all over the country. First, there are the  millions of Americans who are going to lose their healthcare coverage  altogether because they can't possibly afford to pay the huge  additional premiums and copays and deductions they would be faced with  under these plans that would be offered. Then there are tens of  millions of more who will pay much more for much less coverage.   Older Americans are going to be especially hard hit, which is why we  are all hearing from AARP. You know AARP--they sometimes give their  opinion, they weigh in a little bit here and there, but they are out  full force against this TrumpCare bill because it is going to have a  very negative impact on seniors in America. They call it a sweetheart  deal to big drug companies and other special interests. They argue--and  we will talk about how it will weaken Medicare. They say it is going to  impose an age tax on older Americans, and that is what it does. In  fact, they calculate the following:         The change in structure will dramatically increase premiums       for older consumers. We estimate that the bill's changes to       current law's tax credits could increase premium costs for a       55-year-old earning $25,000 by more than $2,300 a year. For a       64-year-old earning $25,000 that increase rises to more than       $4,400 a year.    A year extra--$4,400 more a year for that 64-year-old earning $25,000  to pay for their health insurance, the health insurance they have  today. Then they calculate that it will be $5,800 more for a 64-year- old earning $15,000. In other words, compared to the Affordable Care  Act, the less income you have, the more you are going to be paying  under TrumpCare than you are paying today under ObamaCare, under the  Affordable Care Act.   We are also hearing from groups that fight for the rights of people  with disabilities from all over the country, that are against this  legislation because of its impact on Medicaid and the impact those cuts  to Medicaid will have on people with disabilities throughout the  country.   We are also hearing about the impact on Medicare. One of the promises  Candidate Trump made was that he wasn't going to do anything that would  harm Medicare. That is what he said then, but, in fact, in January,  Congress received a letter from the Medicare actuaries. These are the  professionals who look at the impact of various proposals on the  Medicare system. What they concluded was, this proposal to provide tax  cuts to wealthy Americans would actually reduce the life of the  Medicare program by 3 years.   Here is what they are proposing. We are going to give a tax cut--and  one of the tax cuts means that wealthy Americans will not have to pay a  portion of their Medicare taxes. That portion of their Medicare taxes  today goes into the Medicare trust fund. You say to those wealthy  Americans: We are going to give you a tax break that is going back in  your pockets. That means it is no longer going into the Medicare trust  fund. That shortens the life of the Medicare trust fund. That is the  view, that is the opinion, those are the facts stated by the actuaries  for Medicare.   As you begin to reduce the life of the Medicare Program, there will  be more and more pressure to go to the plan that has been much  discussed, especially by House Republicans, to turn Medicare into a  voucher program. The AARP raises this issue, as well, in their letter.  If you are going to start cutting down on the Medicare trust fund, if  you are reducing the revenues going into that trust fund because you  are giving wealthier Americans this tax cut, obviously, there is less  money in that program to pay for the bills of Medicare.   One of the ideas that has been pushed is: All right, let's save money  for Medicare by transferring the risks Medicare currently takes onto  the backs of seniors. So we are going to start giving them a voucher, a  voucher that does not keep pace with the rising costs of Medicare. That  means that over time, seniors have to pay a lot more, get a lot less in  healthcare, and that is how they save the Medicare plan money. Make no  mistake, by providing a tax cut, and particularly the tax cut to the  wealthy paying into the Medicare Program right now, you are hurting  Medicare.   I know that the President says he is a terrific negotiator, just a  terrific negotiator, and I have here a book by Trump, ``The Art of the  Deal.'' I don't know whether Donald Trump is a good negotiator or a bad  negotiator, but what I know is this: When you look at this TrumpCare  plan, whoever did the negotiating was negotiating on behalf of very  wealthy special interests at the expense of people in the rest of the  country.   So all the talk we heard throughout the campaign and since about  looking after the little guy, all the talk we heard about the middle  class being squeezed, which is very real out there in America, all the  talk we heard about struggling Americans, when you look at TrumpCare,  it hurts exactly those people.   If President Trump was negotiating this deal, he got a great deal for  the billionaires and millionaires who are in his Cabinet. They are  going to see a great tax break windfall. I mean, I would like to get a  calculator and take a look at what the size of the tax break will be to  the members of the Trump Cabinet because it is going to be huge. But  ordinary Americans are going to take it on the chin. They are going to  be very badly hurt, which is why apparently people are trying to rush  this through the Congress so quickly.   First, it was in some remote room, and you needed bloodhounds to go  out to try to find out where it was, and now we know why it was kept so  secret--because it is such a bad deal for the American people.   Now that it is in the light of day and the details are coming out and  we are getting more and more letters from groups from around the  country--AARP, the American Hospital Association, the American Medical  Association, hundreds of other groups. The letters are pouring in. What  is the response? Let's try to get this through the Congress as fast as  possible before the word gets out even farther around the country.   It is ironic because I remember that during the debate over the  Affordable Care Act, which took months and months--I mean, it took over  7 or 8 months--our Republican colleagues accused us of moving too  quickly, of not having sufficient debate and input. Yet what we are  seeing right now, now that the bill has come out of hiding, is an  effort to try to move that bill through the House in a matter of weeks  without any hearings. And then we are hearing over here in the Senate  that the plan will be--and maybe the Republican leader can clarify this  at some point, but the plan will be to not send it to any of the  committees in the Senate for a review but to try to bring it up  immediately here on the floor of the Senate without any committee  consideration, totally outside the regular  [[Page S1681]]  order, flying directly in the face of the complaints that were made  many years ago, when the process took well over 7 months, went through  all the committees, and was thoroughly deliberated throughout the  country.   Today I am looking at some of the publications, and I see Republican  colleagues preemptively criticizing the Congressional Budget Office for  what it might say about what TrumpCare is going to cost the American  people.   Mr. President, I know you and our colleagues know that CBO is the  referee on which we all rely. I know some people like to make up their  own alternative facts, but you need to have some referee here in  Congress when it comes to budget issues because otherwise people just  make up whatever numbers they want.   It is also important to know that the current head of the  Congressional Budget Office is somebody who was jointly selected by the  Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee and the Republican  chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. In other words, the current  head of the CBO was picked by the Republican chairmen of the House and  Senate Budget Committees. It is very important that we have that  nonpartisan referee in these discussions. Yet, in the House of  Representatives, they are acting on TrumpCare right now in committees  without even the benefit of the analysis from the Congressional Budget  Office. Apparently, they are afraid of what it might be and what it  might say.   If people want to defend this TrumpCare proposal, they are obviously  free to do it, but we should do it in the regular order, and we should  do it based on information from sources like the Congressional Budget  Office so people can have all the facts when they make these decisions  which will impact the American people.   One fact we know right now is the fact that I mentioned at the  outset, which is from the Joint Tax Committee, the nonpartisan experts,  saying that TrumpCare will provide a $600 billion tax cut windfall. We  also know it is a fact from the Medicare Actuary that by providing very  wealthy Americans with this tax break, you are going to take some years  off of the life of the Medicare Program. Those are real facts.   So when I look at this deal, whoever negotiated this deal was clearly  looking out for the very wealthiest in this country. That is where the  facts lead.   Again, I don't know if President Trump is a good negotiator or a bad  negotiator. What I do know is that if he negotiated this TrumpCare  deal, he was negotiating on behalf of the millionaires and billionaires  in his Cabinet. He was negotiating on behalf of the insurance companies  that are now going to get a tax break for the multimillion-dollar  bonuses they pay to the CEOs. The larger the bonus, the bigger the tax  break under this bill. I know he wasn't negotiating for everyday  working Americans and certainly not for older Americans or Americans  with disabilities. That is why the AARP and others are weighing in so  strongly against this.   We are going to have a little more time to debate here in the Senate,  apparently, than in the House, but I would hope we would send this  through the regular order because it requires a thorough vetting of the  facts, and the American people deserve that kind of transparency and  accountability in this process. I am absolutely confident that when the  American people get a good look at this deal, they will know it is a  very bad deal for the country and for millions of Americans.   I hope we will get on with that process. I hope the bill will never  arrive in the Senate. I hope the folks in the House will recognize that  it is a bad deal for the country and go back to the drawing board  because when I heard the mantra ``repeal and replace'' and when I heard  President Trump say that replacement was going to be much better and  cover more people for less cost, I think people took that seriously.  Now when they actually take a look at TrumpCare, as it is emerging from  the House, they see something very different. They see something that  is, quote, wonderful for the 1 percent of Americans who are going to  get a tax cut, but it is really lousy for everybody else in the  country.   We need to defeat this charade. This is not a replacement. This is a  fake. The American people are catching on quickly. That is why it is  very important that we not try to rush this through, that we have an  opportunity to discuss it in the light of day. I am absolutely  confident that if we do the right thing in terms of a full democratic  debate, TrumpCare will go down.
