 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2773, Recovering  America's Wildlife Act. I thank Representative Dingell and her  colleagues that have worked diligently on this legislation for a  considerable amount of time.   In the midst of the species extinction crisis that we have,  accelerated climate change, the loss of biodiversity, droughts, the  wildfires that we just heard about, it is important to note that this  legislation was built from the ground up; 1,800 organizations, as  diverse as Duke Energy on one side of the political spectrum and the  Environmental Defense Fund on the other side, both agreeing that the  approach of this legislation is the right approach; 180-plus cosponsors  represented in a bipartisan fashion.   This bill before us today will transform the state of wildlife  conservation in our country.   As we know, America's wildlife faces numerous threats, including  habitat loss, pollution, climate change, wildfire, drought, invasive  species, and emerging diseases.   It provides a historic $1.3 billion of dedicated funding for States  and territories and $97 million for Tribes to assist in their efforts  to conserve, restore, and protect wildlife and habitat each year.   With that protection comes the resiliency for habitat and the overall  resiliency for communities and our environment.   In the long run, this investment will save taxpayers money. It  creates jobs, promotes tourism, and provides safety and resilience to  those communities across our country.   Through habitat conservation and restoration, this bill makes  habitats and communities much more resilient to the ongoing and  accelerated issue of climate change. This is an important piece of  legislation for each and every State, territory, and Tribe in our  country, and I urge my colleagues to support it.                                time  1545    My friends on the other side of the aisle, my Republican colleagues  are fiscal conservatives when they are not in the majority. When they  are in the majority, that is not the pattern of behavior.   At the present time, nothing should be done is what is being  preached:   Nothing should be done about the climate crisis.   Nothing should be done about wildlife extinction.   Nothing should be done about January 6 and our democracy. That was  merely a mirage, a walk in the park that we should all forget.   Nothing should be done about our children and the danger that they  are exposed to in our very schools.   Nothing should be done about the rising healthcare costs and  prescription drug costs.   We can't do anything because of inflation and the rising gas prices,  so the best thing to do is to do nothing.   Well, my colleagues, I support H.R. 2773 because it does something.  It does something in a bipartisan, comprehensive way. If my colleagues  want to talk  [[Page H5519]]  about climate change, if they want to talk about droughts, if they want  to talk about wildfire, if they want to talk about fiscally prudent  things to do, let's talk about this bill today. Support it with  dedicated funding. Make the investment that will guarantee the  dividends for ourselves and future generations.   I applaud Representative Dingell and all the work of her colleagues  and this piece of legislation, and I urge its support and urge a  ``yes'' vote.
