 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend,  the gentleman from Kentucky, for yielding. The bill we are debating  here today, the so-called Protecting Our Democracy Act, is another  attempt by the outgoing majority to relitigate many of the Democrats'  sham investigations. Many of the bill's provisions are unnecessary and  recycled attempts to take away individual States' sovereignty. If we  were really here to talk about protecting our democracy, then we would  focus on the importance of voter rolls list maintenance to ensure only  eligible citizens are able to vote in Federal elections.   Congress passed the bipartisan National Voter Registration Act in  1993. That is almost 30 years ago. This law requires States to conduct  regular list maintenance to ensure their voter rolls are kept up to  date. This simple, commonsense requirement is incredibly important for  voter confidence in our entire election process and its outcomes.   However, the Biden DOJ refuses to enforce it. Instead, Progressives  focus on defunding the police and embracing lawlessness, keeping our  economy and Capitol shut down while ignoring the science, labeling  concerned parents as extremist threats, and weaponizing the DOJ to go  after them, and pursuing reckless, unnecessary spending that is driving  the inflation every single American feels in their pocketbook.   If Democrats were really focused on protecting our democracy, the  Biden Justice Department would investigate States like California where  the number of registered voters far exceeds the number of adults in the  State. Senator Alex Padilla, a newly appointed Senator from the State  of California, knew about the problem and refused to address it when he  was Secretary of State in California during the last election cycle.   Republicans care about election integrity because our constitutional  republic means nothing if our citizens don't have faith in our  elections.   When everyday Americans hear more and more reports of individuals on  active voter rolls who have moved to another State, died, or are  noncitizens, it frustrates them because it calls into question whether  their valid vote actually counts. One eligible person, one whole non- diluted vote.   It is so frustrating because the fix is so simple, but Democrats  refuse time and time again to address this problem. It is common sense  and has been Federal law for decades that only eligible Americans  should be on our voter rolls.   Republicans want every eligible voter who wants to vote to exercise  that right. Democrats dilute your vote, but Republicans restore it.   I am here today to talk about protecting our democracy, and I think  the only way to do that is to make sure Americans know our elections  have integrity.   So today, I am calling on the radical Biden Justice Department to do  the right thing and enforce Federal law across the board. Stop  investigating parents that want to be involved in their children's  education. Stop supporting efforts to defund our men and women in blue  resulting in the lawlessness that we see ravaging our great country.   Focus on what really matters. Protect our democracy, protect our  vote, and ensure States like California conduct voter roll list  maintenance so that voters know only eligible American citizens are  able to vote.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a report from the Department  of Justice IG detailing the DOJ's official policy not to enforce  Federal voter list maintenance requirements.  [From the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General,                                March 2013]   A Review of the Operations of the Voting Section of the Civil Rights                                  Division         V. Enforcement of the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA)         In this section we review the Voting Section's history of       enforcing the National Voter Registration Act, the so-called       motor-voter law. Enacted in 1993, the NVRA has. two primary       purposes: to increase the number of eligible citizens who       register to vote in federal elections and to protect the       integrity of the electoral process. 42 U.S.C. 1973gg(b).       Critics have alleged that CRT leadership during the prior       administration favored enforcement of the list-maintenance       (electoral integrity) provisions because those provisions       purportedly are more strongly supported by Republicans and       remove more potential Democratic voters from the rolls.       Conversely, critics of the current CRT leadership allege that       it has neglected the electoral integrity provisions of the       NVRA in favor of enforcing the voter access provisions,       because these provisions purportedly are supported by       Democratic constituencies and lead to the registration of       more voters who are likely to support Democrats. Without       opining on the underlying political assumptions, we examine       both of these allegations in this section.              A. Data Regarding Enforcement Trends in NVRA Cases         Figure 3. 7 below displays the number of NVRA enforcement       actions initiated by the Voting Section on an annual basis       since January 1995, when the statute became effective in most       states. Figure 3. 7 is broken down by actions that enforced       the statute's list-maintenance provision (Section 8(a)(4)),       actions  [[Page H7586]]       that enforced the voter registration provisions (Sections 5,       6, 7, and the improper purging paragraphs of Section 8), and       actions that brought both types of claims.        The most noteworthy trend in the Department's enforcement       of the NVRA relates to the statute's voter list-maintenance       provision, Section 8(a)(4). In the 17 years since the statute       became effective, the Department has asserted list-      maintenance claims on 7 occasions, 6 of which occurred in a       3-year span between 2004 and 2007. According to Hans von       Spakovsky, CRT leadership initiated an effort to enforce       Section 8's list-maintenance provision in late 2004. Von       Spakovsky told the OIG that he recommended to Division       leadership exploring those cases because he believed that the       Department had never conducted a systematic review of states'       list-maintenance compliance in the 10 years since the NVRA       became effective. This effort ultimately resulted in the       filing of a complaint alleging list-maintenance claims in       2005 and 2006. According to witnesses involved in the four       other matters involving list-maintenance claims brought       between 2004 and 2007, those claims arose when the Section       obtained evidence suggesting a failure to comply with the       list-maintenance provision during the course of ongoing       investigations into other voting-related matters.                 B. Enforcement of the NVRA during 2001-2008         We received allegations that the only NVRA cases that       Division leadership wanted to pursue during this period were       Section 8(a)(4) list-maintenance claims, at the expense of       cases to protect or increase voter registration under other       provisions of the NVRA. Critics further alleged that the       Division's leadership was particularly focused on bringing       such list-purging cases in political swing states and large       Democratic jurisdictions. The Division's leadership denied       any such focus and identified several cases approved by       Division leadership to controvert the suggestion that NVRA       enforcement decisions were driven by a partisan agenda. We       examined the entire range of NVRA cases pursued during       January 2001 to January 2009 in order to address this issue.        From January 2001 through January 2009, the Department was       involved in 12 NVRA enforcement matters, summarized in Table       3.2.        As reflected in Table 3.2, the Voting Section began filing       list-maintenance cases in 2004. As noted above, von Spakovsky       confirmed that Division leadership initiated an effort in       2004 to enforce Section 8's list-maintenance provision on a       systemic basis. Von Spakovsky told the OIG that he       recommended exploring those cases because he believed the       Department had never conducted a systematic review of states'       list-maintenance compliance in the 10 years since the NVRA's       enactment.        Division leadership directed the Voting Section to conduct       the research effort, to review the census data and voter       registration data for all 50 states to determine which states       had more people registered to vote than the voting-age       population, as reflected in the census data. Based on the       results of this research, the Section sent letters to 12       states, stating that the Section's review of relevant data       indicated that the state may not be complying with Section       8's list-maintenance provision and requesting information on       their efforts to remove ineligible voters from their       registration lists.        Von Spakovsky told the OIG that some of the targeted states       responded to the Department's letter, explained why there was       a discrepancy in the data, and established that they were       complying with the NVRA's list-maintenance requirements. He       also stated that a number of states failed to show that they       were in compliance with Section 8(a)(4) and that the Section       proceeded toward enforcement actions against those non-      compliant states.        Division leadership approved the filing of two complaints       as a result of this enforcement initiative. In November 2005,       the Section filed a lawsuit against the state of Missouri       alleging both improper purging and failure-to-purge       violations. In June 2006, the Section filed a complaint       against Indiana alleging that the state failed to conduct       list purging as required by Section 8(a)(4). The Indiana case       was resolved by a settlement agreement, but the Missouri case       continued until early 2009, when the Division voluntarily       dismissed the case.        In 2006 and 2007, Division leadership approved three       additional complaints containing Section 8(a)(4) list-      maintenance claims, against the States of Maine and New       Jersey and the City of Philadelphia. According to the Voting       Section attorney supervising those efforts, these complaints       did not arise out of the enforcement initiative described       above. Instead, the complaints were brought as a result of       investigations under the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) that       uncovered evidence of both HAVA and NVRA violations. The       Section ultimately settled the lawsuits with Maine, New       Jersey, and Philadelphia. In each settlement agreement, the       jurisdiction agreed to implement specific steps to satisfy       its list-maintenance obligations.        In August 2007, Voting Section Chief John Tanner initiated       a program to enforce Section 7 of the NVRA, requiring states       to provide voter registration opportunities in public       assistance and disability offices. Section attorneys reviewed       federal Election Assistance Commission (EAC) data to identify       states that were not meeting Section 7's requirements and       discovered 18 states that reported registering 0 voters in       offices providing public assistance over the previous 2-year       period. Following further investigation, the Section entered       into settlement agreements with Arizona and Illinois to       resolve Section 7 violations.        In 2007 and 2008, Voting Section teams reviewed EAC data       and census information to identify states that might not be       in compliance with the NVRA'sSection 8(a)(4) list-maintenance       requirements. The teams identified states in which a       significant percentage of the counties or electoral       jurisdictions had more registered voters than voting-age       population. The teams recommended to Division leadership that       the Voting Section initiate investigations into the states       that failed to meet the relevant criterion. The states that       were the subject of these recommendations included some       states that historically have consistently favored one party       in presidential elections as well as political ``swing       states.'' The 2007 recommendation was approved and the       Section later issued requests for information to the relevant       states. Ultimately, however, no further enforcement action       was taken arising out of this effort. The investigations that       were proposed in late November 2008 were never approved by       either the outgoing or the incoming administrations.                 C. Enforcement of the NVRA during 2009-2012       1. Division Leadership Declines To Act on Voting Section           Proposal for Section 8 Investigation        In February 2009, shortly after the new administration took       office, the Voting Section submitted a memorandum to Division       leadership requesting approval to initiate investigations       into the list-maintenance procedures of a State (``State       E''). According to the State E memorandum, voter-registration       data indicated that roughly 22 percent of State E's counties       had more registered voters than either the voting-age       population or the citizen voting-age population. The       memorandum stated that the Section had been alerted to State       E's potential list-maintenance failures in connection with an       unrelated Section 5 investigation. We were told that the       Section never received a response from Division leadership to       the proposal memorandum.      2. Drafting of NVRA Guidance        In the spring of 2009, a few months after the inauguration       of the new administration, the Department commenced an effort       to draft public guidance concerning the requirements of NVRA       Section 7. Samuel Hirsch, who joined the Department in March       2009 as a Deputy Associate Attorney General and led the NVRA       guidance effort, described the project as rewriting the NVRA       in plain terms and posting it on the CRT website to assist       those running state governmental offices in complying with       the NVRA's requirements. Hirsch told the OIG the original       scope of the NVRA guidance project was limited to Section 7       because the administration believed that Section 7 had been       somewhat ignored by state government officials. According to       Hirsch, there was a sense in the administration that NVRA       Section 8 and other provisions were working fairly well,       but that Section 7 ``was slipping through the cracks.''        DAAG Julie Fernandes and AAG Thomas Perez became involved       in the NVRA guidance project after they joined the Department       in July and October 2009, respectively. According to       Fernandes, she expressed concern to Hirsch that the project       was limited to Section 7 and proposed broadening the guidance       to include other NVRA provisions, such as Sections 5 and 8.       Perez also told the OIG that in early 2010 he instructed that       the guidance include a discussion of all NVRA provisions,       including the list-maintenance provisions. Hirsch told the       OIG that he did not oppose expanding the guidance to include       Section 8, but stated that he may have been opposed to       holding up the release of the Section 7 guidance while       preparing the Section 8 segment. The Division ultimately       posted guidance concerning NVRA Sections 5, 6, 7, and 8 on       its website in June 2010.      3. Comments by DAAG Julie Fernandes Regarding NVRA           Enforcement at a November 2009 Section Meeting        DAAG Julie Fernandes told the OIG that she urged Voting       Section Chief Christopher Coates to hold section-wide       meetings shortly after she joined the Department in July       2009. As a result, the Voting Section held several brown-bag       lunches. In addition to the September meeting at which       Section 2 enforcement was discussed as outlined above,       another session devoted to NVRA matters was held on November       10, 2009.        At some point during the November meeting, the discussion       turned to the enforcement of the NVRA's voter list-      maintenance provision in Section 8. Witnesses who recalled       Fernandes's statements uniformly remembered that she said       something to the effect that she was more interested in       pursuing cases under NVRA Section 7 than Section 8 because       Section 8 does not expand voter access. Witnesses'       recollections of the context of Fernandes's statements, her       precise wording, and the meaning of her comments, however,       varied widely.        Thirteen witnesses told the OIG that Fernandes stated that       she ``did not care about'' or ``was not interested'' in       pursuing Section 8 cases, or similar formulations. For       instance, Chris Herren, who was later promoted by current       Division leadership to Section Chief, told the OIG that       Fernandes made a controversial and ``very provocative''       statement at this brown bag lunch. In particular, Herren       stated that Fernandes stated  [[Page H7587]]       something to the effect of ``[Section 8] does nothing to help       voters. We have no interest in that.'' Herren told the OIG       that he winced when he heard Fernandes's response because he       believed it would raise a controversy. Two other Section       attorneys took handwritten notes at the meeting, both of       which quoted Fernandes saying that she did not ``care'' about       Section 8.        Ten attorneys who attended the meeting told the OIG that       they interpreted Fernandes's comments to be a clear directive       that Division leadership would not approve Section 8 list-      maintenance cases in the future. One Section attorney told       the OIG that he understood Fernandes's statements to mean       that proposing a Section 8 case would be futile and that he       believed proposing Section 8 could be detrimental for the       attorneys.        Seven Voting Section attorneys told the OIG, however, that       they did not believe Fernandes said that the Division would       not enforce Section 8 of the NVRA. Among these were three       Deputy Chiefs who told the OIG that they believed Fernandes       meant that Section 7 cases would be prioritized over Section       8 matters, but that they did not construe her statement to       mean that Section 8 cases would not be approved. Those       attorneys who were generally identified as being more       conservative tended to recall that Fernandes took the more       extreme position, while those generally identified as being       more liberal tended to recall her statements as being more       limited.        Fernandes told the OIG that she did not recall exactly what       she said at the November brown bag lunch regarding       enforcement of Section 8 of the NVRA. She said that she and       the Section staff discussed the NVRA and what their approach,       goals, and strategy should be. She said that she talked about       how Division leadership is interested in creating equal       opportunity for minority voters. Fernandes further told the       OIG that she talked about wanting the Section to focus on       voter access, which would involve NVRA Sections 5, 7, and 8,       all of which are in the vein of ensuring that jurisdictions       have a fair and accessible process for all voters. She stated       that she recalled being asked about Section 8 and that her       response included something to the effect that Division       leadership's focus is on the provisions of the NVRA       pertaining to voter access.        With respect to the comments attributed to her that she did       not care about enforcing Section 8, Fernandes told the OIG       that she did not think she said the words ``don't care''       about enforcing Section 8 because that is not her position.       Fernandes denied saying that she or Division leadership had       no interest in pursuing Section 8 cases. Fernandes said that       she believed her comment about not caring was in the context       of how to determine what jurisdictions they should target for       enforcement, given that she believed there is widespread       noncompliance with the NVRA.        Fernandes noted that the list-maintenance provision of       Section 8 requires jurisdictions to employ reasonable, non-      discriminatory measures to ensure that people who are       eligible can vote and those who are ineligible cannot.       Therefore, Fernandes stated, she does not care whether a       jurisdiction's voter list is big, but rather whether it has a       list-maintenance program that does not work. She explained       that the fact that a jurisdiction's voter list is too big       means that the Section may want to inquire about the       jurisdiction's list-maintenance program, but that alone would       not justify bringing a lawsuit.        Roughly one year later, in September 2010, allegations       concerning Fernandes's comments at the brown bag lunch       regarding NVRA enforcement surfaced in news media. Fernandes       and other Division leadership personnel assisted other       Department officials in preparing talking points to address       the allegations and Fernandes stated in one of the relevant       e-mails: ``If we are o.k. with having priorities, we should       say that we have a priority on the enforcement of the NVRA,       with a focus on the parts of the statute that require states       to provide voter registration opportunities in a variety of       settings.''      4. Approval of List-Maintenance Investigations        In September 2009, the Section submitted a memorandum to       DAAG Fernandes requesting authority to initiate formal       investigations into the list-maintenance procedures of eight       states. The recommendation was based on the Section's review       of an EAC report that contained voting-related data from each       of the 50 states covering the period from November 2006 to       November 2008. A Deputy Section Chief supervised a team of       Section attorneys that reviewed the EAC report for anomalous       entries, particularly states that reported that throughout       the 2-year period they did not remove any voters from their       rolls due to death or that they had not issued any voter-      removal notices related to citizens who were believed to have       moved out of the state. The team identified eight states that       met one of those criteria, four of which reported removing       zero ineligible voters from their rolls over the 2-year       period for any reason, including death, change of address,       disqualifying criminal conviction, or mental incapacity.        The team presented the relevant data in its memorandum to       DAAG Fernandes and stated that the information suggested that       the eight states in question were not fulfilling their list-      maintenance obligations under Section 8. As a result, the       team recommended initiating formal investigations of the       states in question and directing inquiries to relevant state       officials.        Fernandes told the OIG that, after receiving the proposal       for the Section 8 investigations, she told Section Chief       Coates that he needed to ``hold off' because she was not       ready to decide whether this was the proper approach for NVRA       enforcement. Fernandes told the OIG that she believed the       Section's NVRA work when she became DAAG in July 2009 was       disorganized and that its process for evaluating NVRA matters       was ``random, unstrategic, [and] not very well thought-out.''       She said that Division leadership and Voting Section       management were therefore engaged in a process of identifying       what their NVRA enforcement strategy should be by reviewing       where the Section had focused its enforcement efforts in the       past, determining which areas had been neglected, and       developing an analytical model to bring NVRA cases.        According to Fernandes, she and Division leadership       believed that the NVRA enforcement efforts from January 2001       through January 2009 had focused on Section 8's list-      maintenance cases, largely to the exclusion of the voter-      registration provisions in Section 7, which she believed had       been underenforced and neglected. While we found no evidence       that she examined any data to support this belief, it was       consistent with what we found to be the prevailing belief       about the prior administration's efforts in this area.       Fernandes stated further that she believed the way to       ``rectify this imbalance was to determine what Section 7       efforts were in process, whether they were being performed       correctly, and whether the Section should expand its Section       7 enforcement further. Fernandes stated that her supervisors       were pressuring her to move forward on Section 7 enforcement       and that she received a clear message that they viewed       enforcing Section 7 as a higher priority than Section 8. She       told the OIG that she believed she had to ``scratch the       Section 7 itch before turning to Section 8 matters and that       her supervisors would have criticized her if she had approved       Section 8 efforts first. She also noted that there was       significant criticism of the Department from civil rights       groups that their Section 7 enforcement efforts had been       inadequate, saying they had gotten--and continued to get--      ``beat up all the time by [their] lefty friends not doing       enough on Section 7.''     This is a report from the DOJ's IG. It  takes this many pages to tell the American voter that they are not  going to enforce Federal law in ensuring that States actually provide  and exercise the required voter list maintenance. This is an affront to  election integrity in our great country, and it needs to end today.   Let's protect our democracy, and let's work together to make that  happen.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from  Kentucky for yielding.   Madam Speaker, our most basic duty of the Federal Government should  be protecting the right for our citizens to vote, but we are not doing  everything we can to protect that. A disturbing trend across the  country is that more and more States and localities are allowing  noncitizens to vote. Furthermore, many States are conducting elections  that rely on wildly outdated voter lists, many of which include these  noncitizens.   In some States, such as California, the voter rolls are so outdated  that they have more registered voters than people who reside in the  State. This creates a potential for our citizens' votes to be diluted.  LA County had over 1.5 million ineligible people on their voter rolls.  A suit filed by a nonpartisan watch dog alleged that LA County had 112  percent of its adult citizens registered to vote.    Under pressure, California and LA County finally agreed to clean up  their voter rolls in 2019. Unfortunately, when then-California  Secretary of State Alex Padilla appeared before my committee in 2020,  he could not confirm that many of those ineligible people had actually  been removed from California's unmaintained voter rolls. I do not have  a lot of faith that California is doing everything it can to protect  the integrity of our elections.   And then there is New York City, which just decided to allow nearly a  million noncitizens to vote in city elections. New York can make its  own bad decisions, but it is our job to ensure that we protect Federal  elections. Common sense will tell you that combining noncitizens and  eligible American voters on the same voter rolls is ripe for abuse.   I will also use a final example from my home State of Illinois. In  Illinois, noncitizens cannot vote, and if they do, they face major  legal consequences and could be deported. But in 2016, Illinois'  automatic voter registration program mistakenly registered to vote more  than 500 noncitizens who had done the right thing by checking the box  stating that they are not citizens on their driver's license  application. However, several of these noncitizens voted in the 2018  and 2019 elections.   This does nothing to bolster voter confidence in our elections; in  fact, it does the opposite.   Not only does this undermine the integrity of our elections, the  mistake by Illinois could have had dire consequences for these  individuals, and it could be prevented if States were being forced to  maintain accurate voter rolls. Whether intentional or not, we know this  is happening. It is undermining the integrity of our elections.   This amendment would simply ensure those who are noncitizens who do  not have the right to vote in Federal elections are removed from  States' voter rolls. As someone who has attended many citizenship  ceremonies as a Member of Congress, it is unthinkable that we have  States undermining what it means to be a citizen of this great country.   My office has helped many immigrants go through the legal process to  become American citizens, and there is nothing better than seeing them  raise their right hand and swear to support and defend our  Constitution; to swear to bear arms in defense of this Nation; to swear  allegiance to this great country.    Madam Speaker, there is nothing better  than to think that their vote, something they worked hard to get, the  right to vote on something that they worked hard to get the right to do  is being undermined. That is unthinkable.   Let's pass this amendment to ensure only citizens are voting in our  elections and prevent States from putting noncitizens at risk of  intentionally or unintentionally breaking the law and illegally voting  in our elections.   We will offer this solution as a motion to recommit. If we adopt the  motion to recommit, we will instruct the Committee on Oversight and  Reform to consider an amendment to ensure States remove noncitizens  from their voter rolls as part of a regular comprehensive list  maintenance program.   Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record immediately prior to the vote on the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to  recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.
