 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, we are officially on day No. 2 of the  second tranche of an appropriations package. We have before us the  Interior Subcommittee's appropriations bill, the Financial Services,  the T-HUD--Transportation, Housing and Urban Development--and  Agriculture. So it is a good combination. It is a good package. It is a  strong package. It is a series of appropriations bills that moved  through the full Appropriations Committee several months back. Most of  these bills advanced either unanimously, as the Interior Appropriations  Subcommittee's bill did, or with a strong bipartisan show of support  out of committee.   For those who have followed the appropriations process over the  years, you know it is somewhat unprecedented to be able to advance  these spending bills through the full committee process, much less to  do so in a manner that surely shows the bipartisan approach this  committee has taken in this fiscal year.   I acknowledge and recognize the work of Chairman Shelby and his vice  chairman, Senator Leahy from Vermont, for the truly collaborative  process they have encouraged all of us to work toward.   There was an agreement, an understanding, that our appropriations  process had not been the model of good governance, of legislating, that  we would have liked it to have been, that we would expect it to be, and  that our colleagues--much less the American public--would expect it to  be.   With a very determined effort, the group of appropriators who came  together earlier made a very strong and firm commitment that we were  going to get this process back on track. With the leadership of the  chairman and the vice chairman, that is exactly where we are. We were  able to move a smaller minibus, if you will, a month ago. That is now  moving through that conference process. It is not an easy process, we  recognize, but nothing around here is easy. If it is worth doing and  doing well, it is going to take a little bit of work. We have done that  work, and to be here on the 25th of July--to be at a place at which the  Senate is poised to advance seven of the appropriations bills out of  the Senate--is really quite unprecedented.   In my remarks on the floor on Monday evening, I noted that this was  the first time since 2010 we had seen an Interior Appropriations  Subcommittee's bill being brought to the floor of the U.S. Senate. That  is a long time. That is too long a time not to have had a fulsome  process, a process wherein we not only demonstrate the good work that  we as appropriators have done but wherein our colleagues who are not on  the committee also view that good work, weigh in, offer their thoughts,  offer their amendments, and are a part of the broader, whole process.  [[Page S5317]]    How did we get here from there--from a point at which we,  effectively, were not legislating as we knew we were capable of doing?   There was an agreement, a commitment, that we were going to stand  down on some of the more controversial riders--in other words, those  initiatives that were not actual appropriations but were more in line  with authorizing within the appropriations bill.   There has been a history around here of seeing a level of  authorization, and sometimes that level of authorization on an  appropriations bill has created enough controversy that it has ground  the whole process to a halt. So standing down on some of these  initiatives, on some of these riders, has been an important part of how  we have come to be where we are today.   We talk about the need to keep out the poison pills. We have joked-- it is not really a joke; it is the reality--that one Member's priority  is another Member's poison pill. So how do we work our way through that  process?   We will have an opportunity to take up, at least for discussion, some  of those priorities that may be significant, and Members have a great  deal of desire to see them advance. Members on the other side will look  at that and say that is too toxic--you can't go there; you can't do  that. How we navigate through that will take a little bit of  legislating.   I would ask Members--I would urge Members--to please come to us as  their bill managers, whether for the Interior appropriations issues or  for the Financial Services issues. Senator Lankford is the chairman of  that committee. Go to Senator Hoeven on Ag and to Senator Collins on  Transportation, Housing and Urban Development--T-HUD. I would urge  Members to come to us with their issues, their concerns, their  amendments. Let's work through them. Let's get them through the  process.   Yesterday, we were able to advance four amendments. Some might say,  well, that is not very much, but I would suggest to you that we are  getting started. We are getting started in a good way, in a positive  way, in an encouraging way, and we want to encourage that good, forward  activity.   We all know the most prized commodity around here is time and floor  time. We don't have unlimited time on the floor to take up this package  of measures. So help us get to the point at which we can work through  those issues that we need to in order to bring to the floor that which  will require a vote. We will help you and do so in a way that, I think,  will do honor to the appropriations process, do honor to the  legislative process--again, what we know around here to be regular  order.   Unfortunately, I think we have seen that regular order has been less  and less regular. It has become extraordinary because we just don't  practice it enough. We want to get back to that, and we have the  opportunity to do so. We have demonstrated that with one package, and  we are in the midst of demonstrating that this week. I look forward to  the full cooperation of Members as we advance.   I see my friend and colleague, the vice chairman of the  Appropriations Committee, is on the floor. Again, I acknowledge his  great leadership in working with the chairman of the full committee, in  really getting us back to a place where we can be proud of our process.   With that, I yield to my friend, the Senator from Vermont.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 499, S. 2779.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  committee-reported amendment be withdrawn, the Flake amendment at the  desk be agreed to, and the bill, as amended, be considered read a third  time.  [[Page S5320]]     Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the  bill.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I will just take a few moments as we  are waiting for greater discussion about our appropriations package  that is on the floor.                           Tribute to Marge Mullen    Mr. President, the community of Soldotna, AK, in South Central  Alaska--what we call the Kenai Peninsula--is going to be celebrating  their Progress Days this weekend. On Friday, we have a homestead  community barbecue, where a very special individual will be recognized  as the first female homesteader in Soldotna.  [[Page S5321]]    Now, when most of us around here think about homesteading, we might  go back to when President Lincoln signed the 1862 Homesteading Act.  This enabled over 1.6 million people to stake their claim on Federal  lands. Perhaps, if you are an Alaskan, you recall that homesteading  became legal back in 1898. That was when President McKinley signed  legislation to extend homesteading to what at that time was still the  District of Alaska. It was not until decades later that we became a  State.   What most people do not realize is that while the days of the wild  West are certainly over here in the lower 48, the tradition of  homesteading is still very, very much alive, and certainly we see that  in Alaska.   So I would like to take just a couple of minutes this morning to  share the story of an Alaskan homesteading icon, Marge Mullen. Again,  it is Marge who will be recognized this weekend at Progress Days in  Soldotna. In fact, on July 27, she will be recognized by the mayor of  Soldotna, Mayor Anderson. July 27 will be recognized as ``Marge Mullen  Appreciation Day.''   Marge was born in Chicago in 1920. According to the Peninsula  Clarion, the local newspapers there on the Kenai Peninsula, Marge  claims that she remembers seeing an article on Alaskan homesteading in  the Chicago Daily News back in 1947. The idea must have seemed really  appealing to her because after she read that article, she and her  husband Frank, who was a pilot during World War II, bought a small  plane, and they headed north to plant their roots. That was quite a  trek back in the late 1940s, to fly in a small aircraft.   They landed in Alaska. They walked 65 miles through some pretty tough  terrain. They then settled their homestead on Soldotna Creek, making  Marge the first woman to live in Soldotna under the Homestead Act.   It wasn't too many years after they arrived in Alaska that, sadly,  Marge lost her husband Frank to polio. It certainly would have been  easier at the time for her to just pack up and head back to Chicago,  but Marge was a pretty independent, strong-headed woman, and she made  that brave choice to remain on her homestead.   Just to kind of paint a picture of what we are talking about back in  the early 1950s, to make sure everybody understands the significance of  a decision like that, you can either stay out there in some pretty open  and still very wild areas or you can go back to Chicago. Homesteading  has always been a lifestyle that is based on self-sufficiency. You have  to be able to handle things on your own. It is a difficult task  anywhere. It was difficult, as we saw, for the initial homesteaders  around the lower 48 States, but there are some additional challenges,  perhaps, in Alaska. There are some pretty tough winters that people go  through. Temperatures are somewhat unforgiving in the winter months, as  we know.   Marge faced a cost of living that was three to four times higher than  she knew down in the lower 48. When you are out there, you live every  day knowing that wildlife is just right outside your door, and that if  something goes wrong, there is not a lot of help. There is no aid in  the event of an emergency. So whether it is a bear that has threatened  you and your family or whether it is just the rigors of living on your  own with no assistance and no help, it can be a lonely life, but it can  be a very life-building experience, and Marge certainly developed that.   Marge learned to hunt on her own, to chop wood, carry water, and grow  food to safeguard the health, the warmth, and the safety of herself and  her four children.   Trust me when I say that Marge overcame challenges that many of us-- even some hearty Alaskans--could not imagine. But she overcame those  challenges in an Alaska that was far less modern than the Alaska our  visitors see today.   While Marge is widely known as a pioneer homesteader, she is also  known throughout the community of Soldotna for many other  contributions. She began the town's first roadside litter pickup  program. She was involved at a lot of different levels. She served as  the chair of the local planning commission. She helped to establish the  Kenai Peninsula Conservation Society. She eventually became its  president. In 2010, Marge was honored for her accomplishments when she  was rightly inducted into the Alaska Women's Hall of Fame.   Marge's contributions continue today. She is 98 years old. She is  revered as Soldotna's unofficial historian. She acts as the chair of  the local historical society. You have to figure that she knows  everything that went on in the region. She was part of everything that  went on in the region. She is really history in the flesh, bringing the  early days of Soldotna to life through her teachings and digital  lessons.   Again, as I mentioned, the Soldotna city mayor has proclaimed July 27  as ``Marge Mullen Appreciation Day.'' As the community of Soldotna  comes together to celebrate Marge's legacy, I think it is only  appropriate that we in the Senate should come to know a little bit of  her history as well and join in the recognition.   I offer my thanks and my best wishes to Marge Mullen as she continues  influencing her community and the State of Alaska.   I thank my colleagues for letting me share this tribute this morning.   I see that no Members are on the floor yet. Again, I would encourage  folks to take a look at the bills that we have in front of us--the  Interior, the Financial Services, the Agriculture, and the T-HUD. Let's  have an opportunity to consider the amendments that we can take up and  allow for the process to go forward in a fulsome and a constructive  way.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
