 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   I would like to start off by thanking Chairwoman Foxx and Chairman  Walberg for their strong support of my bill, the Small Business Health  Fairness Act.   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us today is on an issue that has  long been near and dear to my heart: association health plans.  Association health plans would allow small businesses to join together  and provide healthcare coverage just like large corporations and unions  do today.   Association health plans are also a central part of replacing  ObamaCare with commonsense solutions.   You know, ObamaCare has been an absolute disaster. My constituents in  Collin County, Texas, have shared with me their negative experiences  with it since it became law nearly 7 years ago.   One of the groups hardest hit by ObamaCare is small businesses, the  backbone of our economy. Since 2008, over one-third of businesses with  fewer than 10 employees offering health insurance have dropped  insurance; and, you know, that is just wrong.   Because ObamaCare is failing, we need to repeal it and replace it  with better solutions for the American people. One of these solutions  is my association health plan bill.   What my bill does is simply allow small businesses to join together  through trade or professional organizations. As we all know, the basic  rule of insurance is the bigger the risk pool, the lower the cost.   Furthermore, my bill allows small businesses to join together across  State lines. My bill would also free small businesses from costly and  burdensome State and Federal requirements. This isn't anything  different from what large employers and unions already do. My bill is  simply about leveling the playing field for small businesses and their  hardworking employees.   This bill also has wide support from the business community,  including the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National  Federation of Independent Business, the National Retail Federation, and  the International Franchise Association.   Not everyone knows this, but I was a small-business owner myself  between my time in the Air Force and coming to Congress. In fact, I  established a home building business in north Texas from scratch, so I  can understand where small businesses are coming from.   For example, Bob Gibbons and his wife own a commercial real estate  business in my hometown of Plano, Texas. They have had a tough time  obtaining good, affordable health insurance, a problem that has gotten  worse since ObamaCare.   Bob sums up this entire issue pretty well in two sentences: ``Why  should someone's status as an employee give them preferential right to  decent group health coverage? Entrepreneurs are penalized when they  start a small business because they can't get comparable coverage.''                                time  1415    Bob's experience underscores the entire point behind the Small  Business Health Fairness Act.   Mr. Speaker, I include Bob's letter in the Record, along with letters  from the cities of Frisco, Richardson, and Anna in my district.                                  REATA Commercial Realty, Inc.,                                           Plano, TX, March 2, 2017.      Re Association Health Plans.       Hon. Sam Johnson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Johnson: I would like to register my       support of your recently introduced bill, H.R. 1101, which       would provide for association health plans. I am a small       business owner in your district in Plano, Texas. My wife and       I have been on a roller coaster of health coverage over the       years. We were covered by employer plans when I was an       employee (pre-ACA). Then we had to negotiate for an       individual plan when I started my own business (pre-ACA).       Then we were again covered by an employer plan when my wife       went to work (post-ACA). And now that she works with me, we       must navigate the purchase of an individual plan again, but       in the post-ACA failure environment.        I have always thought it was ridiculous that the only       decent health coverage was available to employees of       companies that provided it. Why should someone's status as an       employee give them a preferential right to decent group       health coverage? Entrepreneurs are penalized when they start       a small business because they can't get comparable coverage.        I was thrilled when I ran into Gabi Pate at a Plano Chamber       of Commerce Public Policy Committee meeting yesterday and       heard you were trying to help. Association health plans would       be a step in the right direction. At least then I could get       in on a group plan through trade associations, a chamber of       commerce or another qualified group. I truly hope that the       bill will allow for portability of that health coverage,       however, so I can leave the association if I choose and still       have coverage.        Thank you for your leadership in this area. Please don't       hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.            Sincerely,                                                       Bob Gibbons.  [[Page H2321]]                                          ____                                    Frisco Chamber of Commerce,                                         Frisco, TX, March 22, 2017.        On behalf of the Frisco Chamber of Commerce in Frisco,       Texas, I write in strong support of the Small Business Health       Fairness Act. The Frisco Chamber of Commerce provides       advocacy support for over 1,300 businesses of all sizes. We       consistently hear from our small business members about the       hardship in providing appropriate and adequate healthcare for       their employees at an affordable price. This legislation will       increase small businesses' bargaining power with health       insurance providers and ensure a level playing field for       smaller entities that want to help their workers and families       with healthcare costs.        Locally owned small businesses are a huge contributor in       the fabric of a business community. It is through the small       and medium businesses that we see the greatest job growth. It       is through the small and medium businesses that we see the       greatest increase in retail spending in the local       communities. However, while many see the benefit of a strong       small business community, they have been neglected in being       able to negotiate for competitive pricing in healthcare       costs.        For these reasons, the Frisco Chamber of Commerce strongly       supports the Small Business Health Fairness Act, which will       allow small businesses the opportunity to band together to       provide their employees with better, more affordable health       insurance coverage. With rising medical costs being a top       concern of both individuals and employers, the impact of this       increased availability of affordable insurance would be       significant.            Sincerely,                                                       Tony Felker,      President/CEO.                                   ____                                                  Richardson, Texas,                                             Chamber of Commerce,                                     Richardson, TX, March 21, 2017.      Re Association Health Plans.       Hon. Sam Johnson,      House of Representatives,      Washington DC.        Dear Chairman Johnson: On behalf of the Richardson Chamber       of Commerce, a 5-star chamber, I write in strong support of       the Small Business Health Fairness Act. This legislation will       increase small businesses' bargaining power with health       insurance providers and ensure a level playing field for       smaller entities that want to help their workers and families       with health care costs. The Richardson Chamber of Commerce       commends you for your longstanding leadership on this       important issue to the small business community. With more       than 650 member organizations, the Richardson Chamber of       Commerce continues the goal of its founding fathers to serve       as the cornerstone of economic and community development for       the city of Richardson. In order to continue that growth, our       small businesses must be allowed to offer affordable       healthcare to their employees.        While the small business community's economic output is       great, its negotiating power in the health care market is at       a competitive disadvantage. The federal Employee Retirement       Income Security Act, which currently permits large       corporations and labor organizations to ``self-insure'' and       offer insurance with certain exemptions from state law, does       not provide small business with the same advantage. The law       must be reformed to empower small employers with the ability       to obtain and offer competitively priced health insurance.        For these reasons, the Richardson Chamber of Commerce and       our member companies, strongly support the Small Business       Health Fairness Act, which will allow small businesses the       opportunity to band together to provide their employees with       better, more affordable health insurance coverage. With       rising medical costs being a top concern of both individuals       and employers, the impact of this increased availability of       affordable insurance would be significant.        The Richardson Chamber commends your efforts to provide       small businesses with health care options in a thoughtful and       constructive manner. We look forward to working with you on       this key legislation.            Sincerely,                                                William C. Sproull,      President and CEO.                                   ____                                                        Greater Anna                                             Chamber of Commerce,                                           Anna, TX, March 21, 2017.      Hon. Sam Johnson,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Johnson: On behalf of the Greater Anna       Chamber of Commerce and our more than 200 members, including       a majority of small business, I would like to show our       support of the H.R. 101, the Small Business Health Fairness       Act. There are many small businesses in our community that       cannot currently economically and efficiently afford       healthcare for their employees. We hope this legislation will       help ease that affordability on both our businesses and       employees.        With better access to healthcare, employees could be more       willing to work at these smaller businesses instead of only       working for larger corporations. This will help our local       community by keeping our employees closer to their home,       families and children's schools. Again, we support for Small       Business Health Fairness Act and look forward to a better       solution to our current healthcare problem.            Best Regards,                                                     Kevin Hall,                                                 Executive Director,                                  Greater Anna Chamber of Commerce.     Mr. Speaker, by allowing small businesses  to band together, they can collectively purchase more affordable health  insurance for their employees.   Let's get this commonsense plan passed. Let's help those who power  our economy be able to get the health care they want, need, and deserve  for themselves and their workers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1101.
