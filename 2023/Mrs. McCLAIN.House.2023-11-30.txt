 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the Ubly  High School varsity football team for winning the Michigan Division 8  State championship.   The Bearcats from Ubly High School took home their first-ever State  championship in football, winning 21-6 and capping off their undefeated  season as champions.   I congratulate Coach Sweeney and all the young men on the varsity  team for their remarkable accomplishment. They have made Michigan's  Ninth District proud, and I hope they cherish this memory for the rest  of their lives.   Again, I congratulate Ubly High School.   Go Bearcats.                            ____________________
