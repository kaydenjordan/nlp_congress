 Mr. Speaker, last week I received a peculiar invitation  from  [[Page H1559]]  the Kuwaiti Government to celebrate Kuwait's independence at the Trump  Hotel.   While Kuwait is a close ally of the United States, I feel compelled  to decline the invitation. We must reject the culture of corruption  that surrounds President Trump and his family.   President Trump promised he would drain the swamp. He promised to put  the interests of the American people before his own. Yet he has used  his office to enrich himself further.   According to USA Today, the President earned--get ready for this--$40  million from his Washington hotel just in 2017. This includes $350,000  in campaign funds and events hosted by the Republican National  Committee.   As we press foreign nations to better their own governments, it is  clear that President Trump has reduced America's moral authority.   I remind the President of Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution,  which prohibits the President from receiving gifts from a foreign power  without the consent of Congress.   We must restore America's faith in our democracy. That is why I look  forward to working with my colleagues to hold the Trump administration  fully accountable for their misdeeds.
