 Mr. President, reserving the right to object,  legislation that would affect the rights of American citizens under the  Second Amendment should not be fast-tracked by the Senate. Efforts to  criminalize otherwise lawful conduct with firearms by law-abiding gun  owners should not be exempt from consideration by the appropriate  committee of jurisdiction. It should not be exempt from debate on the  Senate floor.   If this so-called commonsense, bipartisan legislation was indeed  crafted with strong bipartisan input, it shouldn't have any problems  advancing by regular order.   Many questions about this legislation need to be answered before it  is forced upon law-abiding gun owners. If I wanted to give my best  friend's son or grandson my hunting rifle, would we first have to  appear before a licensed gun dealer and go through a lengthy and  potentially expensive background check? This is my understanding. We  have many questions like this.   My constituents would like to have an opportunity to weigh in on  measures like these, which is why we can't fast-track legislation that  affects America's Second Amendment rights.   I object to this unanimous consent.   I yield the floor.
