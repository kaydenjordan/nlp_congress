 Mr. President. I wish to honor the distinguished  career of Bruce Benson, the outgoing president of the University of  Colorado. Through his tenacity and hard work, Bruce made the university  and the State of Colorado a better place. CU is one of the Nation's  great universities, and Bruce's contributions, including the record- breaking growth in research funding, have made it a source of statewide  pride.   Bruce would admit that he was originally reluctant to take the job  and with good reason: He had already enjoyed a long and fruitful career  in politics, philanthropy, and business. However, those experiences and  relationships were exactly what made Bruce so effective. As only he  could, Bruce was able to use these experiences to further CU's standing  as one the Nation's prominent public universities and research  institutions.   Under Bruce's leadership, the university's research funding reached  record levels, surpassing $1 billion during the last academic year.  This money allowed for critical research in biotechnology, healthcare,  energy, and aerospace and a number of other fields. Additionally, CU  had its 6 best fundraising years during his time at the helm, including  a record $440.4 million between 2017 and 2018. All the while, Bruce  guided efforts to implement operational efficiencies, cut bureaucracy,  and improve business practices at the university. Successes like these  solidify Bruce's legacy and his commitment to the future of Colorado.  It is worth noting that he is retiring as the longest serving CU  president in more than half a century.   Bruce has always been a tireless champion for Colorado's young  people. He worked to make the DPS Foundation into the great civic  organization it is today. He has also done extraordinary work at  Children's Hospital Colorado.   Bruce has consistently worked to change the lives of children and  students across the State of Colorado, from the youngest of kids to  college graduates. I know I speak on behalf of all of Colorado when I  say that we are all grateful for his service.                            ____________________
