 Madam President, this week the country will observe  National Police Week, a week in honor of the courageous law enforcement  officers who paid the ultimate sacrifice in service to their  communities.   As we honor the service of our brave men and women in the law  enforcement community, I would like to take the opportunity to honor  the life and memory of three law enforcement officers from the  Commonwealth of Massachusetts who paid the ultimate sacrifice in  service to their communities: Sean M. Gannon, Michael C. Chesna, and  Leon F. Moody.   Sergeant Sean Gannon, of New Bedford, was killed in the line of duty  on April 12, 2018. He was a lifelong public servant, first serving as a  public safety officer and later becoming a police officer with the  Yarmouth Police Department, where he served for 8 years. When he wasn't  on duty, Sergeant Gannon enjoyed volunteering with Big Brothers Big  Sisters, spending time outdoors, traveling, and devoting time to family  and friends.   Sergeant Gannon, who lost his life at the age of 32, was the beloved  son of Denise Morency Gannon and Patrick Gannon and a devoted husband  to his wife Dara.   Sergeant Michael Chesna, who was killed in the line of duty on July  15, 2018, dedicated his life to his country, his community, and his  family. A native of Hanover, MA, Sergeant Chesna enlisted in the U.S.  Army following the September 11 attacks, serving two  [[Page S2809]]  tours of duty with the 187 10th Mountain Division, where he was awarded  the Purple Heart. Following his service in the Army, Sergeant Chesna  became a police officer with the city of Weymouth, where he served  until his untimely death at the age of 42.   Sergeant Chesna was a loving husband to his wife Cindy and father to  his children Olivia and Jack. He was an avid Boston sports fan who  enjoyed playing basketball, collecting sports memorabilia, and spending  time with family and friends.   Patrolman Leon Moody of the Worcester Police Department died of an  illness he sustained in the line of duty in 1932. He served the  Worcester P.D. bravely for 15 years, before passing away at the age of  44.   Sergeants Gannon and Chesna and Patrolman Moody are among 371 law  enforcement officers who died while protecting their communities and  whose names were engraved this week on the walls of the National Law  Enforcement Officers Memorial here in Washington, DC.   This week and every day, we honor their service and their sacrifice.  Most importantly, we honor the lives they lived and legacies they leave  behind. May their memories continue to challenge and inspire us.                            ____________________
