 Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, preventing fraud and abuse within our financial system  and cracking down on bad actors for illegal insider trading is a  nonpartisan priority. This kind of fraud and illegal activity hurts  everyday investors, and it also makes our markets less efficient,  accurate, and reliable.   Current law prohibits trading on material insider information in  breach of a fiduciary duty under the antifraud provisions of the  Federal securities law.   The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice  are the Federal agencies tasked with enforcing insider trading. Both  agencies regularly use their authority by bringing insider trading  cases against bad actors who violate our insider trading laws.   The SEC has not asked for this bill, however, unlike other bills that  Republicans have voted for out of this House in the past month.  Moreover, Democrats have not fully identified a problem within the  current body of the law that inhibits the prosecution of bad actors who  illegally trade on material, nonpublic information.   As it is written before us on the floor at this moment, this bill  could potentially create more confusion and uncertainty within the law  of insider trading. It could even expand liability for good faith  traders, which would hurt the efficiencies of our markets, chill vital  information gathering, and weaken investor confidence.   Republican and Democrat SEC chairs alike, with vastly different  approaches to enforcement matters, have expressed concern over Congress  codifying a prohibition on insider trading into one single statute.  Specifically, they voiced concerns that Congress would write a law that  could be both overly broad and too narrow at the same time.   I share their concerns with the bill as drafted before us today, and  I am pleased to hear that the chair has indicated that the majority  will be accepting the ranking member's amendment shortly.   I am concerned that the current version of the bill, however, does  not include an explicit personal benefit test, as set forth by the  Supreme Court precedents. I am troubled that an unclear phrasing such  as ``relating to the market'' is overbroad and will allow judges and  prosecutors to expand the law.   I am also concerned that the bill, as drafted, lacks an exclusivity  provision that would make this bill the exclusive law of the land.   Finally, the rule of construction section before us is troubling,  because the Financial Services Committee has not even had a chance to  debate this specific language. I fear that this language could add more  confusion and uncertainty around insider trading laws, with rogue  judges and prosecutors using the language to expand the bounds of  insider trading law.   I do believe that the ranking member's amendment goes a distance in  clarifying that, but, as I will talk about, I will be having an  amendment later on as well that I believe further clarifies that.                                time  1330    Drafting a statute that appropriately and accurately captures the  subtleties of insider trading case law and regulations that have been  shaped and finessed over decades into one single statute isn't easy, to  say the least.   Achieving bipartisan support also isn't easy, especially when it  involves nuanced and technical substance such as the body of insider  trading law.   My colleague, Ranking Member McHenry, will be offering his amendment  momentarily that represents a bipartisan agreement with the author to  improve the bill by including some Republican priorities and improving  the bill to better track current insider trading law.   As I had mentioned, I will be offering an amendment as well in an  attempt to further clarify and improve this proposal.   So, while we are unsure exactly what the final product is going to  look like here, I do want to commend both Mr. Himes and Ranking Member  McHenry for working together to attempt to reach a bipartisan agreement  to improve this bill with the amendment and to make it clear that it is  Congress' intent to codify existing law without broadening it into new  areas. I hope that the author of the legislation will accept my  amendment as well.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Steil), the newest member of the Investor  Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets Subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), the distinguished ranking  member.    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Chair, I would like to take this time to, again, congratulate  the work that has been done. I do believe that there is additional work  that is before us.   I will be having an amendment that I will be offering a little later  on, and at this point, I think, as it is coming together, there still  is not going to be total agreement or total unanimity. You will see  with the ranking member's amendment a number of Republicans who will  join this bill. I believe that with the adoption of my amendment you  would see even further Republican support of the underlying bill.   There will be some dissent. There is dissent within the industry.  There is dissent within those prosecutors and the regulators. As I had  noted, both Republican and Democrat chairs of the SEC and commissioners  of the SEC have said that having Congress act on this particular issue  will set off a new chain of events, a new set of legal challenges that  will take years to settle in the courts, as well, and they are  comfortable with the options that they have the way current law has  settled.   Having said that, again, as the ranking member had said, in an  attempt to codify a number of those Supreme Court rulings is  commendable. I tend to be one who believes that Congress has a  responsibility to review and look at and examine whether they should  codify precedent.   I find it interesting that on both sides this happens and with the  regulators, and that everyone seems to pick and choose a little bit as  to what subject area they would like to codify and what subject area  they would continue to like to have flexibility on, based on those  lawsuits.   At this time the ranking member and his work with the gentleman from  Connecticut has made significant progress, and I look forward to  adopting the gentleman from North Carolina's amendment and the  potential adoption of my amendment, as well, as we move forward.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I will be brief. I am concerned that the bill before us  today focuses specifically on awareness of information rather than the  use of wrongful information in connection with security trading.  [[Page H9277]]    Specifically, this bill defines trading while ``aware'' of material  and nonpublic information or communicating material and nonpublic  information as wrongful only if the information was obtained by way of,  or its communication or use would constitute: theft, bribery,  misrepresentation, espionage; a violation of Federal computer data and  intellectual property protection and privacy laws; conversion,  misappropriation, or other deceptive means; and any breach of a  fiduciary duty, a contractual relationship, a code of conduct, or a  personal confidence or trust.   A person violates the bill's prohibitions on trading with and  communicating material on nonpublic information so long as this person  ``knew'' the information was wrongfully obtained, actively avoided  gaining such knowledge, or recklessly disregarded the wrongful use,  communication, or obtainment of this information.   It does not matter, under the bill, whether they know the method by  which the information was obtained or communicated or if any benefit  actually came from communication of the information.   In short, Mr. Chair, I believe that this would, in turn, allow  activist judges and prosecutors to go after individuals regardless of  their intention or actual profit from wrongful actions.   That is why my amendment is very simple. It would strike all  occurrences of the phrase ``aware of'' and insert the word ``using.''  In other words, you can be aware of something, but if you are not going  to actually use that information, why would you be held to a criminal  standard?   My amendment would have the effect of limiting who can be prosecuted  under this bill to people who actually use wrongful information to gain  a profit.   As we all know, in our lives, there are all kinds of rumors around us  all the time, whether it is about our work life or our family or  whatever might be going on, somebody in the neighborhood. It is hard to  know what information is actually true or actually accurate.   What we have currently is this assumption that being aware of  something makes you criminally liable versus actually using that  information.   The current bill could allow prosecution of people who traded and are  simply aware of information but perhaps would have traded regardless of  their awareness of that information.   I am prepared to support this underlying bill with the adoption of my  amendment.   I was pleased to see the adoption of the amendment from the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry). I believe these are perfecting  amendments. I believe that these are issues that need to be further  addressed.   While I, too, have some concerns about exclusivity and some of the  other things that the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry)  discussed, I believe that this particular issue is of significance, and  it is sufficient enough and significant enough to pull my support  across the finish line as we move forward on this.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to accept this perfecting  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 196,  noes 231, not voting 9, as follows:                               [Roll No. 648]                                 AYES--196       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Armstrong      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Baird      Balderson      Banks      Barr      Bergman      Bilirakis      Bishop (NC)      Bishop (UT)      Bost      Brady      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burchett      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Cheney      Cline      Cloud      Cole      Collins (GA)      Comer      Conaway      Cook      Crawford      Crenshaw      Curtis      Davidson (OH)      Davis, Rodney      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Duncan      Dunn      Emmer      Estes      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx (NC)      Fulcher      Gaetz      Gallagher      Gianforte      Gibbs      Gohmert      Gonzalez (OH)      Gonzalez-Colon (PR)      Gooden      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Green (TN)      Griffith      Grothman      Guest  [[Page H9278]]        Guthrie      Hagedorn      Harris      Hartzler      Hern, Kevin      Herrera Beutler      Hice (GA)      Higgins (LA)      Hill (AR)      Holding      Hollingsworth      Hudson      Huizenga      Hurd (TX)      Johnson (LA)      Johnson (OH)      Johnson (SD)      Jordan      Joyce (OH)      Joyce (PA)      Katko      Keller      Kelly (MS)      Kelly (PA)      King (IA)      King (NY)      Kinzinger      Kustoff (TN)      LaHood      LaMalfa      Lamborn      Latta      Lesko      Long      Loudermilk      Lucas      Luetkemeyer      Marchant      Marshall      Massie      Mast      McCarthy      McCaul      McClintock      McHenry      McKinley      Meadows      Meuser      Miller      Mitchell      Moolenaar      Mooney (WV)      Mullin      Murphy (NC)      Newhouse      Norman      Nunes      Olson      Palazzo      Palmer      Pence      Perry      Posey      Ratcliffe      Reed      Reschenthaler      Rice (SC)      Riggleman      Roby      Rodgers (WA)      Roe, David P.
