 Madam Speaker, so what have we had so far under the  Biden plan? Well, what we have heard about lately is that for  Republicans trying to be more fiscally responsible, we hear that he is  complaining that we are worried about deficits and spending.   He says we are affecting lives. Boy, are we affecting lives with the  policy coming out of Washington, D.C. Inflation. Energy crisis. But  that is part of the incredible transition, we are told, that is being  forced upon us to put us out of our vehicles or not being able to use  gas appliances, if they have their way.   On the Republican side, crisis acting is the new term. We are crisis  acting. Well, I guess if we want to talk about crisis acting, let me  remind everybody that carbon dioxide is only 0.04 percent of our  atmosphere, right. You would think it is 40 or 50 percent by the way  the hype is on that, and everybody has to change their lives in this  incredible transition as we get forced into electric cars and have our  appliances taken away, and who knows what else, as part of the Green  New Deal that is being forced upon us, indeed, by executive action  because it is not passing Congress.   So when you are looking at the American people out there, they think  of you in Washington, D.C. as the great reset. You are the spring in  the great reset button. You are not being listened to. Your pain is not  being felt by Washington, D.C.   Inflation? Oh, not a big deal. It was 8.6 percent this month, right.  Wages--though some of them have gone up for some people or are being  forced up by legislation--are being outstripped by inflation. Wages up  a little bit, inflation up a lot more.   Why? Trillions and trillions of spending and policies that take  energy options away from Americans being productive. Oh. Well, let's  get it from Russia--until we finally banned that. Let's get more from  Saudi Arabia.   Why don't we get it here? Why don't we do more here instead of  cutting off leases, cutting off permits for known reserves we have in  this country? No, no. We are going to have the incredible transition  forced upon us by these policies.   It doesn't matter what it costs. It doesn't matter what it is taking  off the table. So live with it. Inflation and wages. Let them eat cake,  as Senators drive past in an electric car, laughing at what the costs  are at the gas stations.    Well, not everybody can turn around and go buy an electric car at  $50,000 or $70,000, or even any new car right now with the way they are  living paycheck to paycheck, and it is going to be more and more so.   So what is the Federal Government's answer? Well, we are doing  something about inflation and the deficit. Yeah. Instead of borrowing  trillions and trillions, I guess by not borrowing the trillions, it  makes the deficit go lower.   So let's put things back on track, have our energy policy be one that  actually produces in the United States of America by our American  workers producing more things in the USA.   Food, for example. In my home State of California, as the water gets  cut off more and more so they can flush water out to the ocean,  hundreds of thousands of acres of food crops are being left out, not  grown.   It isn't all because of a drought. We still get lots of rainfall. We  had an incredible amount of rainfall and snow in December. Of course,  the planters decided well, we are going to go ahead and let all the  water run out through the delta in northern California instead of being  able to cut back some of it and keep it in storage, although our lakes  were at record lows last year. No, no, no. We will keep doing the  environmental thing on that, saving nonexistent fish.   In the meantime, the price for food keeps going up. In America, we  see empty store shelves in the land of plenty. It is an incredibly dumb  policy that has been put in place, piled on by energy that is almost  unaffordable.   Ask any trucker when the price of diesel has gone basically from 3  bucks a gallon to 6 or 7, even, in my home State, what does that mean?   That means all the input costs of bringing fertilizer and seed to a  field to grow your food and bringing the finished product from the  harvest to the mill and from the mill to the store shelf, it all has to  be passed along. There is no free lunch.   So we haven't even seen the full effects of this yet because in 2022,  some of the people had these inputs carried into the crop year. It  hasn't been fully felt yet.   Wait until 2023 when the price of a bale of hay, that you need in  order to feed cattle or what have you, kicks into place. Wait until  that all happens because then, chicken might triple in price from  today, beef, or maybe even just a loaf of bread.   So what are we supposed to think about that? Oh, Americans can afford  that. We can just cut back on other disposable income or disposable  items, you know, maybe less frivolous spending.   Well, is your government telling you what you can spend on?  Basically, they are dictating that by these policies, yes.   When your energy goes up, when your water gets taken away, you will  feel it all the way through, all the way through your whole economy,  and your wages will be outstripped by inflation.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, gas prices have doubled under President  Biden's failed anti-American energy policies. But I don't know which is  worse, that the national average per gallon of gas is 5 bucks or that-- in my home State of California, we would like to see 5 bucks once  again. Prices are well over $7, thanks to decades' worth of regulatory  assault on American gas in California and now at the Washington level.   While the American people are struggling to keep up financially, the  Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Transportation tell them to go  buy electric vehicles. If American families are struggling to afford  these outrageous gas prices, what makes these bureaucrats think that  they can afford a brand-new $50,000 electric vehicle? Enough of this  ``let them eat cake'' attitude.   These gas prices weren't caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They  were caused by regulatory assault on our energy industry and domestic  production being killed.   President Biden, take responsibility for your failed energy policies.  Stand down from your war on American energy, and unleash American  energy independence and help our people for a change.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Louisiana for  leading these important topics here.   There is such a broad range of things we can be talking about, but  one of the key issues that finally we got action on was the issue with  the crazy radicals that have illegally protested outside of the Supreme  Court Justices' homes, threatening them, going so far as even  implicating that they are going to have an assassination attempt on a  Supreme Court Justice.   What kind of system of government will we have if they have to worry  about whether they are going to be assaulted or even killed over doing  their job?   After weeks of twiddling their thumbs as this violence escalated,  finally, we were able to pass the Supreme Court Police Parity Act.   Meanwhile, inflation rates have skyrocketed for months, and prices on  everything are going up dramatically because of supply chain issues  that could be fixed if the administration and this Congress were  focused on the American people instead of pie-in-the-sky things like  the Green New Deal or others.   We have seen little action from the left on these issues. It looks  like we will be too busy to bring to the floor these solutions that we  have been working on in the Committee on Agriculture and others.  Instead, we get the soap opera, complete with prime time and production  from ABC News executives, otherwise known as the January 6th Select  Committee. Select what?   The hearings are being broadcasted in prime time, although the  ratings are actually going in the toilet for that, as reruns from other  programs are outstripping them, including the TV show called ``Young  Sheldon,'' which is actually kind of entertaining, I guess. What it  really shows is that viewers would rather watch paint dry than watch a  bunch of lawmakers using teleprompters in their made-for-TV drama.   We didn't need a whole partisan production when Bennie Thompson  objected to the 2004 Presidential election, and we had a Senator join  in on that, to bring that to a vote. I guess that all is different when  it is a Republican coming in.    We need to look into the security failures of the day, on January 6,  and ask the real questions that need to be asked. The select committee  is, instead, doctoring evidence, texts, and other things to make it  look like a one-sided deal. If we had balance on the committee, we  would actually be getting to ask the real questions and get down to  real solutions.   With many reviews conducted of the security vulnerabilities in the  Capitol, we have a lot to do in order to make it more secure and  something that people can have confidence in, in the process we are  supposed to have here, including on that day, January 6, when we were  supposed to constitutionally complete our work, though I had colleagues  saying: ``Are we going to actually go back in there and complete it?''  Yes, we have to do our job. We have those duties on January 6 following  each Presidential election.   Is it politics or is it solutions? Soaring gas prices; baby formula  shortages, for crying out loud; sky-high inflation; rising crime rates;  illegal aliens flooding across our border.   The only thing the Dems really want to run on is bashing President  Trump. Well, he is not President anymore. Even though he is living  rent-free inside their heads, we need to move on to something else,  getting the work done, the job done, for the American people, who are  suffering right now because of the policies and the inattention to the  details that would help them.   Let's get to work on the real things.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.    Yes.
