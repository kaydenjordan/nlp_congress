 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, over the past month, evidence has  emerged that the President of the United States pressured a foreign  leader to investigate one of his leading political rivals. A  whistleblower inside the intelligence community first raised alarms  that the President applied pressure on Ukrainian President Zelensky  that would benefit President Trump politically. The President himself  then released a memorandum of his conversation with President Zelensky,  which demonstrably validated the whistleblower's concerns.   In the weeks that followed, the House has received testimony from a  number of State Department officials who have filled in additional  pieces to this very troubling puzzle. Rudy Giuliani's efforts to dig up  dirt on the President's political rivals were well known within the  State Department and the National Security Council. The Ambassador to  the EU, Gordon Sondland, was heavily involved with Mr. Giuliani, and we  continue to receive additional information about Mr. Sondland's  participation. His scheduled testimony in the coming days will  undoubtedly be relevant and important.   Amidst all of this, the White House has engaged in stonewalling and  outright defiance of congressional prerogatives. The State Department  instructed its officials not to comply with congressional subpoenas,  the White House has refused to cooperate with the House impeachment  inquiry, and the President has publicly and repeatedly sought to bully  and intimidate the whistleblower.   As additional facts are unearthed, we have a responsibility to  consider them with the best interest of our country in mind. The  whistleblower was doing a courageous and patriotic act and must be  protected. He must be protected. The Constitution made Congress a  coequal branch of government. That role must be respected. The matter  at the heart of the inquiry concerns the very integrity of our  democratic elections, and it must be investigated thoroughly,  completely, and in a nonpartisan manner.  [[Page S5778]]    Our Founding Fathers feared foreign interference in our elections and  considered it one of the greatest threats facing our fledgling  Republic. Once again, the wisdom of the Founding Fathers shines  through. If a foreign country can meddle in or affect the outcome of  our elections, Americans will quickly lose faith in our democracy. If  Russia or China or Iran controls our elections, what the heck do we  vote for? So the alleged offense by the President is clearly serious  enough to warrant an investigation by Congress, and that is exactly  what the House of Representatives is doing in its impeachment inquiry,  and it must continue unimpeded.   We can do two things, and we must do them. We can protect the  Constitution and take action to help average working families at the  same time. Here in the Senate, we can do both: protect the Constitution  and help average working families. It is not either-or. It is not one  or the other.                            ____________________     Madam President, from the very beginning, Democrats have  been committed to doing the people's business, but while the Democratic  majority in the House of Representatives has passed hundreds of bills  dealing with healthcare, infrastructure, gun violence, climate change,  and much more, Leader McConnell has turned our Chamber into a  legislative graveyard. Not one of these bills has received a vote in  the Senate: no vote to save protections for people with preexisting  conditions, although the American people are pleading with us to do it;  no vote on bipartisan background checks, although more people die from  gun violence committed by people who shouldn't have guns; no vote on  bipartisan election security as Russia threatens us; and no vote on the  Violence Against Women Act, when abuse of women continues.   Over the course of his Presidency, President Trump has also failed to  offer proposals to address any of these pressing issues. In many cases,  his policies and his Executive actions have made things worse.   As Congress comes back into session, Senate Democrats will force our  Republican colleagues to vote during this work period on three measures  that are important to millions of Americans. These votes will occur  under the procedures of the Congressional Review Act. The Congressional  Review Act--I know the public is not familiar with the arcane parts of  these things--is one of the rare instances where the minority can force  a vote. We want to debate these other issues. We want to debate gun  violence. We want to debate healthcare. We want to debate  infrastructure. We want to debate preexisting conditions. We are not  saying our Republican friends are going to think exactly as we do, but  let's have a debate and vote. Leader McConnell, much to the discredit  of this Chamber, as well as his own, has said no, but here the  Congressional Review Act at least allows us to review some of the  overreaching actions of the executive branch and get a vote on them.   Each of these CRA votes will present our Republican colleagues with a  choice: whether to protect Americans with preexisting conditions or not  to protect them, whether to protect middle-class Americans from a tax  hike or not to protect them, and whether to fight climate change or to  do nothing.   We will also demand that our Republican colleagues take up  legislation to protect hard-earned pensions for millions of American  workers. Several of my colleagues will come to the floor this evening  to do just that. Senators Manchin, Brown, Stabenow, Peters, Smith,  Baldwin, and Tester have been real leaders on these pension issues.  Workers, who for decades put money into their pensions and thought when  they retired they would at least have some modicum on which to live  decently, will lose all that unless we act.   We hope our Republican colleagues will listen to the debate and help  us move to deal with the millions of workers struggling to preserve  their pensions.   As we continue to fulfill our solemn constitutional duty to hold the  President accountable, Democrats will not--will not--stop putting  pressure on Leader McConnell and our friends in the majority to get the  Senate back to work for the American people. Democrats will use every  tool we have--there are not that many--to stop Leader McConnell from  making the Senate a legislative graveyard when the American people need  help and action in so many ways.                            ____________________     Madam President, now on Turkey and Syria, a major issue  that deserves the Senate's attention this week and that shows we can,  again, fulfill our constitutional obligations as well as help the  American people. One thing we are going to be talking about this week  is President Trump's precipitous and dangerous decision to withdraw  from northern Syria.   A few weeks ago, the President abruptly announced that the United  States, which has long maintained a presence in northern Syria to root  out ISIS terrorists, would stand aside, and Turkey launched a military  incursion into the region. For years, a global coalition of the United  States and our partners and allies, particularly the stout Kurds in  Syria, have worked tirelessly and sacrificed much to defeat ISIS. Now,  in only a matter of days, the President's quick, unstudied, and ill- advised Syria decision has jeopardized all of that progress.   For years, American soldiers have fought hard and some have given  their lives to vanquish ISIS. For years, our great military and  diplomatic leaders have strategized about how to get rid of ISIS, and  in one fell quick and unthought-out swoop, the President has undone  that. It is despicable. It is dangerous.   The consequences have already proven dire. Bashar al-Assad, the  Syrian dictator and war criminal, has strengthened his position  greatly, cutting a deal with the Kurds and moving his forces into the  gap left by our withdrawal.   Who else has benefited from President Trump's ill-thought-out,  precipitous, and wrongheaded action? Iran, his greatest enemy, one of  our great enemies in many ways. As you know, I am no friend of the  Iranian Government.   Iran has benefited. Who else has benefitted? President Putin. Russian  troops have now swept into the region, according to reports. Russia  envies the oil in northern Syria that it might control.   When the President does some kind of action, it makes everyone  scratch their heads, and if it benefits Putin, one doesn't know if he  is doing it to actually help Putin or if he just doesn't get it. I tend  to think it is often the former, unfortunately.   Our Kurdish partners are paying the ultimate cost of their betrayal,  and tens of thousands of civilians have been displaced. Maybe most  concerning of all, reports say that more than 10,000 ISIS fighters  currently held and guarded by the Kurds could walk out of their cells.  By pulling out of northern Syria, President Trump has encouraged  nothing short of an ISIS jailbreak.   I say this to my fellow Americans. Some may say: We don't want any  troops anywhere. Bring them all home. We don't care.   Well, I care. Most people care.   But some might say: I don't care what happens to the Kurds.   The one thing everyone should care about, whatever their views on  geopolitics in the Middle East and in Syria, is our own security. We  have spent a decade of treasure and often lives rooting out ISIS. Why?  Because ISIS presents a danger to our homeland. We, in New York, know,  more than anybody, how a small group from far away could do huge damage  and kill thousands of innocent Americans here. And now President Trump,  through this thoughtless action, is allowing ISIS to gain new strength.  What is going on here? This is a threat to our own national security  here in our homeland, and we must do everything to stop it.   And who is the most angry at the President? From what I am told, our  own military is. Our own military, who have fought shoulder-to-shoulder  alongside the Kurds, watching the Kurds risk and lose their lives to  help protect Americans--they weren't even consulted. The military  wasn't even consulted. You heard what General  [[Page S5779]]  Mattis said. He may be the most respected military leader we have, even  though he is in retirement. He said: This makes it much more likely  that ISIS gains strength and can hurt us.   What the heck is going on here? This transcends any ideological  differences we may have--whether we agree with President Trump or  disagree and whether we think he is a good President or think he is an  awful President. This goes beyond that. What is going on?   After Republicans spent years criticizing our former President,  President Obama, for simply failing to recite the phrase ``radical  Islamic terror,'' then our Republican friends should be apoplectic at  what the President has done. It is not simply reciting this phrase. The  President, through his actions, whether it is inadvertent or not, has  made radical Islamic terror more real and more dangerous.   In one fell swoop, President Trump has deserted our partners,  emboldened three of our chief adversaries, provided a lifeline to ISIS  fighters who have been taken off the battlefield, and put American  troops and America in harm's way. Truly, this is one of the most  thoughtless and dangerous policy changes that President Trump could  have made. That it was made seemingly on a whim--without consulting our  military commanders, without notifying Congress, and, most egregiously,  without thinking its consequences through--makes it even more alarming.   We have entered a dangerous moment, my friends. It is increasingly  clear to everyone that the President's erratic decision making has  endangered our national security and the security of our partners and  allies around the world. Strong sanctions, while good and justified,  will not be sufficient in undoing that damage, nor will they stop the  consequences stemming from the ISIS jailbreak.   So the first step, as Congress returns, is for Democrats and  Republicans to join us in passing a resolution making clear that both  parties demand that the President's decision be reversed.   This is bipartisan, but our Republican colleagues have a special  place here because they will have far more success in getting the  President to reverse course and change his views. There is a solemn  obligation on every one of the 53 Republican Members here.   They know it is dangerous. Are they going to still be afraid to  criticize President Trump? They have not, so far, but this resolution  is the strongest action we can take.   Ultimately, of course, the only person able to immediately stop this  tragedy from unfolding is the President himself. The President made the  decision alone. He alone is responsible for its consequences. President  Trump, hopefully, importuned by Congress, Democrats and Republicans in  the House and Senate, will use this moment--must use this moment--to  step up, admit his grave mistake, and correct course.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
