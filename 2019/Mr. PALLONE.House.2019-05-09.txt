 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 986, the Protecting Americans with  Preexisting Conditions Act of 2019.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in favor of H.R. 986, the Protecting  Americans With Preexisting Conditions Act, introduced by Representative  Kuster from our committee.   This legislation should not be necessary but, unfortunately, the  Trump  [[Page H3520]]  administration continues to take actions that undermine the healthcare  of millions of Americans, including the more than 133 million people  with preexisting conditions.   Today, we are here because of the Trump administration's proposed  guidance last October that would allow States to expand and prop up  short-term junk insurance plans, even providing taxpayer subsidies for  those plans. In order to take this action, the administration blatantly  ignored the plain text of the Affordable Care Act and gutted standards  that States must meet in order to test insurance reforms.   I believe the administration's action is illegal, but, sadly, this  administration has never let the law get in the way of its goals. These  efforts will, without a doubt, seriously undermine the health coverage  of Americans with preexisting conditions.   A coalition of 24 national groups representing millions of Americans  with preexisting conditions, including the American Cancer Society  Cancer Action Network, the American Heart Association, and the American  Diabetes Association, wrote a letter in strong support of H.R. 986,  stating: ``The 1332 guidance substantially erodes the guardrails  governing coverage that people with preexisting conditions such as  cystic fibrosis, lung disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease,  diabetes, rare disorders, pregnant women, and many others rely on in  the individual marketplace.''   The patient organizations go on to say that ``these changes  fundamentally alter the nature of the section 1332 waiver program and  jeopardize adequate, affordable coverage for people with preexisting  conditions in the individual market. Halting the implementation of this  guidance will protect people with preexisting conditions.''   Mr. Chairman, by encouraging States to promote and expand short-term  insurance plans, the administration is giving insurers the green light  to directly discriminate against people with preexisting conditions; it  is giving the green light to these plans to charge people with  preexisting conditions more money; and it is giving these plans the  green light to refuse to cover any treatment that is related to  someone's preexisting condition.   The expansion of these junk plans will also undermine the insurance  market, leading to higher premiums for people with preexisting  conditions who need comprehensive coverage. This is not the way you  protect people with preexisting conditions.   The Trump administration's guidance also undermines the ACA's promise  of coverage of essential health benefits. The American people should  not have to worry about whether their insurance plan covers  prescription drugs, maternity and newborn care, mental health  and substance use disorder services.    This guidance is also bad news for older Americans who could be  charged a lot more for their insurance than what is allowed by the ACA.   In a nutshell, Mr. Chairman, this guidance is bad news for any  American who wants access to quality and affordable health coverage  that is there for them when they need it. Junk plans are just that-- they are junk.   People shouldn't have to read the fine print to see what is and is  not covered, and that is the hallmark of the Affordable Care Act. So  that is why we must rescind the guidance.   I want to commend my colleague, Ms. Kuster, for her great work on  this important bill.   I do want to emphasize that H.R. 986 would not do anything to  interfere with existing 1332 reinsurance waivers, which have bipartisan  support and began under the Obama administration. My Republican  colleagues continue to intentionally conflate these reinsurance waivers  with the Trump administration's new 1332 waiver guidance from October  of last year. H.R. 986 does not affect these reinsurance waivers.   I am disappointed that my Republican colleagues continue to make  these arguments, but the bad faith is not surprising, given their  terrible record on protecting people with preexisting conditions.   Mr. Chairman, this bill is necessary because of the ongoing assault  by the Trump administration on our healthcare system. I urge my  colleagues to join me in standing up for people with preexisting  conditions and standing up for people who want access to affordable and  quality healthcare.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                        Washington, DC, May 8, 2019.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Pallone: I am writing with respect to H.R.       986, Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act of       2019. As a result of you having consulted with us on       provisions that fall within our rule X jurisdiction, and in       recognition of the desire to expedite consideration of the       measure, the Committee on Ways and Means agrees to waive       formal consideration of H.R. 986.        The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letter on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 986.            Sincerely,                                                   Richard E. Neal,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                        Washington, DC, May 9, 2019.      Hon. Richard E. Neal,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Neal: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on Energy and Commerce and agreeing to discharge       H.R. 986, Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions       Act of 2019 from further consideration, so that the bill may       proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will ensure our letters on H.R. 986 are entered into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,                                                          Chairman.

Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Vermont (Mr. Welch), a member of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from New York (Ms. Clarke), the vice chair of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.

Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Courtney).    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time remains?    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I wanted to mention this issue of reinsurance. Some of the  Republicans have brought up the fact that in the last few years under  the Obama administration, actually before President Trump, certain  States--I believe there are eight now, including my own--applied for  1332 waivers because they wanted to put in place reinsurance programs.   I want to assure everyone that those types of waivers that are  granted for reinsurance would continue and that this legislation in no  way impacts that. Keep in mind, we are not opposed to 1332 waivers.   But pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, which I helped draft, those  waivers, when granted, have to maintain affordability and  comprehensiveness of coverage and keep the same number of people  insured as under the ACA.   When my State and others have applied for waivers for reinsurance  programs, it is because the ACA reinsurance funding was discontinued at  some point under the original bill. Those States want to, among other  things, make sure that there is competitiveness in the marketplace by  providing some kind of reinsurance or risk protection so that more  insurers come into the marketplace in those States and create more  competition and lower prices.   When you ask the Federal Government for a reinsurance waiver, you are  still maintaining affordability, probably making things even more  affordable because of competition. You are still maintaining the  comprehensiveness of the coverage because you have to provide policies  that have all the essential benefits. You are keeping the same number  of people insured. In fact, what you are probably doing is having more  people insured.   The difference between that and the section 1332 guidance that the  Trump administration is now putting forth is that none of those things  are guaranteed under the waivers that the Trump administration is  proposing with their guidance.   For one thing, they are saying you can sell a junk plan that doesn't  have hospitalization, that doesn't have essential benefits, so you  violate the section 1332 provision.   You also end up having fewer people insured because the Trump  administration says you don't have to have the same number of people  covered. All you have to do is have access.   Lastly, affordability, sure, they will argue that somehow it is more  affordable because a junk plan doesn't cost as much, but that is sort  of a misnomer because the comprehensiveness of the coverage disappears.   I want everyone to understand, a State that applies to have  reinsurance as part of their program and gets a waiver, that is in no  way impacted by what we are proposing here today with Ms. Kuster's  bill. In fact, reinsurance reinforces the very things that the 1332  waivers are seeking to guarantee.   So that is a very false bit of information that my colleagues on the  other side are trying to put out here today. I wanted to explain that.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Michigan (Ms. Slotkin).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I  am still waiting for one of our other speakers.   Mr. Chair, I want to respond to my colleague, the ranking member,  whom I respect a great deal. He has several times today, as well as in  committee and as a representative at the Rules Committee, talked about  this amendment that he has on preexisting conditions.   First of all, the reality is that the ACA guarantees people coverage  with preexisting conditions. The problem here is not that we need to  restate that, but that the section 1332 guidance that the Trump  administration has proposed would undermine it.   On its surface, Mr. Walden's amendment appears to maintain  protections for preexisting conditions, but, again, that is not the  issue because he is not getting rid of the guidance that the Trump  administration has put forward under 1332.   What does that mean? It means that even with his amendment, the Trump  administration, under their guidance, would allow insuring companies to  not offer basic services such as hospitalization, maternity coverage,  mental health, and substance abuse disorders. Insurance companies would  no longer have to offer these benefits to people with preexisting  conditions who need those benefits.   Mr. Walden's amendment also does not include prohibitions on annual  and lifetime limits, which are critical protections for individuals  with preexisting conditions. These limits, which were commonplace prior  to the ACA, are a threat to the life and health of individuals with  serious medical conditions.   The Walden amendment would also allow insurance companies to charge  women more than men and put a significant financial burden on older  Americans.   We are not interested in these half measures that would leave  Americans worse off.  [[Page H3528]]    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Harder).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, the problem is that nothing that my colleague on the  Republican side says about his amendment and nothing that is in Seema  Verma's letter will help a person with preexisting conditions.   The bottom line is this 1332 guidance that the Trump administration  has put forward allows junk plans to be sold so that people with  preexisting conditions will not get the coverage they need. They can be  charged more. They are not guaranteed that things like recisions and  lifetime limits don't go back into place.   So the problem that we face is we can't allow people with preexisting  conditions to suffer and not get coverage because they are going to be  charged more or because they are not going to get the coverage they  need by buying a junk plan.   If you really care about that and you want to make sure that people  with preexisting conditions really are guaranteed good coverage and can  afford their coverage, then you have to vote for Ms. Kuster's bill.  That is all we are saying here.   I am not saying that my colleague on the other side is not well  meaning, but nothing he has said will protect the people with  preexisting conditions from the problems with the Trump guidance. So I  would ask my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record two letters from various  nonprofit health organizations supporting the bill.                                                        May 8, 2019.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Ranking Member,      House Energy & Commerce Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Ranking Member Walden: Our 35 organizations,       representing the interests of the millions of patients and       consumers who live with serious, acute, and chronic       conditions, have worked together for many months to ensure       that patient voices are reflected in the ongoing       Congressional debate regarding the accessibility of health       coverage for all Americans and families. In March 2017, we       identified three overarching principles to guide and measure       any work to further reform and improve the nation's health       insurance system. Our core principles are that health care       must be adequate, affordable, and accessible. Together, our       organizations understand what individuals and families need       to prevent disease, manage health, and cure illness. As the       116th Congress progresses, we welcome the opportunity to work       with members on both sides of the aisle on solutions that       will preserve coverage for individuals who are currently       covered, extend coverage to those who remain uninsured, and       lower costs and improve quality for all.        Prior to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), individuals who       were in the most need of health insurance coverage--including       older and sicker Americans and people living with pre-      existing conditions--often found it difficult, if not       impossible, to obtain health insurance that provided the       coverage they needed. Many individuals were denied coverage       due to their pre-existing conditions or were charged       outrageous premiums and/or were left with inadequate benefit       packages.        Without access to comprehensive health coverage they could       afford, many patients with serious and chronic conditions       were often forced to delay or forego necessary health care.       Before the patient protections provided under the ACA, more       than half of heart patients reported difficulty paying for       their care and of those patients more than 40 percent said       they had delayed care or had not filled prescriptions.       Uninsured patients with diabetes were six times as likely to       forgo necessary medical care than those with coverage.       Uninsured patients were less likely to be screened for cancer       and more likely to be diagnosed with later stage disease       which is harder to survive and more costly to treat.        Individuals and families with pre-existing conditions rely       on critical protections in current law to help them access       comprehensive, affordable health coverage that meets their       medical needs. Unfortunately, the arguments of the plaintiffs       and the recent change of opinion by the Department of Justice       in the Texas v. U.S. case continue to represent a serious       threat to these protections. We are troubled by the argument       made by the plaintiffs and DOJ that the court must invalidate       the entire ACA due to Congress' repeal of the individual       mandate, as many provisions of the ACA directly protect       people with pre-existing conditions.        Our organizations appreciate that members of Congress share       our concerns about the potential impact of Texas v. U.S. on       people with pre-existing conditions. Several bills have been       introduced in response to this case, from H. Res. 14, which       authorized the Speaker, on behalf of the House of       Representatives, to intervene in the case of Texas v. United       States, to S. 1125, the Protect Act, and H.R. 692, the Pre-      existing Conditions Protection Act of 2019.        Some of these bills--including S. 1125 and H.R. 692--      attempt to provide protection to people with pre-existing       conditions should the ACA be invalidated. We recognize and       appreciate the sponsors' efforts, and know that in many       cases, in response to stakeholder feedback, sponsors have       revised previous drafts of these bills to offer additional       protections for consumers, including those with pre-existing       conditions. However, we remain concerned that the policies       outlined in these bills fall far short of the comprehensive       protections and coverage expansion included in current law.        As you are aware, current law requires issuers to comply       with a set of provisions that work together to promote       adequate, affordable, and accessible coverage for people with       pre-existing conditions. A holistic approach that includes--      but is not limited to--community rating, guaranteed issue,       essential health benefits, cost-sharing limits, a  [[Page H3530]]       prohibition of lifetime and annual limits, allowing young       people to stay on their parents' insurance to age 26, the ban       on pre-existing condition exclusions, and other important       provisions protect people with serious health care needs from       discriminatory coverage practices and promote access to       affordable coverage. Medicaid expansion also brought coverage       to millions of Americans who were previously uninsured, many       of whom went without vital care. These policies are       inextricably linked and repealing any of them threatens       access to critical care for people with life-threatening,       disabling, chronic, or serious health care needs.        We hope that you will keep these critical patient       protections and the interlocking functions of current law       that safeguard coverage for consumers, patients, and       individuals with pre-existing conditions at the front of your       mind during the 116th Congress. We are grateful that Congress       is committed to exploring both immediate and long-term       approaches that can be taken to shore up and strengthen the       individual insurance market and we remain ready and willing       to work with Congress to achieve that goal and provide all       Americans with the health care they need and deserve.

Re Letter of Support from 23 Patient and Consumer Advocacy           Organizations for H.R. 986.       Hon. Ann McLane Kuster,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Kuster: Our 24 organizations,       representing the interests of the millions of patients and       consumers who live with serious, acute, and chronic       conditions, have worked together for many months to ensure       that patient voices are reflected in the ongoing       Congressional debate regarding the accessibility of health       coverage for all Americans and families. Today, we write in       strong support of your legislation to protect people with       pre-existing conditions who receive coverage in the       individual marketplace. The Protecting Americans with       Preexisting Conditions Act of 2019, H.R. 986, would require       the Administration to rescind its Section 1332 State Relief       and Empowerment Waivers Guidance, released on October 22,       2018 (1332 guidance). We are concerned about the impact that       this guidance could have on the people we represent and       applaud your introduction of this bill.        In March 2017, we identified three overarching principles       to guide and measure any work to further reform and improve       the nation's health insurance system. Our core principles are       that health insurance coverage must be adequate, affordable,       and accessible. Together, our organizations understand what       individuals and families need to prevent disease, manage       health, and cure illness. Our organizations are deeply       concerned about how the new 1332 guidance will affect the       individual marketplace's stability in states that choose to       pursue some of the policies allowed under this guidance,       including those that promote short term plans and other       substandard coverage. We are pleased that this legislation       represents a significant and meaningful step towards       protecting all Americans from coverage that does not cover       what they need to promote their health and well-being.        As you know, the 1332 guidance substantially erodes the       guardrails governing coverage that people with pre-existing       conditions such as cystic fibrosis, lung disease, cancer,       cardiovascular disease, diabetes, rare disorders, pregnant       women, and many others rely on in the individual marketplace.       Of particular concern, the new guidance would allow states to       let individuals use advanced premium tax credits to purchase       non-compliant short-term, limited duration insurance plans--      which could further draw younger, healthier people out of the       risk pool for comprehensive insurance and drive up premiums       for those who need comprehensive coverage. The guidance also       eliminates protections for vulnerable populations, such as       individuals with low incomes and those with chronic and       serious health issues, by removing the requirement to       safeguard those populations under any waiver. We are deeply       concerned by this as these changes fundamentally alter the       nature of the Section 1332 waiver program and jeopardize       adequate, affordable coverage for people with pre-existing       conditions in the individual market. Halting the       implementation of this guidance will protect people with pre-      existing conditions from the repercussions of these market       destabilizing actions.        H.R. 986 represents a significant step towards protecting       patients and consumers. Yet, we also recognize that there is       much more that needs to be done to improve upon our current       system of care, including making coverage more accessible and       affordable. Up until this year, health insurance enrollment       has steadily increased, and, with it, the promise of a more       diverse risk pool and greater protection for people with       serious health care needs. However, the recent       reinterpretation of the guidelines is jeopardizing       enrollment. Shortened enrollment periods, fewer resources for       outreach and education and less funding for consumer       navigators not only creates confusion for consumers but       directly impacts the number of individuals who enroll in       Marketplace coverage. Without Congressional action, these       trends will make it harder for many to access coverage and       will further contribute to the destabilization of insurance       markets and result in higher premiums for many enrollees.        Making high-quality coverage and care more affordable is       also a high priority for the people that we represent.       Passage of legislation that expands access to and the level       of advance premium tax credits, fixes the family glitch,       creates a nationwide reinsurance program, and reduces       systemic health care costs could significantly ease the cost       burden for people of all income levels who rely on the       individual marketplace for coverage. We urge Congress to       support legislation that maintains the quality of coverage       while expanding access and affordability.        Again, thank you for your leadership on this critical issue       for people with pre-existing conditions. We support your       efforts to halt the implementation of the 2018 guidance,       ensuring the guidance from 2015 remains intact and promoting       stability in the individual marketplace. We urge members of       Congress to vote for H.R. 986.

Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I object.  [[Page H3536]]     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  gentleman from Oregon's amendment.    Mr. Chairman, it disturbs me, I guess, that my colleague  on the other side, whom I greatly respect, keeps mentioning this letter  from Seema Verma, the CMS Administrator.   Nothing that she says in her letter is in any way going to change the  guidance that she and the Trump administration have put forward that  would undermine people with preexisting conditions' ability to get good  insurance if this guidance is allowed to continue and States get  waivers pursuant to the guidance, because of, again, the issue of  affordability.   You see, the problem is that the 1332 waivers, the way they are set  out in the ACA, have certain guardrails, if you will, to prevent  waivers that would allow for junk insurance and other policies that  would undermine people with preexisting conditions from getting good  insurance.   Those guardrails say that any kind of waiver has to guarantee  affordability, has to guarantee comprehensive coverage, the essential  benefits package, robust coverage, and also not reduce the number of  people who are insured.   This guidance that Seema Verma and the Trump administration have put  forward does exactly the opposite, because it allows insurance to be  sold, if a State seeks to do so, that would eliminate, for example,  hospitalization or eliminate mental health coverage or eliminate  coverage for maternity care.   Now, if you are someone with preexisting conditions and they  eliminate coverage for your preexisting condition, that relates to your  preexisting condition, you might as well not even have insurance, and  that is why we say it is junk. It lets a waiver be granted that would  allow the insurance companies of that State to charge more based on  age, based on sex. I mean, the list goes on.   So Seema Verma can send out all the letters she wants, but it doesn't  mean anything.   I like to say, you know, one of the things that disturbs me most,  also, is we on the Democratic side, myself and some of the other  chairmen of some of the other committees, sent a letter and a request,  because it has been pointed out repeatedly that Seema Verma has been  putting out contracts up to $4 million a year to basically promote  herself, and that is being investigated right now as we speak.    So, again, I don't like to say bad things about people, but the  bottom line is she is in no position to be telling us what is in this  guidance. This guidance is going to hurt people with preexisting  conditions, and there is no way that she is going to get around it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, just to back up what I said previously  about the implications for this Trump administration and Seema Verma's  guidance that they put forward with regard to 1332, I want to read a  section from a letter that was sent by 23 patient and consumer advocacy  organizations in support of H.R. 986, the bill that is before us. These  organizations include the Heart Association, the Lung Association, the  Epilepsy Foundation, et cetera. This goes back to the guardrails.   As I said, under 1332, in the ACA, there are guardrails that say that  any waivers have to guarantee affordability, have to guarantee  comprehensiveness of coverage, and have to, at the same time, not  reduce the number of people with insurance.   Nothing that Seema Verma or anything on the other side that is being  said is suggesting in any way that, under this guidance, those  principles wouldn't be violated. In fact, they would be violated.   So this is what these 23 patient and consumer advocacy organizations  say about the Trump guidance waiver: ``This gross misinterpretation of  the guardrails will have real consequences for patients, steering  people into substandard coverage, such as short-term, limited-duration  plans and association health plans, which often do not cover the full  range of benefits and services that patients rely on to manage their  conditions.   ``Further, policies that could be implemented under this new  interpretation could fundamentally alter the risk pool for a State's  individual marketplace, making comprehensive coverage unaffordable for  patients who rely on it and jeopardizing the stability of the State's  marketplace. The resulting lack of access to care could have  devastating short- and long-term consequences for the millions of  patients we represent.''                                time  1615    The bottom line is this is going to dramatically hurt people with  preexisting conditions if they try to buy insurance that will cover the  maladies that they want to cover, and they need to have covered.   Again, I don't understand, Mr. Holding and, previously, Mr. Walden  have these amendments that really have nothing substantive to say. All  they do is talk about changing the title because they are trying to  ridicule what Democrats are trying to do here, which is to guarantee  that people with preexisting conditions are protected.   I don't want to get upset, but I think that it is kind of  inappropriate, when here we are trying to guarantee people with  preexisting conditions are protected--even Republicans on the other  side are saying that is important to them--and, instead of having a  serious debate about this, they put forward amendments that change the  title to ridicule what we are trying to do. It is just unfortunate that  we are at that point now, but that is where we are.   Madam Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, my colleagues on the other side started out  this debate on these amendments by basically saying they wanted to  substitute the title rather than talking about the substance. Now, my  colleague, the ranking member, starts talking about the lawsuit that  would--I think he is talking about the lawsuit that would repeal the  Affordable Care Act.   Again, my colleagues on the other side are not looking to protect  people with preexisting conditions, they are not looking to protect  anybody, because now they are saying that it is a  [[Page H3538]]  good idea to repeal the Affordable Care Act. So we are back to the  basic debate about whether or not we should have the Affordable Care  Act, which until President Trump came along and started sabotaging the  bill, 97 percent of Americans had health insurance, an all-time high in  the history of this country.   So, okay, that is fine. Now we are going to say that they want to  repeal the Affordable Care Act once again. This is what this is all  about on their side of the aisle: repeal the act, move to court to try  to get the courts to declare the act unconstitutional, no effort to  worry about the millions and millions of Americans who have gotten  coverage because of the Affordable Care Act.   I really don't know what else I can say at this point, but at least  they revealed their true motive, which is simply to repeal the whole  bill.   Once again, I guess there is not much to say here, other than to say  that I would urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. Let's get  back to talking about the substance of the bill that is before us,  which would guarantee that there are protections for people with  preexisting conditions.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
