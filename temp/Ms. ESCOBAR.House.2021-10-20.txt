 Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise  today to honor the life of John Ceballos, who passed away after a  lifetime of public service to our country and to El Paso.   I had the special privilege of knowing John as one of the most  dedicated leaders in our veteran community. He was the chairman of the  Benavidez-Patterson 82nd Airborne Division Association, where he  continuously created a space of support for veterans. He was a mentor  for the El Paso Veterans Courts program and would always celebrate the  accomplishments of the 82nd Airborne Division.   To know John was to know a person of strength and resilience. He  served in the U.S. Army for 8 years during the Vietnam war. After his  time in service, he went back to school where he graduated from the  University of Texas at El Paso, was bestowed a Master of Science  degree, and became an instructor for the Department of Kinesiology.   Madam Speaker, we have lost a giant in our community, and I ask you  to join me in paying tribute to the life of John Ceballos. May his  legacy of precious memories and unwavering commitment to service  continue to inspire us all.                            ____________________
