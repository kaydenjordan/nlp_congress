 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today on the Senate floor to  address an issue that is really fundamental to who we are as Americans.  It is the issue of immigration.   We just celebrated, this past week, a day dedicated to Christopher  Columbus, who, supposedly, discovered America. Of course, we know  better. Native Americans were here and discovered it before him, but he  was the first European to discover America and really triggered an  immigration to this part of the world that has really changed America  and the world forever.   This immigration from all over the world has created one of the most  diverse nations on Earth. I am a beneficiary of that immigration. My  mother was an immigrant to America in 1911, coming here from Lithuania  to East St. Louis, IL, where she was raised and where I had the chance  to grow up, as well.   Today, her son--this immigrant mother's son--has been serving as a  U.S. Senator from Illinois with humility and pride. It is an indication  of our family's story, but it is also America's story--how immigrants  came from far and wide to America and made lives and great futures and  built families that continue to serve this Nation to this day.   You would think, since immigration is such a central part of who we  are as Americans, that there would be a general consensus about the  issue, but it turns out to be one of the most hotly contested and  debated issues almost since the arrival of the Mayflower.   How many people should be allowed to come to this country? Where are  they going to come from? What will they do when they come here? What  impact will they have on those of us who are already here? All of these  questions of national security have led us into an ongoing national  debate about immigration.   Today, this morning, I come to the floor to discuss one aspect of it.  This last Sunday morning, I was back in Illinois and was invited to a  Democratic Party event in Schaumburg, IL. It was a fairly routine  breakfast meeting of the Democratic township organization. I have been  to many of them. It is great to see old friends.   When I arrived at the event, I was surprised to see demonstrators,  protesters--perhaps 200 of them--holding signs with my name on them. It  is not exactly the way you want to start a Sunday morning, greeting 200  people with signs about this fellow named Durbin. I had a chance to  talk to them. I didn't run away from them because I wanted to find out  who they were and why they were there.   By and large, they were people from India who are currently living in  the United States and want to become legal citizens here. Most of them  came to the United States bringing special skills that were needed.  Many of them are in the Silicon Valley high-tech industries--engineers  who came to the United States once companies certified that they  couldn't find an American to fill the job, which is a requirement.  Having been unable to find an American, these companies asked  permission to bring in these highly skilled people from India to serve  as engineers in the United States.  [[Page S5811]]    They come in on what is known as H-1B visas, by and large, and that  allows them to work in the United States for several years and to renew  that work status on a recurring basis. But there reached a point where  they wanted to stay here. They have lived here awhile. They bring their  families and raise their families here, and they want to become part of  America's future. They apply for what is known as an employment-based  immigrant visa, which leads to a green card. A green card is the ticket  to legal, permanent residency, which can lead to citizenship.   So these people from India, who were waiting to see me and say a few  words to me, stated the fact that the waiting list for those in this  category from India has now passed 520,000. There are 520,000 who are  seeking permanent status in our country.   I met one of them from my hometown of Springfield, IL, a young Indian  physician who is serving at one of our hospitals in Springfield. He  brought with him his daughter. His daughter is 12 years old. He is  worried because if he, the physician who came here to work from India,  is not allowed to legally stay in this country and his daughter reaches  the age of 21, her status changes. She is no longer his dependent. She  now has her own immigration status, and she is not technically,  legally, beyond the age of 21, allowed to stay in this country.   So he says to me: Here is my daughter, who has been here for 10  years. This is the country she knows and loves and wants to be a part  of, and if I don't get approval to stay as a doctor in this country,  she is technically undocumented at that point, and we run into problems  with the future.   For example, it is no surprise that this doctor wants to see his  daughter go to college. Well, his daughter, undocumented, will not  qualify for any assistance in the United States by way of Pell grants  or loans. How is she going to pay for college? Where would she go? Our  immigration system says, at that point, if her father doesn't reach  this green card status, she would return to India, a place she maybe  never remembers and that was part of her infancy in her early time here  on Earth.    So it is a complicated situation. There is a debate under way here  about how to stop this backlog of people who are waiting in line 10  years, 20 years, and more to reach green card status. You can imagine  the uncertainty in their lives, the uncertainty for their children, and  why they are looking for some relief.   I came to this issue never dreaming that I would end up being in the  middle of most debates in the Senate on immigration, but I welcome it  because it is such an important issue and because I have strong  feelings myself about America's immigration policy.   I serve as the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Border Security  and Immigration for the Senate Judiciary Committee. As I have said, my  own personal family and life experience have really made me warm to the  subject, and I try to learn as much as I can about a complex field.  Make no mistake, the immigration system of the United States of America  is badly, badly broken. How to fix it is hotly debated here in the  Senate and in the House and across the Nation.   Last night, when I was watching the Presidential debates, groups were  running ads on a regular basis on the issue of immigration. Many  believe that it is going to be a hot topic in the 2020 election. It is  quite possible that it will be. We know that in State legislatures and  city halls, on cable news and social media, and almost everywhere,  there is a debate under way about immigration. But there is one place  where there is no debate about immigration--here in the U.S. Senate.   This year, we had one hearing in the Border Security and Immigration  Subcommittee. And the Senate Judiciary Committee voted on only one  immigration bill. The chairman limited debate to only one hour and  didn't allow any amendments, and we have not had any debates on the  floor of the Senate.   I look to the Galleries and the people who come to the Senate and  expect to see a debate on an issue--an important issue. Here is one:  immigration. But all they have is a speech from this Senator and a few  others, instead of addressing the issue of immigration.   Senator Kennedy has come to the floor, and I am going to make a  unanimous consent request in just a few minutes. He is a member of the  Senate Judiciary Committee, too, and I think he appreciates, as I do,  what a great honor it is to serve on this storied committee. But the  fact is that to have the titles of Judiciary Committee and Border  Security and Immigration Subcommittee and to do nothing, I think, is a  dereliction of duty.   We are supposed to step up and debate these things and come to the  best bipartisan conclusion we can to solve problems in this country.  Here is a problem we are not solving: how to deal with a backlog of  people, highly skilled and important people, like the doctor from my  hometown of Springfield, from India, who wants to have a green card,  giving him an opportunity to become an American citizen.   Do you know what? I want that doctor to become an American citizen. I  want him to get a green card. We need him in my hometown and many more  just like him, and I want his family to be there with him so that his  life is complete as he pursues his professional responsibilities.   Now, in recent weeks, there has been an effort to pass a bill to  address this issue. The bill is S. 386. It is known as the Fairness for  High-Skilled Immigrants Act. Unfortunately, there was an effort to pass  it without any debate or a chance to even offer an amendment.   Now, this bill makes significant changes in our immigration laws, but  there has never been a hearing on the bill or a vote in the committee.  The lead sponsor of the legislation is Mike Lee, who is the senior  Senator from Utah and a personal friend. He has negotiated several  amendments in private with his Republican Senators, but there has been  no conversation with myself or any other Democratic Senators about  these negotiations.   That is not how the Senate should work. I believe I have seen the  Senate at its best, and, unfortunately, it was 7 years ago. We  decided--eight of us in the Senate, four Democrats and four  Republicans--to actually sit down and try to fix the immigration  system. It is a pretty ambitious task, but we had some pretty talented  people engaged in it. Leading on the Republican side was John McCain  from Arizona. Next to him was Lindsey Graham from South Carolina, Jeff  Flake from Arizona, and Marco Rubio from Florida.   On our side, I was engaged with Senator Chuck Schumer, who is now the  Democrat Senate leader, as well as Bob Menendez, of course, a Hispanic  Senator from the State of New Jersey, and Michael Bennet from Colorado.   So the eight of us came together. We did what I think the Senate is  supposed to do. We sat down and took our time and spent months, every  single week, sometimes several evenings each week, going through a  different section of our immigration law and trying to make it work,  reform it, and change it. It took us months--some 6 months of meetings.  That is what we are elected to do.   We produced a comprehensive immigration reform bill that was  supported by virtually everyone. Groups of business leaders, as well as  groups of labor leaders, the church community, and all sorts of people  from the conservative side of politics to the liberal side of politics  said that this was a good, fair, bipartisan compromise.   So in 2013, we reported this bill to the floor, after our Democratic  Judiciary Committee chairman at that time, Patrick Leahy from Vermont,  had a lengthy hearing. We considered over 100 amendments--amendments  offered by those who were voting against the bill, like Jeff Sessions  from Alabama, and amendments offered by those supporting the bill, like  Mazie Hirono from Hawaii. Each person offered an amendment, debated it,  and we voted. It sounded like the U.S. Senate; didn't it? We were  actually voting on amendments on a critically important bill. Thanks to  Chairman Leahy's skill and patience, I might add, after hundreds of  amendments were considered, the bill was reported out of the Senate  Judiciary Committee, came to the floor of the Senate in 2013, and we  called for a vote. It passed 68 to 32. After all that work, on a  bipartisan basis, we finally got it right. I thought we did, and I  voted for it.    Sadly, that bill was sent across the Rotunda, over to the House of  Representatives, as the Constitution requires, and, unfortunately, the  Republican Speaker, John Boehner, refused  [[Page S5812]]  to call the bill or debate an alternative to it. It literally died from  lack of any effort to deal with the issue in the U.S. House of  Representatives.   So one would ask--that was more than 6 years ago--what has happened  since? The answer is nothing--virtually nothing--except decisions by  the Trump administration, for example, to eliminate some aspects of our  immigration law, like the DACA provision.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.    In light of an attempt to pass the Fairness for High- Skilled Immigrants Act without hearings or debate, I come to the floor  today to present an alternative. I am introducing the Resolving  Extended Limbo for Immigrant Employees and Families Act, known as the  RELIEF Act, which will treat all immigrants fairly by eliminating  immigrant visa backlogs.   One of the most serious problems of our immigration system is that  there are not enough immigrant visas, known as green cards. As a  result, immigrants are stuck in crippling backlogs for decades. Close  to 4 million future Americans, many of whom already live and work in  the United States, are on the State Department's immigrant visa waiting  list. However, under current law, only 226,000 family green cards and  140,000 employee green cards are available each year. Children and  spouses of lawful permanent residents, known as LPRs, count against  these caps, which further limit the number of available green cards.   The backlogs are a tremendous hardship on families caught in this  situation. Children of parents waiting to become LPRs often age out, as  I described earlier, because they are no longer children by the time  the green cards are available for them. The solution is clear: increase  the number of green cards.   Let's be clear. Lifting green card country caps alone, without  increasing green cards, as the bill that Senator Lee is sponsoring  would do, will not eliminate the backlog for Indian immigrants, the  nationality with the most people in the employment backlog, and it will  dramatically increase backlogs for the rest of the world.   Mr. Ira Kurzban, who is the Nation's expert on immigration laws, has  said that we are virtually trying to solve the problem with Senator  Lee's bill for Indian immigrants at the expense of everyone else in the  world. He says:         From 2023 until well into the 2030s, there will be zero EB-      2 visas for the rest of the world. None for China, South       Korea, Philippines, Britain, Canada, Mexico, every country in       the [European Union] and all of Africa. Zero.    It would also choke off green cards for every important profession  that isn't in the information technology field.   More than 20 national organizations have now rallied against the Lee  legislation and have said things such as that the bill offers a ``zero- sum approach,'' pitting one group of immigrants against another to  fight the broken immigration system.   The RELIEF Act, which I am introducing today, is a solution.    Madam President, as in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration--    I am making a unanimous consent request.   As in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2603, introduced earlier  today; further, that the bill be considered read three times and passed  and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    I thank my colleague from Louisiana. We have worked on  things together, and I hope we will continue to do so in the future.   This is controversial, but it is so timely and important. The  hundreds of people who demonstrated against this Senator last Sunday  were people I welcomed into this country and believe will be an  important part of our future. I am willing to find a solution to the  problem, and I am willing to work on a bipartisan basis to do it. Your  help will be invaluable.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet),  the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker), the Senator from California  (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Hawaii (Ms. Hirono), the Senator from  Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and  the Senator from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.
