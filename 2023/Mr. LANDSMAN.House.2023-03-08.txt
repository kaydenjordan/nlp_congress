 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to ensure that this debate  is placed in an honest and important historical context.   In the 1930s and early 1940s, Hitler needed America out of his war.  He used propaganda in this country to divide us and to keep us out of  his war in Europe.   Pro-Hitler propaganda was all over the country, and it reached this  body. We know this now. Members of Congress were in on it.   As a Jew, this is frighteningly similar to what is happening today.   One year ago, a new foreign adversary invaded Eastern Europe. Putin,  like Hitler, wants us divided and isolated from his war. We must be  clear-eyed about pro-Putin propaganda and who and why some  intentionally, and others unintentionally, are promoting his will.   Why are we being asked to ban American officials from trying to stop  propaganda from foreign adversaries like Putin?   Why are some proposing we leave Syria, which Putin wants?   Why is the call to abandon Ukraine continuing to emerge from some  Members?   Remember, Hitler did this. He used Americans to spread his  propaganda, and it cost millions their lives. Putin is doing the same  thing.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 140 and to call out any  and all attempts to promote Putin's propaganda and will.   At the appropriate time I will offer a motion to recommit this bill  to committee.   If the House Rules permitted, I would have offered the motion with an  important amendment to the bill. The amendment would have delayed  implementation of the bill until Federal agencies reported to Congress  that this bill would have no negative impact on lawful activities to  combat speech that incites violence, discriminatory speech, or domestic  terrorism.   The bill as drafted is very unclear on those points. As I and my  colleagues have pointed out, if passed, H.R. 140 will encourage the  spread of foreign propaganda. It will also promote hateful, harmful,  and violent content online, undermine democracy, and make us less safe.   We clearly need more information about the effects this bill would  have on speech that incites violence, discrimination, domestic  terrorism, and Federal agencies, including the Department of Justice  and the intelligence community, are best positioned to provide that  information. These critical issues must be addressed before this bill  is implemented.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record the text of my amendment.        Add at the end the following:       SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE; REPORT ON NEGATIVE EFFECTS.         This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall not take       effect until the date that the head of each employing agency       has submitted a report to Congress confirming that this Act       and the amendments made by this Act will have no negative       effect on lawful activities to combat--        (1) speech that incites violence;        (2) discriminatory speech; or        (3) domestic terrorism.
