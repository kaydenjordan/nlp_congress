 Mr. President, we are here today to pass the NDAA, the  National Defense Authorization Act. It has just passed the procedural  vote so we are ready for the vote that is going to take place tomorrow.   It is the 59th year in a row that we will be passing the NDAA, and  that is because it is the most important bill Congress will be doing  all year and one that fulfills our constitutional responsibilities, and  that is to defend America.   There is a document nobody reads anymore that is called the  Constitution. If you read that document, it tells you what we are  supposed to be doing here, which is providing for the common defense  or, simply put, defending America and all who call it home.   This conference report does exactly that. It is a testament to the  good work we can accomplish when we work together, and I am talking  about Democrats and Republicans of both parties in the House and  Senate. The bill has been a long time coming. We started working on it  last January, 11 months ago, holding hearings with military leaders  about what resources they needed around the world. We started drafting  it not long after, and in May we passed the bill out of our committee.  We passed the bill out of committee by a 25-to-2 vote. That doesn't  happen very often on big bills.   In June, we debated on the floor and incorporated more than 90  bipartisan amendments before it passed with an overwhelming bipartisan  vote of 86 to 8. Then we started the conference where we have been  working day in and day out since September. This year, we had twice the  number of Big 4 meetings. Now, Big 4 meetings are with a Democrat and  Republican from both the House and Senate getting together to iron out  some of these problems, and there were a lot of problems with this  bill. Anytime we have 90 bipartisan amendments we are considering while  putting the bill together, that is a big deal. We had twice the number  of Big 4 meetings and more than twice the number of staff-level  meetings that we normally have working our way through over 1,500  provisions within the bill.   I say this to remind everyone that our committee and staff have been  working on this bill tirelessly for nearly a full year, and now we are  going to pass it. If I had to break it down, I would say this year's  NDAA has two big overarching principles. First, it resources and aligns  priorities to implement the blueprint for the National Defense Strategy  Commission. This is it, the publication here, and this was put together  by Democrats and Republicans a few years ago, laying out exactly what  we have to have to adequately defend America.   We follow this blueprint. We are still following it today, and it is  working. This bipartisan document outlines the challenges we need to be  prepared to meet, namely, strategic competition with China and Russia.  This is something--and I don't say this critically of the previous  administration, but President Obama's priorities were not the same as  the priorities we normally had. It was not defending America. There  were other projects he was concerned with, and as a result of this, if  you take the last 5 years from 2010 to 2015, the amount of money going  to the military from President Obama's budget was reduced in that 5- year period by 25 percent. Keep in mind, while that was reduced by 25  percent, China was increasing their spending by 83 percent. That has  never happened before.   Accordingly, the conference report funds the military at $738  billion, in line with the bipartisan agreement I just described. So we  are sticking with that. It is a good thing when you get a chance to get  everyone together. There is always partisanship and all that, but when  you get an outline like this, it is something that has worked and  worked well.   In addition, the NDAA authorizes $5.3 billion in emergency disaster  recovery to help military installations. Occasionally, we have natural  disasters. We had them in Nebraska, Florida, and North Carolina that  inflicted great damage on our military bases in those areas.   The Space Force is the President's big deal. It will help protect  space and ensure America's dominance in this warfighting domain for  years to come. It is interesting also. There are those who are  criticizing it, and I had some reluctance at first because we are doing  a good job in space. We have been doing a pretty good job in space for  quite a while, but it is not all in one area. There is a psychological  component. Our chief problems out there are China and Russia. China and  Russia have their own space dominance in this Space Force, and just the  fact that we don't have one is something that made people believe we  didn't have an interest in the Space Force, and we are going to  dominate Space Force. This is the first time we will have a new branch  in government in over 70 years. The Space Force will help us protect  space and ensure American dominance in the warfighting domain for years  to come.   To implement the national defense strategy, the NDAA reframes its  priorities. It accelerates investment in efforts to modernize our Armed  Forces, including creating hypersonic weapons, 5G, cyber, long-range  missiles, and areas where we are at risk.   I mention the hypersonic weapons. That is the state of the art and  what we are doing right now. Prior to the last administration, we were  ahead in hypersonic weapons. At the end of that administration years  later, China and Russia were ahead. Now we are catching up. We are  going to pass them. This bill is going to be a way to do this.   The NDAA has strong support for nuclear modernization, preserving all  three legs of the triad to maintain maximum deterrence against our  adversaries. Our triad has been controversial for a long time, but it  has worked, and there are some who would like to drop it down to just  two forces as opposed to three, but we want to make sure we have the  best. We want to make sure we can win in a nuclear battle.   It also provides needed reforms to the way the Department of Defense  does business. An efficient, effective Pentagon will help America  retain and, in some cases, regain the competitive edge. We don't have  the competitive edge around the world.    I talk to people around the country. They always assume that America  has the best of everything, and there was a time when we did. I think  ever since World War II we were in that situation, but we have lost  some of that edge, and this is what we are going to do; we are going to  regain it.   The legislation also keeps President Trump's promise to continue  rebuilding the military. The legislation invests its equipment,  resources, and training needed to restore American readiness. These  investments mean we will have a larger Army, larger Navy, a more agile  Air Force and a more lethal Marine Corps--a force that is ready to  deter or, if necessary, defeat any threats that might come our way.   That is something a lot of people think is extreme, but we are used  to that. We learned our lesson in World War II. We have gone through  several conflicts since that time, and we are not going to allow that  to happen again. We are going to keep all of these forces strong. That  is what the bill does to rebuild our military and realign to be able to  compete with Russia and China.   You go through and see the changing scenes all around the world. You  go to the South China Sea and see China building islands out there. It  is as if they are preparing for World War III, and some of our allies  in that part of the world are wondering what we are doing. They don't  see us out there, but we are. Now this bill puts us back in the  running.   I said this bill does two main things. The second part is the bill  really looks out for our servicemembers and their families. To tell the  story of what we do in that area is really to tell the story of two  courageous military spouses. Those two military spouses are Janna  Driver and Jane Horton.   I have had the honor of knowing both of these women who represent  hundreds of thousands of military spouses around the country. About 1  year ago,  [[Page S7044]]  Janna Driver reached out to me because she had housing. This all  started with privatizing housing. We privatized housing and everything  went right for a few years and things started dropping down. People got  greedy. We had 14 contractors that were busy doing this.   Janna Driver was from Tinker Air Force Base. I had the honor of  knowing her well because she came to me and reached out to me to share  the horrible conditions she and her family were facing in their housing  at Tinker Air Force Base.   Let's back up a little. Privatized housing was something that was  working, but things started slipping. Right now, we have done a lot of  work with that. She told me about the mold in her unit, and she  couldn't get a contractor to fix it. We are talking about 1 of the 14  contractors that got the awards. We started looking into the problem  and learned it was bigger than we thought. When Janna Driver came to  me, we thought it was just at Tinker Air Force Base, but after that we  found other places in Oklahoma. We have five major military  establishments in Oklahoma, and we found they were all having some of  these problems. Then I found out this was all over the Nation. So this  was a serious problem she called to our attention.   We got to work, holding hearings and inspecting homes and demanding  answers. As a result, the NDAA includes a landmark overhaul of the  military privatized housing system. The legislation gives military  families the tools to demand accountability, and reengages military  leadership. It is only natural that a lot of the military leadership  would say: Well, we privatized it. Now it is their problem, not our  problem. They kind of stepped aside. Well, they are back in the fight  again to make sure contractors live up to their end of the bargain and  give military families high-quality housing. That was my experience  with Janna Driver.   Then there was Jane Horton. I mentioned there were two heroes I  learned to love over the years. In an event in Collinsville, OK, a  little bit north of Tulsa, we had a townhall meeting over there, and I  was getting ready to go to Afghanistan. This happened about 7 years  ago. Jane Horton was there, the wife of someone who was in the  military. As I was getting ready, and I mentioned I was going to go to  Afghanistan, she told me her husband Chris was deployed there. I  promised her I would visit with him while I was there in about a week's  time. I never got that chance because Oklahoma Army National Guard SPC  Chris Horton was killed on September 9, 2011. He was only 26 years old.   After everything Jane Horton went through after losing her husband,  she was then penalized by what we refer to as the ``widow's tax''--a  dollar-for-dollar offset of benefits as a Gold Star spouse. She came to  me, and we started working on it together to repeal it. Years after we  restarted the process, this year's NDAA repeals the widow's tax in a  fiscally responsible way. It does it over a period of time that is  going to be doable.   That is a fraction of the benefits it has for military families. The  conference report provides a 3.1-percent pay raise for all troops. It  is the largest pay raise we have had in a decade. The bill also  improves access to childcare on military installations.   It helps spouses transfer their professional licenses. Here is a  problem people don't realize we have, and it is that the military  member is going to be moved around every 2 or 3 years. When that  happens, the spouse will go with the military member, but that spouse  may be a trained professional and working as a second worker in the  household. The problem is, there are a lot of States where nurses, for  example, if the spouse is a nurse, they have to wait for 1 or 2 years'  residency before they can actually practice in the State.   Those are little things that nobody really thought of, and it is kind  of discriminatory against our military. So that problem is not going to  exist anymore.   The bill continues critical reforms to fight sexual assault--we hear  a lot about sexual assault--and misconduct and works to improve the  military healthcare system. This bill does a lot.   I have heard people say--there are people around, people who are  actually in this body who don't really think we have a real obligation  to spend so much time and money on our military. In fact, I have heard  people say so many times: Well, wait a minute. The United States spends  more money than China and Russia put together. That is true, but you  have to realize why that is.   We were just talking about housing. You know, China and Russia are  communist countries. They don't care about helping people with housing.  They don't care about healthcare for their people. All they do is give  them an AK-47 to go out and kill people. The vast majority of what we  spend on our military is spent on our people; other countries don't do  that. They say you recruit a servicemember, but you retain a family by  making our NDAA dedicated not only to the warfighter but also to their  families.   Lastly, there are a few other provisions outside of the jurisdiction  of the Armed Services Committee, and they are worth highlighting in  this bill. This has been happening now for 59 years. One of the reasons  is that this is a bill that everybody knows is going to pass. I had  doubts this year that it definitely was going to pass, but it did. A  lot of people have difficulty getting something passed during the  regular session but wait until the Defense authorization bill comes up,  and then they will put it on there as an amendment. We have a lot of  examples.   There is the MARAD authorization. That is the maritime authorization.  Senator Wicker from Mississippi put that in. He is the chairman of the  Commerce Committee. Then we had the intelligence reauthorization.  Senator Burr is the chairman of that committee. We have that as a part  of this bill. Sanctions designed to punish Syria, Russia, North Korea,  China, and all those countries, that would really be in the Foreign  Relations Committee. Senator Risch is the chairman of that committee.  It is in this bill.   So the result is this is a good bill, and now we are going to pass  it. This is the 59th year in a row we have passed the NDAA. It is one  of the few authorization bills that passes year after year, and that is  because everyone knows how important it is. It usually doesn't get  bogged down in partisan fighting.   This year, the process of getting to our final conference report was  certainly tougher than most years. The first bill that came out of the  House, there wasn't one Republican who voted for it on the floor, and  they ended up supporting it. That is the way it happened this year.  There were some moments we weren't sure we were going to be able to get  one. It took a few months of hard-fought negotiations, but the end  result is getting a bill that we are proud of.   I thank Congressman Smith and Congressman Thornberry from the House  and, most importantly, Senator Reed. Senator Reed is my counterpart. I  am the chairman of the committee, and he is the ranking member of the  committee. We worked together, and I am talking about hours and hours.  My wife and I have been married now 60 years tomorrow. I saw more of  Senator Reed during this time than I saw my own wife. We had a lot of  time together working on things. We worked together on the  controversial things, and they worked. We were successful.   I also thank the members of the Armed Services Committee who put in  good work to make sure the bill supports the military community and  keeps America safe. I want to thank President Trump for his leadership  in support of the legislation, especially the Space Force. I look  forward to him signing this into law immediately.   I would be remiss if I didn't thank the Armed Services Committee  staff, especially the staff directors John Bonsell, for the majority;  Liz King, for the minority; and my personal staff, who have worked  countless hours to bring this bill to the floor today. Also under them,  from the majority, we have 33 members of the Senate Armed Services  Committee, and I think 15 members from the minority. That is a total of  48 members.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record all 48 names of  those heroes who participated.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         From my staff from the Senate Armed Services Committee:       John Wason, Tom Goffus, Stephanie Barna, Greg Lilly, Rick  [[Page S7045]]       Berger, Marta Hernandez, Jennie Wright, Adam Barker, Augusta       Binns-Berkey, Al Edwards, Jackie Kerber, Sean O'Keefe, Tony       Pankuch, Brad Patout, Jason Potter, J.R. Riordan, Katie       Sutton, Eric Trager, Dustin Walker, Otis Winkler, Gwyneth       Woolwine, Katie Magnus, Arthur Tellis, Leah Brewer, Debbie       Chiarello, Gary Howard, Tyler Wilkinson, John Bryant, Patty-      Jane Geller, Baher Iskander, Keri-Lyn Michalke, Jackie       Modesett, Soleil Sykes.        And from the minority: Jody Bennett, Carolyn Chuhta, Jon       Clark, Jonathan Epstein, Jorie Feldman, Creighton Greene,       Ozge Guzelsu, Gary Leeling, Kirk McConnell, Maggie McNamara,       Bill Monahan, Mike Noblet, John Quirk, Arun Seraphin, Fiona       Tomlin.     From my personal staff, we had Luke Holland, Andrew  Forbes, Dan Hillenbrand, Jake Hinch, Don Archer, Kyle Stewart, Bryan  Brody, Esther Salters, Devin Barrett, Leacy Burke, Wendi Price, Laurie  Fitch, Whitney Folluo, Mark Powers, Brandon Ellis, and Charlotte  Mitchell.   And the floor staff, they are always back there. They work on all the  bills, but they dropped everything to make this a reality: Laura Dove,  Robert Duncan, Chris Tuck, Megan Mercer, Tony Hanagan, Katherine  Foster, Brian Canfield, and Abigail Baker.   Now, let's vote on this conference report, and let's have the vote be  so overwhelming that there isn't a military family in America who could  doubt our commitment to them. Let's use our vote to send a message as  well to Russia and China that we are revitalizing American power so we  can win the competition for influence that will shape the kind of world  our children and grandchildren are going to live in.   Kay and I have 20 kids and grandkids. They are the ones I am  concerned about, as well as your kids and grandkids. We are not going  to win with a strong military alone, but we will lose without one. That  is what this NDAA will do: revitalize American military power so we can  achieve our vision of a safe, prosperous, and free world. That is what  this is all about. That is what we are going to do.   Merry Christmas.   I yield the floor.
