 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the SUPPORT  for Patients and Communities Act.   Mr. Chair, I want to thank Chairman Walden and the entire Energy and  Commerce Committee for their work on this important legislation. The  SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act is yet another bipartisan  effort aimed at preventing further opioid abuse and assisting those  currently dealing with this addiction.   This legislation will strengthen our efforts to advance treatment and  recovery initiatives, improve prevention, protect our communities, and  bolster the fight against deadly illicit drugs.   We have made meaningful progress in our fight against the opioid  epidemic throughout the country by passing more than 50 bills in the  House, but our work is far from over.   No community is immune from this crisis. In 2016 alone, more than  1,300 Georgians lost their lives to opioid abuse. Many of them in my  community, my closest friends, have had to deal with this.   Our Senate colleagues should take note of this important work that we  have done here in the House over the past 2 weeks to combat the opioid  crisis, and I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 6.
