 Mr. President, I applaud the remarks of our distinguished  majority leader, and I know it comes from the heart because what he is  saying publicly, he has also always said both publicly and privately.  And I also join with him in the condemnation of the attack on the  synagogue this weekend.   I know, in my State of Vermont, the faith community--the Jewish,  Protestant, Catholic--all came together with prayers for the safety of  the people in the synagogue. But more than just the safety of what  happened then, let us pray, all of us, whatever faith we have, that  such attacks do not continue in our country.   We have seen too many attacks against people based on their religion  or based on their race or based on their country of origin. That is  wrong.   In this country, in this country, especially--I was thinking of this  when I led the Senate this morning in the Pledge of Allegiance, and I  thought, ``[O]ne nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and  justice for all.'' Well, it is a constant battle to make sure that we  have liberty and justice for all, and we have to do that.                            ____________________
