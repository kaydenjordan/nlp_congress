 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin) for yielding me the time and for his leadership on the Rules  Committee.   Madam Speaker, something has been happening over the last few  decades. Power meant to be held in these Halls, granted to us by the  Constitution, intentionally given to us by our Founders, has ended up  instead in the hands of whoever sat in the Oval Office.   It wasn't stolen by any particular President. No, Madam Speaker. We  gave it away.   Congresses run by both parties surrendered it to Democratic and  Republican administrations alike year after year after year.   Nowhere is this more pronounced than when it comes to matters of war  and peace. Make no mistake, the Constitution is clear on this: The  President may be Commander in Chief, but only Congress has the power to  declare war. It is right there in Article I, Section 8.   But we abdicated that responsibility. We have been too content to  stand on the sidelines and watch as wars were crafted and carried out  by the White House with virtually no input from the people's House.   Our troops, the very people we represent, have received orders to  deploy. Taxpayer dollars have been shoveled overseas. Policies have  changed from one administration to the next. But too often, Congress  remained silent, not because we were too engaged on other urgent  matters, but because we feared the political risk of a vote.   Many of our colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, have tried to force  debates and votes. I have joined many of my colleagues, from Adam Smith  and Barbara Lee and Ro Khanna to   Tom Cole and Walter Jones and Matt  Gaetz.   In fact, I have stood here more than two dozen times and pleaded for  the chance to vote on many conflicts, like Afghanistan, Iraq, and  Syria.   Too often, these simple calls for debate were ignored, but these are  precisely the issues our constituents sent us here to debate, the hard  ones, the ones where lives are at stake.   Now, I don't care who is President. I don't care who controls the  House. When our troops are ordered to engage, they do not do so  casually. And once they are deployed, it is not easy for them to  withdraw. We all know this. Wars are easy to start but are very, very  hard to end.   This is why how they begin is the most crucial decision. It cannot be  left to one person. The Constitution enshrines that power in our hands,  the people's representatives, the people's voice, and the people's  House.   Today, Madam Speaker, the process of reclaiming that authority  begins. This rule contains two measures.   The first is a resolution from Congresswoman Lee to repeal the 2002  Iraq  [[Page H583]]  AUMF. For nearly two decades, this AUMF has been used by multiple  Presidents to unilaterally engage our troops in conflicts that Congress  never imagined when it was first passed.   It was used to justify the recent strike against Iranian General  Soleimani.   If you think the consequences are limited, bear in mind that 34 more  of our troops now suffer from traumatic brain injuries from Iran's  retaliatory strike.   Pay attention to the words of Marine General Frank McKenzie, U.S.  commander in the Middle East, who told our troops on Thursday that  20,000 newly deployed troops to the region could be there for ``quite a  while.''   Repealing this AUMF isn't just about ensuring that this President  cannot use it as justification for asserting military force without  proper congressional authorization. This vote is about ensuring that  no President can.    The second item included in this rule is legislation from Congressman  Khanna to prohibit funding for military action against Iran that is not  authorized by Congress.   The situation with Iran remains volatile. If tensions should escalate  again and President Trump wants to use military force, he must come to  Congress first, period.   These measures passed overwhelmingly as bipartisan amendments to the  House-passed NDAA bill last year. These are not new items or new ideas.  Unfortunately, both were stripped out of the bill in final conference.   It is my hope that this House will again approve these measures and  that the Senate will recognize the urgency of their passage.   Madam Speaker, I have heard a lot of talk about what it means to  support our troops. Let me just say this: We respect their service when  we give them an honest, thoughtful debate about their sacrifice, about  possible deployments that impact not only them but their families and  their loved ones.   Members of our military put their lives on the line for this country.  The least we can do is have the guts to vote on their fate.   Let's respect our troops. Let's respect this institution. Let's  finally get back to respecting the Constitution, doing our jobs, and  voting on issues of war and peace.   I have to tell you, I am just sick and tired of hearing excuse after  excuse, not only now, but over the last several years, from my  colleagues as to why we can't have these debates, why we can't vote on  these issues.   Madam Speaker, it is time now for my colleagues to support the rule  and the underlying measure.                                time  1300     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and  for his advocacy on behalf of this issue.   And the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I am  delighted to be here with him, and I want to thank him for his work on  this.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4331, the Tibetan  Policy and Support Act. I am proud to have introduced this legislation  with Congressman Chris Smith of New Jersey and with Senators Rubio and  Cardin in the Senate.   I thank Chairman Engel and Ranking Member McCaul for their strong  support of this bill and, more importantly, for their tireless  leadership in support of the human rights of the Tibetan people.                                time  1430    Madam Speaker, our bill updates and strengthens the Tibetan Policy  Act of 2002 to address the challenges facing the Tibetan people.  Perhaps as importantly, it reaffirms America's commitment to the idea  that human rights matter, that we care about those who are oppressed,  that we stand with those who are struggling for freedom, and that we  have a moral obligation to do something when we see something that is  not right.   It should be clear that we support a positive and productive U.S.- China relationship, but it is essential that the human rights of all  the people of China are respected by their government.   Unfortunately, the human rights situation in Tibet has gotten much  worse. The Chinese Government has refused to enter into genuine  dialogue with Tibetan leaders. Restrictions on access to Tibet, both  for Tibetans and foreigners, have been tightened. International  journalists have stated that the isolation of Tibet is as bad as North  Korea, allowing human rights abuses and environmental degradation to be  concealed from the outside world.   Last year, the Congress passed the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act to  demand that American journalists, diplomats, and tourists be given the  same freedom to travel to Tibet that Chinese officials have to travel  freely in America. I hope to see a report from the State Department,  which was due in December, describing the steps that the administration  has taken to implement this policy over the last year.   In addition, the Chinese Government has used advanced technology to  intensify security and surveillance.   It has ratcheted up its so-called anti-crime and vice campaign  targeting Tibetans.   Religious freedom continues to be severely curtailed, including  through mandatory political education for religious leaders and arrests  of Tibetans who display a photo of the Dalai Lama.   The Panchen Lama turned 30 years old this year, but he and his family  remain incommunicado since being kidnapped by Chinese authorities in  1995, making him the world's longest-serving prisoner of conscience.   Finally, Chinese officials have intervened to select Tibetan Buddhist  leaders and threatened to choose the successor to the 14th Dalai Lama.  These actions are in clear violation of China's international  obligations to protect religious freedom.   It is essential that U.S. policy toward Tibet be updated and  strengthened. The bill we are considering today would establish as U.S.  policy that the succession or reincarnation of Tibetan Buddhist  leaders, including a future 15th Dalai Lama, is an exclusively  religious matter that should be decided solely by the Tibetan Buddhist  community.   Send a clear message that Chinese officials who interfere in the  succession or reincarnation process will be subject  [[Page H598]]  to targeted financial, economic, and visa-related sanctions, including  those contained in the Global Magnitsky Act.   Strengthen the role of the State Department Special Coordinator for  Tibetan Issues by including a mandate to work multilaterally to promote  a genuine dialogue.   Mandate that no new Chinese consulates should be established in the  United States until a U.S. consulate is established in Tibet's  historical capital of Lhasa.   Direct the State Department to begin collaborative, multinational  efforts to protect the environment and water resources of the Tibetan  Plateau.   Support democratic governance in the Tibetan exile community.   The Dalai Lama should be commended for his decision to devolve  political authority to elected leaders.   The Tibetan exile community is also to be commended for adopting a  system of self-governance with democratic institutions to choose their  own leaders, including holding multiple free and fair elections to  select its parliament and chief executive.   The adoption of democracy within the Tibetan exile community ensures  that the Central Tibetan Administration in Dharamsala, India,  legitimately represents and reflects the aspirations of the Tibetan  people around the world.   Standing together, the American people will remain steadfast partners  of the Tibetan people. For 60 years, His Holiness the Dalai Lama and so  many Tibetans have remained separated from their land and their home,  while the people in Tibet endure some of the harshest human rights  abuses in the world.   I am proud that today the House of Representatives is taking this  important step to strengthen U.S. policy in support of the Tibetan  people.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their support, and I urge  all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.
