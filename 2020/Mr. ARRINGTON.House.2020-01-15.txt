 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of President  Trump's effort to hold China accountable for its unfair trade  practices, and I commend him and Ambassador Lighthizer on achieving the  first phase of resetting that relationship.   For years, China has been taking advantage of American manufacturers  and producers through currency manipulation, state ownership, stealing  our intellectual property, and other unfair and unseemly behavior.   The bottom line is this, Mr. Speaker: They have been cheating  Americans, and politicians have let them get away with it for far too  long.   Joining me in this historic gallery today are 27 of the hardest  working, God-fearing farmers in west Texas. Cochran, Lubbock, and  Bailey Counties are represented here today. They know all too well the  disastrous results of this trade imbalance with China.   President Trump loves the American farmer, and thanks to his hard- fought negotiations, producers from the South Plains and across the  country will reap the benefit of China's new commitment to purchase up  to $50 billion in U.S. agriculture products. That is nearly twice the  amount ever purchased by China.   These farmers can attest that the pain from China's retaliatory  tariffs is real, resulting in higher input costs, lower commodity  prices, and a significant decline in market share in one of our largest  export markets.   All of this has come on the heels of record bankruptcies and the  steepest decline in farm income since the Great Depression, but our  farmers stand with this President because they know he is doing the  right thing. They know he is fighting for them, and they also  understand that when we get to the other side of this deal, there will  be greener pastures for the next generation of farmers and ranchers.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent the food, fuel, and fiber  capital of the world in west Texas. These cowboys and plowboys who feed  and clothe the American people, and fuel the American economy, are a  picture of America's traditional values of hard work, faith in God, and  love for their families and fellow man, which, by the way, is the real  substance of what makes America great.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of them, I thank the American people for their  support through these tough times, and I thank President Trump for  putting America first and fighting for a better future for the American  farmer.   God bless, and go west Texas.                     Remembering Lubbock First Responders     Mr. Speaker, this is a very solemn moment for me and  all  [[Page H245]]  west Texans. On Saturday morning, west Texas lost two of our finest and  bravest first responders.   Lieutenant David Hill of Lubbock Fire Rescue and 27-year-old Lubbock  Police Officer Nicholas Reyna were responding to a rollover accident  when they lost their lives in the line of duty. A 30-year-old  firefighter and paramedic, Matt Dawson, was also injured and remains in  critical condition.   This is a tragic reminder that our heroic first responders wake up  every single day and risk their lives to keep us safe. These men  understood the sacred call to service. They gave the ultimate sacrifice  and demonstrated the greatest love for their fellow man.   The Holy Scripture says this: ``There is no greater love than this,  than to lay down your life for your friends.'' May God welcome these  earthly heroes into His heavenly kingdom. May He comfort the Reyna and  Hill families. May He grant Matt a speedy and full recovery. May He  continue to bless and keep those who keep watch over us.
