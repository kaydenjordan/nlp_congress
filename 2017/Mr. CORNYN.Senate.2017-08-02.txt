 Mr. President, I note in this morning's news that  insurance companies that provide health insurance policies on the  ObamaCare exchanges are projecting that insurance premiums will go up  about 30 percent next year.   Since 2013, we have seen the nationwide average of premiums go up 105  percent. That was before this latest announcement. We know that in  2017, the national average increase in premiums was 25 percent, and in  Arizona, for example, it was 145 percent.    So why did all of the Senate Democrats vote against making progress  on a solution toward these runaway premiums I have talked about ad  nauseam on the Senate floor?   We have almost become numb to the pain people across this country are  experiencing because of the skyrocketing rate of their insurance  premiums, and we know that 28 million, roughly, have dropped out and  are uninsured. In my State alone, because of the individual mandate,  which is the penalty the government imposes for one's failing to buy a  government-approved health insurance plan--as the Presiding Officer  knows because I got the figures from him--more than 400,000 Texans who  earn less than $25,000 a year paid the penalty because they could not  afford to buy the insurance. All in all, about a million Texans paid  the penalty because of the individual mandate.   When we tried to do something about that last week, in working with  our House colleagues, what was the response from the other side? It was  crickets--silence. Unfortunately, the people who were hurt by ObamaCare  are still being hurt by ObamaCare.   Now, here is the narrative. I have already seen it on social media  and have read about it in the paper and elsewhere. Some people are  saying: Well, the reason insurance companies are saying that premiums  are going to go up 30 percent next year is that President Trump will  not commit to the subsidies for insurance companies, the so-called  CSRs.   That is utterly false. How do they explain the 105-percent increase  from 2013 to currently? How do they explain last year's increase in  insurance premiums, 25 percent, on average, and 145 percent in places  like Arizona before President Trump even took office? It is a  demonstrably false narrative, and I cannot tell you how disappointed I  am that we were not able to make some progress toward a solution on  behalf of the people whom I represent in my State but also on behalf of  the people whom we all represent across the United States.   I dare say, as we search for a path forward, we ought to get our  facts straight, and the idea that premiums are going to go up 30  percent next year, unless something changes, is a product of the  failure of ObamaCare. It is nothing that this administration has done  or will do that has caused that. So let's get our facts straight  because starting with the correct facts is absolutely essential to  coming up with real solutions.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 1701         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Access to Science and       Technology Research Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds that--        (1) the Federal Government funds basic and applied research       with the expectation that new ideas and discoveries that       result from the research, if shared and effectively       disseminated, will advance science and improve the lives and       welfare of people of the United States and around the world;        (2) the Internet makes it possible for this information to       be promptly available to every scientist, physician,       educator, and citizen at home, in school, or in a library;        (3) the United States has a substantial interest in       maximizing the impact and utility of the research it funds by       enabling a wide range of reuses of the peer-reviewed       literature that reports the results of such research,       including by enabling computational analysis by state-of-the-      art technologies;        (4) the Office of Science and Technology Policy issued a       policy memorandum dated February 22, 2013, which established       the commitment of the executive branch of the Federal       Government to ensuring that ``the direct results of Federally       funded scientific research are made available to and useful       for the public, industry, and the scientific community''; and        (5) the executive branch advises that such public access       should be implemented ``with the fewest constraints       possible''.
