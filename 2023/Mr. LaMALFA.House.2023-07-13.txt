 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and pay a heartfelt  tribute to Mike Reynolds of Fresno, California, who recently passed  away. He has left behind an indelible legacy on our State and, indeed,  for people who love safe streets and feel that it is proper to make  those criminals pay the price for their activity.   Mike was a remarkable individual who exemplified resilience and  dedication in the face of adversity which he and his family faced  throughout his life.   He, indeed, was the driving force behind the three strikes law in  California that many other States since picked up afterwards. This was  after the tragic murder of his daughter, Kimber, by violent serial  offenders during a robbery. She is pictured here. No parent should have  to see the loss of their child, especially time and time and time again  around our country with repeat offenders. We know better. We know  better as a society how to treat crime, how to deal with it, yet this  happens.   Mike was a champion for passing an initiative in California called  the three strikes and you are out law to make sure that repeat  offenders would do proper prison time and not be out on the streets  subjecting our neighbors, friends, and families to these violent  criminals, time and time again.    We hear conversations here about something called gun violence. Well,  a gun is an inanimate object. It is people that do the violence. It is  people who have to be held accountable.   Mike Reynolds was the driving force in California that helped change  how crime is fought, and it is up to us to uphold his legacy for  preserving what safety we have on our streets, which we don't have a  lot of, especially in our urban areas.   What Mike created as an homage to his daughter, Kimber, and a way to  make sure that other families wouldn't have to suffer as they had to  has become a lightning rod for citizen groups. Indeed, over 20 States  have enacted laws with the same purpose as the original three strikes  in California that Mike drove.   I want Mike's family to know that we appreciate him as a good man who  showed strength of character and turned an unimaginable tragedy into a  force, indeed, for good.   We will miss Mike and grieve for him. I have had a chance to meet  with him, and I enjoyed being able to work with him when I was a State  legislator to ensure that we didn't lose ground on what we had gained.   At this time we grieve for him, we grieve for his family. We honor  his memory and celebrate the, indeed, profound impact he had not only  on the State of California but on the country.   Mr. Speaker, we talk about how do we keep our streets safe or how do  we make them safer than they are. In our blue cities all around the  country, they have some of the most aggressive anti-gun laws, and yet,  the crime is the highest in those areas.  [[Page H3492]]    What do we have instead? The work that has been done through the  three strikes and you are out, in order to keep violent prisoners in  prison, pay the price, has been undone by defund the police and by  watering down sentencing laws. It is absurd.   We have all the anti-gunners here saying we have gun violence, yet  they take away the sentence enhancements for ``use a gun, go to jail.''  When using a gun in a crime, there used to be special enhancements in  my home State. They have basically eviscerated those.   How does that make an ounce of sense, when you are anti-gun on one  hand, yet you don't want to have the enhancements because you don't  want people sitting in prison? Indeed, there is more and more  legislation all the time to figure out how to let prisoners out sooner;  some very violent offenders, to release them, those on death row who  have been downgraded because they got rid of some of the death penalty  requirements for certain people on death row. Governor Newsom in  California has completely done away with the death penalty during his  time in office by executive action. It is still on the books; he is  just not enforcing it.   How is this going to deter criminals? When you see the crimes that  are happening right under the noses of clerks in retail stores, jewelry  stores, and they are told by their corporate officers, don't dare say  anything, don't even take pictures of them. Someone lost their job  because they took a picture and video of a crime happening inside their  store because we have these lily-livers at the CEO level who don't want  them to help enforce their own goods, therefore, driving the cost of  everything through the roof because we don't enforce against crime.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I hear nonsense. I call it nonsense.   Our strength is not in our diversity. Our strength is in our unity.  We take diverse ideas, diverse talents, and we put them together. With  an offensive football team, where you have all different types and  sizes of people with speeds and talents, they all come together as a  team. They all start to play at the same time.   The same thing for our military. We have the Navajo Code Talkers.  They weren't worried about what color or gender or whatever they were.   We have all sorts of people coming together as a team. Our military  is forced together in recruiting and in training to become a team. You  don't worry about what everybody looks like and this and that or the  other.   That is what we have when we have unity, not diversity, which is  divisive.    Mr. Speaker, each year, especially in the Western  States, we have to suffer fire season, and the season is getting longer  and longer. We have an issue of not having enough people to help put  out the fires.   What had happened under the IIJA was that our wildland firefighters  had gotten a temporary bump in pay, which is deserved. Those folks are  at risk and working hard out there, but that is going to run out in a  couple of months. Federal wildland firefighters will see basically a  drop in pay unless we do something about that to keep their salary,  their wages, commensurate with what they have been used to the last  couple years and indeed deserve.   We need to move quickly on measures to either do a long-term  solution, or at least do a stopgap, to make sure firefighter pay  doesn't actually go back down to the levels of almost 3 years ago.   Instead of gimmickry, like saying we will give them a massive bonus,  why don't we find what level their pay should be on an hourly rate and  set it there, and that will attract people back into the fold of  wanting to help out with our forests and the wildland firefighting we  so desperately need.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 11 o'clock and 32 minutes  p.m.), the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday, July 14, 2023, at 9  a.m.                            ____________________
