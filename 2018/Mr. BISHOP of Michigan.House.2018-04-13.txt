 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  Rochester College men's and women's basketball teams for winning their  respective fourth and first-ever USCAA championships.   With a stingy defense and a strong will to win, the Rochester College  men's team posted an insurmountable lead in their final game, beating  the Oakwood University Ambassadors 80-61.   Men's head coach Klint Pleasant said: ``In 20 years of having the  privilege of coaching these young men, I can't think of a time I have  ever been more proud. Toughness, resolve, commitment, and genuine  relationships ruled the day.''   The Rochester College women's team knocked off the first and second  seed in the tournament en route to their championship, beating Paul  Quinn College 72-57.   Head coach Brent Wichtner summed up their team's success saying: ``I  am so extremely proud of this team and the resiliency they have shown.  This will be a day I will always remember.''   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to congratulate the talented, hardworking  student athletes of Rochester College.   Go Warriors.                            ____________________
