 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1, the For the  People Act.   I have said since day one on this job that if you want to do big and  transformational things in America, you first have to get rid of big  money in politics.   Whether you want to tackle the climate crisis, reform healthcare,  address the gun violence epidemic, or level the playing field for  American workers, it is all about shutting off the flow of big money,  ending gerrymandering, bolstering our ethics laws, and expanding access  to the ballot box. H.R. 1 will do all of these things.   This transformational package includes my bill, the End Dark Money  Act, to crack down on mega-donors who hide their political  contributions through phony social welfare organizations.   If we have learned anything in the past few years, it is that our  democracy is in need of reform. We can and must do big things again,  and it begins by passing H.R. 1.   I urge my colleagues to join me in this historic effort.                            ____________________
