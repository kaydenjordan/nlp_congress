 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 811 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 811         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 3621) to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act       to remove adverse information for certain defaulted or       delinquent private education loan borrowers who demonstrate a       history of loan repayment, and for other purposes. The first       reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. General       debate shall be confined to the bill and amendments specified       in this section and shall not exceed one hour equally divided       and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of       the Committee on Financial Services. After general debate the       bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute       rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute       recommended by the Committee on Financial Services now       printed in the bill, an amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       116-47, modified by the amendment printed in part A of the       report of the Committee on Rules accompanying this       resolution, shall be considered as adopted in the House and       in the Committee of the Whole. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as the original bill for the purpose of further       amendment under the five-minute rule and shall be considered       as read. All points of order against provisions in the bill,       as amended, are waived. No further amendment to the bill, as       amended, shall be in order except those printed in part B of       the report of the Committee on Rules. Each such further       amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the       report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be       subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand       for division of the question in the House or in the Committee       of the Whole. All points of order against such further       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill, as amended, to the House with such further       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and       on any further amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 550) to       award a Congressional Gold Medal, collectively, to the United       States Merchant Mariners of World War II, in recognition of       their dedicated and vital service during World War II, with       the Senate amendment thereto, and to consider in the House,       without intervention of any point of order, a motion offered       by the chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs or his       designee that the House concur in the Senate amendment with       each of the two amendments specified in section 4 of this       resolution. The Senate amendment and the motion shall be       considered as read. The previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the motion to its adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except as       specified in section 3 of this resolution.        Sec. 3. (a) The question of adoption of the motion shall be       divided between the two House amendments specified in section       4 of this resolution. The two portions of the divided       question shall be considered in the order specified by the       Chair.        (b) Each portion of the divided question shall be debatable       for one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.        Sec. 4.  The amendments referred to in the second and third       sections of this resolution are as follows:         (a) An amendment consisting of the text of Rules Committee       Print 116-48.        (b) An amendment consisting of the text of Rules Committee       Print 116-49.        Sec. 5.  If only one portion of the divided question is       adopted, that portion shall be engrossed as an amendment in       the nature of a substitute to the Senate amendment to H.R.       550.                                time  1230     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.  [[Page H580]]                                     General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 811, providing for consideration of  two measures: H.R. 3621, the Comprehensive CREDIT Act; and the Senate  amendment to H.R. 550.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3621 under a structured  rule, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and the ranking member of the Committee on Financial Services. It self- executes Chairwoman Waters' manager's amendment, which updates  definitions, amends requirements for issuance of final rules, includes  protections for workers affected by a Federal shutdown, and makes other  technical changes. It also makes in order 14 amendments.   The rule also provides for consideration of two House amendments to  the Senate amendment to H.R. 550. The rule provides for 1 hour of  debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member  of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for each House amendment. Finally,  the rule provides for separate votes on each House amendment.   Madam Speaker, on H.R. 3621, the Comprehensive CREDIT Act of 2020,  credit scores and credit reports play a critical role in determining  which of our constituents across America will be able to pay for  college, rent an apartment, buy a car or a house, start a business,  meet major unexpected expenses, or even, increasingly, get a particular  job.   Most Americans do not have the wealth to pay out of pocket for major  expenditures, so credit is essential; and credit scores and credit  reports have become the key screening and sorting mechanism, the key  gatekeeper that makes the difference for millions of Americans between  having the money to pay for college or not, being able to buy a house  or rent an apartment or not, and, increasingly, qualifying as an  employee for a specific position or not, because so many employers are  increasingly using credit scores and credit reports as part of the  qualifying process for appointing and hiring new employees.   The system of credit scores and credit reports is deeply flawed  today, and we have done nothing to reform it in 17 years. The Federal  Trade Commission tells us that one in five Americans has an error on at  least one of their credit reports, and 5 percent of the people have  errors grave enough to result in their being denied credit or having to  pay substantially more for their mortgages or their auto loans or to  obtain insurance policies.   The three big CRAs, consumer reporting agencies--Equifax, TransUnion,  and Experian--have files on more than 200 million American consumers,  which means that there are errors in the credit reports of at least 40  million of our constituents and serious, potentially life-changing  errors in the credit reports of 10 million Americans across the  country.   Correcting these errors often takes considerable time and procedural  effort, as well as knowledge on how to communicate with the credit  reporting companies. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the  CFPB, determined that, in 2018, credit reports were the single most  complained-about financial product in our country, and the three big  CRAs were the most complained-about financial companies in America.   Many vulnerable populations like seniors, stressed and busy working- class Americans, and less financially literate young Americans describe  immense frustration in trying to solve problems with credit scoring and  reporting companies. Even beyond the errors and mistakes, the credit  system takes advantage of the financially insecure and precarious,  converting transitory lapses of poverty into a lifetime of financial  stigma and hardship. It is very expensive to be poor in America.   Consumers lack the right to a free annual credit score. Many  consumers who try to get a free annual credit report or to obtain their  scores get tricked into purchasing high-priced credit monitoring or  subscription services.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3621, the Comprehensive CREDIT Act of 2020,  comprehensively addresses these abuses and combines six bills carefully  constructed by our colleagues on the Financial Services Committee to  improve transparency, fairness, and accuracy in America's credit  reporting system. It reforms and upgrades the process for consumers  seeking to resolve errors in their credit reports, and it seeks to  ensure that consumer financial information held by the CRAs will be  accurate, complete, and verifiable.   This bill will:   Prohibit reporting on consumers' debt relating to medically necessary  procedures and delay reporting by 1 year for other forms of medical  debt;   Remove adverse credit file information relating to defaulted or  delinquent private education loans for borrowers who demonstrate a  history of essentially timely and faithful loan repayments for these  loans;   Permit reasonable interruptions in the consecutive repayment periods  for student borrowers facing unique and extenuating life events;   Prohibit most current and prospective employers from using credit  reports to make employment decisions unless required by a local, State,  or Federal law or government;   Shorten the time period adverse credit information stays on consumer  reports from 7 years to 4 years and from 10 to 7 years for bankruptcy  information;   Give consumers a new right to appeal the results of disputes with the  CRAs; and   Improve the oversight capabilities of the CFPB on credit reporting  agencies and their scoring modules and require these agencies to better  train their personnel on addressing consumer concerns.   It has been more than 15 years since we enacted comprehensive reform  of the credit reporting system. The House can be proud of the  significant progress this credit reform package will bring to  hardworking people across America for whom credit and credit reports  are the lifeline to education, housing, and, in many cases, good  employment and financial stability.   Madam Speaker, on the Senate amendment to H.R. 550, the House also  considers the rule on two important amendments to the Senate amendment  of H.R. 550.   The first amendment, based on Representative Ro Khanna's No War with  Iran Act, clarifies that Congress has not authorized military force  against Iran and asserts Congress' funding power to enforce the  congressional authorization requirements under the War Powers  Resolution of 1973. It, thus, prohibits funds for any military force in  or against Iran unless Congress declares war or enacts specific  statutory authorization for the use of military force against Iran or  there is a national emergency created by an attack upon the United  States or our Armed Forces consistent with the provisions of the War  Powers Resolution.   The second amendment, based on Representative Barbara Lee's bill,  will repeal the 2002 AUMF for the Iraq war against Saddam Hussein,  which authorized the President to use the Armed Forces to the extent  ``he determines to be necessary and appropriate'' to ``defend the  national security of the United States against the continuing threat  posed by Iraq'' and ``enforce all relevant United Nations Security  Council resolutions regarding Iraq.''   The commanding premise of the 2002 authorization was the need to  counter the threat of weapons of mass destruction putatively possessed  by Saddam Hussein. But Saddam Hussein actually never had nuclear  weapons or other weapons of mass destruction and was driven from office  in 2003 and was killed in 2006. The current government in Iraq is a  strategic partner of the United States in the struggle against nonstate  terror groups like ISIS and al-Qaida and poses no threat to our  national security.   The 2002 AUMF does not authorize, and has never authorized, the use  of force against Iran; yet it was invoked by National Security Advisor  Robert O'Brien as a primary source of the administration's authority to  engage in military hostilities against Iran, including the strike  against Qasem Soleimani.  [[Page H581]]    This is one problem with obsolete AUMFs hanging around decades after  they were approved. Presidents can treat them like a loaded gun sitting  on a table which can be picked up at will and used in a completely  different context for a completely different reason.   The 2002 authorization must be repealed to ensure that no President  now or in the future can use it as a pretextual justification for  deploying military force without congressional authorization or a  formal declaration of war as called for by the Constitution of the  United States.   Madam Speaker, the Framers gave Congress the power to declare war  because they had just had a revolution against the kings and the  monarchs who, for centuries, plunged their populations into wars of  vanity, intrigue, political advantage, and distraction of the  population. The Framers understood that the power over life and death,  over war and peace, was far too awesome to vest in one person, much  less a political actor motivated by the desire for fame, prestige, and  power. By giving Congress the exclusive power to declare war and to  appropriate funds for war, the Framers made certain that the momentous  decision to go to war, to send our troops into battle, would belong  primarily to the representatives of the people, both the people who  fight and die in our wars, their parents, and their families, and the  communities that they are drawn from.   Over the last month, the President initiated a dramatic escalation of  tensions with Iran without the consent of Congress and without  consulting Congress pursuant to the War Powers Resolution of 1973. In  the case of the strike against Qasem Soleimani, Congress was never  consulted by President Trump, although he apparently spoke with several  people who were guests of his at Mar-a-Lago, where the decisions were  apparently being made.   On January 7, Iran retaliated for the killing of General Soleimani by  launching ballistic missiles against our military and coalition forces  in Iraq. We now know that at least 34 troops have been diagnosed with  traumatic brain injuries from these strikes, injuries the President has  dismissed as headaches. We have still yet to receive any legitimate  explanation for the justification for the strike in Iraq, and the  administration's subsequent briefing on these actions left far more  questions than answers and troubled even many Republican Senators to  the point of extreme frustration.   On January 8, when administration officials briefed Members of  Congress on the President's actions, both Democrats and Republicans,  alike, expressed grave concerns about the briefing, with one Member  highlighting the administration had given no time, place, or method  justifying the attacks. The President later said there were four  threats to United States Embassies, an explanation which apparently was  withdrawn in the aftermath. So we still don't know.   In any event, Madam Speaker, we need to return to the Constitution of  the United States and the rule of law. The grave decision to go to war  is one that belongs properly with Congress.   If we can send our sons and daughters into battle and ask them to  exercise the most powerful courage in the world to do that, certainly,  we can exercise and summon up the moral and political courage needed  just to properly exercise our constitutional powers. We have the power  and we have the duty to declare war when we engage in military  hostilities abroad, and that is what we are doing with these two  amendments.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished chairman of the House  Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, no, I do not yield for that purpose. All  time is yielded for the purpose of debate.    No, I do not. I have yielded for the purpose of debate  only, and I would love to have a real debate about the resolution that  is before us.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rarely fail to be moved by my good friend from  Georgia (Mr. Woodall) with his directness, his charm, and his  legislative prowess. But I have to say I fail to be moved by this last  jack-in-the-box procedural maneuver of people getting up and asking for  unanimous consent to do something that my friends failed to do for the  last 8 years when they could have had a hearing at any point on the War  Powers Act, yet they didn't do it.   Now, I believe that all of my friends who got up in the line were  operating under a misapprehension because there was a hearing in the  House Foreign Affairs Committee on January 14--that is about 2 weeks  ago--called ``From Sanctions to the Soleimani Strike to Escalation:  Evaluating the Administration's Iran Policy'' and all the implications  in terms of Congress' war powers.   For the life of me, I can't understand why my good friend is not  joining us today. I understand that it is always possible to summon up  a procedural objection when the substantive task at hand is too  difficult to do politically. I understand this would require people to  make the President of the United States mad because, like every  President before him--and this is a bipartisan issue, as Chairman  McGovern said--this President wants to be able to decide for himself  whether or not the United States of America is going to be plunged into  war.   The very simple proposition that we bring before the House that  everybody in the Chamber can speak to right now, and everybody in the  Chamber can vote on, is the repeal of the Authorization for Use of  Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.   That was 18 years ago. We have kids who could die in a war against  Iran in Iraq, or a war in Iran, based on this resolution, and they  weren't even born when this Authorization of Use of Military Force was  adopted by Congress.   The real question is: Are we going to have the courage to stand up  for the Constitution and to stand up for our constituents and say that  we will not go to war unless there is a specific statutory  authorization by Congress or a declaration of war or there is an actual  attack on the United States such that the President is really acting in  self-defense?   Both Democratic and Republican Members of Congress were bewildered  and frustrated by the presentation of this administration as to why the  United States of America needed to commit that strike when they did.   There were changing stories. About every 20 minutes, we got a new  story about why it was necessary. I have not heard a single word on the  other side--to their credit--defending any of the justifications or  rationalizations or pretexts that were offered by the administration.   So, we come back to a constitutional point that is not difficult, and  that is one that came up at that Foreign Affairs Committee hearing a  couple of weeks ago. It is one that we talked about in the Rules  Committee last night in debate. It is one that every one of us is  invited to join in right now on the floor of the House to discuss,  which is the one that was made by the chairman of the Rules Committee.   I have to say a word in honor of our great chair on the Rules  Committee. He has been invoking the Constitution and the exclusive  power of Congress to declare war for two decades, through Democratic  Presidents, Republican Presidents, Bushes, Clintons, Obamas, and now  Trump. He has been saying the same thing, which is that we should not  be committing American troops to wars abroad without a vote of  Congress, which was the explicit design of the Framers of the  Constitution.   Go back to the Preamble of the Constitution:         We the people, in order to form a more perfect union,       establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for       the common defense, promote the general welfare, and preserve       to ourselves and our posterity the blessings of liberty do       hereby ordain and establish the Constitution of the United       States of America.    The very next sentence in Article I states that the legislative power  is vested in a Congress of the United States, a House of  Representatives and a Senate. Then, it sets forth all of our powers,  including the power to declare war, the power of taxes, the power to  appropriate money, the power to raise armies, the power to maintain a  navy, and so on. All of that is with Congress.   You go all the way through Article I, Madam Speaker, and then you get  to Article II, where the President is denominated the Commander in  Chief of the Army and the Navy in times of actual conflict and  insurrection, and the President's core job is to take care that the  laws are faithfully executed.   That includes the Constitution itself, of course, and it includes the  War Powers Resolution of 1973.   This is a very clear principle. It is a constitutional axiom we are  advancing today. We had a hearing on it a couple of weeks ago, but we  don't need weeks and months of hearings. Obviously, our good friends  didn't think it required any hearings over the 8 years that they were  in control of the House of Representatives.   It is a simple proposition, which is that the war power belongs to  Congress. We have to declare war. We can't run away from it any more  than our brave troops can run away from battle when they have been  committed to battle.   All we are saying is that if there is going to be war against Iran,  if there is going to be a war against the new government in Iraq--not  Saddam Hussein, who is gone and dead--then we have to declare the war;  we have to authorize the war; and we have to debate and deliberate over  it as contemplated by the Founders of our country. That is our job.   We had a bipartisan vote invoking the War Powers Resolution on  January 9. It ended up 224-194, but we had Democrats and Republicans  invoking the War Powers Resolution with respect to the situation in  Iran.   Again, I am not quite sure why our colleagues don't want to do this  with us. I understand it is easier to do it when the opposing party is  in the White House, but we have many Members on both sides of the aisle  who have demonstrated their courage by invoking the War Powers  Resolution and by  [[Page H586]]  standing up for the Constitution. That is what we have to do today, and  we have the perfect opportunity and legislative vehicle to do it right  now.   I reserve the remainder of my time, Madam Speaker.    Madam Speaker, how much time do I have?    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time to close.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to thank my good friend from Georgia for our robust and active  exchange today.   We came to debate matters of war and peace and the reassertion of  Congress' essential constitutional powers over the declaration of war  and the commitment of our troops and our funds to foreign wars.   These are critical issues that our friends, when they were in charge  of the Chamber, routinely ignored; but we are confronting them, and we  invite them in enthusiastically to be part of this process of  reasserting Congress' war powers.   But the minority's previous question is obviously unnecessary and an  irrelevant distraction from the important issues that we have come to  address. And I want to be clear about this: It is an unnecessary  distraction because the House majority leader committed this morning to  bringing up S. 3201, which extends the ban on all fentanyl-based  substances. It took place this morning. Check docs.house.gov, which has  the complete running explanation of what is taking place. This morning,  he scheduled it for the very first item of business tomorrow.   So the bill that my friends are valiantly promising to bring to the  floor if we defeat the previous question is already scheduled to be  considered as the first item of business tomorrow morning under  suspension of the House rules.   And I will remind my colleagues of what defeating the previous  question means. It gives control of the floor to the minority. We are  not going to do that because we are here to prevent unauthorized war  with Iran; to repeal the obsolete and unnecessary 2002 AUMF, which  addressed the situation with Saddam Hussein; and to modernize the  credit reporting system, which is failing millions of Americans, our  constituents.   For all of the reasons that we have discussed during this robust  debate, we need to ensure that the whole House gets the chance to vote  on all of these things: on the repeal of the 2002 Iraq AUMF and on  reforming the credit reporting system so our people have better access  to credit and we have real transparency and fairness in people's credit  reports and credit scores.  [[Page H588]]    I hope that all of our colleagues, both in the majority and the  minority, will join us in voting ``yes'' on the previous question and  ``yes'' on this rule so we can move on to serious, thoughtful,  deliberate consideration of all of these critical measures that we  bring before the Congress and the American people.   I also hope that all of our colleagues will join me in supporting S.  3201, the fentanyl legislation, which our colleague discussed, on  suspension tomorrow.    I yield to the gentleman from Oregon.    Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time. I am thrilled to be  able to assure the gentleman that we are taking up the exact Senate  bill in its exact verbatim text.    Madam Speaker, this will occur tomorrow morning on the  first bill at 12:15, 12:30. It is the first bill.   Madam Speaker, let me just say that I hope our friends take yes for  an answer, and I hope that this will perhaps usher in their ability to  support the underlying legislation here because I know that they agree  with us that the Constitution gives the House of Representatives and  the Senate the power to declare war. It gives Congress the power to  declare war, to spend money on war. We should not allow a President of  any party--Democratic, Republican, or anything else--to usurp that  power and to engage in unilateral Presidential wars without our  specific authorization, without our declaration, unless there is an  attack on the land, the people of the United States, or our Armed  Forces, as specified in the War Powers Resolution.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 811         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (S. 3201) to extend the temporary scheduling order for       fentanyl-related substances, and for other purposes. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on       any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Energy & Commerce; and (2) one motion to       recommit.        Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of S. 3201.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
