 I thank Senator Scott for leading this issue.   Mr. President, every moment of every day is precious, but none more  so than when war has engulfed your home. It was just 3 weeks ago today,  what now feels like an eternity, that Russian forces first invaded  Ukraine's sovereign border and launched a deadly, unprovoked attack on  the people of Ukraine. And since that day, the world has watched in  horror as hundreds, perhaps thousands, of innocent civilians--including  children--have perished from gunfire and explosive weapons. More than 2  million people have now fled their homes.   Among the Russian targets have been a bread factory, a maternity  ward, and a nursery. Despite enduring the suffering and being greatly  outnumbered by Russian force strength and military might, the Ukrainian  people have bravely defended their homeland, an inspiration for the  entire world. Here at home, though, President Biden has been doing his  best to fool the American people into thinking he is a wartime  President, but his track record tells a different story.   To say the President is leading from behind is an understatement. The  President's handling of the Ukraine invasion has been littered with  missteps and tardiness nearly every step of the way, his words and  actions seldom lining up.   In December, the administration slow-walked a shipment of military  arms that would have hardened Ukraine's defenses. It took nearly a  month for the package to be approved and the armaments to arrive in  Ukraine. In January, Senate Republicans moved to stop sanctions on the  Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. President Biden dispatched his allies in this  Chamber to filibuster the bill and allow the project to be slowed down.   A month later, the President finally came around and moved to impose  sanctions on the project. Last week, I introduced with 10 of my  Republican colleagues to ban Russian oil imports. Democrats in the  Senate joined in calling for an announcement of such an action during  his State of the Union speech, but none was made.   Always afraid to lead, it would be a full week later when President  Biden would finally impose the import prohibition. This President has  repeatedly been late to act. His failure to show strength and take  proactive maneuvers empowered a war criminal to move to reclaim one of  the most prized former Soviet republics, a land rich with wheat and  corn and sunflowers.  [[Page S1087]]    I was on a phone call with many of my colleagues last weekend with  President Zelenskyy. And my friends across the aisle were so excited,  they were so motivated, wanting to move quickly to place ammunitions  and MiG-29 jets in the hands of the brave Ukrainians. But no; cowardice  is contagious. Democrats in Congress have now taken a page out of our  President's playbook by settling on a process that would deliver this  most recent round of military aid to Ukrainians more than a week after  President Zelenskyy laid out his country's need to Members of Congress.    And the MiG fighter jets that are so desperately needed by the  Ukrainians, they remain grounded and out of the hands of the sieged.  Instead of a stand-alone bill or attaching this invaluable relief to  the short-term CR that will be signed to keep the government open while  the massive 3,000-page bill is enrolled and sent to the President, they  are insisting that it remain part of the omnibus in order to sweeten a  sour bunch of grapes--once again, delaying lifesaving aid by many days.   At a time when our national debt is over $30 trillion and our  government spent almost $2 trillion extra on government programs this  year already, the bill increases discretionary spending on more than  $45 billion. Indeed, we won't let a crisis go to waste.   It also funds the administration's tragically misguided attempts to  electrify our electric fleet and implement the Green New Deal. All the  while, we are witnessing a self-imposed Biden energy crisis because  they have killed our domestic oil and gas industry by declaring war on  American energy.   Today, I would ask the Democrats partying in Philadelphia with drag  queens and sampling Pennsylvania beers that they should jump on the  next Amtrak train and come back and help us pass this Ukrainian aid  immediately. Let's not force it into an omnibus that makes the  Ukrainian people wait 5 more days before it would be officially signed  into law. I support the much needed Ukrainian aid. We would pass it as  a stand-alone piece of legislation today.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I rise today to recognize the  incredible performance and achievement from Kansas's own, Ms. Pyet  DeSpain. Pyet took home the grand prize during FOX's inaugural ``Next  Level Chef'' season and is officially the first Next Level Chef.   A native of Kansas City, KS, Pyet developed a passion for cooking  while helping in the kitchens of her family's taquerias and  restaurants. This passion for the kitchen led her to attend Le'Cole  Culinaire to pursue a culinary education and career. A chef and an  entrepreneur, Pyet started her own business, ``Pyet's Plates,'' back in  2016 to promote her passion for wellness, nutrition, and healthy  lifestyle choices. A lifetime of hard work and dedication to her craft  has culminated into Pyet earning her Next Level Chef title and a hefty  cash prize as a nice bonus.   The skills that Pyet developed throughout her time spent in kitchens  across the country allowed her to succeed on the inaugural season of  ''Next Level Chef,'' and I am sure that the lessons learned from this  season will help Pyet to develop into an even more talented chef,  entrepreneur, and restaurant owner. I look forward to seeing how Pyet's  passion for good food, healthy lifestyle choices, and respect for  tradition will develop into future culinary endeavors.   I ask my colleagues now to join me in recognizing this outstanding  achievement by Pyet DeSpain. She has made her family, friends,  community, and State incredibly proud, and we are all rooting for  continued success throughout her career.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise today to honor and  recognize Barry Feaker of Topeka, KS. Barry has served the homeless and  impoverished since 1986 as executive director of the Topeka Rescue  Mission, TRM. He plans to step down from this position but continue to  serve as strategic adviser.   TRM is a Christian organization that works with community partners to  give shelter, meals, clothing, and other needed items to homeless and  impoverished individuals. They do this by sharing the love of Jesus  Christ with every person they encounter. Barry has served the Topeka  community for 36 years. In April 1986, 15-20 homeless individuals were  staying at TRM per night. By 2019, that number has grown to an  astounding 200-300 people per night, a true testament to Barry's work  and determination over the years.   As he finishes out his time as executive director of TRM, I hope he  is able to reflect on the impact he has had on the Topeka Community. He  not only expanded the services they provide and number of people  working at TRM, but also increased TRM's annual budget from $70,000 to  $5.3 million. Along with that, he increased operating one singular  men's shelter, to two shelters, a warehouse, a distribution center, and  a Children's Palace. Barry offers his role with excitement for what is  ahead at TRM. He believes it is time for the next generation to take  control. He believes that the job is not done and there are more people  in need than ever. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the  wonderful career of Mr. Barry Feaker and wish him nothing but joy and  happiness in his next chapter of life.                            ____________________
