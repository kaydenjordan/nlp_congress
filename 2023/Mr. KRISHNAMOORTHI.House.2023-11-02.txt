 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support Federal  funding to help our cities cope with the rising number of new migrant  arrivals.   Many mayors, including Chicago's Mayor Brandon Johnson, are asking  that cities and States be allocated $5 billion in emergency funding to  help them with the influx of new arrivals.   Most importantly in their request is also the flexibility to decide  for themselves how to allocate the funds, since different cities have  different needs. Chicago, for example, needs the ability to provide  warm clothing to families arriving with little preparation for  Chicago's winter.   As an immigrant myself to the greatest country the world has ever  known, I ask that even as we debate how to prevent future border  crises, we remember that we have to help people, particularly children,  who have been allowed to enter the Nation in service of their better  future.                            ____________________
