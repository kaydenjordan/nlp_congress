 Madam Chair, let me be very clear: Equal pay for equal  work has never been a reality for women in America.   Congress recognized this for the first time 56 years ago, before I  was even born, when the Equal Pay Act was passed. This was a  foundational piece of civil rights legislation. But a half century  later, it is clear that the Equal Pay Act isn't working for everyone,  and it isn't working fast enough.   In my district, for every dollar that men in Naperville or Batavia or  McHenry make, women make 71 cents. That is the worst pay gap in  Illinois. It means we have to work at least 10 years longer to earn the  same lifetime income. At this rate, every woman in America wouldn't  make equal pay for doing the same work for almost 200 years.   In my community in Illinois, the 14th Congressional District isn't  willing to wait that long, and neither are the House Democrats. That is  why I am standing here today as a cosponsor and strong supporter of the  Paycheck Fairness Act. There is no point in a woman's life, from  childhood to retirement, where the gender pay gap doesn't hurt her. The  Paycheck Fairness Act would take huge, critical steps to fix that.   The Committee on Education and Labor held hearings on the act, and we  heard from experts how this bill would do things like lift children out  of poverty, contribute billions of dollars to America's economy, and  make sure women have a safer, healthier retirement.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record a letter signed by 315 State,  local, and national organizations that support the Paycheck Fairness  Act.                     Vote for the Paycheck Fairness Act                                                     March 25, 2019.        Dear Representative: As members of a broad coalition of       organizations that promote economic opportunity for women and       vigorous enforcement of antidiscrimination laws, we strongly       urge you to vote for the Paycheck Fairness Act when it comes       to the House floor for a vote. Despite federal and state       equal pay laws, gender pay gaps persist. This legislation       offers a much needed update to the Equal Pay Act of 1963 by       providing new tools to battle the pervasive pay gaps and to       challenge discrimination.        In January, we celebrated two major accomplishments. First,       an historic number of women were sworn into the 116th       Congress, many of whom--along with their male colleagues--ran       and won on issues central to the economic well-being of       families. Second, on January 29, 2019, we commemorated the       tenth anniversary of the enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter       Fair Pay Act. That vital law rectified the Supreme Court's       harmful decision in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber       Company. The law helps to ensure that individuals subjected       to unlawful compensation discrimination are able to have       their day in court and effectively assert their rights under       federal antidiscrimination laws. But the Lilly Ledbetter Fair       Pay Act, critical as it is, is only one step on the path to       ensuring women receive equal pay for equal work.        There is no more fitting way to begin this historic       Congress than by making real, concrete progress in ensuring       all women receive fair pay. The Paycheck Fairness Act updates       and strengthens the Equal Pay Act of 1963 to ensure that it       provides robust protection against sex-based pay       discrimination. Among other provisions, this comprehensive       bill bars retaliation against workers who voluntarily discuss       or disclose their wages. It closes loopholes that have       allowed employers to pay women less than men for the same       work without any important business justification related to       the job. It ensures women can receive the same robust       remedies for sex-based pay discrimination that are currently       available to those subjected to discrimination based on race       and ethnicity. It prohibits employers from relying on salary       history in determining future pay, so that pay discrimination       does not follow women from job to job. And it also provides       much needed training and technical assistance, as well as       data collection and research.        Women are increasingly the primary or co-breadwinner in       their families and cannot afford to be shortchanged any       longer. Women working full-time, year-round are typically       paid only 80 cents for every dollar paid to men, and when we       compare women of color to white, non-Hispanic men, the pay       gaps are even larger. Moms are paid less than dads. And even       when controlling for factors, such as education and       experience, the pay gaps persist and start early in women's       careers and contribute to a wealth gap that follows them       throughout their lifetimes. These pay gaps can be addressed       only if workers have the legal tools necessary to challenge       discrimination and when employers are provided with effective       incentives and technical assistance to comply with the law.        It's time to take the next step toward achieving equal pay.       We urge you to vote for the Paycheck Fairness Act and       encourage your colleagues to do the same, taking up the cause       of Lilly Ledbetter and all those who have fought for equal       pay.
