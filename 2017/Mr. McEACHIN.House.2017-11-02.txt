 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to speak on the importance of  reauthorizing the Children's Health Insurance Program, commonly  referred to as CHIP.   In my home State of Virginia, there are 66,000 children and 1,100  pregnant women who rely on CHIP. Almost 6,000 of those children and  pregnant women live in my district. They need a clean reauthorization  of CHIP. Instead, this week, we are expected to vote on a bill that  will put my constituents at risk.   As reported from committee, this new version of CHIP, the so-called  HEALTHY KIDS Act, is loaded with poison pills that would undermine the  Affordable Care Act, Medicare, and Medicaid. According to the  Georgetown University Center for Children and Families, CHIP with  Medicaid boosted the rate of children's health coverage to more than 95  percent.   Mr. Speaker, why tamper with such success? I urge my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle to bring a bill to the floor that  reauthorizes CHIP and supports our constituents.                            ____________________
