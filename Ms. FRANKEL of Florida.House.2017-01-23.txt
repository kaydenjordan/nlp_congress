 Mr. Speaker, the age of coat hanger medicine  has returned.   It may be a new year, a new Congress, a new administration, but  Republicans are taking us back to a dangerous past, one where women  were maimed and killed by back-alley abortions.   Today, our new President signed an executive order restricting safe  abortions for women around the world. And tomorrow, Republicans will  vote to block American women from access to full reproductive care.   Our government is about to enter our bedrooms and take the lives and  liberty of our women and our families.   With every breath, we must fight back.                            ____________________
