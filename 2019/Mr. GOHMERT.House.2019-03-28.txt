 Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is my honor to yield to my  friend from New Jersey, not just a friend, but a brother, ardent pro- life advocate who I have seen has compassion for every baby child.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).                  An Important Message America Needs to Hear     Will the gentleman stay for a question.   Mr. Speaker, I am deeply moved and touched by everything my friend  from New Jersey has had to say. But at one point, my friend said, he  really believed that some day Americans will look back on this point in  history. And one of my great concerns, because of the love I know is  shared between us both for this country; and desperately wanting this  country, our children, grandchildren, great grandchildren, someday to  enjoy our freedoms, one of my biggest concerns is that it won't be  Americans that look back; that if we stay on this road where we  dismember and kill babies, it may not be Americans that look back, it  may be historians in some other country after the United States no  longer exists in its present condition that look back and say, Wow,  look how degenerate they had gotten, and it just seemed so accepted.   Does the gentleman from New Jersey, my friend, have any concerns  that, perhaps, if we don't address this problem that it may not be  Americans that look back and see this problem area?   I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I really appreciate those words from my  friend, Chris Smith, and I look forward to seeing that movie.   I was very moved watching the movie ``Gosnell''. It just--I thought  about the poets, the inhumanity to man. It is tragic.   Having talked to people that have taught in China, you know, it is a  human crisis what is going on with the abortion of so many women. And  like my friend, Chris Smith, I can't help but wonder why that is not  considered a war on women when you kill a baby in utero simply because  the child is female. But apparently, in China, since couples are only  allowed normally to have one child, many couples think, well, we would  rather have a boy. Discrimination against girls.   As a father who has three girls, they have brought joy to my life in  so many ways. I just cannot fathom the thought of ever doing anything  to have prevented those girls from being born.   But there are far-reaching implications when you have a gendercide.  But as was pointed out by a teacher in China, first of all, the boys  don't have as much opportunity to have female friends, making it more  difficult to find a heterosexual partner.   But more than that, because it is restricted to one child, you have  two sets of grandparents and two parents, six people who have one child  to focus on, and it actually--   One of the greatest disciplined groups of children in the world used  to be considered from China.  [[Page H2910]]                                     time  1230    More and more, you have doting grandparents and parents. Since they  only have one child to dote on among the six of them, more and more of  those Chinese children are being spoiled rotten. It is much more  difficult to maintain order, because now that there is one child to  spoil among six people, the teacher is never right. The child is always  right.   It is interesting, seeing all the far-reaching ramifications of this  gendercide against women. I hope and literally do pray that things will  change, and babies will no longer be killed just simply because they  are female.                             Fraud on FISA Court     Mr. Speaker, there are four other topics I wanted to  touch on.   One, I was greatly surprised to find out about a motion and order by  the Obama administration in 2012 before the FISA court, because being  on the Judiciary Committee--I wasn't there when the PATRIOT Act was  passed; I have been there for reauthorization--I have grave concerns  about some of the civil rights there.   My colleagues across the aisle on the Judiciary Committee, many of  them had extremely grave concerns when they were in the minority about  civil rights and civil liberties, and those seem to have taken a  backseat while the President was President Obama.   I am hopeful that, now that there is not a Democrat in the White  House, we can get some bipartisan concern again about civil liberties,  after the Obama administration really did run roughshod over so many.   One of the things we were assured in reauthorizing the FISA court,  the procedures and all, is that no American, and this was in the  PATRIOT Act as well, but no American would be caught up in any foreign  surveillance or surveillance by our U.S. entities, whether CIA, NSA,  whatever, unless the American citizen was engaged in a conversation  with a known terrorist, foreign terrorist, or an agent of a known  terrorist organization.   Then through this colonoscopy, figuratively speaking, that the Trump  campaign and administration were getting, we come to find out things  were far more loose in protecting civil liberties and privacy rights.   On the FISA court, unfortunately, we have at least one or more FISA  judges that really don't care about the Constitution. They don't care  about Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights. They have allowed the Justice  Department to run roughshod over those.   I am very concerned about how far this goes back. Did it go back  before the Obama administration? Is it a newer invention? Just how many  activities once considered unthinkable by the Federal Government are  now just ho-hum to FISA judges?   The fact is that we now know the FISA court, at least one, perhaps  more courts, were lied to. Since this is basically a Star Chamber where  the public is not allowed to know what went on--things are held in  secret. The transcripts are held in secret, unless you get them  released by WikiLeaks, as the application for warrant, the affidavit on  which it was based, and the order regarding Verizon some years back-- WikiLeaks released that.   That was the eye-opener for me, because as just an ardent historian  when it comes to so many things American, and that includes First  Amendment rights, I was shocked, Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment.   We know the Constitution is very clear. You can't just say: Give me  all the information you have.   It is required that you have some kind of probable cause here, and  you have to describe with particularity the area to be searched or the  thing to be searched and the specific thing that is being sought for  which there is a warrant.   I was overwhelmed to see an affidavit saying: Well, for America's  protection, we just need every bit of information that Verizon has on  every one of their customers.   I am going, oh, my gosh. During my days as a felony judge in Texas,  if an officer had come with an affidavit and an application signed,  sworn to, and given that to me, that we need a warrant, I am going, you  have got to be kidding. There is no particularity here. It is just  saying give me everything you have on every customer this company has.   Are you kidding? You need to go back to school. I am not sure I need  to be signing any more warrants for you if that is the way you consider  constitutional rights.   Yet, it was just ho-hum for the Justice Department, ho-hum for the  FISA court judges.   I mean, unless there is some FISA judge that signed these four  warrants regarding the Trump campaign, and individuals with it, who has  just completely lost his or her mind and doesn't know what is going on,  that judge, or judges, has to be aware they were lied to. There was  fraud upon that court.   The fact that we have Federal judges who were confirmed by the U.S.  Senate after being appointed by a U.S. President who would not be  bothered that the United States Department of Justice and the FBI had  people who would come before that judge and lie to that judge, and the  judge is not bothered--``oh, well.''   I remember after a bankruptcy hearing many years ago, I really liked  this judge, but he said: Louie, you seem bothered that the person who  filed bankruptcy got caught in a huge lie. That seemed to bother you.  But, Louie, they all lie. You just got to get used to it.   Well, I have still not gotten used to the idea that somebody can come  in and lie under oath before a judge without any ramifications coming  from that.   The fact that we have one or more FISA judges who are not bothered,  have done nothing, and have put no one in jail for the fraud committed  in the FISA court tells me we have to either get rid of the FISA  courts--go back to the way it was before, when if you had a matter of  national security, it was treated differently, but we didn't have  special Star Chambers where you came and had secret hearings. You just  went to a normal judge and handled things in camera, if necessary. We  have to either do that, get rid of the FISA courts, or we have to have  some safeguards to make sure that Americans' rights are protected.    But there is a motion and order here. The motion, it was secret,  classified, before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. This is  from April 23, 2012. It has now been declassified. I had no idea that  the Obama administration, the Justice Department, had sought this and  gotten it, but apparently, as broadly spread as information was about  American citizens whose names were unmasked and about what they were  saying when it didn't necessarily involve any foreign terrorist  organization--I am still not over the fact that some of us were lied  to, in order to get some of the PATRIOT Act reauthorized. That was not  the Obama administration I am talking about.   But this is a motion, and the title is: ``Government's Submission of  Amendments to Standard Minimization Procedures.'' That is the procedure  where, if it is an American citizen who is caught up in a phone  surveillance, phone conversations that are being surveilled by our  intelligence, the minimization is what the law requires where you mask  the name. You minimize the conversation so that the identity and other  information is not available for review, because the Constitution  protects American citizens and gives them Fourth Amendment and Fifth  Amendment rights that otherwise would be abused.   But this says: ``For FBI Electronic Surveillance and Physical Search  Conducted Under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and  Submission of Revised Minimization Procedures for the National  Counterterrorism Center, and Motion for Amended Orders Permitting Use  of Amended Minimization Procedures.''   Then I see that it was classified by Tashina Gauhar, Deputy Assistant  Attorney General. She answered directly to Rod Rosenstein, I guess  still does.   My understanding is, and I was told, that she is one of the key  people who was telling Jeff Sessions that he needed to recuse himself.  This is an attorney, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, who was loyal  to Sally Yates, is still loyal to Sally Yates, even though she refused  to do her constitutional duty to defend a constitutional act by  President Trump. She didn't care for the President, so she wasn't going  to carry out her constitutionally mandated duty.  [[Page H2911]]    Fortunately, Sally Yates is no longer there, and we have at least  some people there who are willing to carry out their obligation under  the Constitution.   But when my friend Jeff Sessions was saying he has talked to career  people and they have encouraged him, told him he needed to recuse  himself, I had heard that Tashina Gauhar was one of those people. You  can call her a career person. I hope her career is about ended, at  least in the Justice Department.   I also had understood she was someone who was trying to make Jeff  Sessions look bad. As the National Security Council liaison, the  notices of NSC meetings would go to her for the Attorney General. I was  told she would sit on those and not get them to the Attorney General.  He would get his notices late. He would be, therefore, the least  prepared at the NSC's critical meetings. Sometimes, he would have  conflicts because she didn't get him the notices early enough. Yet she,  I was told, is one of those who said: Oh, yeah, you have to recuse  yourself.   Her loyalties were more to President Obama and Sally Yates than they  appear to be, at least to me, to the Constitution itself. Yet she is  the one who is also pushing to change the minimization requirements.   What really got me as I read through this lengthy motion, I think  this is really the crux of it, over here at page 64.                                time  1245    Over here on page 64--so, obviously, it is a long motion on behalf of  the U.S. Government by Tashina Gauhar--it says:   ``The following underlined text will be inserted into the first  sentence: `The FBI may disseminate FISA-acquired information concerning  United States persons, which' ''--and then here is the underlined  part--`` `reasonably appears to be' ''--and then not underlined--``  `foreign intelligence information' ''--more underlining--`` `is  necessary to understand foreign intelligence information or assess its  importance, or is evidence of a crime being disseminated for a law  enforcement purpose.' ''   Look, when you get language like this that could allow the massive  distribution of what we were assured during reauthorization of these  type procedures--oh, no, it is so restricted.   See, here are the regulations. This is who can find out about an  American citizen who was surveilled electronically. It is protected. If  somebody--an American citizen--happens to be captured just because of  who they are talking to, you know, we have the minimization--nobody  gets to know who that person is. The requirements are so tough to  reveal the name.   Oh, no, not in this that was filed by Tashina Gauhar, if it  reasonably appears it is necessary to understand some intelligence.  Good grief, that throws the door wide open. You could justify giving  this constitutionally protected information to basically anybody. Well,  I think this will be important to help them understand some other  intelligence information. This is an outrage.   And I had no idea--I don't know of anybody who did know back in  2012--that the Obama Justice Department was throwing this door open  with this kind of vague and ambiguous terminology: Oh, well, if it  helps them understand other information, well, then they can see and  hear and get all of what otherwise should be constitutionally protected  information where the U.S. Government has been spying on U.S. citizens.   As I have said before, I mean, it is becoming more and more clear  that the only thing that Orwell got wrong was the year. It wasn't 1984.  But here, oh, yeah, anything that our DOJ, our intelligence, want to  disseminate to their friends, even if it is somebody that may be  working at the U.N., we will disclose it to anybody, because it will  help them understand other information better.   For everyone's sake, this is such an outrage. And here it is, 7  years--yeah, next month--7 years since this motion and order was filed  in order to allow the government to pass around top-secret information  that should be not only classified, it should never have been obtained  in the first place.   And then, through the investigation of the Donald Trump campaign, we  find out that, actually, you don't have to be a terrorist or a member  of a known terrorist organization. If you happen to be an ambassador,  which, I would imagine, most all of the Members of the House and Senate  have met with ambassadors and have talked to ambassadors of foreign  countries. And it had never crossed my mind that our Justice  Department, or our NSA, CIA, or FBI, that they may say: Oh, here is a  Senator or a U.S. Congressman who is having a conversation with a  foreign ambassador, so we get to surveil this Member of Congress or  Senate.   But, it turns out, if you have a conversation with an ambassador, you  can't be sure anymore that you don't have the FBI's electronic  intelligence community noting and logging and checking everything that  you are doing and saying. That is incredible. That is just almost  unfathomable, due to the protections that used to be observed for  American citizens. I thought we made progress.   The days when Attorney General Kennedy authorized a wiretap of Martin  Luther King, Jr., and Hoover were surveilling so many people that never  should have been allowed to be surveilled, I thought we had gotten  beyond that. Some of those activities were unconstitutional, were  illegal. I thought we had progressed to the point that Members of the  House and Senate, both sides of the aisle, should be deeply offended to  find out that their government may be spying on them, perhaps when they  talk to an ambassador. Even if it is not a terrorist country, it is  just extraordinary what we have been finding out in the last 2 years  about the extent of abuses of Americans' privacy rights.   I am hoping, though, that we can work across the aisle to rein in  some of these abuses, since the Obama administration is no longer there  and the protection that seems some of my colleagues were trying to  afford them, even though, in my mind, it meant really abuses of  Americans' constitutional rights.   And then, somewhat related, my friend Rand Paul, down the hall, this  story from Paul Bedard, yesterday, notes that, ``Senator Rand Paul  escalated his demand for an investigation into former Obama officials  who `concocted' the anti-Trump Russia scandal, revealing that former  CIA director John Brennan was the key figure who legitimized the  charges and discredited `dossier' against the President.''   And it is interesting. This term ``dossier'' everybody is using now  because of the former MI6, a former FBI informant who became no longer  trusted by the FBI, no longer usable, because he was untrustworthy by  the FBI, which was never conveyed to the FISA judge, that allowed the  judge to keep signing warrants based on this untrustworthy person, but  now to have this. As Senator Paul was reporting in a tweet, he said  that he had heard from a high-level source that Brennan helped to  validate the dossier in intelligence reports.   ``A high-level source tells me it was Brennan who insisted that the  unverified and fake Steele dossier be included in the intelligence  report . . . Brennan should be asked to testify under oath in Congress  ASAP,'' Senator Paul tweeted.   In an earlier tweet Wednesday, Senator Paul called for wide  investigation into former President Barack Obama and his team. ``Time  for Congress to investigate. What did President Obama know and when?  How did this hoax go on for so long unabated?''    It goes on to say:   ``Brennan has denied in the past that he included the salacious  dossier. . . . But at least two other top intelligence officials said  he did.''   And we do know, sort of parenthetically here, it is not in the  article, but we know Brennan has admitted being untruthful under oath  before the Senate. He has admitted perjuring himself when it suited  what he wanted to accomplish. And this is a guy that was overrunning  the Trump campaign, Donald Trump and his campaign--then Donald Trump,  now President Trump--just abusing his position as head of an  intelligence agency.   This says, ``And Washington Post editor Bob Woodward also said that  Brennan endorsed the dossier from Christopher Steele when he''--Bob  Woodward--``got a copy in late 2016. Woodward said that Brennan felt it  matched the Russia collusion charges he had heard.''  [[Page H2912]]    And I can't help but wonder now if where Brennan heard this was when  it came out of his own mouth.   ``The dossier was never considered true until it was recognized in  intelligence assessments and only after the late Senator John McCain  and top Obama officials helped circulate it, said Paul.''   ``The dossier was underwritten by the Democratic National Committee  and Hillary Clinton's campaign. By indicating the Kremlin interfered in  the election, it helped to fuel false allegations of foreign collusion  with the Trump campaign, leading to 2 years of nonstop  investigations.''   `` `I'm very concerned that it's becoming more clear that the Obama  administration was able to obtain a FISA warrant to spy on our campaign  based on phony opposition research from the Clinton campaign. Having  Federal law enforcement spy on a Presidential campaign based on phony  campaign research is really distressing and the true untold story,' he  said.''   This is a problem. I know others may feel otherwise.   I like Adam Schiff. He was put in charge of--back when he was in the  Judiciary Committee where I was serving, we actually impeached two  Federal judges who needed to be impeached, who needed to be removed,  and my colleague, Adam Schiff, did a wonderful job in handling that  effort. As far as I am concerned, he developed great credibility with  me in his professionalism in the way he handled the impeachment of  those two Federal judges.   But, over the last 2 years, as he has continued to say we know there  was collusion between the Trump administration and Russia and we have  evidence and on and on, his credibility when it comes to intelligence  matters has now been done great harm, not only here, but abroad. So I  think it is time to have a different chairman of intelligence.   It is too important that we have someone who is a chairman that  hasn't spent 2 years saying something was true that it turned out  wasn't. We need to have a Democrat who has credibility with foreign  governments, as well as here in the House, as well as in the Senate,  and there are people like that. There are people like that on both  sides of the aisle that have that kind of credibility that we know just  would not be spreading something that wasn't absolutely true.   So I agree with my friends that are on the Intelligence Committee,  and I appreciate my fellow Texan, Mike Conaway, for pointing out this  is now a problem and it needs to be addressed.                                time  1300    This article points out something I very much appreciate. The article  is from Gregg Re with FOX News. ``President Trump, in an exclusive,  wide-ranging interview Wednesday night with FOX News' Hannity''--and  that was a great interview my friend Sean Hannity had with the  President, really enjoyable, last night. But anyway, it says, `` . . .  to release the full and unredacted Foreign Intelligence Surveillance  Act warrants and related documents used by the FBI to probe his  campaign, saying he wants to `get to the bottom' of how the long- running Russia collusion narrative began.   ``Trump told anchor Sean Hannity that his lawyers previously had  advised him not to take that dramatic step out of fear that it could be  considered obstruction of justice. `I do, I have plans to declassify  and release. I have plans to absolutely release,' Trump said. `I have  some very talented people working for me, lawyers, and they really  didn't want me to do it early on. . . . A lot of people wanted me to do  it a long time ago.' '' I was one of those people.   He says: ``I'm glad I didn't do it. We got a great result without  having to do it, but we will. One of the reasons that my lawyers didn't  want me to do it is, they said, if I do it, they'll call it a form of  obstruction.''   Last fall, when I was in the Oval Office along with the President  talking for a while, and then his personal attorney came in, it seemed  clear to me that his personal attorney was very concerned about  declassifying the documents, that it was not the time to do it.   But there is no reason not to do it now, for sure. These things need  to come out. We need to see just how badly abused this system was.   My friend Jerry Nadler is chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary.  I remember my first term. There was no more vocal advocate on behalf of  civil liberties and privacy rights. I really hope that our chairman of  the Committee on the Judiciary will join in with Republicans to try to  correct this situation.   Clearly, there are still many people who are working in the Trump  administration who don't want President Trump to succeed, don't want  the President to succeed with what he is trying to do, what he promised  he would do.   I don't think anybody has to worry about President Trump being  abusive secretly of somebody's rights. But if this isn't handled now,  even though Republicans are not in the majority, if we don't clamp down  on what we see are clear abuses within the DOJ, within the intelligence  community, with the FISA courts, then we are easily headed for a time  when somebody else will come in there and they will see how the system  was abused during the Obama administration.   I don't know whether that will be a Democrat or a Republican, but I  am telling you, if we don't clamp down on it now, the abuses will allow  the arising of a Chavez. It will allow the arising of these people who  got elected and then became totalitarian.   I think there is a great deal to the poster that circulated: ``The  problem with socialism is, you can vote your way into it, but you have  to shoot your way out of it.''   That is what they found in Venezuela. They voted it in, but in order  to have true socialism, you have to move toward totalitarian. You have  to have such a powerful government. You can take from those who have  earned and who have worked and give to those who are more desirable to  have it, according to the government.   It is interesting that we have billionaires who are contributing  massive amounts of money to move toward socialism. Obviously, they  don't know their history well enough to know, that, yeah, they are  considered good friends of the movement--thank you; you are a hero--but  then when you move either toward communism--which true communism means  there is no government. Everybody just shares and shares alike out of  the goodness of their heart. You never can get there. You got to have a  totalitarian government. That is why communism doesn't work.   Socialism, they welcome the help of all the rich people. But once you  move toward real, true socialism, most of the time, the billionaires,  they are going to end up in prison or dead and their money confiscated.   So I am amazed that so many billionaires don't realize they are just  lackeys who are being appreciated now, but some day, they are going to  go under the bus, and their money is going to be relieved from them.   It is a very critical time. As the Mueller investigation has finally  concluded, having questioned Mr. Mueller numerous times, having done so  much research on the man I feel like I know him very well--obviously,  not as well as Eric Holder, who thought he would end up with an  indictment to keep going.   I can't help but wonder if we have a new Attorney General who came in  and realized there is nothing here. After all these subpoenas, tens of  millions of dollars, it is time to wrap it up.   I really do think Mueller, left to his own devices, would have just  kept an investigation going until every potential limitation on  anything he had done wrong had run out.   But it is time to reform FISA courts, time to reform DOJ, time to  reform our intelligence communities so the kind of abuses that have  just gone on will not continue and Presidents in the future, whether  Democrat or Republican, will not be tempted to abuse the system, as it  is now appearing to have been done.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the indulgence. At this time, I yield back  the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 1 o'clock and 6 minutes  p.m.),  [[Page H2913]]  under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow, Friday,  March 29, 2019, at 2:30 p.m.                            ____________________
