 Madam President, today I have the honor and privilege to  recognize Dr. Rochelle Walensky for her unwavering dedication, service,  and contributions to public health.   Before her time at the CDC, Dr. Walensky's groundbreaking work in  understanding the transmission, prevention, and treatment of HIV/AIDS  was paramount in addressing disparities in access to care, vaccine  efficacy, and distribution among underserved communities while  addressing gaps in knowledge, earning her widespread recognition and  acclaim.   With a drive toward making a difference, Dr. Walensky began her  tenure as Director of the CDC in 2021, in the midst of the  unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this challenge, Dr.  Walensky boldly stepped into the role, bringing her years of experience  and perspective to the Georgia-based Agency. As evidenced by the CORE  Health Equity Science and Intervention Strategy, which she unveiled  within months of starting, and declaration that racism is a serious  public health crisis, Dr. Walensky's passion for health equity has  ensured that equity is baked into the CDC's mission.   Dr. Walensky's pursuit of truth and dedication to the well-being of  others has left an indelible mark on the field of public health. Her  leadership during the most challenging public health crisis of this  generation saved lives. She has displayed true servant leadership by  prioritizing science, empathy, and public welfare during heightened  times of distrust and misinformation.   As we reflect on Dr. Walensky's remarkable achievements before she  begins the next chapter in her career, I am proud to honor her as a  pioneer for health equity. Her commitment to public health and pursuit  of the idea that we all have inherent value, combined with her tireless  efforts to protect and improve the lives of all individuals, will  forever inspire future generations of healthcare professionals. Thank  you, Dr. Walensky, for your great service to the American people.                            ____________________
