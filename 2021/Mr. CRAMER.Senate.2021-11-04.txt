 Mr. President, on October 28, North Dakota lost  one of our heroes. Lynn Aas of Minot, age 100, was to many of us the  face of the very best of the Greatest Generation. This child of the  Great Depression was raised on a farm near Benedict, ND, and was among  the 60,000 North Dakotans who served in the U.S. Armed Forces during  World War II.   He enlisted in the U.S. Army in August 1942, after completing his  first year of college. He became part of the 193rd Glider Infantry  Regiment of the 17th Airborne Division and, after extensive training,  was shipped to Liverpool, England, 2 years later.   Lynn's first combat experience was the Battle of the Bulge, one of  the costliest battles in American history with more than 80,000 U.S.  casualties, including 19,000 American soldiers killed. His division and  unit were flown to France and transported by trucks to Bastogne on  December 24, 1944. His platoon entered combat on January 7, fighting in  deep snow, frigid cold, and heavy fog. Beginning with 55 troopers, Lynn  was one of only five survivors to leave the front lines 3 weeks later.  The end of January brought his first 2 nights of sleep under a roof in  5 weeks. In February, his platoon fought along the Seigfried Line on  Nazi Germany's border.   Later in March 1945, he participated in Operation Varsity, the last  large-scale Allied airborne operation of the war. There he was towed in  a glider and landed behind enemy lines near Wesel, Germany. Lynn's  combat career ended on March 25 when he was wounded in his left arm by  shrapnel. Following extensive recuperation back in America, Lynn  remained in the Army another 5 months before being honorably discharged  on November 1, 1945.   For his valor and commendable 18 months of service during World War  II, he was awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star medals, in addition  to the Glider Badge, Combat Infantryman's Badge, Good Conduct Medal,  American Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal  with one Bronze Arrowhead and three Bronze Campaign Stars, and the  World War II Victory Medal.   After his discharge, Lynn earned business and law degrees from the  University of North Dakota, and moved to Minot in 1960, where he and  his wife Beverly raised four sons. He managed a medical clinic until  retirement, served in the North Dakota Legislature for 8 years and was  a delegate to the State's 1972 Constitutional Convention. Until his  final days, Lynn remained active in the Minot community.   He shared his World War II story throughout his life, giving a voice  to all veterans whose lives were forever impacted because of their  selfless service. Lynn attended reunions of the 17th Airborne Division,  and in 1999, he visited Europe with other 17th Airborne Division  veterans, visiting the locations where they had fought more than  [[Page S7786]]  a half century earlier. In 2015, he visited Belgium again to  commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge. As one of  the official representatives from the United States to this observance,  Lynn was greeted by many grateful Belgians who had not forgotten what  American soldiers did to liberate them from Hitler's tyranny.   In 2017, the French Government awarded Lynn its highest honor, the  Knight of the Legion of Honor medal, an award created by Napoleon in  1802. The letter from the French Government notifying Lynn of this  award carried these poignant words, ``73 years ago you gave your youth  to France and the French People. Many of your fellow soldiers did not  return, but they remain in our hearts . . . You saved us. We will never  forget. For us, the French people, you are a hero. Gratitude and  remembrance are forever in our souls.''   As he is buried today, we remember the remarkable life of Lynn Aas.  He is one of those personalities who, even at the age of 100, you think  is never going to die. Yet he has earned this opportunity to rest, and  I join all North Dakotans in sending our sincere condolences and  prayers to his family. I am grateful that I could count Lynn Aas as a  friend and one of my mentors in public service and public life. He will  be greatly missed. God bless his memory.                            ____________________
