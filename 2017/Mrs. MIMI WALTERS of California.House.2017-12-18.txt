 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  H.R. 4661, the United States Fire Administration, AFG, and SAFER  Program Reauthorization Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, 2017 has been the most devastating year in California  wildfire history. Thousands of California residents were displaced,  over 1 million  [[Page H10158]]  acres burned, and thousands of homes and businesses were destroyed by  this year's fires.   Now, more than ever, it is critical that California's fire  departments are fully staffed. SAFER grants provide resources for fire  departments that struggle to meet their staffing needs, including  Orange County Fire Authority in my district.   SAFER grants will undoubtedly help fire departments across the  country meet the needs of their communities, while ensuring  firefighters are ready and able to assist with wildfire suppression  efforts.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to offer my  sincerest condolences to CAL FIRE and the family of Cory Iverson, who  tragically lost his life this past week battling the Thomas fire.
