 Mr. Speaker, Republicans packed their expensive suits  and dresses this morning, and they are leaving town.   The American economy is being held hostage by Republicans as they try  to push their harmful agenda to strip millions of dollars from  Americans and the benefits they rely on.   In my home State of New York, the default on America bill could strip  2.3 million people of health insurance.   The default on America bill would also strip nutrition programs from  126,000 women, infants, and children in New York State.   The GOP plan to impose work requirements for SNAP recipients would  also burden those recipients with useless paperwork while doing  absolutely nothing to lower reliance on safety net programs.   Republicans are trying to strip benefits from the American people.  They are trying to pull the wool over our eyes.   This is the default on America act working against America.                            ____________________
