 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of amendment 191 to the  Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill. This  amendment prohibits funds from being used to issue a license relating  to the sale of commercial passenger aircraft to the Islamic Republic of  Iran.   The JCPOA allowed for the sale of commercial aircraft to Iran Air,  but it is an Iranian airline that the Treasury Department designated in  2013 for providing material, support, and services to the Iranian  Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.                                time  1430    What changed in those 3 years from that designation to the signing of  the JCPOA? Congress has yet to see a report of good behavior on the  part of the Iranians. The Ayatollahs continue to call America the ``Big  Satan.''   The sales of these aircraft must be stopped so long as the Iranians  continue to be the leading state sponsor of terrorism.   I thank Representative Roskam for his leadership on this issue and  hope that it passes with unanimous support.
