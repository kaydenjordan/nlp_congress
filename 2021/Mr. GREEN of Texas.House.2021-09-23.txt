 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise, a proud, liberated  Democrat unbought and unbossed in the spirit of Shirley Chisholm.   And I rise today with a very simple message: Black lives still  matter. It doesn't matter who is in power, Black lives matter. The  circumstances haven't changed. Black lives matter wherever they happen  to be. They matter in Haiti, and they matter at the southern border.   Mr. Speaker, what you see here is despicable and reprehensible. This  is what is happening at the southern border, persons on horses lashing  out apparently at persons who are from Haiti. Black lives still matter,  and it is important to note that these persons, when they are rounded  up apparently and sent back to Haiti, are given $50, a phone card and  some food. Many of these persons haven't been to Haiti in over a  decade--over 10 years--and they are given $50, a phone card, and some  food.   Black lives matter. This has got to change. This is why I have  introduced H. Res. 670. It condemns the actions that we have seen at  the border; it condemns the actions. It doesn't condemn the people; it  condemns the actions. I have some personal thoughts about the behavior  of the people and the people themselves, but this resolution condemns  these actions. I believe all people of goodwill should find these  actions abhorrent and deplorable.   I also believe that those who tolerate injustice--this is an  injustice--those who tolerate injustice perpetuate injustice.   I am asking that H. Res. 670 be brought to the floor of this House so  that this House can go on record as opposing what we have seen at the  border that is inhumane. We ought to go on record opposing this.   We have gone on record opposing things that have been said by people  who are within the House and without the House. This House has gone on  record when we have had these seminal moments in time. This is another  seminal moment in time that requires some time on the floor of this  House to show the world that we stand for justice and that this  injustice should not stand.   Finally, I indicated that when they are deported to Haiti they  receive $50, some food, and a phone card. But here is something that I  find appalling as well: Haitians have been given temporary protected  status in this country. Mr. Speaker, if you were here at a certain time  prior to a certain time, you were given temporary protected status.  Well, we are sending people who are Haitians back to Haiti who haven't  been there in 10 years, but there are others who will stay because we  are saying that the conditions are not acceptable to send people back  to Haiti. That contradiction has to be reconciled. We shouldn't be  sending people to Haiti when we said that Haiti is not safe for us to  send Haitians to.   Mr. Speaker, Black lives still matter. It doesn't matter who is in  power, Mr. Speaker. Circumstances don't change, and until they change,  a liberated Democrat is going to continue to say that we must be a part  of that change.   I pray that we will have H. Res. 670 brought to the floor so that we  can show the world that we believe Black lives matter.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have  voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 283.
