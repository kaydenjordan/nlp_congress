 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 1374 is a bipartisan bill that has long-time support in the  House. We passed it by voice vote on suspension in the 115th Congress  and again in the 116th Congress. The legislation reauthorizes the State  Energy Program and strengthens our energy emergency planning and  preparedness efforts.   This is an important bill, and we are reminded why every year when we  witness how States must respond to a variety of hazards, including  hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, fuel supply disruptions, and physical  and cyber threats.   We have had harmful hurricanes and will continue to do so.  Consequently, there is an ongoing urgency for State energy planning and  action.   The electricity crises in Texas and surrounding States this past  winter provides a vivid example for State responses to energy  emergencies; and, of course, the Colonial Pipeline incident last month  had State energy officials working with Federal authorities to make  sure people had fuel when they needed it.                                time  1415    This legislation provides States with the flexibility they need to  address local energy challenges.   It also ensures that State energy security planning efforts address  fuel supply issues, assess State energy profiles, address potential  hazards to each energy sector, mitigate risk to enhance reliability,  and incorporate regional planning efforts.   H.R. 1374 also helps States protect fuel and electric infrastructure  from physical and cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities. It makes  sure we are thinking ahead, not just about an actual threat, but how  our energy and electric systems might be vulnerable in a broader sense.   The bill also encourages mutual assistance, an essential part of  responding and restoring in the event of an energy emergency.   Prioritizing and elevating energy security planning and emergency  preparedness is an important step in the face of increased threats,  vulnerabilities, and interdependencies of energy infrastructure and  end-use systems.   Protecting energy security requires defense in depth, which means a  strong energy sector, strong State capabilities, and ensuring sector  agencies like the Department of Energy have the tools they need to  respond to energy emergencies. This ensures we can help people in  energy emergencies, whether caused by weather or cyberattack, and help  them when they need it most.   I urge support of H.R. 1374, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would state in conclusion that I urge  strong support for H.R. 1374, and I yield back the balance of my time.
