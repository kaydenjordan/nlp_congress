 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Nahunta mayor, Ronnie E. Jacobs, who passed away on Thursday, March  29, at the age of 64. Mayor Jacobs had been the mayor of Nahunta,  Georgia, in Georgia's First Congressional District, for over 15 years  and across four different decades.   Mayor Jacobs lived in Nahunta for his entire life, taking great pride  in his town, and truly caring about its residents and well-being. A  testament to his hard work for the well-being of Nahunta, Mayor Jacobs  founded Neighbors Helping Neighbors there in 2004, which is a nonprofit  that helps citizens search for jobs, purchase homes, apply for  nutrition assistance, and much more.   Mayor Jacobs has also done an exceptional job guiding his residents  through unique situations for Nahunta, including population changes,  hurricanes, and wildfires.   Mayor Jacobs will be remembered by many in Nahunta as one of the best  leaders the city has ever had. His family and the city of Nahunta are  in my thoughts and prayers.                            ____________________
