 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Major General Christopher Donahue, the commander of the 82nd Airborne  Division and the last American soldier to leave Afghanistan.   A native of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, and as an officer in our  Nation's special forces, General Donahue has devoted his life to the  service of our Nation.   During the global war on terrorism, General Donohue has led soldiers  in both Iraq and Afghanistan. He has always put his soldiers and their  mission first. As the final soldier in Afghanistan, General Donahue  showed his devotion to our Nation yet again.   This man is a leader, and our Nation is well-served with him  commanding  [[Page H4534]]  our airborne division. I am grateful for General Donahue and for all of  the brave soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who have served in  Afghanistan. Their service has made our Nation more secure. No  political decision can take away what their service has meant.                            ____________________
