 Mr. President, thank you. I appreciate your comment, ``The  Senator for Alabama.'' That is exactly how I like to be recognized, so  thank you very much.                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2486    Mr. President, I rise today to appeal to my colleagues to support the  renewal of vital funding for historically Black colleges and  universities and all minority-serving institutions.   I have risen in this body on more than one occasion to talk about the  importance of HBCUs and minority-serving institutions.   Alabama is home to 14 HBCUs--more than any other State in the  country. They are part of the fabric of our economy in Alabama and a  part of the fabric of our society. They are the pride of their  communities. They are the pride of those folks who went there and had  relatives who went there and even those individuals who are not alums  or relatives of alums.   Our HBCUs are a source of enduring pride in our State and across this  country. They serve an incredibly important function. They educate  those from underserved communities more than any other college or  university. It is important that we continue funding them because their  challenges with funding are great.   They do not have the endowments that other colleges and universities  have. They don't have the source of funding. It is only through our  efforts in Congress and across the country that we can continue the  great work of these HBCUs.   Recently, the House passed what is known as the FUTURE Act, which is  H.R. 2486. My colleague Senator Scott and I have a similar bill that  has been introduced in the Senate because, at  [[Page S5594]]  the end of September, all funding for HBCUs is set to end.   Our act would extend that. We need to make sure that we fund all of  our HBCUs, that they are not left in the lurch and not left with any  uncertainty about their future funding. I truly believe this is such a  bipartisan effort that we can get this across the finish line. I have  urged Senator McConnell to put this on the floor because it is quite  urgent.   As in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2486, which is at the  desk; that the bill be considered read a third time and passed; and  that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I rise today with deep sadness, but  also with reverence to remember Dr. Ravindra Behari ``Ravi'' Lal, who  died on July 23, 2019. Dr. Lal was an esteemed educator and innovator  in the field of physics. His impact on Alabama A&M University and the  Huntsville area is incalculable.   Dr. Lal was born on October 5, 1935, in Agra, India. He was one of  three children born to Avadh Behari and Radhapyari Lal Mathur. Dr. Lal  earned his Ph.D. in solid state physics from Agra University in 1962  and married his wife Usha in the same year. In 1964, Dr. Lal and Usha  moved to Huntsville, where they raised their son Amit. That same year,  Dr. Lal began his teaching and research career for the National Academy  of Sciences as a resident research associate at NASA/Marshall Space  Flight Center. It was there that Dr. Lal conducted groundbreaking work  on the effects of radiation on thermal control coatings for Apollo and  other spacecrafts. Through a special recommendation from famed  aerospace engineer, Dr. Wernher von Braun, Dr. Lal earned a rare  extension of his postdoctoral associate position with NASA.   Following his time at Marshall Space Flight Center, Dr. Lal worked  for 2 years as a senior scientist and assistant professor at the Indian  Institute of Technology in Delhi, India. He returned to the United  States in 1970 as a senior research associate for the University of  Alabama in Huntsville, leaving in 1973 to become an associate professor  of physics at Paine College in Augusta, GA.   Dr. Lal made his return to Huntsville in 1975 to begin his long and  impressive career at Alabama A&M University--AAMU--rising from  associate professor of physics to department chair to university  eminent scholar. In 1978, during his tenure at AAMU, he was chosen by  NASA as a principal investigator for a space shuttle experiment on the  maiden flight of the Spacelab-3 Mission in 1985, making Dr. Lal one of  the first university professors to be selected for an experiment on  space shuttle and the first from AAMU. During this project, he worked  as one of the pioneers in crystal growth experiments in microgravity.  Dr. Lal later served for 7 years as the principal investigator for a  project from NASA's Commercialization of Space program.   Dr. Lal was deeply committed to bettering the AAMU and Huntsville  communities during his tenure as an educator and beyond. In 1997, Dr.  Lal launched the popular Annual Nobel Laureate Lecture Series, which  has since brought 20 Nobel Prize winners to Huntsville. He was  instrumental in establishing AAMU's masters and doctorate programs in  physics. AAMU celebrated his commitment to his field and students in  2005, naming Dr. Lal an AAMU eminent scholar. Recognized as one of the  first Indian couples in Huntsville, Dr. Lal and his wife Usha mentored  and advised Indian families new to their city and were actively  involved in helping to build a temple, the Hindu Cultural Center of  North Alabama, for the local Indian community. Dr. Lal also served on  the board for AshaKiran, an organization that provides assistance to  individuals from multicultural backgrounds that are experiencing  crises.  [[Page S5599]]    Dr. Lal was highly respected and celebrated in his field, earning  recognition from the Alabama House of Representatives in 1985 for his  achievements on NASA's Spacelab-3 experiment. He was also awarded  NASA's Public Service Achievement award for those same achievements by  NASA Administrator James C. Fletcher. Dr. Lal was selected for the  Professional of the Year award by the Huntsville Association of  Technical Societies, the Noble prize in Science by the National  Association for Equal opportunity in Higher Education, and the Lifetime  Achievement Award from AAMU Research Institute.   Dr. Lal will be dearly missed by all whose lives he touched, both  through his work as a brilliant educator and scientist and as a pillar  in the Huntsville community. Both Alabama and the United States have  benefited immeasurably from his contributions to the field of physics  and space research.                            ____________________
