 Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening on behalf of some  of my greatest constituents, Oak Ridge High School, in the Third  District of Tennessee.   The Department of Energy created the National Science Bowl in 1991.  This is one of the most prestigious competitions in math and science  for our high school and middle school students.   Oak Ridge High School is the only high school in the great State of  Tennessee to participate in the finals this year that will take place  this weekend.   I would like to announce that Joseph Andress, Henry Shen, Steven Qu,  Melody Guo, and Batu Odbadrakh are our outstanding students for Oak  Ridge High School.   Go Oak Ridge. Go National Science Bowl. Go America.                            ____________________
