 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Respect for  Marriage Act. Over my time in Congress as the first openly gay Member  of color elected in history, the fight for LGBTQ equality has remained  a critical and personal focus of mine. Last week, the Senate took long- overdue action to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act, and when my  colleagues and I pass the Respect for Marriage Act in the House today,  it will mean the world to me, my loved ones, and to millions of  Americans.   Nearly 10 years ago, at the start of my career in Congress, the  Supreme Court ruled in Obergefell v. Hodges that marriage equality is a  fundamental protected right. We took to the streets in fervent  celebration of this cornerstone victory for our community.   This bill will pass today, but it is a reminder of the necessity of  our vigilance in the fight for human rights and the need to hold the  judicial branch accountable. We must rise to the challenge, and we will  prevail.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank a member of my staff  on the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, who will not be continuing  with us into the next Congress.   Kassie Stagner has served our committee both as a clerk and a  research assistant. During her time on staff, she has also shown a  willingness to go the extra mile, take on any job that needs doing, and  to do so with incredible attention to detail. Her work proved  invaluable to many of the committee's oversight investigations. Through  long days and hard projects, Kassie brought a sense of humor and a  Texas charm to everything she did.   The work of my committee, this Congress, and our government to honor  and to support our veterans was made better by Kassie's service, and  she will be deeply missed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his  generous yield.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank a member of my staff on the House  Committee on Veterans' Affairs who will not be continuing with us into  the next Congress.
