 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  service of Lima Company, 3rd Battalion, 25th Marines, Sergeant Major  Dan Altieri.   Sergeant Major was the living embodiment of the Marine Corps motto  ``semper fi,'' always faithful, dedicating more than 30 years of  service to the Corps.   Suffering unprecedented losses during its 2005 Iraq deployment, he  led his marines in multiple combat operations, and Sergeant Major  Altieri played a vital role in caring for Lima upon its return home.   As his marines and so much more of Central Ohio mourned for Lima  Company in the wake of tragedy, it was left to Altieri to hold his  marines together, a task requiring both strength and compassion.   Outside the Marines, he was a family man. He was a loving husband and  father. His devotion to family was reflected in the love for his wife,  Kovette, two grown sons, a sister, and his mentorship of others.   Today, the hearts of so many Ohioans are with the Sergeant Major's  wife and family, his Marine Corps family, the law enforcement  community, and to the countless lives touched by this remarkable U.S.  marine.                            ____________________
