 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, never before has this country marked the day that a  fundamental freedom was taken from us. This Saturday, for the first  time, we will.   Almost 1 year ago, the Supreme Court's shameful and unprecedented  Dobbs decision stripped a constitutional right from all Americans, and  the harm it triggered has only grown in the year since.  [[Page H2997]]                                     time  1015    We are here to say enough is enough. Extremist Republicans around the  country created this reproductive healthcare crisis against the will of  the people with their out-of-touch, anti-choice agenda.   People should have the right to make decisions over their own bodies,  especially healthcare decisions, not this body, nor politicians, nor  Justices. That process has been now aided and enabled by Republicans in  this Chamber, so it is time for some accountability right here and  right now. Time to put our Speaker and the Members of his party on the  record in front of their constituents. It is time, really, to restore  the right to abortion.   One year after the fall of Roe, we refuse to back down from the fight  for reproductive freedom.   Our bodies, our choices. That is what this, in essence, is about:  freedom. We are here using every single tool at our disposal to force  action on this issue.   I am proud to join with our fellow Pro-Choice Caucus leaders, our  membership, Representative Diana DeGette and Representative Judy Chu,  in leading this discharge petition on the Women's Health Protection Act  and demanding that the Speaker let us vote.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sign it.
