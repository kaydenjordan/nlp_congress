 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  5314, the ``Protecting Our Democracy Act,'' spearheaded by my friend  and colleague on the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th  Attack on the United States Capitol, Adam Schiff.   This bill bolsters congressional oversight authority and the  important powers vested in Congress by Article I of the Constitution.  It also includes a host of other good-government measures to make our  entire government more ethical and more accountable to the people we  serve.   As chairman of both the Committee on Homeland Security and the Select  Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States  Capitol, I know firsthand how important congressional oversight is to  our legislative process. And I have seen how dedicated the forces  aligned against representative democracy are.   Protecting our democracy is protecting our homeland, and protecting  our homeland means protecting our democracy.   I am particularly supportive of title IV of this bill, which amends  the United States Code to reaffirm the House's right to enforce its  subpoenas through civil suits in Federal court. The title would also  expedite consideration of those suits in the courts and enhance  penalties for noncompliance with congressional subpoenas.   While I firmly believe the House already possesses the ability to  seek civil enforcement of its subpoenas, some recent court decisions  have questioned it. This bill leaves no room for such doubt.   Almost a century ago, the U.S. Supreme Court said that Congress needs  information to govern wisely and effectively, and it must often seek  out others--often by compulsion--to obtain it. To effectively exercise  our legislative duties, the Constitution implicitly grants enforcing  processes.   Madam Speaker, this bill furthers our ability as legislators to do  our job wisely and effectively. I encourage my colleagues to join me in  voting for the ``Protecting Our Democracy Act.''
