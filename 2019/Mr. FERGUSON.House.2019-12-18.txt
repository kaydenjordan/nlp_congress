 Madam Speaker, well, here we are, on the verge of doing  exactly what America doesn't want us to do and what they feared that  you would do.   In 2016, I, along with 63 million American voters representing 304  electoral college votes, went to the polls, and we raised our  collective political middle finger to D.C. and voted for Donald Trump,  folks like my father, who watched this place destroy his profession of  community banking; my friends and family in the textile industry who  saw their way of life destroyed following NAFTA; Americans in rural  areas whose opportunity and life and voice have been drowned out by the  screams of socialist Democrats; our friends and neighbors living in  poverty and crime, broken-down, project-based public housing, who for  generations have been told by this place: ``This is the best that we  think you can do. Here is your check. God bless you. Now, move along.''  Those voters.   Now you want to remove our voice from office. Well, our voice will be  heard. I stand here determined to make sure that it will be because we  will fight back against this corrupt and unfair impeachment process.   How dare you, the liberal elites, the condescending bureaucrats, and  every other kind of swamp critter in this godforsaken place tell the  American public who the President should be. That is the job of the  American voter, not yours.   This whole flipping rodeo is a sham and a shame, and it will not be  forgotten.
