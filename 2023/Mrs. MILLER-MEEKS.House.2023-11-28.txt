 Mr. Speaker, the American Concrete Institute  recognizes and awards construction projects across the world every  year.   During the 2023 ACI Excellence in Concrete Construction Awards, the  I-74 Mississippi River Bridge, located in Bettendorf, Iowa, took home  first place in the infrastructure category.   This regional project was started with the intention of improving  access across the Mississippi River. The bridge was recently updated to  include interchange ramp reconfigurations and interstate and local  roadways improvements.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the architects, engineers, contractors,  and suppliers that worked so diligently to improve this vital link  within the Quad Cities across the Mississippi River.        Congratulations to Sam Raymond, Carson Guzman, and Ryan Peters     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize three very  impressive Norwalk High School students and their recent achievements.   I congratulate Sam Raymond, Carson Guzman, and Ryan Peters for  receiving the National Speech and Debate Association's 2022-2023  Speaking and Service Award.   Every year the National Speech and Debate Association recognizes  students who go above and beyond in their service to their teams,  schools, and communities with the Speaking and Debate Service Award.   From more than 140,000 members, fewer than 140 students receive this  recognition and reached the maximum number of service points in the  student honor society.   These three individuals earned distinction through their impressive  record for speech and debate competition, as well as community service,  public speaking, and leadership activities.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I congratulate Sam Raymond, Carson Guzman,  and Ryan Peters for their award.            Recognizing Zach Graham, the 2023 Pat Tillman Scholar     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Zach  Graham, the 2023 Pat Tillman Scholar.   This award is inspired by the legacy of Pat Tillman who left the NFL  to serve as a U.S. Army Ranger and ultimately gave his life in service.   Zach Graham is a dedicated Army veteran and a third-year graduate  student at the University of Iowa College of Dentistry.   In 2014, Zach graduated from Iowa State University with a double  major in anthropology and international studies and a minor in military  science. Zach commissioned as an intelligence officer in the Army and  he was stationed in Germany as the lead intelligence officer for the  Army's aviation unit in Europe.   Zach transitioned from the military to dentistry when he found his  calling, a profession that allows him to make a tangible impact with  precision and artistry.   Zach Graham's dedication to service above self is truly commendable,  and we eagerly anticipate the remarkable contributions he will continue  to make.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Zach on receiving this incredible honor  and award.      Congratulations to Mrs. Suzi Jones as Theatre Educator of the Year     Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to congratulate a  passionate and impressive educator from Iowa's very own Pella High  School, Mrs. Suzi Jones.   Mrs. Jones was recently recognized by the Iowa High School Speech  Association as their Theatre Educator of the Year.   Every year, IHSSA selects the winner for this award based on  community and statewide impact. Mrs. Jones was surprised with this  award in front of the entire Pella High School student body.   As a parent, I am grateful to all educators and teachers dedicated to  shaping the lives of our future generations.   Mr. Speaker, I thank them for their exceptional effort and, once  again, I congratulate Mrs. Jones for her award.                            ____________________
