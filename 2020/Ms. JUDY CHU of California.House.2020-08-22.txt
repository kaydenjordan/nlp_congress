 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of H.R. 8015, the Delivering for America Act, because I will  not tolerate sabotage of the U.S. Postal Service.   This week, I went to my local post office to fight back against the  attacks on mail delivery that my Republican colleagues now claim never  happened. But I stand by those who know better than anyone, our  country's postal workers.   They talked about how cuts to overtime are forcing mail carriers to  abandon their routes halfway through, and how deliberate reductions to  operating capacity mean that they cannot meet their community's needs.   My constituents also know better. Every day, I have heard from  seniors whose medications have been delayed, small businesses unable to  get orders to customers, and workers waiting to receive a check.  Pharmacies in my district have even needed to tell customers to pick  their medicine up in person instead of relying on the mail.   No one should have to risk exposure to COVID-19 just to pick up a  prescription, especially not so the President can suppress votes in  November.   Madam Speaker, vote to save the post office.
