 Madam Speaker, as chair of the House Committee on Foreign  Affairs, I speak in strong support of the international provisions of  the American Rescue package. With a total of $10 billion, this is a  relatively small yet critical investment in fighting COVID and its  effects around the world.   Pandemics do not respect international borders. To control this  pandemic, we need to mitigate its global spread. This provision puts  global health front and center, supporting efforts to relieve  overburdened health systems and medical workers and help governments  develop and distribute vaccines.   To address the humanitarian crises that have been exacerbated by this  pandemic, this provision will provide funding for the most immediate  lifesaving assistance, including shelter, food, clean water, basic  medical care. Additionally, it provides COVID-related relief for  vulnerable refugees who are already vulnerable.   Madam Speaker, this provision would also provide flexible funding for  economic support to help ensure that even more need isn't created as a  result of the economic impacts of COVID, which are already severe.
