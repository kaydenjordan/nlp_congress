 Mr. Speaker, in his column yesterday, Pat  Buchanan wrote that, through most of its history, the Republican Party  was the high tariff party, favoring tariffs rather than income taxes.  He wrote that those tariffs helped the U.S. to become the strongest  industrial power in the world.   In the 1950s and 1960s, 53 percent of American jobs were industrial  based, many of them white collar. Now only around 10 percent are in  manufacturing, and many thousands of college graduates are working as  waiters and waitresses or in other low-paying jobs and living with  their parents.   Fears of a trade war are being greatly exaggerated. We have been in a  trade war for many years, and we have been losing. With only 4 percent  of the world's population, we buy almost 23 percent of the world's  goods.   Every country wants into our markets, and we have tremendous leverage  on trade that we haven't been using. President Trump's proposed tariffs  apply only to two products. I commend him for his effort to try to  protect American jobs.                            ____________________
