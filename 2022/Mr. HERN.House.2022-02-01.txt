 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in solemn memory of an Oklahoma  hero, Technical Sergeant Marshal Roberts.   Sergeant Roberts had a strong love for his country and was intensely  proud to serve in the Oklahoma Air National Guard. He was deployed to  Camp Taji in Iraq in support of Operation Inherent Resolve when his  unit was engaged in enemy fire.   Sergeant Roberts gave his life defending our Nation and the freedoms  we enjoy every day, leaving behind a proud wife and a loving daughter.  Since his death, Oklahomans have shown overwhelming support for  Sergeant Roberts' family and have taken every opportunity to celebrate  his memory.   I will never forget when his remains were brought back to Tulsa in  March 2020, when the city had just begun lockdown. Still, there were  hundreds and hundreds of Oklahomans waiting outside the airport to  welcome him home and mourn with his family.   At his funeral, at the dedication for the highway named after him, at  our Memorial Day service, and at countless events since his death,  Oklahomans have shown up in massive numbers to support and to honor his  service and to thank his family.   You see, Oklahomans recognize the importance of military service and  the  [[Page H324]]  sacred responsibility we all have to keep his legacy alive.   We can rest in the knowledge that Sergeant Roberts' sacrifice was not  in vain. He laid down his life for hundreds of millions of Americans  that he never knew and future generations yet to come.   Mr. Speaker, renaming the Owasso Post Office in his honor is a small  but meaningful gesture and ensures that our community proudly keeps his  story alive for all the generations to come.
