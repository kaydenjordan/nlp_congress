 Mr. President, today let the Senate recognize the  70th anniversary of the Marine Corps Logistics Base in Albany, GA.   For 70 years, Marines Corps Logistics Base Albany has provided  critical support to its tenants, including the Marine Corps Logistics  Command and Marine Depot Maintenance Command/Production Plant Albany.   Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany and its outstanding personnel  provide the U.S. Marine Corps with advanced logistical capabilities  vital to U.S. national security.   Under the leadership of Col. Michael J. Fitzgerald, Mr. Leonard  Housey, and Sgt. Maj. Auburne I. Edwards II, the base has been  recognized for its leadership in energy security. Last year, the  Secretary of the Navy awarded the Energy Excellence Award to Marine  Corps Logistics Base Albany for its commitment to energy security  planning, cybersecurity, and energy reduction.   On behalf of the State of Georgia and the U.S. Senate, I express our  heartfelt gratitude to each servicemember and civilian marine who has  served at Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany.                            ____________________
