 Mr. Speaker, the opioid crisis has had a devastating  impact on communities throughout our country. In my conversations with  members of law enforcement, public safety officials, and public health  experts, it has become clear that serious reforms are necessary to  ensure our criminal justice system effectively contributes to efforts  to combat the substance abuse epidemic.   The 2018 National Institute on Drug Abuse data shows that every day,  128 people in the United States die from an overdose of opioids. The  misuse of and addiction to opioids, including prescription pain  relievers, heroin, and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl is a severe  national crisis that affects public health, as well as social and  economic welfare.   Next month, I am going to hold a roundtable discussion on this issue  in my district to learn best practices and ensure that our stakeholders  stem the tide before it becomes a crisis in our community. I am going  to use the measures that my Democratic colleagues instituted to bring  that to our community to make sure that it does not happen in the  Virgin Islands.                            ____________________
