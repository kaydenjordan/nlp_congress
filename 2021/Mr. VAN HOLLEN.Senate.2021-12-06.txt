 Mr. President, I stand today to extend my heartiest  congratulations to Ann Mathis--``Andi''--as she prepares to retire from  the National Endowment for the Arts--NEA--after 42 years of dedicated  service.   A resident of Bethesda, MD, Andi has served as the NEA's program  specialist for States and regions, using her expertise in arts  management and best practices in grantmaking to support the work of 50  State arts agencies, six regional arts organizations, and six U.S.  Territories.   Andi first joined the NEA after graduating from Cornell University  and then earning a master's degree in community arts management from  the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Andi began her career in  the NEA's Grants Office and Office of Management Analysis before  settling into her role with States and regions in the Partnership  Division.   During her distinguished tenure, Andi has nurtured partnerships with  State arts agencies and regional arts organizations, building a network  that has extended the reach of Federal support for the arts. As a  guiding force in the NEA's Partnership Division and a font of  institutional knowledge, Andi's expertise, dedication, and sense of  humor have made her a beloved icon in national arts funding. Often,  State and local officials would line up, literally, to obtain Andi's  guidance and insight.   Andi's efforts have included extensive work with both the Maryland  Arts Council and Maryland's Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation. She was also  instrumental in centering the role of arts and culture in Federal  disaster relief and recovery efforts, representing the NEA on disaster  preparedness task forces and Federal Government working groups. Her  outstanding work at the NEA has earned her numerous Distinguished  Service Awards and other commendations over the years.   Andi's greatest pleasure has always been her beautiful family. While  at the NEA, she married, had two daughters, Allison and Melinda, and  now delights in her daughters' growing families, which enabled Andi to  become ``Grandi.'' A devoted mother and grandmother, Andi is renowned  for her sewing prowess and her own line of ``Grandi'' children's  clothing.   After more than four decades in the Federal Government, Andi plans to  continue her legacy of service in retirement, working in the area of  adult literacy, which will include tutoring through the Literacy  Council of Montgomery County. We know that she will take seriously the  Jewish tradition of tikkun olam, repairing the world, as she continues  to make a difference in the lives of others.   I ask my colleagues to join me in extending our gratitude to Andi  Mathis for her outstanding service to our Nation and in sending our  best wishes to her as she begins her next adventure.                            ____________________
