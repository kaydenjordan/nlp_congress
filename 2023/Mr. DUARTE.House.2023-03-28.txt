 Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1.   We hear today that it is not very interesting to discuss the  Constitution to some. Well, let's see the Constitution in operation  today.   We are the champions of abundance over here, and we want to show the  American people, the working families in America, what an abundance  agenda looks like and show them our commitment to improving their lives  with abundance.   We stand here arguing, in my opinion, with the lords of scarcity.  They want to protect our forests until our forests burn. They want to  leave American oil in the ground while gas prices go up for American  working families, while energy costs in my district in California go  over 25 cents a kilowatt, where working families in my district open  the screen door in 105-degree temperatures because they can't afford to  run their air-conditioners.   Yet, the lords of scarcity think we need more solar panels on more  high-income homes, getting off the grid, leaving the cost of delivering  electricity to the working families in America.   When we drill it in America, when we dam it in America, when we nuke  it in America, when we frack it in America, we save American jobs and  increase American families' affordability.   When we grow it in America, when we log it in America, when we make  it in America, we create jobs and create affordability, and we do it  more sustainably than anywhere else on Earth.   Over here, we are the champions of abundance, and we are here today  to tell the American working family that there is a better choice for  them. We can thrive. We can have affordability. We can have  sustainability. We can have opportunity right here in America.   With H.R. 1, drill oil now, we can deliver American working families  a better option.   Please keep talking about how silly you think the Constitution is. It  is in play right now.
