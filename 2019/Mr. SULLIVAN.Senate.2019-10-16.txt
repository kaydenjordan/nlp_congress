 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks prior to the vote for Ambassador Barrett.    Madam President, a few weeks ago, I had an opportunity  to come to the floor and talk about the outstanding public service of  some senior U.S. marines: Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, Secretary of  Homeland Security General Kelly, and the outgoing Chairman of the Joint  Chiefs, Gen. Joseph Dunford. The service these gentlemen have given to  their Nation includes almost 140 years of combined Active-Duty military  service in the Marine Corps but also at the highest levels of  government at a critical time in our Nation's history.   Men and women who are committed to the service of our Nation are  continuing to follow in the footsteps of these three very impressive  U.S. Marine generals who brought the Marine Corps ethos of honor,  courage, and commitment to our Nation's military and to their work in  government. We should all be thankful for that.   At the end of September, I had the privilege of attending the  swearing-in of a member of the new team that President Trump is putting  together in terms of national security, GEN Mark Milley, as the next  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, now in the position succeeding  General Dunford. At the Department of Defense, we have Secretary Esper,  Secretary McCarthy, the Secretary of the Army, and General Milley who  have all served their country with honor and will continue to do so.   Now we are considering the nomination of Ambassador Barbara Barrett  to be the next Secretary of the Air Force. In fact, we are going to be  voting on her nomination in a few moments.   I want to talk about her experience and her qualifications, which are  diverse and very impressive. I think she is extremely well qualified to  be the next Secretary of the U.S. Air Force.   Let me provide just a bit about her background and exceptional  experience. She is a private pilot, astronaut, Deputy Federal Aviation  Administrator, past CEO of the Aerospace Corporation, past member of  the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services and Defense  Business Board. Importantly, she is a former U.S. Ambassador to  Finland. That is a very impressive resume, a very impressive  background.   I first met Ambassador Barrett in 2015 when I had the opportunity to  share dinner with her and the late Senator John McCain. Prior to that  dinner, I was talking to Senator John McCain, and he told me how highly  he thought of Ambassador Barrett. I can state--and I think many of my  Senate colleagues will agree--that there can be no better an  endorsement than that from Senator McCain.   Ambassador Barrett will be taking over from Dr. Heather Wilson, who  did an outstanding job as Secretary of the Air Force. Secretary  Wilson's leadership was critical in rebuilding the U.S. Air Force,  which had shrunk to its smallest level ever just a few years ago since  the Air Force was created in the late 1940s. We had to start bringing  it back. She did a great job on that, and I know Ambassador Barrett is  committed to continuing that rebuilding of this critically important  branch of our military.   Another important element of Ambassador Barrett's experience is that  as a former U.S. Ambassador to Finland, she understands the strategic  importance of the Arctic and what is happening in terms of great power  competition in the Arctic.   I want to spend a few minutes talking about that critically important  part of the world and the role of my State, the great State of Alaska.  Dating back to Gen. Billy Mitchell, who is the father of the U.S. Air  Force, Alaska has been recognized as what General Mitchell said in an  Armed Services Committee hearing; that it is ``the most strategic place  in the world.'' Former Secretary Wilson and our current Chief of the  Staff of the Air Force, General Goldfein, have been leaders at the  Department of Defense, raising awareness of the critical importance of  the Arctic in defending America's national security interests.  Additionally, Congress has been playing a role in highlighting this in  our national security priorities in the National Defense Authorization  Act over the last 3 years and so, too, has the Trump administration.   Secretary Pompeo, our Secretary of State, was recently in Finland for  the Arctic Council, all the nations of the Arctic, and he had this to  say:         We are entering a new age of strategic engagement in the       Arctic, complete with new threats to the Arctic and its real       estate. . . . This is America's moment to stand up as an       Arctic nation and for the Arctic's future.    That was our Secretary of State a few months ago in Finland.   America is an Arctic nation because of Alaska. I like to say that my  State constitutes three pillars of America's military might. We are the  cornerstone of missile defense for the entire Nation--the missile  fields and the radar sites that protect Washington, DC, New York,  Miami, Rhode Island, L.A. They are all based in the great State of  Alaska. We are the hub of air combat power for the Arctic in the Asia- Pacific.   In the next 2 years, we are going to have over 100 fifth-generation  fighters, F-35s and F-22s, stationed in Alaska.  [[Page S5828]]  No place on Earth will have that kind of combat power with those  critical fifth-generation supersonic stealth fighters. We have a  platform for expeditionary forces--some of our best trained military  units--to be able to deploy on a moment's notice because we are so  strategically located to other countries.   Because of Alaska's strategic role in defending America's interests  in the Arctic and the Indo-Pacific, the Congress and this  administration, together in a bipartisan way, have been building up  each of these three critical pillars of our Nation's military might and  defenses.   Let me give just one example. The Senate has been pushing lately to  ensure that the air combat capability we have in Alaska is matched by  air refueling capacity. The last three National Defense Authorization  Acts passed by this body and signed by the President have established  criteria that the Air Force needs to use when deciding where to base  the next modern aerial refueling tanker platform, the KC-46.   Ambassador Barrett and I have discussed this issue and what the Air  Force is going to do with regard to stationing of the KC-46 outside of  the continental United States, and I look forward to working with her  on the advice already provided to the administration from the Congress  on where those military assets need to be based.   As the current Secretary of Defense, Mark Esper, said in his  confirmation hearing, having KC-46s colocated with 100 fifth-generation  fighters would give America ``extreme strategic reach'' anywhere in the  world. I believe Ambassador Barrett also understands this, and she  clearly understands the importance of the Arctic as a former ambassador  to Finland.   So, as I mentioned at the outset, we need good people and highly  qualified people to serve at the highest levels of our military,  civilian and uniformed, and I believe Ambassador Barrett is certainly  one of those individuals.   I was heartened to see that my colleagues in the Senate gave a very  strong bipartisan cloture vote, 84 to 7, which shows very strong  support for her nomination. I know we are going to vote in a couple of  minutes. I encourage my colleagues to vote yes for her nomination to be  the next U.S. Secretary of the Air Force.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
