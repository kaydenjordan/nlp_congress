 Madam Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor this bill, which is  led by my Ways and Means Committee colleague from Oregon.   The Restaurant Revitalization Fund has been a lifeline for small  businesses in Philadelphia and across the country. We provided $28  billion to help more than 100,000 restaurants. Unfortunately, the need  has been far greater than the initial funding.    This bill would extend the lifeline with another $42 billion to help  our neighborhood restaurants and the people they employ as the pandemic  continues.   Restaurants are part of our small business backbone that help to keep  our communities together and our neighbors employed.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
