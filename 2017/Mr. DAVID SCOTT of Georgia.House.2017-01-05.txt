 I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in great support of the Ross-Engel bill against  this most deceitful and shameful U.N. resolution. That is what we are  here for. This act was shameful and it was deceitful.   When the U.N. voted for this 2334 resolution, it was like cutting  Israel's legs out from under it and then condemning Israel for being a  cripple. Shameful and deceitful because they wanted to put all of the  blame on Israel when it is the Palestinians who refuse to even meet to  discuss or to even talk about a two-nation state. It is the  Palestinians who say Israel doesn't even have a right to exist.   How in the hell are you going to meet with somebody to talk about a  combined future when they will not give you decent recognition?    I thank the gentleman because this part  is very important.   Mr. Speaker, this Nation is blessed. We have been blessed with divine  intervention all through our history to be that shining light on the  hill, to let all of our great work show for the world. We have an  opportunity here tonight for this Congress to stand up and show that  light for Israel.   Stand up for Israel and show our great works to this world. That is  what I say, so let it be written and let it be done.
