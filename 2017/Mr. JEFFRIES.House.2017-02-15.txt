 Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump poses the greatest  Presidential threat to our democracy since Richard Nixon. It is about  the potential crimes and the potential coverup. Seventeen different  intelligence agencies have concluded that the Russians interfered with  the election in order to help Donald Trump. Top Trump cronies like  Carter Page, Paul Manafort, and Michael Flynn all had regular  communications with high-level Russian intelligence agents at the same  time they were engaging in hacking.   The National Security Adviser resigned in disgrace because of illegal  communication with the Russian Ambassador. The President refuses to  denounce Vladimir Putin and continues to try to make Russia great  again.   Connect the dots. It is time for House Republicans to do their job  and put country ahead of party. Join us in a bipartisan investigation  of the White House. What did the President know, and when did he know  it?
