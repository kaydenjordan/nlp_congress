 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, far too often our brave servicemembers return to  civilian life only to find that the skills they have gained in military  service do not easily transfer to the job market. These brave men and  women who have worked tirelessly to keep their country safe deserve to  know that they can thrive here after their service is complete.   For that reason, Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Jobs  for Our Heroes Act. Among other critical initiatives to help our  servicemembers find civilian employment, this legislation contains my  bill, the ADVANCE Act.   The ADVANCE Act will allow Active-Duty servicemembers, reservists,  and National Guardsmen to access the same unique testing standards for  commercial driver's licenses granted to veterans by the latest surface  transportation bill.   This commonsense legislation will allow those serving our country to  begin the process of finding civilian employment before they finish  their term of service, allowing them to hit the ground running upon  reentering civilian life. Our Nation's heroes deserve to know that the  process of transitioning out of the military will be seamless, and this  bipartisan legislation will help ensure that is the case.   I want to thank the ranking member, the chairman for their  leadership. I also want to thank Senators Warren, Cornyn, and Tillis  for guiding this bill through the Senate. I urge my colleagues here in  the House to vote in favor of this today.
