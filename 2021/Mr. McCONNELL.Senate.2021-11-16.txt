 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, President Biden and his  team flew to Glasgow for a glitzy conference. World leaders traveled  there to attend one another's speeches on carbon emissions and climate.   The world's largest emitter was not there. China pumps out more than  one-quarter of the entire world's emissions, but President Xi didn't  bother to attend this conference. Putin didn't show up either. He and  his cronies in Moscow are too busy using Russia's natural gas to  stranglehold the energy and make energy hostages out of our European  friends who rushed too naively toward renewables.   This goes to the core problems with the anti-energy agenda that  liberal elites want to thrust on our country--maximum self-inflected  pain for American families in exchange for no meaningful global gains.   They would have America tie one hand behind our back while our  competitors and adversaries keep right on going. This hurts families  and helps China.   Across the country, working families are already worrying about the  big, potentially historic spikes in energy costs and heating bills that  are headed their way. Here is the New York Times headline from last  week: ``Winter Heating Bills Loom as the Next Inflation Threat.''   Futures contracts for home heating fuels have skyrocketed in price.  Natural gas users have just about doubled from last year. For heating  oil and propane, it is actually even worse. Our colleagues on the  Energy and Natural Resources Committee are holding a hearing this  morning on rising heating costs.   In Kentucky, where about 4 in 10 households are heated by natural  gas, families are about to get slammed. Even more Kentucky families  rely on straight electricity for their heat, and, in our State, more  than two-thirds of our electrical power comes from coal. Coal literally  keeps the lights on, and it keeps the cold out.   That is why the original Obama-Biden War on Coal hits States like  Kentucky so very hard and why the even more radical sequel the  Democrats are planning next would fall on the heartland like a ton of  bricks.   The President's special envoy for climate issues John Kerry says:         [Y]ou have to phase down coal before you can end coal.    One of the President's nominees to the Treasury Department has  admitted that small producers of affordable American energy ``are going  to probably go bankrupt in short order.''   American families are staring down the barrel of skyrocketing heating  bills, and the Democrats' response is to go to war against affordable  American energy. The reckless taxing-and-spending spree they are  writing behind closed doors and want to pass in a matter of weeks would  spend hundreds of billions of dollars on Green New Deal-type policies  that would saddle families with even higher prices and make our Nation  even more dependent on Russia and the Mideast.   Of course, energy inflation is just one part of the huge inflation  crisis that Democrats have unleashed. According to reports in one new  survey, 90 percent of Americans are either somewhat concerned or very  concerned about inflation and rising costs. Nine out of ten households  are hurting. Sixty-seven percent of the country, two-thirds, say  Washington needs to stop printing and spending so much and driving  prices even higher.   Energy bills and gas prices are just one corner of this inflation  crisis, but Democrats seem to want to ignore the people, plow ahead,  and spend trillions more.   Even liberal economists who like the Democrats' reckless taxing-and- spending spree because they agree with the far-left transformation  admit it would make inflation even worse next year.   There is no part of our economy that can afford another massive dose  of socialism, but Democrats are specifically targeting American energy  to get hit especially hard. They are planning direct new taxes, new  fees, and new regulatory mandates for energy producers. They want to  make affordable, reliable energy artificially expensive to force  Americans toward the less affordable, less reliable forms of energy  that elite liberals would rather they use. It would hurt families  badly; it would help China in a big way. That is because the Biden  administration doesn't have any strategic plan to snap its fingers and  turn our massive country into some green utopia overnight. They just  want to throw boatloads of government money at things like solar panels  and electric vehicles and hope it all works out. But China absolutely  dominates the supply chains for lithium batteries, for solar panels,  and for practically all the fashionable purchases into which Democrats  want to dump all this money. In all likelihood, Democrats' supposedly  green agenda would just provide a massive one-way gift to our  adversary, the world's No. 1 emitter, the Chinese Communist Party.   This isn't Build Back Better; it is Build Back Beijing. Here is just  one example: There is a raw material called polysilicon that is crucial  for solar panels. According to the New York Times, more than 80 percent  of the entire world's supply comes from China. About half of the  world's supply comes from the Xinjiang Province, where China is  brutalizing the Uighur minority with tactics that include forced labor.   There are other key resources, including critical minerals, where  China has similar strangleholds. Here are some recent headlines:   ``Lithium Shortage May Stall Electric Car Revolution and Embed  China's Lead.''   ``China's lithium companies are in an investment frenzy.''   Just like liberal policies are hostile to the American energy we  produce here at home, they are also hostile to exploring for these  critical minerals here at home. Their massive proposal is backed with  anti-hard rock mining provisions that would make it even harder to  stand up American supply chains for critical minerals.  [[Page S8218]]    So here is the bottom line: American families don't want Washington  politicians waging a holy war on fossil fuels in the first place. They  can't afford that nonsense. But it is even more absurd that Democrats'  top-down schemes would just increase China's wealth and dominance all  along the way. They don't have some smart master plan to invest in  America's future. They have a plan to build back Beijing and raise  American families' gas prices and heating bills even higher so that we  could massively stimulate Chinese export markets. Hurt families; help  China--every piece of their reckless policies fits this mold.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
