 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding me this  time.   Before I get to my bill, if I could just address a few points that  have been brought up in this debate, which I am surprised at the fact  that the Rules Committee doesn't actually talk about the rule. We talk  about a whole bunch of different issues, but maybe I am new to this  game.   I have to say that the gentleman from Georgia is correct.  Infrastructure investment in the internet has gone down over the last 2  years.   I would agree: If it is not broken, why did President Obama try to  fix it?   It was working really well for 20 years, and we had great innovation.   In regard to the tax bill, that is being debated. I think we are  looking at some unique arguments that are being made. The Democrats are  over there and they are fighting for the poor middle class American,  and all Republicans are fighting for the rich. It is a great line. I  love the line. But let's look to the wealthiest communities in America.                                time  1430    Go look right outside of D.C. Look in Northern Virginia. Are those  wealthy communities, those counties in Virginia, are they Republican or  Democrat? They are Democrat. L.A., San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, New  York are all really rich communities that elect Democrats.   The wealthiest and biggest corporations, think of the tech industry  in California or the biggest in America. What are they? They are  Democrats. And that is why. When the tax debate comes up, you see  Democrats fighting for loopholes and preferences for their big, wealthy  friends.   And that is why, when Republicans here in this House said maybe to  write off the mortgage interest on a $1 million home, that might be a  little too much, maybe we should lower it to $500,000 of mortgage  interest deductions, my Democratic friends freaked out.   Oh, no, the poor, middle class people in my community who have a $1  million mortgage, they are just having a tough time getting by--that  was the argument that was made, fighting for the loopholes and  preferences for the wealthiest Americans, while we are fighting for the  middle class.   You talk about investment in my bill? You want to talk about pension  funds? What has happened to pension funds in America? What has happened  to American 401(k)'s? They have gone through the roof because we are  lowering rules and regulations in a smart way, and we are going to  reform our Tax Code to let families and businesses keep more of their  income because they can spend it better than anyone in this town. They  do it well.   So if you want to tank the markets, do what you have been doing and  tank tax reform.   I want to get to my bill. This is on proxy advisory firms. I have  taken awhile to get here, but the role of proxy advisory firms in the  U.S. economy and shaping corporate governance is profound. These firms,  they counsel pension funds and mutual funds and institutional investors  on how to vote the shares of the corporations that they own.   You think, well, that is pretty benign. That is not a big issue.   Well, the shares of institutional investors' ownership in 1987 was 46  percent. Today, institutional investors own 75 percent of American  corporations, billions of shares institutional investors control and  look to proxy advisers for advice.  [[Page H9865]]    There are just two firms that control 97 percent of the market. So  two companies, basically, are having a huge influence on American  corporate governance, and they are involved in the writing and analysis  and reports and voting recommendations that affect fundamental  corporate transactions like mergers and acquisitions, approval of  corporate directors and shareholder proposals--a huge impact on  corporate governance.   And they are not immune from conflicts of interest. For example, in  addition to providing recommendations to institutional investors about  how to vote, proxy advisory firms may also advise companies about  corporate governance issues, rate companies on corporate governance,  help companies approve those ratings, and advise proponents about how  to frame proposals to get the most votes.   I am going to come back to that in a second, but there was a Stanford  University study that said institutional investors with assets under  management of $100 billion or more, they only make 10 percent of the  voting decisions, which means they offload 90 percent to proxy advisory  firms.   So I don't know if you are familiar with the Mafia, but you have got  the old storekeeper on the block, and he is robbed one night--right?-- gets beaten up and robbed, and the next day, the thugs come in and go:  Hey, hey, I hear you were robbed last night. You pay a little fee,  we'll take care of you and make sure you are not robbed anymore.   That is exactly what proxy advisory firms are doing. They are like:  Oh, you got a bad recommendation. Let me tell you what. You buy our  services, and we can help you in the future. Just pay the ransom, and  we will help take care of you in future recommendations.   This is not the way corporate governance should work. So my bill  brings transparency and accountability to proxy advisory firms.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    I thought that is what Democrats want: making them more  responsive; bringing more competition into the industry; making it  better for investors; specifically, again, a bipartisan bill.  Republicans and Democrats voted for this legislation.   But we will ensure that proxy advisory firms are registered with the  SEC. Oh, how bad is that, registering with the SEC, a little oversight?   We are going to disclose potential conflicts of interest. How radical  is that idea?   Shouldn't we tell people that we have a conflict of interest, and  shouldn't all parties be aware of it?   I don't know why my friends across the aisle, or the gentleman from  Colorado would be opposed to that.   Maintain a code of ethics. That is not shocking. I think most people  would agree to that point.   And make publicly available the methodologies for formulating proxy  recommendations and analysis.   Again, this is transparency. This is a commonsense bill that both  Republicans and Democrats have voted for because we have recognized-- and again, I am not a big regulation guy, as the gentleman from  Colorado had pointed out. But when you consolidate a great deal of  power in two companies that have a huge impact on American corporate  governance, that makes a lot of people uncomfortable; and to have a  little more oversight, to have a little more transparency, to have a  little more accountability is a really, really good thing.   Some of the smallest companies have been the biggest complainers  about how these proxy advisory firms have held them hostage. So let's  support the small innovators, the big job creators in America that are  complaining about the big proxy advisory firms. Let's stand with them  and the families that they employ, and the future families, if they are  successful, that they will employ, and let's give a little more control  to proxy adviser firms.    I ask all to support this great bill.
