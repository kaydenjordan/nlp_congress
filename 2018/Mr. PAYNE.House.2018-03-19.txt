 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Newark Community  Solutions for its continued work on reducing crime and strengthening  connections between courts and the community.   Newark Community Solutions works with young people who are at risk of  being victims or perpetrators of gun violence. They provide job  training, counseling, and peer mentorship. The organization also  develops support networks for crime victims and provides mental health  counseling for veterans and schoolchildren to avoid expulsion.   Mr. Speaker, Newark Community Solutions produces real results, and  they are felt throughout Essex County. In cities throughout my  district, we are seeing safer streets, reduced incarceration, and  improved neighborhood perceptions of justice.   The program at Newark Community Solutions can be a model for cities  throughout the country. Newark Community Solutions shows that, by  investing in the community, we can build a foundation for sensible and  thoughtful criminal justice reform.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me first thank Representative Clarke and  Representative Lawrence for hosting tonight's Special Order hour. These  are two dynamic colleagues of mine. Ms. Clarke, as she stated, is right  across the river from me and has really been a mentor to me since my  arrival here in Congress. There is never anything that I have ever  asked her to do that she hasn't done. I just want to acknowledge the  great support that she has been for me since I have arrived at this  body. She is a true leader from across the river.   Also, Mrs. Lawrence, who is from the great State of Michigan, has  joined us in her second term here in Congress. She has demonstrated her  leadership day in and day out as well.   Mr. Speaker, of course, every year is the year of the Black woman for  me. Just as Black women like the late great Shirley Chisholm and  Barbara Jordan paved the way for other Black women to run for office,  the work that these gentlewomen do has inspired a new generation of  Black women to change the course of our Nation. For that, we are all  grateful.   Throughout American history, Black women have been undervalued and  undercompensated. Nationally, Black women who work in full-time jobs  make only 64 cents for every dollar a White man makes. In New Jersey,  Black women only make 58 cents for every dollar a White man makes.  Black women both in New Jersey and nationally make persistently less  than White women, despite the fact that Black women have the highest  labor force participation rate in the United States among women.   Regardless of their educational level, Black women are less likely  than other workers to be employed in higher paying careers. They are  more likely than other groups to be employed in service-industry jobs  with low pay, no benefits, and outside the scope of the labor laws of  this country.   Black women are key to building long-term success in our communities,  yet they are disproportionately incarcerated. They are more likely to  face employment discrimination and housing discrimination. They are  more likely to be disciplined at school, and they are still undervalued  and underrepresented in our society.   What should we be doing in Congress and in our communities?   First, we should be strengthening Black women's political  participation. We need more Black women in office at all levels of  government. Each of us should mentor young Black women who want to  serve. We should uplift their voices, give them the microphone, and  build infrastructure that gets them into office.   Secondly, we must protect the right to vote for Black women and all  people of color. Over the past 5 years, the Supreme Court has gutted  the Voting Rights Act. Legislators in States like Texas and South  Carolina have passed voter ID laws that disproportionately restrict the  right to vote for people of color, and Russian social media accounts  have targeted the Black community to sow division and discord in our  elections.   As Members of Congress, we have the power to restore the Voting  Rights Act, protect the right to vote, and ensure our elections are  secure from foreign interference.   Third, we need to support increased employment and higher earnings  for Black women. That includes raising the Federal minimum wage to make  it a liveable wage. That means strengthening collective bargaining.   Mr. Speaker, there are many examples of women in New Jersey who have  made great accomplishments. Throughout 2018, the Year of the Black  Woman, it is vitally important that we elevate Black women's voices and  their experiences. Here are just a few Black women from my district who  are making a difference.   Ibtihaj Muhammad, a Black woman from Maplewood, New Jersey, became  the first American Olympian to wear a hijab during her event. She was  also a model for the first hijab-wearing Barbie doll. Ibtihaj Muhammad  is a trailblazer. She fenced in this year's past Summer Olympics.   Sheila Oliver, as Ms. Clarke intimated, a Newark native, just became  the first African-American Lieutenant Governor in New Jersey's history.  She had already broken the glass ceiling by becoming the first African- American woman to serve as assembly speaker in New Jersey, and only the  second African-American woman in the country to lead a State  legislature. The first, of course, was our colleague from California,  Karen Bass. Sheila Oliver and Karen Bass are trailblazers.   Mattie Holloway from Hillside, New Jersey, has spent nearly 40 years  helping young women in her community. For the past three decades, she  has led Hope, Inc., a community service organization that helps  pregnant teens and young mothers stay on track during and after their  pregnancy. Mattie Holloway is a trailblazer.    In Bayonne, New Jersey, there is a young woman named Jae Wilson. She  is 9 years old. Jae was at the mall one day when she noticed a homeless  man wasn't wearing socks. Jae saw a need and stepped up to fill it.  This young woman now spends her spare time collecting socks and shoes  to distribute to people in need. Jae Wilson is a trailblazer.   There are countless Black women whose contributions to our collective  freedom have gotten us to this point today. Too often, they have been  sidelined and, as I stated, undervalued and disrespected. Let's do a  better job to celebrate, uplift, and empower our sisters this year and  every year.
