 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I rise today in favor of my amendment No.  165 to H.R. 4365.   My amendment prohibits the use of funds to pay regular remote and  telework for the civilian and contractor workforce of the Department of  Defense.   Madam Chair, at the very beginning of this Congress, our majority  brought the voice of the American people to this Chamber saying that  enough was enough, that it was time for the Federal workforce to return  to work.   To this end, we passed the SHOW UP Act because our constituents were  sick and tired of the lack of service from the Federal Government.   While progress has been made to some extent, there are still legacy  and recent telework and remote work agreements that keep Federal  workers who are supposed to be delivering for the American people out  of the office. This includes the Department of Defense workforce, which  is allowed to work from home in varying capacities.   In 2019, the Office of the Director of National Security found that  across the entire Federal Government 4.2 million employees were  eligible to access classified information. The Defense Department is  responsible for 3.8 million of these clearances. Of these clearances  for employees of the DOD, 20 percent are civilian workforce and 26  percent are contractors.   The DOD works largely in a classified setting. Its responsibilities  are to safeguard this Nation. How this mission can be fulfilled when  the employees are sitting at home is beyond me.   Madam Chair, it is time for the Federal workforce, including those  who work for the DOD, to return to work so the American people can  receive a full and fair return on the services that they fund through  their tax dollars.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Calvert).    Madam Chair, I believe that my colleague on the other  side misunderstands the amendment or the scope of it. The amendment  does not prevent DOD employees from working from home if needed, such  as for health or emergency situations. In fact, the Defense Civilian  Personnel Advisory Service is responsible for policy oversight of the  DOD telework and remote work programs. These programs are administered  in accordance with DOD Instruction 1035.01.   This amendment specifically prevents only telework and remote work on  a regular, recurring basis. The other categories that accommodate  health issues, emergency situations, and more would be left untouched,  providing the necessary flexibility.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, this should be a no-brainer that our  Federal workers and our employees should actually go to work. In fact,  it is actually bipartisan. President Biden called on his Cabinet  members to aggressively execute plans for Federal employees to work  more in their offices.   The President and I do not see eye to eye on very much--in fact, very  little. In this instance, putting workers back in the office is common  sense.   This amendment would not defund telework and remote work for  servicemen and -women. This amendment specifically prevents funds for  DOD employees, civilians, and contractors.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H4613]]     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in favor of my amendment, No. 60,  which would prohibit the Secretary of Homeland Security from traveling  outside of the United States.  [[Page H4692]]    Mr. Chairman, under Mr. Mayorkas, the Department of Homeland Security  is a disaster by every single metric, and he has utterly failed at  protecting our country, securing our borders, adhering to the rule of  law, and protecting the constitutional rights of the citizens of this  country.   The southern border is in chaos. We are being invaded by military- aged men from hostile countries from around the world and our cities  are being overwhelmed by a mass of humanity and level of migration most  likely not seen in world history.   At the same time, the Committee on the Judiciary continues to expose  Mayorkas' role in creating, implementing, and enforcing the censorship  industrial complex. The list of failures goes on and on and on and on.   Despite Mr. Mayorkas' direct and intentional involvement in the  destruction of the borders, boundaries, security, and integrity of the  United States of America, he has had the audacity to travel overseas to  praise--yes, praise--the importance of the borders in other countries  and the benefits of having an orderly transfer of people and goods  across the same.   Yes, while ignoring the invasion on our southern and northern  borders, an invasion that he has facilitated, Mr. Mayorkas actually  traveled to a border between Poland and Ukraine to praise ``the use of  U.S. technology that has been deployed to ensure the safe transfer of  people and goods between Poland and Ukraine.''   That is right, even while our border has become a raging inferno, Mr.  Mayorkas traveled to view another nation's border crossing, to view and  judge their operations while also meeting and speaking with their  border enforcement officers. If only he had the same such care for what  is happening right here in the United States of America.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of amendment No. 60,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, with all due respect, I do not believe Mr.  Mayorkas was traveling to other countries to learn how best we can  secure our border.   In fact, I don't think there is any evidence whatsoever that he has  ever traveled to another country and asked them to stop sending their  poor to our country to invade our country.   The fact is that Mayorkas and his boss, Joe Biden, are the largest  human traffickers and drug smugglers in U.S. history. We receive  absolutely no benefit whatever from Mr. Mayorkas traveling to other  countries to observe their functioning borders while ours is burned to  the ground.                                time  2200    There is no basis, rationale, or benefit for Secretary Mayorkas to  travel outside of the United States to enjoy the fruits of an ordered  society. He has failed to do his job and should not be rewarded for  such failure by traveling the world at the taxpayers' expense. He needs  to leave the visitation and discussions with foreign nations to the  State Department. He needs to secure our border and reform his corrupt  Department.   My amendment would prohibit Mr. Mayorkas from traveling outside of  the United States while acting as the Secretary of the DHS.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment. Mr. Chair, I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment No. 61 to  H.R. 4367, which would prevent the DHS from implementing its ``climate  literacy strategy.''   Mr. Chair, it seems that there is nothing that Mr. Mayorkas and his  Department won't do to distract from carrying out their central mission  of defending the U.S. homeland, a mission at which they have failed  miserably.   The climate literacy strategy states its objective is `` . . . to  develop a climate literate DHS workforce, ensuring all employees across  the Department have a sufficient and up-to-date understanding of  climate change and its relevance to the DHS mission.''   That is flatout hogwash.   The DHS states it will develop and administer this climate literate  workforce through its program for climate change professionals, which  DHS calls the ``CCP'' for short. No, I am not making that up.   It will also have a Department-wide website for sharing climate  change information, have climate change trainings, and develop a  community of practice to champion and share climate discussions.   I will use the word again: This is hogwash.   There are no resources to build a wall, no resources to apprehend  illegal aliens, which have numbered over 10 times the population of the  State of Wyoming since Joe Biden took office, no resources to stop  terrorists from crossing our borders, but, of course, under Mr.  Mayorkas' so-called leadership, there are vast sums of money available  for promoting climate hysteria to ensure access to the newest climate  propaganda and developments.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of amendment No. 61.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, again, with all due respect, it is not the  DHS' responsibility to deal with climate. In fact, the DHS has  absolutely no capacity to do that whatsoever.   What the DHS' responsibility is is to protect the homeland from the  invasion that we are seeing on the southern and northern borders.   My constituents are sick and tired of this. Not a cent of money  should go to distracting the DHS employees from their jobs of defending  this country.   I urge all of my colleagues to support my amendment, strip every last  penny from this bone-headed initiative, and force the DHS to actually  do its job.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my amendment No. 62,  which would prevent the DHS from carrying out its environmental justice  strategy, whatever that nonsensical word salad means in today's  parlance.   Similar to the climate indoctrination boondoggle I addressed when  addressing my prior amendment, this is yet another angle being taken by  Secretary Mayorkas and the DHS to worship at the altar of the so-called  climate change instead of actually focusing their attention and  resources on the gross incompetence that this administration calls  border security.   While this administration continues to use newspeak to extol the  virtues of this so-called environmental justice agenda, the reality is  that Joe Biden, Mayorkas, and others in this administration are  responsible for vast amounts of energy poverty around the world.   What this administration is not pursuing is environmental justice. It  instead, has an affirmative goal of universal government-imposed  wretchedness. This is what happens when you staff an entire  administration with people who have never held a job in the private  sector--a collapse of your supply chain, your energy resources, and  ultimately, your prosperity.   Environmental justice isn't any such thing. It is an Alice in  Wonderland level of gaslighting that is destroying our ability to  produce energy, grow food, and provide affordable housing.   Congress' power is in the purse, and we must exercise that power by  ensuring that there are no funds going to anything that doesn't secure  our border. For my colleagues across the aisle, 11,000 illegal border  crossings a day does not count for border security.   I urge my colleagues to support amendment No. 62, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Again, Mr. Chair, I think that I have made my point with  these three amendments. The purpose of the DHS and Mr. Mayorkas is to  secure our border and protect the homeland. He has failed. There is no  other thing that our DHS should be doing except specifically that.   For that reason I urge that my colleagues support amendments 60, 61,  and 62, and I yield back the balance of my time.
