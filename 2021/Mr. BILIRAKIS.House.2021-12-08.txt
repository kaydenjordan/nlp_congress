 Mr. Speaker, I rise today saddened as deaths involving  synthetic opioids continue to skyrocket.   In my district, in Pasco County, Florida, 193 people have died from  fentanyl overdose since January. I have also received hundreds of  heartbreaking stories from constituents whose families have been  devastated by addiction.   One constituent, MaryAnne said: ``I lost my son in June of 2021 to a  fentanyl overdose. The system failed me in every single way. With open  borders, enough fentanyl came pouring into our country's southern  border to kill 70 percent of our population. Sadly, my son is one of  those statistics.'' Parents like MaryAnne are the faces of the fentanyl  crisis.   Mr. Speaker, the tragedies these families have experienced are the  reason why we must fight back. We must secure our borders, Mr. Speaker.  We must place fentanyl-related substances into schedule I, and we must  hold China accountable.                            ____________________
