 Madam Speaker, I think I just heard that we are in the  25th day of the shutdown. I see some of my good Republican friends over  there, and perhaps we ought to engage in a debate about the wisdom of  this shutdown.   Can anybody find any good reason for the shutdown?    At the moment, Mr. Meadows, perhaps I would yield and  you can give me a 30-second explanation of why the shutdown makes  sense, but let's talk about the shutdown.   Let's talk about the reality that the President proposed in his  budget for 2019 that we should spend somewhere around $1.6 billion for  border security, not specifying walls or all of it, but just border  security.   We, of course, do what we always do. We took that, and we put it  through the ringer. We came out with $1.6 billion for border security,  including some wall in there.   But we didn't finish the task, so we did a continuing resolution last  September and kicked the ball down the road, which is what we really do  best, boom, boom, boom, bounce down the road until right after  Thanksgiving.   Then we hadn't quite completed it, so in a day when none of us were  here, by unanimous consent, again, we kicked the ball down the road  until December 11.   Then the Senate sent over a piece of legislation that was unanimously  passed in the Senate by voice vote, and it wound up over here the next  day. Sometime between that evening when it passed the Senate and it  wound up over here, the President decided that he needed $5 billion for  a border wall.   Now, perhaps there was a discussion of appropriations sometime during  that process. I don't know. But in any case, it was in none of the  bills. Suddenly, we had a $5 billion addition to border security. All  of that happened overnight.   At the same time, the President calls into his Oval Office the  leadership, and he says that he will shut down the government, and he  will take the mantle of the shutdown.   So, my good friends from the Republican side of this aisle, here we  are on day 25.   A lot of things are going on out there. There is not much going on  around here, unfortunately. But what is going on out there?   I got a phone call from a mayor of one of the small cities that I  represent down in the agricultural part north of Sacramento. He said:  Can you help us? One of the veterans in my district, a World War II  veteran, is in hospice, and, over the years, he lost his Purple Heart  for injuries that he suffered in World War II. We would like to get  that back for him before he dies, but we can't. We can't help him.   We can't get that Purple Heart back before this veteran dies because  the National Archives is shut down. Normally, we could. We would make  our request, and we would go to the National Archives. Somehow we would  find the record, and we would get a replacement Purple Heart. We can't  do that now. The National Archives is shut down.   Another one of my constituents wants to start a new business in one  of the towns that I represent west of Sacramento. It is a little  restaurant coffee shop. He needs an SBA loan. He worked it all through  the bank. The bank is ready to make the loan. The papers can't be  signed. SBA is shut down.   How long can he hang on? How long will that escrow remain open before  this deal tanks? Well, it is 25 days thus far. Apparently, the deal is  still in place. But businesses all across this Nation are not moving  forward.   Recent estimates show that two-tenths of a percent of the economic  growth of this Nation in this 25-day shutdown has been removed from  this economy. We are looking somewhere just north of 2\1/2\, 3 percent,  in that range, but two-tenths of that is now gone as a result of this  shutdown.   Let us remind ourselves: This is entirely the making of the President  who parachuted--no, bombed into our negotiation process here, $5  billion in the 12 hours between the passage of a compromised, unanimous  vote by the Senate to keep government going and the arrival and the  vote on that bill here on this floor.   Madam Speaker, I will also state that our Republican colleagues  accommodated the President and put the $5 billion into the legislation  and sent it back to the Senate, and there it sat, sine die. That  legislation is gone.   However, we want to open government. We think it is really important  that those veterans across this Nation who want to get their records  are able to do so, and those men and women who want to start a small  business are able to get their Small Business Administration loans  approved.   How about Foreign Service officers? Oh, yes, the State Department  isn't funded. Foreign Service officers are not able to get the training  that they need. They go through a whole course before they are sent off  to some part of the world--language, culture courses. None of that is  happening, to say nothing of the fact that about a third of the  appointments in the State Department have never been filled to begin  with.   Department of the Interior? Some of us stuck around here over the  weekend. Normally, we would go down to the Smithsonian and take a look,  or the National Museum of African American History and Culture, or  maybe the National Museum of American History. Maybe we would go watch  one of the presentations that are made at the national parks. No, that  doesn't happen either. Woe on us here in Washington, but all across  this Nation, the national parks are shut down.   Fish and wildlife, now, we have a real problem here. The fish and  wildlife refuges in California are shu down, and we are approaching the  end of duck season. Oh, my goodness. You mean we can't go duck hunting,  as we might want to do, at the fish and wildlife refuges? That is  right. You are not going to go duck hunting at the fish and wildlife  refuges, as you have normally done, even though you put your bid in and  you had January 15 for your date to hunt ducks at the refuge. Nope,  can't do that.    Transportation, the Department of Transportation is shut down.   You tell me it is a small portion of the Federal Government. Well, it  is a  [[Page H584]]  small portion of the budget, but it is 85 percent of the activities of  the Federal Government that are shut down: Department of the Interior,  Department of Agriculture, Department of Homeland Security, Department  of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Transportation, and the  Internal Revenue Service.   Don't worry, we can't collect taxes. That is a good thing, right? My  conservative friend says you can't collect taxes, and that is all  right. No, I want my tax refund, and I can't get that either.   EPA, there are those who would argue that that is all good. Well, I  don't think so, not if you are concerned about air and water, the  ability to swim in the rivers or to drink the water.   Let's just say you are going out for your first tranche of funding.  You need SEC approval. Well, you are not going to get it. The  Securities and Exchange Commission is shut down also.   Eighty percent or more of the activities of the Federal Government  are shut down.   There was a big headline in The New York Times, the failing New York  Times, about the President and whether he is compromised. Well, I don't  know. That will prove itself out one way or the other with the Mueller  investigation and all that is going on.   But I do know this, that if Putin wanted to harm America, he would  shut down the American Government. That is precisely what the President  did. He shut down the American Government for 25 days. What greater  gift would Putin want than an American Government that is not  functioning?   Oh, the military is still there, but the fifth branch of the military  is the Coast Guard with 40,000-plus Coast Guard members who are out  there on the water protecting the borders of America. By the way, the  Coast Guard has confiscated 10 times the amount of drugs that are  confiscated on the Mexican border. They are working without pay.  Essential services, yes, they are.   But the back-office services are not working. They are laid off.  Contractors who have contracts to get a paycheck from the Department of  Transportation on the road that they are supposed to be building or  have built, it is not going to happen.   It is time for us to open this government. It is time for us to open  the government and put America back to work. Put the essential services  back to work.   The Food and Drug Administration is shut down. Who is checking? Many  of my colleagues here have young grandchildren, infants. Who is  checking the quality, the safety, of infant formula? The answer: No  one.   Here we are. We are for border security. We Democrats are for border  security. We have been for more than 20 years now. We voted for walls  in the past. We voted for improving the security of the border in every  way possible, and we will continue to do so.   But to hold America hostage, to hold our government hostage, to hold  800,000 government employees and 40,000-plus coastguardsmen and -women  without pay? No way.   To simply come in at the very last moment in a negotiation that had  been settled and drop a $5 billion--excuse me, it is $5.7 billion now;  there seems to have been an escalation--a $5.7 billion border wall on  our process, it is unconscionable.   We can open the government. Bills have been passed here, not with the  help of our Republican friends, but with the new majority. We have  passed legislation day after day after day to fund the government. Some  of it is short term, as we did just an hour ago here on the floor, a  short-term CR to open government until February 1 to get people back to  work and negotiate, negotiate border security.   The President wants a wall. Where does he want the wall? What kind of  a wall does he want: cyclone fence, steel spikes, concrete? Where? For  what purpose? What is its effectiveness? What is he trying to stop?  Where is he trying to stop that incursion into America? None of that is  available today.   I have been on the Armed Services Committee for 8 years, 9 years now.  We would not build a hangar for the Air Force unless we knew what its  purpose was, unless we knew where it was, what it would cost, why it  was necessary. But the President wants a $5.7 billion slush fund to  build a wall somewhere along the 1,900 miles of the border.   Now, a couple of my colleagues were here a few moments ago talking  about the President's desire to have a national emergency. Well, he  sure as hell created one. But I think he is talking about those young  children who are climbing over the fences in diapers. I suppose those  are the terrorists he is talking about.                                time  1615    Madam Speaker, let's talk about what he proposes to do about it. He  would call for a national emergency which gives him--he believes, we  don't--but he believes the power to appropriate funds. The Constitution  is very, very clear. There is only one part of our government that has  the power to appropriate funds. It is us. It is the Congress. But  apparently the President thinks he can declare a national emergency and  acquire the appropriation power of Congress.   What does he intend to appropriate for his purposes of the border  wall?   America has had some flooding in some of the districts of some of my  colleagues that I see here on the floor. We passed the emergency  legislation to deal with that. California has its droughts, but it also  has its rain. This is the Oroville Dam. It is not subject to the  emergency appropriations for disaster recovery. But the levees  downstream from the Oroville Dam are subject to one of the  appropriations in the disaster recovery bill. If Oroville Dam had  broken, within 1 hour a city of 40,000, Oroville, would be under 30  feet of water.   The levees downstream from Oroville on the Feather River are in the  process of being repaired. Further downstream as you get to Sacramento,  Madam Speaker, the American River and the Sacramento River, major levee  projects, is the most flood-prone part of America. I know there are  some friends from the Southeast here who would debate that point. But  let's just say there is a lot of America that is subject to flooding.   This is a dangerous one. Money in these supplemental appropriation  bills for disaster relief is designed to shore up the levees of  America.   Now, some folks would argue, yeah, but it is not going to rain this  year. Maybe. Maybe it makes no difference. But if it does rain, the  repair of that levee makes all the difference.   Here is a place that a lot of our friends don't care much about:  Puerto Rico. In the emergency disaster relief legislation that the  President wants to raid is the repair of dams just upstream from San  Juan, Puerto Rico. This is what happened during the hurricanes, and  that dam spillway needs to be repaired.   The communities in Texas, California, the Carolinas, Florida, and the  Gulf Coast don't want this to happen again.   How do we save them from this ever happening again?   It is to use the money that we have appropriated for disaster relief  to repair the levees so that flooding is less likely to happen. But the  President decides that he is going to create an emergency declaration,  and he is going to go into the Army Corps of Civil Works programs that  were allocated as a result of the appropriations from last spring's  disaster relief legislation and rip $2\1/2\ billion out of those  appropriations.   Some of us have reason to suspect with some evidence that he intends  to go after Puerto Rico and California. It turns out that the projects  in California may be of interest to some of my Republican friends,  particularly the minority leader, because one of the projects is Lake  Isabella just upstream from Bakersfield, California.   So, Madam Speaker, we say to the President: A, there is no emergency;  B, the shutdown of government is one of your own making; and C, you  don't have the power to appropriate money yourself. Particularly, it is  shameful to take money that we have allocated to protect Americans in  Florida, Texas, California, Puerto Rico, the Carolinas, and even  Missouri so that their levees and so that their flood control projects  can be updated and improved and so the safety of those communities can  be enhanced.   Here is what we want: we want government opened. It is inexplicable  that after 25 days this government is shut  [[Page H585]]  down because the President is demanding $5.7 billion for a border wall  without even telling us where that is going to be built. Oh, excuse me.  That is a misstatement. It is going to be built on the Mexican-American  border.   Where?   Is it going to be built where there is a real need?   What kind of a wall will it be?   That seems to change every 12 hours because there are no plans worthy  of our--we are presumably responsible for the taxpayer dollars-- consideration as to where, what the effectiveness would be, what the  usefulness would be, what the cost would be, or even what the color  will be.   Open our government. Pass the legislation in the Senate. The  President said he will veto it. Okay. Put it on his desk. Let him veto  it. He already says he is wearing the mantle of the shutdown. Let him  put on another coat, another mantle of a veto, so that the American  public knows precisely who is responsible for this shutdown.   We have done our job here. We have passed the legislation to fund  this government--all but one department--for the remainder of this  fiscal year until September 30, 2019. We have done that multiple times  now, and we have left the issue of the Department of Homeland Security  in which the issue of the border fence resides on a short-term leash so  that all of us would be forced to come back to negotiate border  security.   Democrats would undoubtedly go for improvements in the ports of  entry. One out of five cars is not checked at the border. Maybe we  ought to deal with that. Only a few of the containers arriving at our  ports are checked. Most are not. Maybe we ought to deal with that.  Maybe we ought to look at our airports where we know most presumed  terrorists arrive.   So what are we doing here?   We are shutting down--we. Excuse me. We are not shutting down. The  President is shutting down this government for 25 days.   I can only imagine the joy in the Kremlin. Consider for a moment Mr.  Putin, saying: Oh, my God. The American Government is shut down.   He couldn't do it by himself. Only our President would do it to us.   We have got things to do here.   I notice one of my colleagues, Mr. Levin, has arrived, and I know he  wants to join us on this issue in a few moments. In the meantime, I  have got a few more things to say.    To my Republican colleagues who will soon follow me on this floor  when this hour is done, I can get pretty heated about some things, and  maybe I have been, but I want them to think about what is actually  happening here in America and why we are in this situation.   My Republican colleagues had the power over the last 2 years to build  any wall they wanted to build anywhere they wanted to build it-- Canadian border, Mexican border. They had the power. They didn't do it.  Excuse me. That is not right. I think 22 miles of new wall have been  built in the last 3 years. That is okay. I think the appropriation was  somewhere less than $50 million for that. Now here we are.   I would love to hear my Republican colleagues explain to the American  public how it came about that we are in this situation when they had 2  years to build whatever wall they thought the President might want to  build. It didn't happen.   I heard a wonderful and foolish--a wonderful argument, because it was  so foolish--that gee whiz, $5.7 billion is just a very small part of  the total American budget for expenditures.   That is true. It is a small part. That is $5.7 billion.   Madam Speaker, $5.7 billion would provide a year and a half of  funding for all of the tuition for every student at the University of  California and the 23 State universities in California--more than 1  million students. Madam Speaker, $5.7 billion is no small amount of  money.   How many kids could you educate?   How much relief could we supply to people who are hungry here in  America or some part of the world?   By the way, my Republican friends did create a massive deficit when  they passed the tax bill last December--a massive deficit. It will  approach over $900 billion this year. It just about doubled the annual  deficit with that piece of legislation. I used to say the deficit hawks  migrate in December. My guess is they are going to come back as we deal  with the new appropriation bill, and as we do that, I would hope they  would keep in mind the $5.7 billion for an unspecified wall in an  unspecified location of an unspecified height to carry on an  unspecified purpose--5.7 billion.   So let us continue for a moment. I want to deal with one other thing.  This is the kind of thing that probably, Madam Speaker, you have to see  this picture. This picture is worth maybe 500 words, but nevertheless I  am going to use 250 of them.   This is a picture of the President of the United States and the  Governor of California at the Paradise fire. Somewhere around 16,  17,000 homes were destroyed. Eighty-seven American citizens were killed  in that fire. An entire community of some 25, 30,000 people is gone. It  just doesn't exist anymore. It is gone. It is ash. It is rubble.   Fortunately, Madam Speaker, the American Government, you and I and  others and those who preceded us, developed a program called the  Stafford Act which provides the generosity of Americans to help rebuild  families and communities such as Paradise, California; or Redding,  California which also suffered a few thousand homes burned and  destroyed, not nearly as many deaths fortunately.                                time  1630    So the Stafford Act is what we know as FEMA, Federal Emergency  Management Agency, the declaration at the county level and at the State  level of a disaster, then at the Federal level of a disaster, and then  a presidential declaration of a disaster.   The Federal Government then steps in and begins to provide funding to  rebuild, to help the individuals who have lost everything, through the  Small Business Administration and some direct grants, and to help  communities put back in place their infrastructure. It is a wonderful  expression of America's empathy and generosity.   Two weeks ago my colleague Mr. LaMalfa's constituents, who has the  district just north of me, many of whom now live and have found housing  in my area just south of Paradise, were greeted with a tweet from the  President.   I am going to paraphrase what the tweet said; I don't have it with me  right now. It basically said: I will stop all FEMA funding until the  State of California properly manages its forests.   Madam Speaker, I must tell you, we have seen tweet after tweet, and  they range from disgusting to awful and occasionally one that you go:  ``Okay.'' But with this one we said: What in the world are you talking  about, Mr. President? What are you tweeting about?   You are going to deny these people--you were there, Mr. President.  You were there. You saw the devastation.   We counted the 87 people who died, and they are still sifting through  the remains of these houses and may find even more. You were there. And  you say you are going to cut off support until California manages its  forests properly. You know not what you talk about or tweet about, Mr.  President.   The fact of the matter is that the Federal forests which you oversee,  Mr. President, are the ones that are mismanaged, for a whole variety of  historic reasons, many of which we have actually made steps to improve  here in legislation.   So what is with this man that he would wake up one morning and say:  No more help from the Federal Government.   Does he think everything is about leverage? Is that what he thinks,  that he could use his power, awesome as it is, to leverage something?   That is precisely what he is doing with the wall. That is precisely  what he is doing with 25 days of this Nation's government shutdown. He  is using the citizens of America as leverage. He is using the 800,000  employees, the Department of Interior, the Department of the Treasury,  the IRS, the EPA, the Department of Transportation, the Coast Guard, as  leverage for his border wall promise.   It is despicable. It has got to end.   I need time to cool off.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin), my  colleague, who comes from an extraordinary family.   And another generation has joined us.  [[Page H586]]         Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for bringing our  attention to the real-life problems that these employees have  personally and that are being created for Americans, whether it is the  weather or a broken pipeline or an airplane that wasn't inspected. It  is very important that we all know those things. I thank the gentleman  for joining us.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Brendan F. Boyle), my colleague, and ask him to please share with us  his thoughts on the government shutdown.    The gentleman is quite correct about the nature of the  shutdown and the impact that it has on Americans.   Can I be optimistic and encourage him to figure out how to stop these  from ever happening again? And when he grows a very gray head of hair  and a gray beard, perhaps he will have figured it out. It just hasn't  happened.   I was around for the 1995 shutdown. I was the Deputy Secretary at the  Department of the Interior, number two, and that massive Department  which I spoke of earlier, the parks, the Fish and Wildlife services,  all of those organizations--gone.   At that time, we did not have the requirement that essential services  would be provided; there was just nobody working. And that went on for,  I think, 23 days, which until this week was the longest. It was a long  time ago, and here we are once again and in between. I think there are  ways.   I notice many of my colleagues on the Republican side are here, will  soon have the opportunity to take the floor and will probably debate  many of the points or disagree with many of the points that I have made  earlier today. I saw a few jaws clenching, biting down on their teeth,  just wanting to get in the mix of it.   Mr. MEADOWS asked for time, and I didn't really want to hear that,  but the gentleman will have time in just a moment. I am not sure what  he is going to argue, but I would be pleased to hear why this shutdown  is good, why it is necessary to keep the government of America, the  essential parts of the government--not the military. The Medicare  checks continue to go out, and that is happening. The military,  Department of Defense, we funded that earlier, and that continues, and  thankfully so.   But the Treasury Department, SEC, EPA, Agriculture--I didn't even get  into agriculture, although I have a $4.5 billion farm gate agricultural  district. They are hurting.   The crop checks that they need and the assurance they need to their  lenders that they will be able to plant their crops when the rainy  season is over in a few weeks, it is not happening now, so that is  delayed. And it may be, if it goes much longer, they will miss their  planting opportunities.   Food stamps will soon be unavailable, and millions of Americans may,  under that circumstance, be very, very hungry. Why is it worth it? Why  is it worth it?   Why don't we start up government, pass the legislation that is over  in the Senate, encourage, cajole, browbeat a few Senators to pass the  legislation, put it on the President's desk, and then he can have that  mantle of shutting down the government once again very clearly?   We will deal with border security. We have over the years, and  recently we have done that and we will do it again. But that is a  negotiating process. We negotiate on virtually everything around here.   I have yet to get my way; but then, I am one of seven children. I  learned very, very early, I don't get my way very often. I would like  to participate in that process of give-and-take.   And for proper comprehensive border security, we know--I won't speak  names. Perhaps that will get me in trouble here. But more than one of  you sitting there and I have had conversations about border security,  about immigration and how we could solve that problem. That is going to  take some time, and surely there are places for a fence or a wall or  concrete or steel or whatever, those places for improved ports of  entry, more personnel.   I haven't even started to talk about the children that were  separated. That will get me off on another thing that wouldn't be  helpful now. But that takes time, and you and I know that we need to  solve that problem.   So let's start our government today, tomorrow. Let's prove to the  world that it really is an American Government--not shut down but  operating, all of its good and all of its extraordinary work and,  occasionally, the mistakes that it makes. But it is not operating now.   And then let's take the time over the next 30 days, 60 days, whatever  you want to put on it, to negotiate real border security, dealing with  the immigration issues, dealing with DACA, dealing with fences and  border ports of entry, the kind of technology that is necessary to know  what is inside that container, the kind of technology that is  necessary, and the kind of personnel necessary to check not one of five  cars but every car and every truck and every plane and every ship. We  ought to do that. But right now we are in the heat of this, and we are  not getting anywhere.   So as he takes the floor in the next hour, I will listen and our team  will listen. I would ask him to encourage his colleagues, our  colleagues in the Senate, to pass the legislation that has been sent to  them, which is actually the Republican appropriations bills, take a  very significant major step towards reopening government, and then  let's take the time to thoughtfully, properly address a very complex,  very long-lasting problem in America: immigration, border security. I  know most of them, and I think that is what they would really like  to do.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
