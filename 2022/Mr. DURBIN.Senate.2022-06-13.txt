 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I got the news, along with others,  Sunday morning about the decision of 10 Republican and Democratic  Senators to move forward with the proposal to deal with our Nation's  epidemic of gun violence. I had a conversation with Senator Chris  Murphy, who has been one of our leaders on the Democratic side, about  exactly what that meant and the help that we might be able to offer to  him from the Senate Judiciary Committee.   I just want to say, at this moment, that I really want to commend my  colleagues on both sides, Democrats and Republicans. I believe they  made a good-faith effort to negotiate a package of reforms. Senator  Murphy, Senator Cornyn of Texas, made it bipartisan, timely, and I  believe did an excellent job. Is it the package that I would have  written? No--nor yours, Madam President. You would have included  things, and I would have included others. But it is within our reach.   We have a bitterly politically divided nation. That is a fact. We  have a Senate Judiciary Committee evenly divided 50-50. We have a  Chamber evenly divided 50-50. So it is difficult to say that any one  party or one person will get exactly what they want in this political  atmosphere, but it is equally important to note that we have all gone  home and gotten the message over and over again. Whether it was in  reference to the supermarket killing in Buffalo, the fourth grade  school class in Uvalde, TX, or the doctor and other bystanders being  killed in a Tulsa, OK, hospital, all of that has occurred in the last  few days.    The American people have reacted with one voice, and they have said  to us two words: ``Do something.'' To Members of Congress, don't just  tell us you are going to give us your thoughts and prayers. Do  something.   Well, I think this decision to move forward could help. Every  provision in this agreement could save a life. For that reason, if for  no other, I will be supporting it.   This agreement would support ``red flag'' laws. It is one way they  characterize them. ``Crisis intervention orders'' is another. Many  States--19--already have them. It would also close dangerous gaps in  Federal law that enable domestic abusive boyfriends to get guns.   I want to commend Senator Klobuchar, who has been the leader in the  U.S. Senate on that issue. We tried to help her on a previous piece of  legislation, and it didn't have the votes to do it, but if it is  included in this package, I will definitely support it, and I thank her  for her leadership.   It also would strengthen the background check system by clarifying  which gun sellers would be required to conduct background checks. That  is a step in the right direction. I hope there is more coming.   The agreement would provide funds for desperately needed mental  health and trauma support services, including more school counselors  for enhanced school safety.   I can't tell you how critically important that is. Half of the people  who die because of a gun in America commit suicide. It is a plea for  help that we should be answering. This could help. We also know that  some of the people who pick up these guns and go shooting children and  innocent people have serious mental illness problems. They need  counseling, too, and we need to find ways to reach them.   I also want to add that we have a different form of gun violence in  big cities like Chicago. Many of these crimes are committed by kids and  gangs, and these kids--90 percent-plus of them--have been victims of  trauma in their lives. Things have happened to them which they can  never forget, and they need help to deal with them. So mental health  counseling and trauma counseling are critical to reducing gun violence  at all of these different levels.   Importantly, the framework would crack down on the straw purchasing  and the illicit trafficking of guns. Last August, an amazing young  woman who was a Chicago policewoman, Ella French, was on duty with her  partner, sitting in the squad car, when a man walked up and shot her in  the head and killed her. Then he shot the other officer and blinded him  in one eye. The gun that he used to kill the policewoman was the  subject of a straw purchase.   What does that mean? That means that he could never have cleared a  background check. He was a convicted felon. So he finds a friend or a  girlfriend to go in and buy it--someone who has no criminal record--and  then he hands the gun over to him, and he turns around and kills a  wonderful Chicago policewoman. The outpouring of sentiment in favor of  Ella French and her family was overwhelming.   I hope that we can get this provision, which I have worked on with  Senators Collins and Leahy, included in the final passage so as to  tighten up the penalties on those who make straw purchases.   If you are going to stand up and lie to buy a gun so that you can  give it to someone who can't pass a background check, you ought to pay  dearly for that. It cost Ella French her life, and I hope that we stick  with this provision all the way through.   The last point is especially important because I have met her mother;  I have met the officer who was in the car with her; and I met his  family. I know how much this particular incident has meant to each and  every one of their lives.    Does an agreement like this do everything that I would like? No, it  doesn't, but this, if we can pass it, will be the most significant gun  violence reform in 30 years in Congress--30 years. We now have more  guns than people in this country. They estimate some 400 million guns.  They can't even give me anywhere close to an exact number of how many  AR-15s we have in this country. I have heard estimates that people are  convinced the number ranges from 10 to 20 million of these AR-15  military assault-type weapons.   We have a long way to go before we reach the finish line, but I want  to commend those Senators who have worked so hard to bring us to this  point. I will just make it very clear: I am prepared to do everything I  can as a Senator and as whip to bring the votes together to get this  done as quickly as possible.                           Student Loan Forgiveness    Now, Madam President, on another matter, 2 weeks ago, the Education  Department announced it would wipe out $5.8 billion in student loan  debt owed by 560,000 borrowers who had attended for-profit Corinthian  Colleges in the last 20 years. Corinthian Colleges was one of the  largest, most corrupt, most unscrupulous companies in the for-profit  college industry, but it wasn't alone in its shady dealings--far from  it.   So the basic primer on for-profit colleges and universities--the  question that you are going to face on the final exam--is this: What  two numbers tell the whole story about for-profit colleges and  universities? The numbers 8 and 30. What do they mean? Eight percent of  high school graduates go to for-profit colleges and universities--8  percent. Thirty percent of all of the student loan defaults in the  United States are of students from for-profit colleges and  universities.   Why? Why are these students who attend for-profit schools failing to  make their student loan payments?   Well, first, these for-profit industry schools charge too much in  tuition. The students can't keep up with the debt, so they borrow more.  They reach a point where something happens, and they have to drop out-- afraid of the debt they have accumulated.   At the next stage, some finish. They take their diplomas from their  for-profit schools, and they learn, unfortunately, that they are almost  worthless. Westwood College is one of those fraudulent for-profit  colleges. It operated 15 campuses in 5 different States, including  Illinois--Westwood College. I remember driving out to O'Hare Airport  and looking up at the side of one of those tall office buildings. They  had a sign for Westwood College, and I thought: What a fraud.   Like the Corinthian Colleges, Westwood used high-pressure sales and  marketing tactics and outright lies to pressure students to take on  huge amounts of student debt. Students in Westwood's criminal justice  program in Illinois were told that a Westwood  [[Page S2903]]  criminal justice degree would all but guarantee them a good-paying job  with the local police department, maybe even with the FBI. What a lie.   Victoria Vences is one of the thousands of Illinois students who  heard those lies and is paying the price for it. Victoria is the first  person in her family ever to attend college, and that is the case more  often than not. These students come from families with no college  experience and don't know where to turn. They look at the advertising  and, unfortunately, fall for it. They sign up for these for-profit  schools like Westwood.   Victoria enrolled in the criminal justice program at Westwood in  2007, believing it would help her land a job as a probation officer or  maybe even with the Immigration Services. After 3 years of juggling  full-time jobs and going to school full time, Victoria was shocked to  learn that a Westwood degree would not pay off at all. At that time,  she owed $50,000 in student loans that she had taken out at Westwood.  Not wanting to take out more loans for a useless degree, she dropped  out. She started applying for law enforcement jobs, showing them the  certificate of her transcript from Westwood, and they told her that it  was worthless.   Victoria now works for the Illinois Domestic Violence Hotline. She  likes her job, and she helps a lot of people, but she has never earned  enough of an income to make the monthly payments on her student loans.  Victoria Vences isn't someone who shirks responsibility. She is helping  to raise a niece and a nephew who live with her. She doesn't believe  that she should have to pay back $50,000 in loans because of the  deception. I agree.   Last week, I wrote to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, asking him  for a second time--and I like him, but if he doesn't start answering my  letters, I am going to have to think of a way to get his attention. I  asked him to cancel the student loan debt of all former Westwood  criminal justice students in Illinois who were defrauded by this  company.    I first made this request in April of last year. It is time for a  response, Mr. Secretary.   Last July, the Education Secretary canceled the student loan debts of  1,600 former Westwood students. Among them were 488 Illinois students  who had taken on debt to enroll in Westwood's worthless criminal  justice program. These students had all applied for relief under  something known as borrower defense that allows the Education  Department to cancel their student debts.   There are still more than 3,000 Westwood criminal justice students in  Illinois who haven't gotten that same break. Some of them, like  Victoria Vences, have carried that debt for more than 10 years. It has  ruined their credit ratings, and it has made it harder for them to find  a job, rent an apartment, or think about a future.   We have known for more than a decade that Westwood used misleading  marketing tactics. Now they have to be called to account. The unethical  behavior was documented in detail by Illinois' former attorney general,  Lisa Madigan, who sued Westwood 10 years ago. I remember that. I joined  her in a press conference announcing it.   The Education Department also has concluded that Westwood defrauded  its criminal justice program students in Illinois. The Education  Department should grant automatic loan forgiveness for all of the  approximately 3,000 students who are still burdened with Westwood's  criminal justice program deception.   During the Trump years, the Education Department decided to take a  blind eye to the situation of these for-profit schools. The Trump  administration actually hired people who worked in that industry--for  these schools--to regulate them. You can guess what happened--no  regulation.   It is time for the Education Department to make a difference, and let  me say that it is time for us to make a difference when it comes to  student loan debt. It was in 1998 when we decided--in a bill which was  loaded with extras that people didn't discover until long after it  passed--that you couldn't discard your student loan in bankruptcy. If  you had a mortgage on a home and filed for bankruptcy, you could  discharge that mortgage, even on a second home, even on a car loan,  even on a loan for a boat, even on a loan for appliances--just about  everything except a student loan.   Well, that was the wrong decision. That was the wrong policy. There  are more than 3 million student loan borrowers who owe more than  $100,000 in student loans, but we have decided these would be  nondischargeable in bankruptcy. There is a provision in there that  says, if there is an undue hardship, you might be able to discharge  your loan. Almost never does a court rule that there is an undue  hardship.   This situation is unsustainable. Senator John Cornyn of Texas and I  have introduced a bipartisan bill to change it to make sure the  Bankruptcy Code gives student debt a break. I will continue working  with him and others to get this done. Bankruptcy should always be the  last resort, but it ought to be an option for those who truly need  relief, and these student borrowers do.   The bottom line: Even with other reform measures, like relief for the  Corinthian Colleges students, bankruptcy reform ought to be part of the  solution to the student debt crisis. I hope that it will.                                  H.R. 3967    Madam President, I recently received a letter from a man in Chicago  who was writing on behalf of his dad who was a Vietnam war vet, and he  was writing for hundreds of thousands of other veterans just like his  dad.   These people are sick with illnesses connected to their military  service. These veterans served our Nation in many different wars, in  many different places, and at many different times in different  branches of the military. They have one thing in common: They were  unknowingly poisoned with toxic chemicals during their service. They  came home from war and thought they were safe as they managed to escape  the fate of some of their colleagues, but years and sometimes decades  later, they became sick with rare cancers, with debilitating lung  diseases, heart conditions, and other illnesses as a result of toxic  exposure during their service.   One veteran said:         It's like an I.E.D. that goes off in your body 8 or 10 or       20 years [after you are out of the service].    Al LaHood, who is not related to the Congressman or the Congressman's  son, is the father my constituent wrote to me about. Al was 22 years  old when he was drafted in the Army, and he went to Vietnam in 1968. He  was an infantryman, a machinegunner, stationed at Camp Cu Chi,  northwest of Saigon. He came home after a year, with a Bronze Star for  valor, but he brought something else home, although he wouldn't know it  for almost 50 years. His body had absorbed Agent Orange, the toxic  defoliant used by the U.S. military in Vietnam to clear the jungles.   (Ms. DUCKWORTH assumed the Chair.)   After his service, Al LaHood earned a college degree and an MBA, got  married, had a family--the American dream.   Every 2 years, he and his Army buddies made a point of having a  reunion somewhere. One by one, over the years, his buddies started  getting sick. Heart disease, prostate cancer, esophageal cancer--it  turns out all related to the toxic exposure to Agent Orange.   Four years ago, the toxic timebomb caught up with Al LaHood. He was  diagnosed with a rare form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; last year, even  worse news--diagnosed with another rare cancer. Doctors tell him he has  a 30-percent chance of surviving 5 years.   The VA ruled that his cancers are service-related and declared Al a  hundred percent disabled. It amazes him to think that he now receives  more in disability compensation each month than he received in combat  pay for an entire year in Vietnam.   ``People don't understand the true cost of war,'' Al says.   Exposure to toxic substances is not new. In World War I, it was  mustard gas; World War II, exposure to nuclear tests; Vietnam, Agent  Orange. In the Persian Gulf wars and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,  there was a new form of exposure. It was called burn pits. The military  dug massive pits, filled them with everything imaginable--from ruined  humvees and aircraft to medical waste, human waste, computers,  batteries, plastics--every bit of trash produced in a war on a military  [[Page S2904]]  base. Then they doused it all with jet fuel and lit it on fire. The  thick black smoke from the fire contained invisible deadly chemicals.  They filled the air and covered everything around. And the soldiers,  they breathed them into their lungs and into their bodies.   Al LaHood's son said his dad was concerned for the veterans from Iraq  and Afghanistan. He hopes they receive early screening, so if they  develop cancer, this just might be able to save their lives.   Al and his family say they want more research into the kinds of rare  cancers and other illnesses that toxic-exposed veterans developed so  they can be detected earlier. Al would give up gladly all of his  disability payments if the money could be spent on research for  illnesses that might hit his fellow victims exposed to toxic  substances.   I want Al LaHood and the hundreds of thousands of toxic-exposed  veterans, their families, and caregivers to know the U.S. Senate not  only honors your service; we hear your voices.   This week, the Senate is taking up SFC Heath Robinson Honoring Our  PACT Act. The PACT Act is the most important piece of veterans  legislation in a generation. It is about keeping promises, the promises  that we made to veterans that if they risked their lives for our Nation  and became wounded as a result, that we would not leave them behind;  they would have healthcare and benefits they needed and earned.   The PACT Act builds on the historic Agent Orange Act. Let me, at this  point, note that a friend of mine, now deceased, was one of the major  movers on the Agent Orange Act of 1991. His name was Lane Evans. He was  from the Quad Cities in Illinois. He and I were elected to the U.S.  House in the same year, 1982.   Lane was a Vietnam-era veteran who came back determined to help his  fellow veterans, and he made Agent Orange his cause. He recognized that  illnesses caused by Agent Orange are actually war wounds and should be  treated that way.   The PACT Act takes that principle that Congressman Lane Evans stood  for and applies it to other situations. It applies it to all American  veterans from all wars who were exposed to toxic chemicals during their  service, whether overseas or in the United States.   As we continue to learn about the cost of exposure, it provides a  framework to add more conditions related to toxic exposure in the  future. Veterans will no longer have to fight a second war with the VA  to prove their illness was service-related. They can focus on fighting  their disease instead of fighting the bureaucracy.   It is estimated that the PACT Act will affect 1 out of every 5  veterans--3.5 million veterans in all. The act directs the VA to devote  resources and personnel needed to process new claims and treat new  patients.   In another provision, which I strongly support, the PACT Act directs  the VA to work collaboratively with the Department of Defense and  Health and Human Services and EPA--a whole-of-government search for  better ways to detect, treat, and cure these hidden deadly wounds of  war. Our veterans deserve nothing else.   I have heard some critics say: This is going to cost a lot of money.   Right. It just might do that. But can you think of a more deserving  cause? Can you think of anything better than for us to really face the  true causes of war than to stand by our veterans?   Madam President, you know that story far better than I do.   I have long supported this whole-of-government approach to research-- especially at the VA--and treatment for our veterans.   Many VA researchers are veterans themselves, determined to find  innovative treatment and cures.   I commend Senator Jon Tester of Montana and Senator Jerry Moran--they  are the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs  Committee--for their leadership in producing this excellent, timely,  and historic bipartisan bill.   I especially thank the more than 60 veteran service organizations,  like the VFW--I spoke to their statewide convention in Springfield just  last Friday--and so many others that helped produce this bill and the  veterans who fought to reach this point--fought sometimes literally  with their last breath.   I will vote proudly for the PACT Act. I urge my colleagues to do the  same.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock) is  necessarily absent.
