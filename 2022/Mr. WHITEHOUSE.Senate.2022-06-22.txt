 Mr. President, I rise now for the 284th time with my  increasingly tattered and battered ``Time to Wake up'' poster to urge  this Chamber to wake up on the issue of climate change.   Human beings dumped 36.3 billion tons of greenhouse gases into the  atmosphere last year--last year. After all our big talk, after all the  plans and the COPS and the commitments, 36.3 billion tons. That is the  highest total ever recorded. We are not doing any better. We continue  to do worse, and here in Congress, we continue to do nothing. We have  seen this coming for many years. And even with all that warning,  nothing.   NOAA reports there is currently more carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  now than at any time during the last 4 million years. Humankind has  never experienced what we are putting ourselves through.   Here is a look at it. Over centuries, wobbling, wobbling, back and  forth quite steadily. And now--whoops--and all the way up to where we  are, out of the historic range of this planet back into geological  time.   All that carbon pollution has us hurtling toward climate catastrophe.  With every ton of carbon dioxide we add, comes a higher risk of  destructive changes to our world: ever-stronger hurricanes, rising  seas, severe droughts, flooding, heat waves, disease, hunger, and more.  We have a simple choice: We act swiftly to address the carbon pollution  scorching our planet or we tip our climate over the edge into a cycle  of destruction mankind cannot halt.   As we disrupt essential planetary operating systems, we face another  problem: American deindustrialization and the offshoring of jobs in  much of our manufacturing base.   After China joined the World Trade Organization back here in 2001,  the United States lost almost 6 million manufacturing jobs. It was a  complete bloodbath. Communities across America were hollowed out as  factories closed and workers were laid off losing union jobs that  helped workers support their families and enjoy a good wage and a  decent standard of living.   Our trade deficit blew up, especially for manufactured goods. In  2001, our trade deficit in manufactured goods topped $250 billion. By  2020, it had more than tripled to almost $900 billion.   Then came the COVID-19 pandemic and exposed the fact that we no  longer make so much upon which modern life depends. First it was the  masks and the protective gear for medical professionals on the  frontlines; then shortages came to everything from patio furniture to  auto computer chips, bicycles, garage doors, and much more.   Well, what if--what if--it turned out there was a solution to both  problems, a policy that would simultaneously drive down carbon  pollution worldwide and help reshore American manufacturing? Well, it  turns out there is such a solution, and it is called a carbon border  adjustment. With Senators Coons, Schatz, and Heinrich, I have  introduced one here in the Senate.    The fact is that American manufacturers are way less carbon-intensive  than other competitors. On average, we are nearly 50-percent less  carbon-intensive than our trading partners.   Here is a list of some of our majors: China, 3.2 times more  efficient; Mexico, 1.4 times more efficient; India, 3.8 times more  efficient. So if we level the playing field about carbon emissions  economy to economy, we win against carbon-intensive nations like China  and India. And that is fair. A steel plant in Shanghai shouldn't be  able to pollute for free and undercut plants in Pittsburgh that make  better steel with less pollution. My border adjustment fixes that  problem. Carbon-polluting goods from abroad, fossil fuels, refined  petroleum products, petrochemicals, fertilizer, cement, steel would be  tariffed on the carbon intensity of their industries. This means that  if you are a carbon-intensive cement factory in Mexico, you pay or you  invest in technologies to lower your carbon intensity to match that  cleaner plant across the border in Texas.   That is a powerful incentive to reduce global emissions and a big  boost to U.S. companies competing against foreign climate cheaters.   The tariff revenues fund a competitive grant program for carbon- emitting U.S. industries to help them invest in the new technologies  necessary to reduce their own carbon intensities.   Developing countries didn't get us into this mess, and they are  getting clobbered by climate change, so we also direct some revenue to  the State Department to support decarbonization projects in those  countries.   To make this work, we need to hold American companies to the same  standard as we do overseas, so we set  [[Page S3066]]  the standard at our U.S. average emissions for the industry. So all you  have to do to pay nothing is be better than average. And if you are  below average, all you have to do to pay nothing is to clean up your  act to where half your industry already is.   We also give clear targets to industries for future baseline carbon  intensity because that is what industry wants--clarity, certainty to  know where the goalposts are.   Look at an example. Under my bill, the average or better American  steel mill would pay no charge at all because it is better than  average. The below average steel mill might pay $5 to $10 per ton of  steel produced, a $5 to $10 per ton incentive to clean up its mill. But  here is the really good part: Imports from a Chinese steel mill, more  like $110 per ton. The below average U.S. steel mill, $5 to $10; the  Chinese, $110. That will make Americans feel more competitive compared  to polluting Chinese imports, and then buyers will beat a path to our  door.   We might as well get ready with a U.S. carbon border adjustment  because the European Union Parliament is passing a carbon border  adjustment of its own. Member states will vote on that proposal later  this year. When it takes effect, American companies will pay a carbon  tariff to European governments--unless we have one of our own. Now,  where we want to be is for the EU, the UK, Canada, Mexico, Japan,  perhaps South Korea, all with common carbon border adjustments,  creating a common carbon pricing platform across all those major  economies so that we move toward decarbonization, and more importantly,  the rest of the world that wants to trade with the United States, with  the UK, with the EU, has to clean up its act. They would need to  decarbonize and fast to have any hope of competing.   Trying to convince Chinese manufacturers to clean up their act out of  the goodness of their hearts, perhaps, is a bit of a fool's errand.  Putting a tariff on their goods so that they have to pay if they don't  clean up their act? Now, that is how you get things going.   Unfortunately, this is on us now--on Democrats. There are too many  Republicans who are just in tow to the fossil fuel industry to help.   And, of course, you can't talk about anything having to do with  climate change without the dark money scoundrels, propped up by the  fossil fuel industry, to come and cause mischief. They are even  advertising against my bill.   Here is an advertisement against it paid for by AG Conservatives--AG  Conservatives. Well, assume that this is a real organization, which it  isn't. It is a front group paid for by dark money that hides who the  real donors are--just a mouthpiece for somebody who doesn't want to  identify themselves.   But why would an agriculture group want to hurt manufacturing? It  doesn't make any sense. Why would they not want American manufacturing  to have that advantage against their Chinese competition? Why would  they be asking people to vote no on a carbon border adjustment?   And by the way, there are a lot of products where agricultural  products form the feedstock for a later manufacturing product. And if  we are bringing manufacturing to the United States because we are  favored versus dirty polluting foreign manufacturers, why would they  not want that to happen?   And where is agriculture in this fight anyway when this is mostly  about manufacturing? Where, for American agriculture, is the downside?   If you think it through, it actually doesn't exist, which helps  confirm to me that behind this phony front group is probably the fossil  fuel industry pretending that it is some agriculture group. If that  were agriculture, that was agriculture from millions of years ago  before it all went down to the bottom and got compressed and rotted and  turned, after millions of years, into oil. That is the agriculture.   So that is what we are up against. That is why Democrats are going to  have to do this. The fossil fuel money that is driving the other party  makes it impossible for bipartisanship to work.   We have a shot in reconciliation to pass a serious climate bill--a  real one--and we should make a carbon border adjustment a central  component of that bill. It is a win-win-win. We compete on a playing  field with a huge built-in advantage for American manufacturing; we  spare ourselves carbon tariffs from the EU; and we relentlessly, with  economic pressure and power, drive down carbon pollution across the  biggest polluters around the globe--a win-win-win.   The choice is clear. Let's win.   I yield the floor.
