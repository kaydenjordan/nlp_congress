 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Colorado for  yielding. I also thank Chairman Grijalva for the work he put in.   I rise to speak, Madam Chair, in support of the Wildfire Response and  Drought Resiliency Act. This bill includes many long-fought initiatives  to address the mega-drought and year-round wildfires we see in Arizona.   Arizona's First Congressional District encompasses rural and Tribal  communities, six national forests, three Tribal forests, along with the  Grand Canyon. There is no longer a wildfire season in northern Arizona.  Deadly wildfires happen year-round, and these fires threaten our homes,  businesses, and communities.   Included within the final package are several bills that address key  policy steps we can take to address wildfires, drought, and public  safety in our national forests.   This legislation allows for the hiring of more Forest Service law  enforcement officers, which will improve safety and oversight of our  forests, especially during high-risk days when fires can start in an  instant.   Another critical provision included will create a grant program to  remove nonnative plant species, like salt cedars, that contribute to  drought and fire conditions.   Importantly, also within this package are two Tribal water  settlements that I have fought for since 2017 when I arrived in  Congress, the White Mountain Apache Tribe and Hualapai Tribe water  settlements. The Tribes have been waiting decades for these Federal  approvals.   In addition, these settlements will provide the State of Arizona with  greater surety in its water future.   Today, I am looking forward to joining my colleagues gathered here to  vote to pass this critical package of bills. I also acknowledge that  there is a tremendous amount of work over decades that has not been  done by this Congress that it has to complete.
