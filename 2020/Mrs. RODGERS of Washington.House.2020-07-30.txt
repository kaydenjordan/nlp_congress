 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the  bill. While it contains many partisan poison pills and reckless levels  of spending, there is a glaring omission: funding for the long-term  storage of nuclear waste.   Safely storing our Nation's existing and future nuclear waste in  Yucca Mountain is of paramount importance. Eastern Washington pioneered  some of the most important breakthroughs in nuclear technology of the  last century at the Hanford Site near Tri-Cities, Washington. Their  efforts are critical to continuing the development and the expansion of  nuclear power in the next century.   However, this important work came at a cost. Today, more than 2,000  tons of spent nuclear waste and millions of gallons of high-level waste  await disposal at the Hanford Site, which is why it is so necessary  that we move forward with the Yucca Mountain site and properly dispose  of the nuclear waste in eastern Washington and from the sites in 38  other States across the country.   The United States has led the world in nuclear energy innovation, and  continued advancements in this important technology will be essential  to meet our clean energy needs and maintain our global leadership in  the 21st century.   Failure to move forward with the Yucca Mountain site jeopardizes our  ability to continue to innovate in the future and is unfair to the  communities that have dealt with the cost of housing nuclear waste for  the past 50 years.   I would like to end by thanking Congressman Shimkus for his years of  tireless leadership on this important issue. Whether shepherding  legislation through the Energy and Commerce Committee and through the  House, prodding the Appropriations Committee to act, or leading  delegations to see Yucca firsthand, no one has been  [[Page H4120]]  more dedicated to solving the nuclear waste issue for our Nation's  communities.   Let's help him finish that fight by working on a bipartisan, long- term solution to our country's nuclear waste.
