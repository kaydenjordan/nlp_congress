 Mr. President, on the day after Christmas, former Senator  Jocelyn Burdick died in Fargo, ND, at the age of 97.   Jocelyn served only 30 days, roughly--or 3 months, maybe, at the  most--in the United States Senate while she filled the vacancy that was  created by the death of her husband, the longtime United States  Senator, Quentin Burdick. During those 3 months, Jocelyn was able to  cast votes as her husband would have cast them and to support his staff  after his death and through the transition to fill the vacancy in a  special election. Jocelyn will forever hold a place in North Dakota  history as North Dakota's first woman United States Senator.   However, her service in North Dakota goes far beyond those 3 months  she served in the Senate. All of us Senators know the importance and  the incredible service of our spouses. Jocelyn stood by Quentin's side  for 32 years while he served our State here in this important body.   Throughout her life, Jocelyn embraced her place in public life with  tremendous grace, dignity, and class. She demonstrated by example how  people can be principled in their beliefs, yet friendly, cordial, even  affectionate while having different political views. I am honored to be  standing here using her desk--Quentin's desk. To be a part of this  heritage is a great honor for me.   The impact of her life well lived can be seen in countless ways,  especially as a philanthropist, as a political and community volunteer,  and certainly as a woman of deep faith. Jocelyn's memory will remain  alive in the hearts of all of those who had the privilege to know her.   Kris and I join Senator Hoeven and Mikey, and many, many North  Dakotans in sending our condolences and our best wishes to the Burdick  family. We pray that fond memories and the deep affection so many  people held for Jocelyn will comfort them in these days and the days  ahead. I pray that God will bless Jocelyn Burdick's memory.   I yield the floor.
