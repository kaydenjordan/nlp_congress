 Madam Speaker, back in high school when I was a senior  at a pregame warm-up at Carthage, I had my hands under the center about  to take a snap, throw a pass--the manager had my helmet--I am looking  at the split end, and the manager yelled, Louie, and I looked up in  time to have my nose splattered all over my face.   That is what this warning will be. It is not going to stop violence.  It is just going to say, look, we have got more violence.   Let's talk about what it really is. The truth is, these cities with  the most violence in America--and there are already 1,400 warning  systems that will already take care of this, but, apparently, we need  more help in the big cities controlled by Democrats.   We are not going to lower the crime rate. I have spent much of my  adult life in courtrooms dealing with crime. I am familiar with what  causes it, what happens. My heart has gone out repeatedly to victims,  but you have got to reduce crime.  [[Page H6000]]    How can we do that? We have brought up repeatedly in committee over  the years, 17 and a half years I have been here, look, let's go to the  heart of what is causing the crime.   I saw a recent report that said fatherlessness definitely is  affecting the crime. It definitely is affecting the violence. It is  increasing the violence.   We have always had guns, but we haven't had mass shootings like this,  mass killings. The culture has changed. Then we see this administration  is going to help deal with problems around the world by giving grants  to groups that will promote atheism and humanism. As if we are not  doing enough damage. Because as Adam said, this Constitution was meant  for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for the  governing of any other.   If we want to deal with shooters, don't take away guns from law- abiding people. Look where the mass shootings are. They like to go  where there is nobody law-abiding that has a gun.   And what about the border? The border has drugs pouring across, drugs  that have added tens of billions a year to the drug cartels that engage  in violence and are now located in cities all over America.   So I would just submit, you know, this is going to be, if it is  passed--and the Democrats have the majority. They have the White House.  They have the Senate. If it passes, you know, it is going to be in the  big cities.   They are not going to reduce their crime. So I would suggest if they  are going to be going 24/7, at least get some nice music on there so  maybe that will be soothing. Maybe some good Paul Williams songs,  because it is not going to stop crime. Maybe some good music will make  people feel better.                                time  1330     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays. The  SPEAKER pro tempore.
