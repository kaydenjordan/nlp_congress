 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Berryessa Snow  Mountain National Monument Expansion Act.   This legislation would expand the Berryessa Snow Mountain National  Monument to include approximately 3,925 acres of adjacent public land  managed by the Bureau of Land Management.   In 2015, President Obama established the Berryessa Snow Mountain  National Monument, proclaiming that ``once covered by ocean waters, it  is a landscape shaped by geologic forces of staggering power overlain  with bountiful but fragile biodiversity. Anchored in the north by Snow  Mountain's remote forests and in the south by scenic Berryessa  Mountain, this area stretches through unbroken wildlands and important  wildlife corridors, a mosaic of native grasslands, picturesque oak  woodlands, rare wetlands, and wild chaparral . . . This dramatic and  diverse landscape is a biological hotspot providing refuge for rare  plant and animal species and showcasing the human history of north- central California.''   The Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument is managed jointly by  the Bureau of Land Management, BLM, and the U.S. Forest Service, USFS  and provides for unparalleled outdoor recreational opportunities, is  home to rich biodiversity, and contains lands that are culturally  significant to over two dozen federally recognized tribes. This  legislation would add over 3,900 acres of adjacent, BLM-administered  land to the existing national monument.   This expansion would include portions of the land known previously as  Walker Ridge in Lake County, CA. Importantly, the legislation renames  ``Walker Ridge'' to ``Condor Ridge,'' which is translated from Molok  Luyuk in the indigenous Patwin language. For thousands of years, these  sacred lands have been central to Tribal origin stories, and Condor  Ridge is an area that retains deep cultural significance to the Patwin  people and over two dozen Native American tribes. The legislation also  directs the BLM and USFS to complete the management plan for the  national monument and to consult with federally recognized Tribes to do  so.   I am proud that this legislation would better enable federally  recognized Tribes to be involved in the day-to-day management of the  national monument. This essential, landmark component of the  legislation would enable Tribal communities to share their rich history  and ecological knowledge to better conserve and care for these lands.   With the protections provided by this legislation, the abundant  natural resources and the rich history on Molok Luyuk will be preserved  for our children and future generations. By requiring the Federal  Agencies to finally develop a management plan and by allowing for  Tribal governments to be involved in the management of the monument,  the bill would improve the health of these lands to benefit both people  and biodiversity.  [[Page S2133]]    I thank Senator Feinstein for introducing this legislation with me,  and I thank Congressmen Garamendi and Thompson for spearheading this  effort in the House of Representatives. I would also like to thank the  Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation for their leadership and desire to  cooperatively manage ``Molok Luyuk'' to ensure that all Californians  and Americans have the opportunity to benefit from these sacred lands.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the Berryessa  Snow Mountain National Monument Expansion Act as quickly as possible.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Berryessa Snow  Mountain National Monument Expansion Act.
