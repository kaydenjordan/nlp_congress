 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my enormous dismay  with the situation at our southern border.   I went to the border three times this spring and have seen firsthand  the escalating human and national security crisis, but what I have seen  from my colleagues going to the border this weekend is beyond any  words.   Our government is becoming an accomplice to human and drug  trafficking for Mexican cartels and is completely disregarding its duty  to protect the American people.   I am an immigrant myself and value the contributions of immigrants to  our country over the years, but what is happening at the border is an  invasion of our country and complete lawlessness.   We are not an anarchy. We are a country with the rule of law. It is  our duty as Congress to help the State of Texas protect our Republic.  It is becoming even more urgent in light of the Afghanistan debacle and  increased risk for terrorism.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question so  we can consider the Border Security for America Act.
