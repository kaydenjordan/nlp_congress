 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I have just been informed that the  alleged shooter at the Republican baseball practice this morning is  someone who apparently volunteered on my Presidential campaign. I am  sickened by this despicable act.   Let me be as clear as I can be. Violence of any kind is unacceptable  in our society, and I condemn this action in the strongest possible  terms. Real change can only come about through nonviolent action, and  anything else runs counter to our most deeply held American values.   I know I speak for the entire country in saying that my hopes and  prayers are that Representative Scalise, congressional staff, and the  Capitol police officers who were wounded make a quick and full  recovery. I also want to thank the Capitol Police for their heroic  actions to prevent further harm.   Thank you, Madam President.
