 Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of H.Con.Res 3 and  urge my colleagues to vote in favor of its passage.   In June of last year, following the decision by the Supreme Court to  overturn Roe v. Wade, a pro-life pregnancy center that assists pregnant  women in Nashville, Tennessee, was the victim of an attempted arson  attack. Thankfully, no one was injured, and local law enforcement  opened an investigation into the situation in an effort to bring the  perpetrators to justice.   Unfortunately, that is not the case across the entire United States,  which is why it is essential that this body, the United States House of  Representatives, condemns these heinous acts of political violence.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation and will  always and forever stand on the right side of history when it comes to  protecting the unborn.
