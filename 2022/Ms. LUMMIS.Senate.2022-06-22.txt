 Mr. President, in reserving the right to object, the PUMP  Act is noble in nature, but it is an economy-sized approach without  flexibilities for some nonstationary workplaces.   This legislation would require that all modes of transportation that  have employees, including railcars, be retrofitted with private, non- bathroom enclosures to allow for breastfeeding. It would also require  employees reasonable break time for an employee to express breast milk.   To be clear, I recognize the need for breastfeeding women to do just  that. However, many women in this industry are quite literally keeping  the trains running on time. Entire supply chains could be disrupted  because of an overly broad and burdensome regulation that is not  crafted to fit this industry. I can't believe I am the only one who  sees the pitfalls in this. Regulations like this risk inadvertently  doing more harm to working women than helping them.   I understand what it is like to juggle the need to feed your child  while also working to provide for them. My daughter is working while  raising two little boys.   This whole thing just makes no sense. That is why I am working on an  amendment that would recognize the unique situation that working moms  in the transportation sector face. It is my hope we can work with the  bill's sponsors to solve this small issue. Until that time, we don't  need to exacerbate our supply chain crisis by implementing regulations  that do not actually protect or aid women in this industry.   For that reason, I object.
