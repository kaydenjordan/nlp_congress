 Mr. Speaker, most Americans watching these proceedings  right now are watching them on C-SPAN.   C-SPAN is a public service funded by the cable industry which  receives no taxpayer dollars. Every year C-SPAN holds a documentary  contest for middle and high school students called StudentCam. This  year students addressed the theme: What does it mean to be an American?   Today I am proud to announce that some of my young constituents,  Caitlin Lanterman and Madison Collins from Mountain View High School,  were chosen as winners. The winning videos can be viewed at  studentcam.org.   On behalf of the people of Idaho, congratulations on winning this  prize out of nearly 3,000 entries.                            ____________________
