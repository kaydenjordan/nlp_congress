 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to object to the  administration's recent executive order suspending the U.S. Refugee  Admissions Program and visas from certain countries in the Middle East  and east Africa. Protecting our national security, of course, must  always be our number one priority.   This executive order, however, Mr. Speaker, does not focus on the  precise challenges that we face. We can keep our homeland safe by  immediately implementing more thorough screening procedures rather than  pursuing this broad brush approach.   Although this measure is temporary and some individuals will continue  to be admitted on a case-by-case basis, Congress needs to work to  ensure that this order does not apply to U.S. residents, does not apply  to those who have already been issued a visa, or does not apply to  those who have already been granted refugee status.   I urge the administration to work with Congress and Federal agencies  to find a measured plan that protects our national security, honors our  existing commitments, and follows the letter and spirit of the law.                            ____________________
