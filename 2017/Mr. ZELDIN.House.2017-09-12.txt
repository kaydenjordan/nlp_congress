 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division C (before the short title) insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used by the National Marine Fisheries Service to enforce       Executive Order 13449 or section 697.7(b) of title 50, Code       of Federal Regulations, in the Block Island Transit Zone (as       that term is defined in section 697.7(b)(3) of such title).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Zeldin) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R.  3354 on behalf of the hardworking fishermen of Long Island and our  entire region who are suffering more than ever under confusing and  unfair regulations that are threatening to put them out of business.   This amendment is nearly identical to one I offered to the DHS  division of this bill that unanimously passed by voice vote last week  that related to the Coast Guard.   Today's amendment would bar the National Marine Fisheries Service  from enforcing the ban on striped bass fishing in the Block Island  Sound Transit Zone, a 15-mile stretch of water between Montauk Point,  New York, and Block Island, Rhode Island.   No other species of fish are subject to an arbitrary ban in this  section of Block Island Sound, famous for fishing and recreational  boating.   The fact that the transit zone is considered a part of the EEZ means  the ban on striped bass fishing extends into this local waterway. This  means hardworking commercial fishermen, charter boat captains, and  recreational anglers enjoying a day on the water with their family can  suddenly go from fishing for striped bass legally to committing a  Federal crime because they are drifted over the 3-mile line.   This ban was meant for the high seas, not a local waterway,  arbitrarily declared to be part of the EEZ due to a boundary drawn on a  map by a bureaucrat in Washington, D.C.  [[Page H7266]]    Every other species of fish popular in this area--scup; eel; squid;  bluefish; even striped bass' cousin, black sea bass--are not subject to  an unfair ban in this area. Just like they can legally with proper  permits and allocations in adjacent State waters, local fishermen  should be able to legally fish for striped bass in this area after  State waters end and the transit zone begins.   Mr. Chairman, on the East End of Long Island, the coastal economy is  our economy. So when unfair regulations impact fishermen, it also hurts  the other local businesses like tackle shops, restaurants, gas  stations, and hotels.   No one is more invested in protecting this important fishery to  ensure it is there for the next season and the next generation than the  hardworking men and women from my district who rely on fishing as a way  of life.   This amendment does not create open season on stripers or lift the  need for quota allocations or permits. In addition to a nearly  identical amendment passing on a voice vote last week, last Congress,  my standalone bill to address this issue, H.R. 3070, the EEZ  Clarification Act, passed the House with another unanimous voice vote.   This amendment is supported by the Recreational Fishing Alliance, the  Long Island Commercial Fishing Association, and the Montauk Boatmen and  Captains Association.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Culberson).    Mr. Chair, I wish to speak in favor of the amendment. How  much time is remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 1\1/2\ minutes remaining.    Mr. Chairman, my colleague on the other side speaking in  opposition actually made a great argument for exactly why the amendment  needs to be passed.    I completely agree, we should not be micromanaging the local fishery.  And the best way to ensure that we are not micromanaging the local  fishery is to pass this amendment.   The amendment is empowering the local regional council to be able to  manage the striped bass fishery. If we don't pass the amendment, then  we are micromanaging and we are taking away power from the local  council managing the fishery.   So by passing this amendment, we are encouraging that regional  council to manage the striped bass fishery in that area. Without  passing the amendment, then we are micromanaging and we are not  allowing any striped bass fishing at all.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the hardworking fishermen of Long Island's  East End, our entire region, and our entire country are struggling. The  special interest groups, knowing nothing about the East End, may  incorrectly disagree. Fish do not adhere to arbitrary man-made  boundaries drawn by bureaucrats.   This amendment, by no means, removes the management of this species,  including the quotas or allocations meant to protect against  overfishing. Now, more than ever, we should be taking commonsense steps  to help our fishermen get back to work. This simply allows for local  fishermen to not be treated like criminals when they drift across an  arbitrary 3-mile line.   Mr. Chair, I encourage support from my colleagues for this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin).   The amendment was agreed to.   The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands amendment No. 116 will not be  offered.                   Amendment No. 117 Offered by Ms. Norton    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 117  printed in House Report 115-297.
