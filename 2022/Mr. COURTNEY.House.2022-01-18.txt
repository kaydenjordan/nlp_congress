 Madam Speaker, just a few days before Christmas, on  December 21, President Joe Biden issued a Presidential determination  with little fanfare under the Defense Production Act of 1950.   The Defense Production Act of 1950 is a Korean war-era law that  allows the government to accelerate production of critical materials  and technology. It is the same law that Presidents Trump and Biden used  to stimulate production of COVID-related ventilators and PPE during the  pandemic.   In his memorandum to the Secretary of Defense, Biden noted that:  ``Ensuring a robust, resilient, and competitive domestic defense  industrial base that has the . . . workforce to meet the Virginia-class  submarine undersea warfighting mission is essential to our national  security.''   To accomplish that mission, the President invoked DPA authorities to  expand the domestic production capability for ``large-scale  fabrication, shipbuilding industrial base expansion for resilience and  robustness, and maritime workforce training pipelines.''   As chair of the House Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee,  which oversees the Virginia-class program, I strongly support the  President's decision because it is based on both strategic national  defense considerations and industrial base demand.   Indeed, just a few days after Christmas, the President signed into  law the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act, which contained  provisions my subcommittee authored that are completely aligned with  the President's DPA order.   Specifically, the new 2022 NDAA added funding for new facility  construction for submarine production, as well as a boost for workforce  training and supply chain development. All of these provisions were  plus-ups from the Navy's initial budget request last February and based  on our own analysis of strained shipyard capacity.   The more consequential issue contained in the DPA, I believe, is its  finding that the Virginia program ``is essential to our national  security.'' That finding is a blaring signal to the Congress and the  entire country that we need to bolster our undersea deterrent  capability to counter aggressive, coercive actions in the maritime  domain--specifically, the behavior of both the Chinese and Russian  navies that has been overwhelmingly repudiated by the United Nations  Law of the Sea Convention, the former in the South China Sea in 2016  and the latter in the Black Sea in 2019.   In both cases, despite the International Court's scathing rejection  of both countries' intrusions on protected waters, there is no sign  that lawlessness has abated. China's encroachment on territorial waters  in the Philippines and Vietnam continues, as does its illegal island  building and militarization of artificial landmasses that the court  condemned. In the Black Sea and the North Atlantic, Russian claims to  sea control and its seizure of Ukrainian naval ships are blatantly in  violation of the international rule of law.   Madam Speaker, today, China has the world's largest navy, and Putin  is aggressively increasing the size of his submarine fleet.   For the U.S. Navy, what is particularly concerning is the development  of sophisticated missile technology by both countries that increases  the vulnerability of our surface fleet that has been working in  conjunction with allies like France, Japan, and Australia to reassert  post-World War II principles of freedom of navigation visibly and  peacefully. The joint sea patrols in the international waters of the  Indo-Pacific and Black Sea are a reassertion of principles that, since  the end of World War II, have successfully reduced the risk of conflict  while enhancing trade and prosperity.   To counter ongoing threats to rule of law, the Biden administration  has been diplomatically reconnecting, all throughout 2021, with U.S.  allies in both regions, as well as reevaluating the highest and best  use of limited defense spending. The DPA issued on December 21 is a  logical extension of that process. Given the new challenge posed  [[Page H200]]  by missile technology to our surface ships, stepping up production of  the Virginia-class program makes perfect sense since those submarines  are not at risk from even the most sophisticated airborne missiles, and  the Chinese and Russian navies know that.   Madam Speaker, in addition, last September, the new AUKUS security  alliance between the U.S., Australia, and the U.K., whose centerpiece  is the sharing of nuclear propulsion technology for a new class of  Australian submarines, is another powerful, tangible statement about  the importance of strengthening our joint allied undersea capability.   As David Ignatius, a longtime observer of U.S. foreign policy,  recently wrote in The Washington Post: ``The AUKUS alliance with  Australia and Britain to build nuclear submarines and share other  military technology might be the most important strategic move'' by the  U.S. ``in decades.''    The Biden DPA order last month and the AUKUS agreement last September  are a powerful, tangible signal by the U.S. to our allies and friends  who support a collaborative action to uphold international rule of law,  which is critical to maintaining a peaceful coexistence among the  world's nations.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the bipartisan  Impact Aid Flexibility Act, S. 2959, which is a companion bill to H.  6126, which I introduced on December 2, 2021. I thank Chairman Scott  and Ranking Member Foxx, and her representative this evening, Mr.  Owens, of the Education and Labor Committee, and the committee staff  for accelerating consideration of this important measure which provides  Federal support to 11 million K-12 schoolchildren across America, and  whose passage is very time sensitive, which I will explain in a minute.   Mr. Speaker, Federal Impact Aid is our Nation's oldest K-12 Federal  education program. Impact Aid has its origins in 1821 when Congress  first authorized support for schools to educate military dependent  children.   In 1934, Congress passed the Johnson-O'Malley Act, which extended  help to school districts located at federally recognized Tribal lands.  Congress recognized that, like military school districts, kids residing  on Native American Tribal lands, which were not subject to State or  local taxation to fund schools, deserved assistance.  [[Page H204]]    In 1950, President Harry Truman signed into law the statutory  framework for Impact Aid which still stands today. Impact Aid is an  important statement to communities that host children who reside in and  are connected to Federal property and facilities, namely, that the  Nation will not force them to bear an unfair disproportionate cost to  public education.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to represent a district with two of those  host communities, Groton and Ledyard, Connecticut. Groton is the home  to our Nation's oldest Navy submarine base with approximately 9,000  sailors and officers who work every day to protect our Nation. Ledyard  is the town next door where many personnel live. Groton has over 1,000  Navy kids, and Ledyard has 850. Ledyard is also the site of the  Mashantucket Tribal Nation, many of whose children attend Ledyard  schools. Impact Aid is critical to these towns' school budgets.   The bill before us addresses an urgent logistical problem with Impact  Aid, that, unless we act, will harm military and Tribal districts all  across the country, namely, the obstacle created by COVID, to get an  accurate headcount of eligible students that must be filed with the  U.S. Department of Education by January 31, 12 days from now. And that,  again, is the time-sensitive urgency this evening. Military and Tribal  districts across the country have reported that COVID restrictions have  slowed down the paperwork process, and this hindrance will result in an  undercount, and thus, an artificially low Federal reimbursement.   The Impact Aid Flexibility Act will solve this problem in an elegant  way by simply carrying over last year's student census, thus ensuring  no Impact Aid district will be harmed financially. This is a 1-year  fix, the same as the fix the last Congress passed in December 2020, the  Impact Aid Coronavirus Relief Act, which I sponsored with my Republican  colleague, Dusty Johnson of South Dakota.   Mr. Speaker, this vote is being watched nervously by school officials  and military staff all across the Nation, such as Groton school  superintendent, Susan Austin, Ledyard superintendent, Jason Hartling,  and Miranda Chapman, the Navy School liaison officer at the Groton  SUBASE, New London, who have worked with the National Association of  Federally Impacted Schools, and I salute them and all their colleagues  across the country for their work raising this issue before Congress.   The bill before us has already passed the U.S. Senate unanimously and  has the support of the Biden administration. It is a bill that keeps  the promise to host communities that a high-quality education will not  be denied because of military service or Tribal recognition.   I urge the House to pass this bill tonight with an overwhelming vote  of confidence and thanks for those who wear the uniform of this country  and our Tribal nations and their families.
