 Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the  Record some of the finalist essays written by Vermont high school  students as part of the seventh annual State of the Union essay contest  conducted by my office.   The material follows:      ZOE HOULIHAN, NORTH COUNTRY UNION HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMAN (FINALIST)         When you think of America, do you think of McDonald's, big       cities, high-tech phones and computers, or do you think about       violence, fear, and hatred amongst people? Although America       seems like a great place full of opportunities and freedom,       it is quite the opposite if you are not a white, straight,       cisgendered male. There are many problems in America that       need to be fixed.        Racism has been ongoing for hundreds of years. Blacks,       Hispanics and many other  [[Page S538]]       non-white groups have faced discrimination and hatred because       of the color of their skin. Blacks are thought as more       violent and lazy than whites. African Americans now       constitute 1 million of the 2.3 million imprisoned       population. They are also incarcerated at six times the rate       of whites. NAACP says that 5 times as many whites are using       drugs as Blacks, but they are being sent to prison at 10       times the rate of whites. Moreover, Blacks are getting shot       at higher rate than whites. Although more whites are getting       shot, there are about 160 million more white people than       there are black people. While Whites make up 49% of those       fatally shot by police officers, Blacks make up 24%, despite       only being 13% of the US population. More than 250 blacks       were killed in 2016. Furthermore, 47% of hate crimes have to       do with race. Racism is such a big problem in America it's       hard to say what an effective solution would be. One solution       to this could be to get media stars that are POC to talk       about racism. This could cause their fan base (which can be       quite large) to change their ideas about African Americans.       Another solution is to educate people on racism. Teaching       young children in school about how racism started could       lessen the number of people in each generation that feel       negatively about people of color. Lastly, the government       should make the policies about racism in schools and       workplaces stricter. Telling kids ``That is not appropriate''       when they make a racist comment isn't doing anything. People       need to be punished for making these comments because if they       aren't it makes it seem like it isn't a big deal.        Another problem in America is sexism and sexual assault.       Sexism makes it harder for women to get jobs and be well-off       in life. According to the Huffington Post, well-off white men       are three times more likely than women to be offered a job       interview. Moreover, women that work 41-44 hours per week       earn 84.6% of what a man working that same time would earn.       Women that work more than 60 hours a week earn only 78.3% of       what a man would earn. Similarly, in the House of       Representatives only 19.3% are women, and in the Senate only       20% are women. In addition, when a woman claims to have been       sexually assaulted, men usually blame the women. They ask       what they were wearing, how ``revealing'' it was, and if they       were under the influence of drugs or alcohol. One in four       women will be sexually assaulted in their lifetime. Also,       683,000 adult women are forcibly raped each year. This is       equal to 56,916 per month, 1,871 per day and 78 per hour. One       solution to women not getting payed as much as men could be       to make a policy that both women and men are to be paid       equally. Furthermore, a solution to sexual assault is to       teach kids about consent and to give longer sentences to       people that have committed sexual assault. Another solution       to sexism is to have more women representation in media and       politics. This could help eliminate the thought that women       are only made to have children, clean and cook. It would also       give young girls more role models to look up to.        Finally, the last issue that needs to be fixed is hate and       discrimination against the LGBT+ community. According to an       analysis of data collected by the FBI, lesbian, gay,       bisexual, and transgender people are the most likely targets       of hate crimes. An example of a hate crime against the LGBT+       community is the Orlando nightclub shooting. 49 were killed       and at least 53 were injured. This shooting is considered the       worst mass shooting in the United States and the nation's       worst terrorist attack since 9/11. Additionally, LGBT+ people       experience discrimination in the workforce. They actually       have a higher unemployment rate than African Americans (15%       versus 12%). People of color that are also apart of the LGBT+       community face the most discrimination. A solution to this       problem could be to educate young children about the       different sexualities and explain that it's okay to feel       attracted to whomever. Another solution is to create policies       that would help protect people in the LGBT+ community.       Lastly, there should be stricter rules about when a teacher       hears a homophobic comment. Many kids say ``That's so gay''       when something that they don't like happens and i could make       other kids feel unsafe.        In conclusion, America has many issues with equal rights       that need to be fixed. One of the main solutions to every       problem is education. When people are educated, they can use       their knowledge to base their opinions off instead of going       with what the popular opinion is or what they are hearing       around them.           GRAHAM JANSON, MONTPELIER HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR (FINALIST)         Whenever you ask someone the question, ``What is the most       pressing issue facing our nation today?'' you will most       likely get a different answer every time. An environmentalist       might say, ``Carbon emissions and global warming.'' A       conservative activist might say, ``The increasing national       debt.'' There are many answers to this question. But there is       only one answer that addresses an issue that lies at the       center of our nation's existence. That answer is that the       fundamental democratic principles on which the United States       is based are being eroded by voter suppression and       gerrymandering.        Efforts to suppress voting rights for many people have been       around since the Constitution was adopted as the supreme law       of the land, when only property-owning white men could vote.       We have come a long way since then, with African Americans,       Native Americans, and American women gaining the right to       vote, but we still have a long way to go. Similar to during       Reconstruction, when literacy tests were used to deny African       Americans the right to vote, a now-overturned North Carolina       voter ID law was in effect that, according to the federal       appeals court that dealt with the case, deliberately       ``target[ed] African-Americans'' in an attempt to suppress       their voter turnout. Other states, such as Ohio, Kansas, and       North Carolina, have had voter ID laws that have been       overturned after being ruled discriminatory by a federal       appeals court. The overturning of these laws is already a       step in the right direction. A way to address voter-      suppression efforts is to require a federal court review for       every voter ID law to make sure that there is no       discrimination or infringement of American rights. Another       way is to restore the provisions of the Voting Rights Act of       1965.        Additionally, the repeal of some of the key aspects of the       Voting Rights Act in 2013, which allowed nine states to alter       their election laws without the approval of the federal       government, demonstrates how gerrymandered elections can       serve to undermine basic democratic principles.       Gerrymandering involves altering the areas of electoral       districts to favor one party or another, and both Democratic       and Republican politicians have engaged in gerrymandering in       the past. There have been many cases in which a political       candidate has won an election because of gerrymandering. This       clearly undermines our nation's democratic principles because       now a candidate can carry the minority of an electorate and       win an election, and it needs to change now. Furthermore,       because these same elected officials appoint and confirm       federal judges, voter suppression and gerrymandering can also       undermine the judiciary's vital role in protecting democratic       voting rights.        In conclusion, the restoration of equal voting rights and       the elimination of gerrymandering would allow the United       States to remain a true democracy. Indeed, the other pressing       issues that face our nation today, such as global warming,       economic development, immigration, healthcare, and       gender equity, cannot be fairly addressed while our nation       continues to utilize this flawed system that does not       reflect democratic values.      IRA RICHARDSON, BELLOWS FALLS UNION HIGH SCHOOL SENIOR (FINALIST)         When George Washington delivered his farewell address, he       stated that ``The alternate domination of one faction over       another, sharpened by the spirit of revenge, natural to party       dissension . . . is itself a frightful despotism.'' Our first       and only president who was not a member of a political party       attempted to warn us of the threats they can pose to       democracy. Today, however, the Democratic and Republican       parties have become so powerful that one can hardly imagine       the American democratic system without them. In a sense, this       is one of the sources of their overbearing power: many       Americans see them as an intrinsic part of our democracy       rather than two organizations that were created long after       the union to organize like-minded voters. Political parties       are not inherently bad, but a system which creates a forced       dichotomy by only giving voters two realistic choices for any       given position has unquestionable negative effects on our       nation. Firstly, it forces citizens who care deeply about       specific issues to routinely vote for candidates whom they       may not agree with in any other capacity so as to not violate       their personal moral code. This, in turn, allows parties to       cynically align themselves with these single-issue voters to       win their votes without truly sharing their values.       Additionally, two diametrically opposed political parties       give rise to an us-versus-them mentality among citizens,       eroding the mutual trust that is intrinsic in the formation       of a nation.        To reduce the near-hegemonic power that the parties       currently hold, it is imperative to make it more clear to the       American public that both parties are private organizations,       operating within their own processes and promoting goals that       are not necessarily those of their constituents. The       intention is not to cause Americans to stop supporting the       party they belong to, but rather not to follow any party       blindly, and to understand their complex histories and role       in American democracy. Another step towards a system in which       people could more consistently vote for politicians they       truly support would be the implementation of an instant run-      off (aka alternate or ranked) voting system. In such a       system, a voter does not select a single candidate to receive       a position, but rather ranks the order in which they support       each candidate. If no candidate has over fifty percent of the       vote, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated and       every citizen who selected them has their votes moved to       their next choice, and the votes are tallied again. This       process is repeated until a candidate has a majority. This       alternative would allow people to vote their conscience       without fear of handing the election to a candidate on the       opposite side of the political spectrum. It would not destroy       the existing political parties (which would be destabilizing)       but rather allow third-party and independent candidates to       speak for portions of the population who cannot identify with       either existing party. By reducing the power of the two major       parties, the environment necessary to address the many       problems facing America could be created.  [[Page S539]]             JULIA STERGAS, BELLOWS FREE ACADEMY FAIRFAX SENIOR (FINALIST)         Nearly 260 years ago our country endured a war over the       rights of our states and the rights of its peoples. From this       war came the first legislation to protect African Americans       living in the United States. One-hundred years later, our       country faced another revolution, resulting in new       legislation that enhanced the ability for African Americans       to participate in political and social life. Since then, many       Americans have believed that racial equality has been       achieved.        But here we are, fifty years later, struggling through yet       another conflict over the divide between black and white.       Tensions are high between African Americans and white       authority figures in the United States. Distrust and anxiety       separates black Americans from their government and onlooking       citizens. In 2014, Michael Brown was shot and killed by a       police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. That same year, a       barrage of negative media emerged from an originally peaceful       protest in Baltimore, Maryland, depicting unlawful rioters       who looted and set fire to business, injuring six police       officers. Now, we continue to watch video clips on nightly       news highlighting the struggle between black and white.       Through this our attention has been distracted from the true       cause of continued racial conflict: the lack of recent       successful intervention.        White authority figures are perpetually distrusted by the       black community, and groups such as Black Lives Matter still       believe inherent biases against African Americans are       abundant in society. We must rebuild this connection. To       achieve comprehensive change we must redirect our nation's       path. The first step toward action is awareness. This issue       must be introduced into schools, universities, and community       centers. If we can enlighten young adults they will share       their knowledge and work to obtain equality nationwide.        Educators would lead discussions on current and historic       racial tensions in a non-partisan, open environment. Focusing       on historic and current events and their social and political       ramifications, these open debates would promote civic       engagement and thoughtful problem solving. Prompts regarding       the government's involvement and the responsibilities it       should assume, the action we as the nation's youth should       assume, and opportunities to develop individual solutions       would be considered during discussion. Our young population       is critical to the future of our nation, so it is necessary       that we provide them with opportunities to immerse themselves       in their political and social world.        Today's generation and the ones to follow will be our       leaders and our visionaries. Incorporating awareness into       education programs would introduce these leaders to the       nuances of the world they will come to inspire, and allow       them to develop an understanding of their political efficacy.       Raising consciousness of this racial strain would encourage       young leaders to take charge of their futures, and ours, and       incite change. It is critical to the well being of our nation       that we cultivate a generation of educated young adults who       possess the skills to maneuver themselves in their political       and social world. Addressing our nation's imperfection and       coaching our youth will only be the start to a nationwide       revolution of change and acceptance.
