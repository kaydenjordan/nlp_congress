 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the 23  pueblos and Tribes in New Mexico. This week, New Mexicans observed our  first Indigenous People's Day, celebrating the lengthy history and  ongoing contributions of Native American communities in New Mexico.   New Mexico's past, present, and future is tied to the vibrancy of its  Native American sovereign governments. One of the most serious threats  facing these communities is the crisis of murdered and missing women.  The murder rate for Native American women is 10 times higher than the  national average, and we have trouble even counting these tragedies.  Due to outdated databases and insufficient coordination between law  enforcement agencies, we can't count the number of Native American  women who go missing each and every year.   This crisis demands a response. I am proud and honored to join my  colleagues--Congresswoman Norma Torres, Congressman Dan Newhouse, and  Congresswoman Deb Haaland--in cosponsoring H.R. 2733, Savanna's Act.   Savanna's Act improves Tribal access to Federal databases, creates  new guidelines for responding to these cases, and creates grant  programs for law enforcement agencies to improve their practices.
