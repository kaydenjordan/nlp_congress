 Mr. Chair, I can tell you  who is happy that the budget resolution will likely pass the House  today, Big Pharma. Pharmaceutical companies are once again escaping any  changes to a system which has repeatedly allowed them to prioritize  profits over people and drive increases in out-of-pocket healthcare  costs.   Companies like Mylan, Turing, and Valeant are jacking up lifesaving  drugs like EpiPen for anaphylactic shock; Daraprim for HIV and cancer  patients; and Nitropress for heart failure overnight without any  accountability.   While the American people increasingly can't afford their medicine,  pharmaceutical companies are the wealthiest they have been in years.   In fact, median healthcare and pharmaceutical executive pay is higher  than any other industry in the United States.   And even though taxpayers fund billions of dollars of basic medical  research used to develop groundbreaking drugs, pharmaceutical companies  often charge Americans many times what the rest of the world pays.   Mr. Chair, Americans can't afford to continue giving pharmaceutical  and health insurance executives a pay raise, and many on both sides of  the aisle agree.   Just this week, President-elect Donald Trump added his voice to that  effort saying: pharma was ``getting away  [[Page H494]]  with murder.'' I agree. They are literally getting away with murder.  Because if a mother can't afford her child's EpiPen, or a cancer  patient can't afford treatment, people die.   So I offered an amendment to this budget resolution seeking to lower  prescription drug costs, but Republicans refuse to even allow debate on  my amendment.   Instead of fighting to make sure Americans have access to lifesaving  medications, Republicans are protecting the ability of pharmaceutical  companies to continue to shake down the American people.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution and, instead, address  these healthcare costs and access issues that every American knows too  well.
