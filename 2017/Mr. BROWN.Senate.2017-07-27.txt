 Mr. President, I intend to offer the following motion to  H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record.   This motion would commit the bill to the Finance Committee with  instructions to eliminate all provisions that would increase healthcare  costs for the middle class and those struggling to get into the middle  class.   I am offering this motion because healthcare costs are already too  high for hard-working Ohioans, and this bill would make them even  higher. We ought to be working to bring down costs; yet as my colleague  Senator Heller said, there is nothing in this bill that would lower  premiums.   The first test of a bill should be, do no harm so I would hope all my  colleagues will join me in ensuring that any bill that comes out of  this body doesn't saddle working families with higher healthcare bills.   My motion is supported by the following Senators: Baldwin,  Blumenthal, Whitehouse, Hirono, Feinstein, Leahy, Van Hollen, Harris,  Franken, Carper, Udall, Coons, Menendez, Duckworth, Durbin, Reed,  Stabenow, Warren, Booker, Nelson, and Klobuchar.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Brown moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) eliminate provisions that will increase health costs       for the middle class and those struggling to get into the       middle class.     Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Foreign  Relations Committee and the ranking member, Senator Cardin.   Senator Crapo and I began working on this months and months ago. I  appreciate that partnership.   Senator McCain--I read an op-ed he wrote in USA Today about 3 weeks  ago. It was about what Putin tried to do with some level of success in  Montenegro, and nobody has watched Putin and his intervention in our  elections and European elections and their governments and his desire  to destabilize democracy around the world--nobody has recognized it  quite as early or with the acute sense that Senator McCain has, and we  thank him for that.   I rise to urge my colleagues to join me and vote for this critical  sanctions  [[Page S4388]]  legislation, which is the product of months of bipartisan effort in  this body.   At a time when it is difficult to get things done in this far-too  partisan Senate, this effort proves it is still possible for Congress  to come together and accomplish big things. The bill provides for a  range of tough new sanctions against Iran, Russia, and North Korea.   The Ukrainian community in my State knows firsthand the dangers of  decades of unchecked Russian aggression. Congress must act to punish  Russia for its continued actions in Ukraine, in East Ukraine, in  Crimea, and for its interference in our Presidential election and to  deter future such aggression.   This bill will prevent President Trump from relaxing sanctions on  Russia without congressional review. We are all concerned about that.   Iran is one of the world's leading state sponsors of terrorism and a  continuing source of instability throughout the region. This bill is  carefully written to avoid violating U.S. commitments under the Iran  nuclear agreement, and it applies new sanctions in response to Iran's  support for terrorism, its human rights abuses, and its ballistic  missile program.   It also incorporates sanctions on North Korea, including measures to  toughen enforcement of current U.N. Security Council rules. North  Korea's efforts to develop nuclear capabilities must be countered. We  must take a stand against its horrendous human rights record, including  the savage treatment of Otto Warmbier that led to his death.   These are important steps. More can be done to address the situation  in North Korea.   I thank my staff, Colin McGinnis, Mark Powden, and Graham Steele on  this. I appreciate the work of the staff in all four of these offices  on Banking and Foreign Relations, and I ask my colleagues to concur.    Mr. President, let's look at how all this started. Right  down this hall, a few months ago, Senator McConnell, a handful of  Republican Senators, the drug lobbyists, insurance company lobbyists,  and Wall Street lobbyists met in that office behind closed doors. Most  Republican Senators didn't know what was happening, no Democratic  Senators knew what was happening, and the American public didn't know  what was happening.   This bill--written by drug companies, insurance companies, and Wall  Street--was sent to the Senate floor, was discussed, and, alas, it was  big tax cuts for the drug companies and the insurance companies.   When you think about this, you have U.S. Senators who get taxpayer- subsidized insurance, Senators who get insurance provided by taxpayers  who are going to rip it away from potentially 700-, 800-, 900,000  Ohioans.   I stand with Governor Kasich. Governor Kasich said: You don't pass  legislation--you don't meet in the majority's leader's office down the  hall here, write legislation with drug company and insurance company  lobbyists, and then take Medicaid away, take insurance away, disrupt  the insurance markets. You just don't do things that way.   A professor of healthcare finance at Case Western in Cleveland wrote  yesterday that millions would lose coverage and that middle-income  Americans would be ``priced out of the market.''   If I could talk for a moment about what happens to individuals,  yesterday I was on the phone with Donna May from Gahanna, OH. She told  me:         My mother is 91 years old. She worked hard all her life.       I'm 73 years old and still work. Without Medicaid, or even       large cuts in Medicaid, I will not be able to care for my       Mom.    Donna and so many others pay into Social Security. They pay into  Medicare. They pay into unemployment insurance. And then this Congress  is going to cut their Medicaid. This Congress is going to take money  away from them when they need it, when they run out of money at the end  of their lives and they are in nursing homes. Is that what we stand for  as a country?   In Toledo, I talked to Kelly Peterson. Her dad is in a nursing home  and relies on Medicare. She told me:         My family would be devastated by these proposed cuts to       Medicaid. My dad worked in the auto industry and paid into       the system 30 years. Now when he needs it most, conservatives       in Congress want to take it all away.    Again, these people paid into Social Security. They paid into  Medicare. Now we are going to take their insurance away from them as  they grow older. A bunch of Members of Congress who have insurance  provided by taxpayers think it is morally OK to strip the insurance  from millions of people in our States.   Again, I side with Governor Kasich. I am a Democrat. He is a  Republican. He is as repulsed as I am that down this hall, Senator  McConnell and Republican leadership, with the drug and insurance  company lobbyists, wrote this bill.   I stand with Governor Kasich, who wants to do a simple thing: Stop  this outrageous attempt tonight. Sit down with Republicans and  Democrats in both parties. I could sit with Senator Portman. We could  come up with legislation to fix the Affordable Care Act; to encourage  more young, healthy people into the insurance pools; to stabilize the  insurance market; to go after the outrageous cost of prescription  drugs; maybe even to open up Medicare eligibility for people between 55  and 64. It is not complicated.   The special interests have taken over this Chamber. We should be  ashamed of ourselves. We ought to do this right. I ask my colleagues to  vote yes on the Murray motion to recommit.
