 Madam President, I rise today to recognize the  200th Anniversary of Clay Township, MI. Forming the southernmost  portion of St. Clair County, Clay Township is endowed with natural  beauty, fertile farmland, and a rich tradition of entrepreneurship  dating back to the fur trade between French explorers and the  indigenous people, also known as the Anishinaabe.   Long before Michigan was incorporated as a U.S. Territory and western  expansion encouraged migration to the area we know now as St. Clair  County, the region was home to the Anishinaabe peoples. Members of the  Odawa, Pattawami, and Ojibwe Tribes and more made their homes alongside  the Otisi-Keta, and Otisi-Keta-Sippi waters, now known respectively as  Lake St. Clair, and the St. Clair River. The nutrient-dense farmland,  abundant natural resources, and easy access to trade routes provided by  the many waterways endowed the Anishinaabe with a rich culture and  community that would eventually attract the notice of French explorers  arriving in the area. In fact, it was these early French explorers who  would christen the Otisi-Keta as ``Lac-Sainte-Claire'' after  discovering the crystal-clear waters on the day of the Festival of  Sainte Claire. In time, the lake, tributary, and surrounding land  became known as St. Clair, the modern appellation we see today.  Although French explorers began to depart from the territory following  the Seven Years War, the legacy of trade and industry established with  the Anishinaabe laid the foundation for the development of Clay  Township as a hub of local commerce.   Among the first settlers of Clay Township were Angus MacDonald and  John Martin, who founded the city of Pointe du Chene--now known as  Algonac--in 1805. MacDonald and Martin chose to settle the city at the  head of the St. Clair flats, which had been the previous site of trade  between the Anishinaabe and the French. Algonac quickly developed into  the principal settlement in the area and is now recognized as one of  the oldest cities in Michigan. Clay Township would be officially  organized 17 years later in 1822. With this recognition, Clay Township  became one of the four original townships that comprised the entirety  of St. Clair County.   Today, Clay Township is comprised of 82.3 square miles of land and  water. Bounded on three sides by water and divided into several islands  by branches of the St. Clair River, it is known as a center for local  water recreation and is home to over 9,000 residents. The freshwater  delta formed by the St. Clair River and waters of Harsens Island is the  only major river delta in the Great Lakes Basin and the largest  freshwater delta in North America. Michigan's Department of Natural  Resources manages two sites on Harsens Island, supporting pedestrians,  cyclists, and other outdoor enthusiasts wanting to admire the wildlife  and waters of the region. The Algonac State Park is comprised of 1,550  acres and provides sanctuary to rare habitats and 22 threatened,  endangered, or special-concern species of plants, birds, and  butterflies. With its rich history and lush natural resources, Clay  Township is recognized as one of the best places to live in the State  of Michigan.   Clay Township has been an integral part of the State of Michigan and  our great Nation for over 200 years. As a Michigander and passionate  advocate for all of Michigan's waters, I am honored to ask my  colleagues to join me in celebrating this significant milestone for the  township, as well as its residents, elected officials, and businesses.  I wish Clay Township continued growth and prosperity in the years  ahead.                            ____________________
