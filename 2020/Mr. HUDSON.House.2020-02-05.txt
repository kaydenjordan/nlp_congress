 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy of  Representative Walter B. Jones, Jr., a fierce champion for North  Carolina, a diligent public servant, and a personal friend to many  across this body.   Representative Jones passed away on February 10, 2019, his 76th  birthday. He worked tirelessly on behalf of our great state and served  four years in the North Carolina National Guard, ten years in the North  Carolina General Assembly, and was a member of the House of  Representatives for over three decades.   A man of profound integrity, Representative Jones fought each and  every day for what he believed was right. From championing our men and  women in uniform to protecting our coastline, he was always a steadfast  voice for the people of eastern North Carolina.   Today I am proud to join the North Carolina Congressional Delegation  in supporting H.R. 5037, to designate a facility of the United States  Postal Service as the ``Walter B. Jones, Jr. Post Office,'' located in  his hometown of Farmville, North Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, please join me today in honoring the life and legacy of  Representative Walter B. Jones, Jr.
