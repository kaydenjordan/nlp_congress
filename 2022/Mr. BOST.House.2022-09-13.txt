 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7939, as amended, the Student  Veteran Emergency Relief Act of 2022.   This is a bipartisan bill led by Chairman Levin and Ranking Member  Moore of the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity. The base text would  provide emergency protection for maintaining current GI bill payments  for student veterans if a pandemic like COVID-19 hits our country  again.   I am supportive of the entire package, but I am especially pleased  that five Republican proposals have been included. This bill includes  Congressman Joyce's language that would extend full post-9/11 GI bill  benefits to the servicemembers who have been discharged under DOD's  sole survivor rules.   A sole survivor discharge is designed to protect the members of a  family if they have already lost family members to military service.   This issue directly impacts Congressman Joyce's constituents, the  Weninger family, whose son, Sergeant Weninger, tragically passed away  in 2020. I am happy to honor Sergeant Weninger for his service to the  United States and provide this benefit to his brother.   I thank his family, Congressman Joyce, and the Tragedy Assistance  Program for Survivors for bringing this important issue to our  attention.   Now, this package also includes text from Congressman Moore's bill  that would improve the way that schools are approved for the GI bill to  help prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.   Recently, there has been a rise in schools abusing this benefit. GI  bill fraud both takes away a veteran's benefit and wastes taxpayer  dollars. This bill would make it much harder for a bad school to be  approved for GI bill benefits and well before they could harm veterans.   I thank the Student Veterans of America, the VFW, and Veterans  Education Success for assisting us in writing this provision.   I also thank the Office of Inspector General and Inspector General  Missal for their hard work in protecting veterans by helping us draft  this text.   H.R. 7939, as amended, also includes a GOP proposal that would help  improve access to study-abroad programs while using the GI bill.    I thank the Student Veterans of America and other higher education  groups for bringing this issue to our attention.   Another proposal in this bill would amend the Servicemembers Civil  Relief Act to make it easier for military spouses to transfer licenses  across the States.   This bipartisan proposal would allow spouses to transfer their State- based medical and professional license when they move due to their  spouse's military orders. This is an important change that would help  reduce unemployment among military spouses. I thank Congressman  Mike  Garcia for originally proposing this legislation, and I am pleased to  see it in the list of bills today.   The bill also includes the text for H.R. 4702, originally introduced  by Congressman Cawthorn, that would help clarify the State that a  military spouse can file taxes in when their family is deployed to  another State.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7846, the Veterans'  Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2022. I thank  Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Chair Luria  and Ranking Member Nehls for introducing this bill.   It would increase the rate of disability compensation and DIC  compensation for survivors to keep up with the steep rise in the cost  of living. This legislation is absolutely vital in the face of rampant  inflation, a potential recession, and a high cost of living under the  Biden administration.   We must ensure that our veterans are able to pay their bills and put  food on the table for their families. If we do not act, our veterans  and their families will bear the burden of the careless financial  actions of this administration.   Mr. Speaker, I am glad to offer my support today, and I hope my  colleagues will do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Cawthorn).    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7735, as amended, the  Improving Access to the VA Home Loan Benefit Act of 2022.   Every veteran deserves the chance to own a home and pursue the  American Dream. We know that with increased inflation and economic  uncertainty brought on by the failed economic policies of the Biden  administration, this dream is harder for veterans to achieve.   With interest rates on the rise, we should do whatever we can to make  the VA home loan benefit the best option for veteran home buyers and  sellers alike.   We have heard that the time it takes to complete a VA appraisal is a  barrier to veterans who want to use the VA home loan program.                                time  1615    My bill would address that issue by requiring VA to update the  regulations on how and when the appraisals must be completed.   While not eliminating traditional appraisals, my bill would make the  process for veterans to purchase a home more efficient by shortening  the appraisal timeline to match industry standards.   It would also require VA to consider when changes to the appraisal  process would save a veteran money during the closing process.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the mortgage bankers and the other  stakeholders for their work in crafting this bill to help make the VA  loan more competitive.   With their support, we have been able to create a solution that I  hope will help thousands of veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Takano for his assistance in moving  this bill forward, I urge all of my colleagues to support it, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5916, as amended, the Wounded  Warrior Access Act.   H.R. 5916, as amended, would require VA to establish a secure,  public-facing website that veterans can use to request a copy of their  VA records. This would make VA more accessible to veterans by  modernizing its systems. Specifically, the bill would make it easier  for veterans to review their records before they file a claim or  appeal.   Over the years, I have heard of increasing concerns from veterans  about organizations that attempt to swindle veterans out of their VA  benefits. This is unacceptable, and it is about time that we do  something about it.   This proposal also would require VA to warn veterans about greedy  claims practices when they log into the VA's website. I hope these  warnings will prevent veterans from being taken advantage of by these  bad actors.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 8260, the Faster Payment of  Veterans' Survivors Act.   This bill would improve VA's delivery of insurance benefits to  survivors. One of the provisions would streamline insurance payments to  beneficiaries under the NSLI and the USGLI programs.   Another section would make improvements to the VA's process for  identifying and paying the beneficiaries.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Pappas for introducing this bill and  for his commitment to help VA honor its obligation to surviving family  members.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
