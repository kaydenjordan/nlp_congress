 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Justice for  the Living Victims of Lockerbie Act. This bill would create a process  to seek justice for a group Pan American World Airways pilots who lost  their careers and pensions following the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103  over Lockerbie, Scotland, and the subsequent bankruptcy and closure of  Pan Am.   On December 21, 1988, the state of Libya committed an infamous act of  terror by bombing Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing  270 innocent civilians. Despite Pan Am's greatly improved financial  position in 1988, the media coverage of the terrorist attack wreaked  havoc on Pan Am sales leading to its bankruptcy in 1991.   In 2008, the United States entered into the U.S.-Libya Humanitarian  Settlement Agreement, in which Libya paid $1.5 billion to settle claims  by U.S. citizens for Libyan-sponsored terrorism. After payments by the  State Department to families of death victims from Lockerbie and the La  Belle Disco bombing in Germany, compensation to other victims was to be  determined by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. The Commission  could only consider further claims referred to it by the State  Department.   One of these claimants was a group of senior Pan Am pilots, most of  whom were veterans, who were over the age of 50 and lost their jobs,  pensions, healthcare, and eventually their savings when Pan Am went  bankrupt and closed. Due to the federally required retirement age of 60  at that time, and the airline industry's seniority system, they were  unable to get new pilot jobs with other airlines. Two of these pilots  reside in Maine--Ron Fitch of Poland Spring and Schafer Bean of Diamond  Cove--and I have heard their stories and their pleas for Justice on  behalf of their own families and the others who suffered as a result of  Libya's acts of terrorism.   This group's initial lawsuit against Libya, which had been joined  with the families of those who died at Lockerbie, was dismissed by the  courts due to sovereign immunity. Following the 2008 settlement  agreement with Libya, the group of pilots approached the State  Department in 2009 seeking the necessary referral to have their claims  heard by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. For more than 4  years the State Department failed to refer the group's claims to the  Commission, but following bipartisan letters to then-Secretaries  Clinton and Kerry signed by myself and more than 60 other Members of  Congress, the State Department finally referred the claims in 2013.   After an initial denial of claims in a preliminary ruling by the  Commission in July 2016, the group of pilots was granted a hearing in  December 2016. So many of the pilots and their families attended the  hearing that it was moved to a U.S. District Court courtroom in  Washington, DC. Three senior Pan Am executives testified at the  hearing, including the former Pan Am CEO, Thomas Plaskett; former Pan  Am senior vice president for finance, Ramesh Punwani; and former Pan Am  vice president of strategic planning, Peter Pappas. Each explained why  the Lockerbie bombing and the subsequent media coverage directly caused  the airline's collapse.   In January 2018, more than a year following that hearing, the  Commission ruled against the pilots. Using an undefined standard of  proof and applying international law, the Commission argued that Pan  Am's demise was not caused by the Lockerbie bombing, contrary to the  testimony of the former Pan Am executives themselves. The pilots'  referred claim was the very last of the Libyan claims adjudicated by  the Commission, and the Libya settlement fund is now exhausted from the  claims it approved prior to the final adjudication of the pilots'  claims.  [[Page S5522]]    These terrorism victims were denied an opportunity to even make their  case for 4 years by the Department of State, and when finally referred  to the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, they were forced to wait  another 3 years for a preliminary ruling and another 2 years for a  final decision, by which point the Commission had already awarded  claims that essentially exhausted the settlement funds provided by  Libya. That simply is not fair, and I believe these Mainers and other  Americans deserve a quick and fair process to compensate them for their  losses.   I urge my colleagues to join me in working toward justice for all of  the victims of the Lockerbie bombing perpetrated by Libya.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Justice for  the Living Victims of Lockerbie Act.
