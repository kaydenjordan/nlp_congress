 Madam President, I intend to offer the following  motions to H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that they be printed  in the Record. Both motions are supported by Senators Franken and  Udall.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Ms. Heitkamp moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which       the Senate is not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) ensure that all Native children with family incomes       that do not exceed 133 percent of the Federal poverty line       (as determined under section 1902(e)(14) of the Social       Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396a(e)(14))) continue to receive       the same level of Medicaid benefits and protections that they       are eligible for under current law, such as early and       periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services, and       cost-sharing protections.                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Ms. Heitkamp moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) eliminate provisions that would limit access to health       care for Native American youth, including members of Indian       tribes and Native Hawaiians, with respect to services related       to--        (A) mental and behavioral health care;        (B) trauma-informed and trauma-specific interventions; and        (C) suicide prevention.
