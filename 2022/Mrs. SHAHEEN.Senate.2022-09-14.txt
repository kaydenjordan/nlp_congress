 Madam President, I am very pleased to be on the floor  today with my colleague Senator Hirono to express our strong support  for the nomination of Dr. Geeta Rao Gupta to be Ambassador at Large for  Global Women's Issues at the Department of State.   The position that Dr. Gupta has been nominated for leads the Office  of Global Women's Issues, which is charged with advancing the rights  and empowerment of women and girls around the world through U.S.  foreign policy, so looking at our foreign policy through a gender lens  that recognizes that women are half of the world's population.   Not only does the Office of Global Women's Issues prioritize policies  and programs to advance the status of women around the world, it  ensures that U.S. policies incorporate a gender lens at all levels of  policy and decision making.   The last 2\1/2\ years of the COVID-19 pandemic have demonstrated why  this office is more important than ever before. Around the world over  those last  [[Page S4606]]  2\1/2\ years, the gender gap has grown as a result of the pandemic.  Girls are dropping out and staying out of school at a higher rate than  boys. The female labor force participation rate has declined, with  women not only holding less secure jobs but also taking on more unpaid  work at home with childcare and housing.   Gender-based violence has increased to such an extent that UN Women,  the U.N. body charged with advancing the rights of women globally, now  warns of what they call a ``shadow pandemic'' of violence.   These are issues of great consequence to half of the world's  population. They cannot be an afterthought. Gender equity, equality,  and the empowerment of women and girls must be a focal point of U.S.  foreign policy, and that is exactly what the Ambassador at Large is  intended to facilitate.    Unfortunately, this position has been unfilled for too long. Over the  past 5 years, beginning in the Trump administration, the position of  the Ambassador at Large for Global Women's Issues has been filled for  only 1 year, so 20 percent of the time over the last 5 years.   During that time, we have endured an unprecedented global pandemic.  We have ended a 20-year war in Afghanistan. We have watched as Vladimir  Putin launched an unprovoked attack on Ukraine. We have experienced a  supply chain crisis and suffered a global food shortage. And in every  single one of these crises, women have been more acutely affected than  men and affected in a different way than men.   During the pandemic, women, who make up almost 70 percent of the  healthcare workforce, have been those who have been on the frontlines  of providing care for the sick and vulnerable.   With the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan, women's rights have been  rolled back at an unprecedented rate, and we have seen--90 percent of  the households in Afghanistan have food insecurity, and women are  experiencing the greatest part of that.   Displacement from the war in Ukraine has left millions of women  vulnerable to human trafficking, even as Russia continues to shell  their homes and communities.   The food insecurity from the supply chain crisis and global food  shortage has reinforced our understanding of what we have seen for too  long: that in times of hunger, it is women who eat last and who eat the  least.   Through all of these crises, the Office of Global Women's Issues has  been without a leader to spearhead its work to ensure that women's  needs are incorporated in every aspect of the U.S. response to these  crises. Now, why does that matter? Well, not only do women make up 50  percent of the world's population, but what we know is that where women  are empowered, they contribute, give back more to their families. They  give back more to their communities. The countries that empower women  are more stable; they are more economically secure.   This is a policy that is important not only to our foreign policy  writ large but to our national security. That is why we need to fill  this position and why we urgently need to confirm Dr. Gupta.   Dr. Gupta has spent her career in service to gender equality and  women's empowerment. She knows better than most the impact that unfair  gender norms and inequalities have on women and the importance of  prioritizing women's leadership.   What is so unfortunate is that Dr. Gupta is being punished for her  personal views on women's reproductive choices. As the result of those  personal views, those groups who oppose women's reproductive choices  are spreading falsehoods instead of facts. They are doing that, and  unfortunately, too many of our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle have been willing to listen to those falsehoods without really  looking at the facts. This sets a very dangerous precedent for all  future nominees.   Let me be clear. The Office of Global Women's Issues does not lead on  sexual and reproductive health and rights, nor does it provide  information about abortion services.   When former President Trump nominated someone to lead the Office of  Global Women's Issues, I and my pro-choice colleagues in this body  didn't ask her what her position was on choice because we knew that was  not the mission of the Office of Global Women's Issues, and she was  confirmed. And I think by all accounts, people thought she did a good  job in the short time that she was there.   So why are my Republican colleagues spreading these falsehoods? They  have said that Dr. Gupta has advised the World Health Organization to  support abortion as a human right. They have alleged that Dr. Gupta  gave a speech saying that abortion should be an essential service. They  have alleged that the administration has plans to include abortion in  the mandate of the Office of Global Women's Issues. Let me be clear.  There is no truth behind those allegations.   If you missed it, let me say it again. There is no truth behind those  allegations.   We cannot let this idea that because somebody has a personal position  on an issue that affects them, that that means they cannot be  considered for a position within the government. You know, based on  that criteria, I wouldn't be able to be considered for any position.   So for the sake of Dr. Gupta's nomination today and for the sake of  all of those qualified women candidates who are going to come before  the Senate in the future, we can't let this divisive move become the  status quo. We have to correct the record. We need to approve Dr.  Gupta, and we need to get the Office of Global Women's Issues back  operating at full capacity.   With that, let me yield to my colleague from Hawaii, Senator Hirono.    Thank you, Senator Hirono, and thank you for your  eloquent remarks about Dr. Gupta's qualifications and the importance of  having someone who has those kinds of qualifications at the Office of  Global Women's Issues.   At this time, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII,  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee be discharged and the Senate  proceed to the following nomination: PN1578, Geeta Rao Gupta, to be  Ambassador at Large for Global Women's Issues; that the Senate vote on  the nomination with no intervening action or debate; that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that no further  motions be in order to the nomination; and that any related statements  be printed in the Record.    Madam President, I can buy that answer. Senator Hagerty  and I have worked together on the Foreign Relations Committee. I voted  for you to be an Ambassador. I thought you did a good job in that role,  and I think you are doing a good job now.   But the fact is that taking up floor time to deal with qualified  nominees at a time when we have limited floor time, when we have a  position that needs to be filled, when we have a minority position on  the Foreign Relations Committee in opposition to authorizing  permanently the Office of Global Women's Issues tells me it is  something more than that, and I think Dr. Gupta's stalled nomination is  emblematic of the intransigence on confirming President Biden's  nominees for the Department of State.   That obstructionism is undermining our diplomatic efforts. It is  demoralizing to employees at the Department of State who have dedicated  their lives to U.S. foreign policy, and I know you understand that  because you headed an Embassy. You know how critical our employees are  who manage our foreign policy.   Eric Rubin, a former Ambassador to Bulgaria, recently spelled out  what this means for U.S. diplomacy and national security, and this is  the concern that we all ought to have.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record this article from Puck News.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              [Sept. 6, 2022]                    Washington's New Crisis of Diplomacy                              (By Julia Ioffe)         As of this writing, it has been 593 days since an American       ambassador has inhabited the Villa Taverna, their official       residence in Rome. Ever since the financier and Republican       donor Lewis Eisenberg moved out at the end of Donald Trump's       administration on January 21, 2021, no one has replaced him.       President Joe Biden never nominated anyone, which raised       eyebrows both in American foreign policy circles and in       Italy. The Romans I've spoken to are furious and see it as a       sign of unprecedented disrespect, especially at a time when       Washington is asking its European allies--including countries       dependent on Russian gas, like Italy--to hold the line on       anti-Russian sanctions. ``It's the only G7 country with no       U.S. ambassador,'' one American diplomatic insider told me.       ``I know the Italians are unhappy and they should be, given       the situation politically and what's going on with Russia.''       Given that Russia is rumored to have had a hand in the       collapse of Mario Draghi's sanctions-friendly coalition       government this summer, the fact that Washington doesn't have       a representative on the ground is more than embarrassing.       It's downright negligent.        Currently, the United States is represented in Italy by       Shawn Crowley, who is the charge d'affaires. That's fine, but       a charge doesn't have the same rank and status as an       ambassador, and receiving countries have all kinds of       protocols and rules about who can meet with whom. Usually, a       charge has a much lower ceiling for whom they can meet than       an ambassador; the rank itself can be quite limiting. ``The       Italians,'' noted the diplomatic insider, ``are very protocol       conscious.'' As are the Ukrainians--so much so that, despite       all the aid the U.S. has poured into his country, President       Volodymyr Zelensky refused to meet with the American charge       d'affaires until a real American ambassador, Bridget Brink,       arrived in Kyiv this May.        Why has Biden left the post in Rome unfilled for so long?       It's been an open secret in Washington that the president is       holding the spot for Nancy Pelosi, the first Italian-American       Speaker of the House and a minor celebrity in Italy. The       idea, apparently, was to give her a nice, cushy retirement       gig after Republicans take over the House. But why not       nominate someone, like a career foreign service officer, to       serve in the post, and then shoo them out once Pelosi ripens       to the idea? All ambassadors, after all, serve at the       pleasure of the president. I asked spokespeople at both the       State Department and the White House about this, but they       wouldn't--and couldn't--explain to me, even off the record,       what the hell is going on there, not even after Fox News       published its own story about the Pelosi rumors on Tuesday.        Pelosi's people, meanwhile, offered a familiar line: Why       would Pelosi go get another job when she could just retire to       Napa, and play with her grandkids? ``Fox is just trying to       start shit,'' one source close to the speaker told me.       ``There are no conversations with the White House. And I've       just heard [Pelosi] say `S.F. is heaven on earth' one too       many times to believe that she would realistically want to       spend her post-Speaker life anywhere but home with family.''       Which is also the exact kind of thing you might say before       you take a job like that.        The Italian imbroglio is just the tip of the diplomatic       iceberg. Over a year and a half into Biden's administration,       more than 20 percent of American ambassadorships remain       unfilled. Nearly 40 of them have a nominee that is pending       confirmation, including for strategically vital posts, like       the Czech Republic, Latvia, and the Netherlands--all crucial       allies in holding the line against Russia on Ukraine. There       is no American ambassador in Saudi Arabia, a fraught but       important ally, and there hasn't been one since Biden's       inauguration. India, the world's largest democracy, hasn't       had an American ambassador since then either. The current       nominee, L.A. mayor Eric Garcetti, has been in confirmation       purgatory for more than a year, held up over allegations that       he knew about his chief of staff's alleged sexual predations.       In limbo, too, is the nomination for the ambassador to the       U.N.'s Conference on Disarmament. Apparently, the U.S. Senate       does not consider nuclear disarmament a pressing matter.        Fifteen more posts are completely vacant, with no nominee       anywhere in sight. The abandonment of some places, like Cuba       and  [[Page S4608]]       Afghanistan, make some sense. Other places, like Ethiopia, or       Estonia, which is a crucial NATO ally, do not. ``There is no       reasonable explanation for why more than 20 percent of our       ambassadorships overseas remain unfilled,'' said Eric Rubin,       president of the American Foreign Service Association, which       tracks such things. ``This is not a world in which we can       coast and assume that the rest of the world will wait for us       to sort out our parochial difficulties. No other country       leaves key diplomatic posts vacant so frequently and for so       long.''        The problem, though, is that there is an explanation. In       fact, there are several. It began with Trump gutting the       State Department and the career foreign service. The people       he had nominated to represent the United States were       comically unqualified if not outright problematic. Once Biden       came in, Washington expected him to right the ship. He had       been, after all, an old member of the Senate Foreign       Relations Committee and a vice president that had handled       some of the most complex foreign policy matters under       President Barack Obama. He boasted about his foreign policy       chops as well as the coterie of smart, experienced advisors       he was bringing in with him: the best and the brightest.        And yet, here we are, more than a year and a half later,       and one-fifth of the president's ambassadors remain       unconfirmed or even unnominated. The first problem for Biden       was the Presidential Personnel Office, which, in true       Democratic fashion, decided that if the previous       administration was going to nominate people with criminal       records or ongoing lawsuits for ambassadorships, they were       going to do things with extra diligence. Chief of staff Ron       Klain also decided he had to vet every single nominee, too,       slowing the process even further. Meanwhile, over in Foggy       Bottom, the State Department decided that its people also       had to be extra vetted by diplomatic security, because       everyone now had a digital footprint and social media       presence.        Then, last July, Texas Senator Ted Cruz took it upon       himself to wage a one-man campaign to kill the Nord Stream II       project by putting a blanket hold on all the Biden       administration's State Department nominees unless the White       House got the German government to kill its pipeline. Since       the Biden administration was not about to do so, this created       a massive backlog--and that was before Missouri's Josh Hawley       instituted his own blanket hold, in September 2021, on State       and Defense Department nominees unless Secretary of State       Antony Blinken, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, and National       Security Advisor Jake Sullivan resigned for, in his view,       bungling the withdrawal from Afghanistan.        Needless to say that never happened. By the time these       holds were lifted early this year, the backlog had grown       massive. And time on the floor of the Senate of the 117th       Congress, which will gavel out on January 3, 2023, had grown       ever more precious.        But before that, let's pause to talk about how       ambassadorial nominees get to the floor of the Senate for a       vote.        First, they have to be approved by the Senate Foreign       Relations Committee, which is currently headed by New       Jersey's Bob Menendez, a Democrat, and Idaho's Jim Risch, a       Republican. Both men are steeped in foreign affairs and       appear to all outside observers as serious thinkers about       world events. But according to people who have regular       dealings with the Foreign Relations Committee, they have a       relationship that is closer to something out of Mean Girls.       They are, as one source familiar with the committee described       them to me, ``like oil and water.'' They have been known to       be so laser-focused on messing with each other, in fact, that       they regularly inhibit the functioning of the Committee. Said       one Senate staffer familiar with the workings of the       Committee, ``It's an open secret that the challenges in their       working relationship often impedes us from working together       constructively on foreign policy and national security       issues.''        But there are other issues for ambassadorial nominees to       navigate inside the Committee, especially if they're female.       There is only one woman senator on the committee, New       Hampshire's Jeanne Shaheen, and so the women Biden has       nominated often run up against the proclivities of the old       men of the Senate, especially of the Republican persuasion.       ``There is certainly a layer of unconscious bias that is       holding back a number of women, that isn't there for the male       nominees,'' said the Senate staffer. This includes ``spouses       saying things about Trump'' or ``the way in which women talk       and represent themselves, where Republicans have been       viscerally opposed to just how the women communicate.''       According to two sources, Sarah Margon, who had run the       Washington office of Human Rights Watch and was nominated to       lead the State Department's Office of Democracy, Human       Rights, and Labor, ran into trouble when she met with Senator       Risch, who pressed her repeatedly on her position on the BDS       movement. She opposed it, she said repeatedly. Afterwards,       Risch told colleagues he didn't like Margon's tone. (A       committee spokesperson contended that, ``The issue was not       and has never been her `tone,' it was her answers to the       questions themselves.'' The spokesperson did not, however,       explain what was wrong with the answers.)        Other women have been pressed by Committee Republicans on       their stances on abortion, even if the position they are       nominated for has nothing to do with women's health, let       alone abortion. This happened, for example, with Dr. Geeta       Gupta, who was nominated to be the Ambassador to the Office       of Global Women's Issues. The post, and the office, deals       with women's security and economic empowerment, and has       nothing to do with women's health, let alone reproductive       rights. Yet Gupta was held up by Republicans on the Foreign       Relations Committee over her alleged support of abortion,       sending Shaheen into a righteous fury. ``Republican       grandstanding that held Geeta Gupta's nomination from       advancing in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in July       is a pivotal example of this gross display of partisan       politics,'' Shaheen said in an email. ``Republicans prevented       her nomination from proceeding to fill the urgently needed       role as Ambassador at Large for Global Women's Issues because       of their obsession over women's health and access to       abortion--neither of which are under the jurisdiction of this       role. Senate Republicans are putting our security in danger       and our credibility on the world stage at risk--it needs to       end now.''        The guiding assumption seems to be that if they are women       and Democrats, then they are automatically rabid abortionists       and will use whatever diplomatic role to advocate for it,       from Kyiv to Kinshasa. ``Women nominees tend to face more       rigor from Senate Republicans and are frequently questioned       about extraneous issues like their views on abortion,''       another Senate Democratic aide told me. ``Some of this       happens in public during hearings, but the majority of times       it takes place behind closed doors when there are no cameras       around to catch a senator and his staff go after women over       issues well beyond the scope of the position for which they       were nominated.''        Once upon a time, ambassadorial nominees could count on       cruising through the Senate on a vote of unanimous consent.       They would be advanced as a block of nominees and voted       through as a block, and people would only get singled out if       they had truly bungled their meetings with senators. The       feeling at the time was that the President of the United       States deserved to pick his ambassadors just as he deserved       to pick his cabinet secretaries and the Senate was there only       to weed out the truly rotten apples.        No more. If a nominee even makes it out of committee for a       floor vote, they are voted on individually, it takes several       hours, and any senator can use the opportunity of their       nomination to extract something from the administration.       Some, like Hawley, have asked for the resignation of cabinet       secretaries. Others have asked for small, stupid things like,       for example, a visa for a friend in exchange for waving a       nomination through. That is to be expected of Republicans who       will do whatever they can to impede Biden's agenda, but even       some Democrats have caught on to the game. They have also       learned that they can use any nomination to extract some       choice morsel from the administration, whether it's a pet       issue or something they can flaunt to constituents back       home.        As a result, every single State Department confirmation       hearing, ambassadorial or otherwise, now resembles a hostage       negotiation. ``This is not how the system is supposed to       work,'' said one insider the process. ``You're not supposed       to negotiate for individual unrelated reasons. But people       have started treating this as normal. I think nominations       will look like this forever from now on.''        Because of this, and because there are only four working       weeks left on the Senate calendar before the midterms,       Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has made it crystal clear to       his conference that ambassadorial nominees are now at the       very back of the line. Why spend hours on the ambassador to       Azerbaijan when you can ram through another lifetime judicial       appointment to balance out the work done by Mitch McConnell       when he had the majority? ``You only have a certain number of       hours a week,'' one Senate aide familiar with the process       told me. ``The more we're spending it on ambassadorial       nominations, the less we're spending it on judges.'' Added a       Senate Democratic staffer, ``It has been made clear that,       through the midterms, the floor will be tied up with judicial       nominees.''        After the midterms, whether the Democrats hold the Senate       or not, it will be a new, 118th Congress and that means all       the ambassadorial nominations now floundering in senatorial       purgatory will have to be resubmitted, and the process will       begin again, from scratch.        Both the White House and State, in their official       statements to me, emphasized the number of ambassadors they       were able to confirm, despite the unprecedented obstruction       they're facing in the Senate. Things are actually going       pretty well, they say, all things considered. But privately,       the tone is very different. People worry about recruiting and       retention. Who in their right mind would want to go through a       process like this? Others worry about the irreparable harm       this is doing to our relationships with allies and       adversaries abroad, especially after the calamity that was       the Trump presidency.        ``It's baffling to our foreign interlocutors because they       don't have these confirmation processes, and our inability to       field ambassadors when there are so many crises around the       world is unbelievable to them,'' one former State Department       official told me. ``It's also having a huge impact at State       on morale and retention. I think because there's so much       uncertainty over how long it takes to get confirmed, the       currency of an ambassadorship is being devalued. You have       people  [[Page S4609]]       waiting for a year or more to get confirmed. People have quit       jobs for these posts. Others are waiting inside State, stuck       in limbo forever. I heard of someone who considered retiring       while waiting to be confirmed.''        Eric Rubin, himself a former ambassador to Bulgaria and       deputy chief of mission in Russia, is worried about what       message this is sending to the two countries most eager to       weaken and replace America on the world stage: Russia and       China. ``The U.S. no longer has the largest diplomatic       service, China does,'' Rubin told me. ``The U.S. no longer       has the most embassies and consulates abroad, China does. We       have to stop tying one hand behind our backs in our efforts       to represent our country and advance its security and       prosperity.''        Or, in the words of the diplomatic insider, ``It's       malpractice.''     Ambassador Rubin put it very starkly. He said:         The U.S. no longer has the largest diplomatic service.       China does.    He concluded by saying:         We have to stop tying one hand behind our backs in our       efforts to represent our country and advance its security and       prosperity.        It's malpractice.    It is malpractice.   The fact that too many people in this Chamber are dragging their feet  on allowing Ambassadors to be confirmed, on allowing diplomats with the  Department of State to be confirmed, on allowing other high level  people throughout government to be confirmed because, only, of their  opposition to the Biden administration is just untenable, and it is  against our national security.   So I think it is time now for the Senate to do its job to confirm Dr.  Gupta. So let's move forward. Let's get our foreign policy with respect  to gender throughout the world back on track.   I yield the floor.
