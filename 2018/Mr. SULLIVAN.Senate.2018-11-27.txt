 Mr. President, today, on the occasion of his  retirement, I would like to honor Lawrence P. ``Larry'' Cotter, a very  special Alaskan who, for years, has given his heart and soul to our  fishing industry, one of Alaska's most vital cultural and economic  industries.   Larry began working in Alaska's commercial fishing industry in 1974,  when he was a seafood processing worker in Juneau. He then spent 8  years as a labor organizer and representative for seafood processing  workers and longshoremen. Additionally, Larry served on the advisory  panel to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council for 6 years and  then as a voting member of the council for an additional 6 years. The  time of Larry's service on the council was during the transition years  when foreign fishing was being phased out, our U.S. domestic fishing  and processing capabilities were stepping up to replace the foreign  fleets, and allocation issues among U.S. fisheries interests were first  coming to the forefront.   These were difficult, challenging, and exciting times in Alaska's  fishing industry, and Larry was on the frontlines for all of it,  helping to shape the most sustainable, best managed fisheries in the  world.   Until recently, Larry has served as founding CEO of the Community  Development Quota--CDQ--Group, known as the Aleutian Pribilof Island  Community Development Association, or APICDA, which has provided jobs  and scholarships for thousands of Aleutian and Pribilof Island  residents, and has helped develop the workforce and build  infrastructure throughout the region.   Larry is my friend and a great Alaskan. His leadership in the seafood  industry has helped make Alaska the ``superpower of seafood.''   Thank you, Larry, for your tremendous contributions to our  sustainable fisheries. Enjoy your retirement, and best of luck in your  continuing endeavors.                            ____________________
