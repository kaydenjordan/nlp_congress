 Mr. Speaker, on the week of the Congressional baseball  game, one in which I will wear the uniform of the St. Louis Cardinals,  I rise today to honor the life and career of Major League Baseball  player Albert Fred ``Red'' Schoendienst, who passed away last week on  Wednesday, June 6, at 95 years old. He was born 40 miles away from St.  Louis, in my congressional district in Germantown, Illinois, on  February 2, 1923.   Red grew up as one of seven children. His dad was a coal miner. He  lived, in his early days, without running water or electricity. He  married Mary Eileen O'Reilly in 1947. They celebrated 52 years of  marriage before she passed away in 1999. Together, they had four  children, 10 grandchildren, and seven great grandchildren.   At 16 years old, while working on a fence, under the Civilian  Conservation Corps, he suffered an injury to his left eye. That injury  made it hard for him to read a breaking ball from the right side, so he  learned to be a switch-hitter.   Red tried out for the Cardinals in 1942 and, at his induction  ceremony at the Baseball Hall of Fame, he said he and his friends  hitchhiked a ride to St. Louis on a milk truck and: ``I never thought  that milk truck ride would eventually lead to Cooperstown and  baseball's highest honor.''   He also spoke about his attitude toward playing the game. ``I would  play any position my manager asked. Whatever it took to win I was  willing to do. All I ever wanted to do was be on that lineup card and  become a champion.'' And that Red Schoendienst was.   After his discharge from the military, Red started his major league  career with the Cardinals in 1945 as a left fielder. The hometown kid  finally had a chance to play for his hometown team. He played in 137  games and stole 26 bases that season.   In 1946, Red moved to second base, which is where he played for the  rest of his career, and the Cardinals won the World Series at that  time. It was the Cardinals' third championship in 5 years and Red's  first.   In 19 seasons as a player, Red compiled a .289 batting average, with  84 home runs, 773 RBIs, 1200-plus runs. The Cardinals won the World  Series in '46, '57, '64, '67 and '82. He spent 74 consecutive years in  major league baseball as a player, coach, and manager, and spent 67 of  those years as a St. Louis Cardinal.   I would like to end by also talking about Red and his family as  individuals. Mary was very involved with reaching out to new players'  wives, helping them adjust to life with a major leaguer. Mary sang the  national anthem many times before Cardinal games, and organized the  wives' charity group.   What Red Schoendienst said was: ``What makes baseball so great is you  can't hold the ball for 24 seconds and take the last shot or run the  clock down and kick a field goal. You have to get 27 outs, one way or  the other. Time doesn't run out until you get that 27th out.''   One of his best friends was Stan Musial, and he sums up Red this way:  ``A lot of guys had the privilege of playing with or for Red over the  years, and I'm proud I was one of them. He is one of the kindest, most  decent men I've ever known in my life. Even more important than having  been his teammate or roommate, however, is having been his friend for  so many years. They don't come any better.''   I can't say it any better myself, Mr. Speaker. We have lost a great  Cardinal.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my support for and  [[Page H5106]]  emphasize the importance of blood donation and independent blood  centers in America.   Blood transfusions help save millions of lives each year. However,  blood cannot be manufactured, so our entire national supply depends on  the selfless generosity of blood donors. Because donated blood is  perishable, it has a limited shelf life. It must be continually  replenished.   Last year, when a shooter attacked the Republican baseball team and  hit my friend and roommate, Majority Whip  Steve Scalise, the donors  who visited their local blood center in the days prior to the shooting  made a crucial difference in saving his life. Volunteer blood donors  ensure that patients suffering due to natural disasters, accidents,  diseases, or acts of violence always will have access to lifesaving  blood.   This week, in honor of World Blood Donor Day, I want to thank our  Nation's blood donors, as well as encourage others to join the 7  million Americans who choose to donate blood each year. I also  encourage my colleagues to visit their local blood centers to learn  more about the continuous need for blood donation and to support their  lifesaving work.                            ____________________
