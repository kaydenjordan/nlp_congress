 Mr. Chair, today, I rise in support of H.R.  1230, the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act, which  will restore protections for older Americans against age discrimination  in the workplace. This legislation will ensure that older workers will  once again have the same legal protections against age discrimination  as those that exist for discrimination based on race, religion, sex, or  national origin.   As the cost of living rises and retirement savings shrink, Americans  now more than ever before are faced with the necessity of working later  into their lives. It is critical that we, as members of this body,  enact protections for older workers because if older workers lose their  jobs, they are far more likely to face long-term unemployment. We must  guarantee that age discrimination should be treated just as seriously  as any other form of workplace discrimination.   This bill amends four laws--the Age Discrimination in Employment Act,  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with  Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act. It ensures that the  higher burden of proof for age discrimination claims are lowered to  include mixed-motive claims. This equates to standard practices for  workplace discrimination claims based on race, religion, sex, or  national origin.   As a member of the House Democratic Caucus Task Force on Aging &  Families, I am proud to support our seniors and their families in  communities across our country through the Protecting Older Workers  Against Discrimination Act.
