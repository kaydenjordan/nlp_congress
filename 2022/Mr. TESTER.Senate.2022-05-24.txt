 Madam President, I would like to share a few words  today to honor an outstanding Montana educator who is retiring at the  end of this school year.   Kirk Miller has dedicated his career to bettering the lives of the  next generation of Montanans. Over the years, Kirk served as a teacher,  a principal, and a superintendent before being appointed to the Montana  Board of Public Education where he later served as chair. As Bozeman  schools superintendent, Kirk played a key role in improving  infrastructure for students for years to come. He championed numerous  successful initiatives that strengthened public education in the region  and served as a template for other communities to follow.   At the end of this year, Kirk will be retiring from his most recent  position as executive director of the School Administrators of Montana,  where he has worked tirelessly to support administrators and educators  across the State. Those who have been lucky enough to work with Kirk  recognize that he has a knack for connecting with people, even those  who have different views than his own. And his passion for public  education shines through in everything he does.   Under Kirk's leadership, the School Administrators of Montana  established the Leaders Professional Learning Program, or SAM LPLP, a  mentorship program that brings administrators from across the State  together to receive student-focused, solution-based professional  development training. The SAM LPLP has served more than 500  administrators to date.   As a former public school teacher I commend Kirk for his steadfast  commitment to improving our school system from the top down. In  addition to his work, Kirk has a lot to be proud of--in particular, the  wonderful family he has built with his wife of 42 years, Nan. A  lifelong educator and a dear friend to many, Kirk has shown through his  kindness and work ethic that he is truly dedicated to bettering the  lives of the next generation of Montanans. Thank you for your service,  Kirk; our Montana schools are better because of you.                            ____________________
