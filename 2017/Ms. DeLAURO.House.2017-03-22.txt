 Mr. Speaker, the healthcare plan supported by President  Trump and Speaker Ryan will raise premiums and deductibles.   Let's tell the truth here on the floor of the House of  Representatives. It will raise premiums and deductibles. It will throw  millions off of their insurance. It will shift the cost of health care  to the States who are fiscally strapped today, causing a rationing of  care at the State level. And, yes, it will cover less and less people  and raise the insecurity that people have today about whether or not,  if they get an illness or someone in their family does, they are going  to have healthcare coverage.   The result is that working people, older Americans, will pay more;  and, in fact, with older Americans, it will impose an age tax. The  irony of this is that working people and older Americans are going to  be paying for the tax breaks in this bill, tax breaks to millionaires  and to billionaires. I will explain.   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that  14 million Americans will lose coverage in 2018; 24 million Americans  will lose their insurance coverage by 2026. In my State of Connecticut,  220,300 individuals are projected to lose their health insurance by  2026.   Again, older Americans will be hit the hardest. They will see their  premiums spike. Yes, it is an age tax. And the reckless cuts in this  bill rob, in addition to this, it robs the Medicare trust fund, which  people rely on, of over $170 billion, shortening the life of that trust  fund by years. Long-term care that older Americans rely on will be  hurt, as well as folks who are disabled. And children will be hurt as  well.   Over the next 10 years--and again, these are not my numbers, but the  Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that two of the tax breaks in the  repeal bill will provide $275 billion in tax cuts to individuals who  have an income over $200,000, and nearly $190 billion will go to tax  cuts for health insurance companies.   Do we believe that they are hurting?   It is also going to provide a tax break for drug companies, for  pharmaceutical companies.   Are they hurting today? No. They are reaping profits every single  day. That is the case with medical device manufacturers as well.    While the wealthiest Americans and corporations reap the benefits of  this Trump bill and Ryan bill, roughly 160 million households with  incomes below that $200,000 level will pay for the repeal of these  taxes.   I have heard from thousands of my constituents about how the  Affordable Care Act has positively impacted their lives. I have  submitted testimony for the record from women in my district who depend  on the Affordable Care Act to manage life-threatening illnesses, get  back to work, get them the mental health services that they need.   Just think of that injustice when you think about Mnikesa Whitaker,  whom I spoke to just 2 weeks ago. She has an autoimmune disease which  is called scleroderma. I regret to say that this has put her life in  danger, but she now has the protection because she is no longer  threatened by preexisting conditions. In her words, she said: ``I will  die without the Affordable Care Act.''   We have a moral obligation not to let Mnikesa or others down. We have  an obligation to older Americans and to the middle class of this  country, to working people. The Affordable Care Act needs to be changed  in critical ways. Premiums and deductibles are way too high and are  putting too much strain on families who barely make enough to live on.  We know that because their wages have not kept pace with rising costs.  There is not enough competition in the marketplaces.   But instead of repealing the Affordable Care Act, we should be  working our hearts out to make the big fixes that are necessary. But my  friends, that starts with defeating this wrongheaded bill.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am so honored to join my colleagues here  tonight. I thank the gentlewoman for taking the lead in this effort.   There really is such an urgency to this debate and to what is  happening on the floor of this House. I rise to voice my opposition to  the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, but the urgency of the debate is  because tomorrow, in this Chamber, in the people's House, House  Republicans are prepared to vote on a healthcare plan which is  supported by President Trump and by Speaker Paul Ryan.   What is at stake on this vote tomorrow in this House? What happens to  people in this country with this vote tomorrow?   There is real clarity here. We will see families pay higher premiums  and higher deductibles. This plan will increase out-of-pocket costs to  working Americans. In addition to that, older Americans will be faced  with what has been described as an age tax. Those Americans who are 50  to 64 years old will pay premiums five times higher than what others  pay for health coverage, no matter how healthy they are.   There will be less coverage because we are going to take away health  care for 24 million hardworking Americans. And for older Americans,  once again, something that they rely on in terms of healthcare coverage  is what happens to Medicare. Well, Medicare and the trust fund for  Medicare will have a shortened life by 2 or 3 years because it takes  $170 billion from the Medicare trust fund.   To do what? What does all of this mean? Who benefits from this  legislation that my Republican colleagues want to pass tomorrow and who  are strong-arming their own Members to vote for it? Who benefits?   Don't take my word for it, but the Joint Committee on Taxation  estimates that two of the tax breaks in the repeal bill will give a  $275 billion tax cut to individuals with incomes over $200,000; $190  billion in tax cuts for insurance companies and drug companies who are  making a fortune, for medical device manufacturers who are making a  fortune.   And so what is the balance?   It is working Americans, older Americans who are going to pay  increased costs for premiums and deductibles, and the wealthiest  corporations and individuals are going to get a $600 billion tax cut.   I will make one final comment because this is where the values of  this Nation come into play, and when you think about a young woman in  my district, Mnikesa Whitaker. She is 36 years old. She has an  autoimmune disease known as scleroderma. She cannot breathe without an  oxygen tank. She cannot work any longer at 36 years old. What she says  to me is, without the Affordable Care Act, each day is one day less in  her life. We cannot let the Mnikesa Whitakers all over this Nation down  in order to be able to take care of tax cuts for the wealthiest  Americans and increase the costs to working Americans and older  Americans.   We have an opportunity to say no tomorrow and defeat this Republican  healthcare plan supported by the President and the Speaker of this  House, which will only do great damage to the health care of the people  of this great Nation.
