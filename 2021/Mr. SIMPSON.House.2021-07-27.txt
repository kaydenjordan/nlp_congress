 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding  time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in reluctant opposition to H.R. 4502, the  seven-bill fiscal year 2022 appropriations package that includes the  Energy and Water Development appropriations bill. I had hoped to be  able to support the appropriations bill this year. Unfortunately, the  overall funding framework for these bills lacks bipartisan support. The  House framework includes massive increases for non-defense programs and  shortchanges our national security needs.   Taken in isolation, there are many things in the Energy and Water  bill that House Republicans could support. For example, strong support  for the Corps of Engineers, including specific community project  funding and additional programmatic funding, is a bipartisan priority.   Of great importance to me, of course, is the Department of Energy's  nuclear energy program. I appreciate Chairwoman Kaptur's efforts to  address many of my priorities within this account.   In particular, I am pleased to see increased funding to continue  three demonstration projects under the Advanced Small Modular Reactor  and Advanced Reactors Demonstration programs, as well as continued work  on microreactors, including the MARVEL program.   Also notable is the support for ensuring a supply of high-assay, low- enriched uranium, or HALEU, that will be the fuel that will be used by  many of the next generation of reactors. The Department of Energy will  serve as an essential, temporary source of HALEU until the commercial  market can be established.   While I support the focus on demonstrating new technologies, I am  disappointed to see that the bill does not also continue support for  the Versatile Test Reactor. The VTR will be a valuable domestic testing  facility for many advanced technologies. Continuing work now, even if  at a slower pace than was originally planned, will allow us to benefit  from collaboration with one of the demonstration projects.   I was pleased to join Congressman Weber in offering an amendment to  highlight the importance of the VTR, and I urge the full House to adopt  it. I look forward to working with my colleagues to support progress on  the VTR as soon as possible.   Unfortunately, the bill before us underfunds our national security  needs. An increase of less than 1 percent for weapons activities does  not even keep up with inflation. And while the budget request was  itself insufficient, the bill before us does not even meet the budget  request for certain stockpile sustainment and major modification  programs. We must uphold our Nation's strong national deterrence  posture, and to do that we must adequately fund the activities  necessary to maintain a safe, reliable, and effective stockpile.   In closing, I would like to thank Chairwoman Kaptur for putting  together this year's Energy and Water bill in her typical cooperative  style. It is clear that she and the majority staff worked hard to  address individual Members' priorities from both sides of the aisle,  and I thank her for that consideration.   I would also like to thank Chairwoman DeLauro and Ranking Member  Granger of the full committee for their leadership and support of the  important programs in this bill.   I look forward to working together as the bill moves through the  legislative process to develop a final Energy and Water bill that  reflects a balanced set of priorities that can be supported by Members  on both sides of the aisle.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Cammack).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Tenney).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from New York.                                time  1815     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I support this amendment and hope that  Members will vote for it.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from North Carolina.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    Mr. Speaker, I support this amendment, and I encourage  my colleagues to support it also. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) for a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Jackson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  my amendment No. 151, which seeks to provide an additional $650,000 to  the U.S. Geological Survey to accelerate updating the seismic hazard  model for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The corresponding  offset would come from a small portion of the increase to transition  the U.S. Geological Survey fleet to zero emission vehicles, which falls  under the same account.   The National Seismic Hazard Model describes the potential impacts of  earthquakes nationwide and serves as the basis for seismic provisions  in building codes. While the U.S. Geological Survey office last updated  the model for the 48 contiguous States in 2018, it has not updated the  models for Alaska since 2007, for Hawaii since 1998, and for Puerto  Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands since 2003.   The U.S. Geological Survey has begun updating the models for Alaska  and Hawaii, which will be released with the next update of the National  Seismic Hazard Model in 2023. Unfortunately, there is not enough time  to update the models for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. That  is the reason this amendment will provide the initial funds needed to  permit the U.S. Geological Survey to complete Puerto Rico and the U.S.  Virgin Islands update within 3 years, by 2024.   In Puerto Rico we know firsthand the devastating impact earthquakes  can have, as we saw last year in the southern part of the island where  most of the schools were destroyed as well as infrastructure. Updating  the hazard model is, therefore, urgent and crucial to saving lives and  ensuring that we have the necessary tools to prepare for future seismic  events.   Mr. Speaker, that is the reason I urge my colleagues to support the  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
