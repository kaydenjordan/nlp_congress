 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself, Senator Gillibrand, and Senator Schatz to the  President's counsel and the House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question from Senators Manchin,  Gillibrand, and Schatz for both parties:         Have you ever been involved in any trial--civil, criminal,       or other--in which you were unable to call witnesses or       submit relevant evidence?    I believe the House is first.   Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and thank you to  the Senator for the question.   I want us to imagine for just a moment someone broke into your house;  stole your property; police caught them; they returned the property.  Now, the fact that they returned the property changes nothing. They  would still be held accountable.   But imagine if they had the power to obstruct every witness, prevent  witnesses from appearing. Imagine if they had the power to destroy or  obstruct any evidence in the case against them from being presented to  the court.   I have had the opportunity to appear in a lot of hearings and be a  part of building a lot of cases. We all know. I know everybody here  knows that witness testimony and evidence or documentation in a case is  everything. It is the life and breath of any case. It is the  prosecutor's dream or the police officer's or detective's dream to have  information and evidence.   It truly baffles me, really, as a 27-year law enforcement officer,  that we would not accept or welcome or be delighted about the  opportunity to hear from direct witnesses, people who have firsthand  knowledge.   We know that the President cannot be charged with a crime. We know  that. The Department of Justice has already ruled on that. But the  remedy for that is impeachment. That is the tool that, as we know, has  solely been given--that power, solely--to the House of Representatives,  solely tried before the Senate.   So, to answer your question, it is extremely--let me say it this way:  Only in a case where there are no available witnesses or no available  evidence have I ever seen that occur.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mrs. Manager.   Counsel.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the  Senate.   I would respond to that question in this way. Thank you for the  question. The House managers controlled the process in the House. I  think we can all agree to that. They were in charge, and they ran it.  And they chose not to allow the President's counsel to have any  witnesses. And they chose not to call the witnesses that they are now  asking you to call, demanding you to call, accusing you of a coverup if  you don't call.   I have never been in any proceeding, trial or otherwise, where you  show up on the first day, and the judge says: Let's go. And you say:  Well, I'm not ready yet. Let's stop everything. Let's take a bunch of  depositions.   Well, did you subpoena the witnesses you are now seeking?   Well, some but not others.   Well, when you did subpoena them, did you try to enforce that  subpoena in court?   No.   The other witnesses that you did subpoena, did they go to court?   Yes.   What did you do? I withdrew the subpoena and mooted out the case. And  now I want them. I want them. Otherwise, you are doing the coverup.   Let me make another point because they keep making this point: What  will we do? The President is not producing documents.   I would like to refresh your recollection about the Mueller  investigation, OK. The Mueller investigation had 2,800 subpoenas, 500  search warrants, 500 witnesses. The President's Counsel, the Chief of  Staff, and many, many others from the administration testified.  Documents--voluminous documents--were produced. And what happened? Bob  Mueller came back with a conclusion. He announced it. There was no  collusion.   What did the House do? They didn't like it. Didn't like the outcome.  So what did they do? They wanted a do-over. They wanted to do it all  again themselves, despite the $34 million or more that was spent.   So I don't think anybody really believes that the Trump  administration hasn't fully cooperated with the investigations. The  problem is, when they don't like the outcome, they just keep  investigating. They keep wasting the public's money because they don't  really care about truth; they care about a political outcome.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Utah.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk on  behalf of myself for the President's counsel and House managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question is from Senator Manchin for both parties. We will begin  with the President's counsel.         Over the past two weeks, the White House counsel had       detailed all the problems associated with the House's       decision to move quickly through their impeachment       proceedings. Why shouldn't this body heed their advice and       slow down and at least allow the judge to rule in the McGahn       case to give the members of this body an official opinion       from the Judiciary on Article II?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senator, thank you for the  question.   I think the key point here is the McGahn case is not going to  directly resolve something related to the obstruction charges here. It  is going to address a legal issue with respect to an assertion of  absolute immunity for Don McGahn.   There should be a decision from the DC Circuit sometime soon, but  that will almost certainly go to the Supreme Court. I mean, that  immunity is being challenged, and it has been relied upon by the  executive for over 40 years. That is an issue destined for the Supreme  Court.   So the idea--it is not going to be just to slow down here a little  bit. This trial can't be held open pending a final resolution of that  litigation, and that is an important point, because this is something  that Alexander Hamilton pointed out in Federalist No. 65, when he was  discussing who should be the body to try impeachments. One  consideration was potentially drawing in judges from various States to  create a new body to try impeachments, and the rationale that Hamilton  gave that that would be a bad idea is that there has to be swift  progression from an impeachment to the trial, to a verdict, to having  it finished, precisely because this is where he talked about ``the  persecution of an intemperate or designing majority in the House of  Representatives.''   He recognized there could be partisan impeachments, and that  accusation, that impeachment, shouldn't been hanging out there. There  should be a swift trial to determine things finally, and that is why  all of the preparation ought to be done in the House of Representatives  to ensure that there is an investigation, there is a case put together.  And, if they are ready to impeach the President of the United States,  they had better be finished, have everything buttoned down, and have  their case ready because they can't have a trial of the President-- Hamilton warned against that specifically--hanging over the country for  months on end.   And so to push off this trial to say: Well, we will wait for  litigation and at that point--that is a very dangerous idea, and that  is not the way that the trial here should operate. It ought to be  finished on the basis of the case that the House managers came ready to  present. If they weren't ready to present a case that can win, there  should be an acquittal.   Thank you.
