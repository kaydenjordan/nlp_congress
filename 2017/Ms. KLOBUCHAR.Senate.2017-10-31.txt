 Mr. President, I wish to explain my vote today in  opposition to the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to serve as a U.S.  Circuit Judge for the Seventh Circuit. In Professor Barrett's hearing  before the Judiciary Committee, I focused my questions on Professor  Barrett's views and previous writings on the circumstances under which  judges must adhere to precedent and on the doctrine of originalism. It  was on the basis of her responses to those questions that I have  concluded that I am unable to support her nomination.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.
