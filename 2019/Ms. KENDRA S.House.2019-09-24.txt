 HORN of Oklahoma led the Pledge of Allegiance as  follows:         I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of       America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation       under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.                            ____________________     HORN of Oklahoma asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)    HORN of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support  of the FAIR Act that makes forced arbitration clauses illegal.   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I worked to protect  servicemembers and their families from negligently managed base housing  and the contracts they were forced to sign to keep them quiet. Our  servicemembers should have the right to advocate for themselves.   We cannot hold bad actors accountable when they can hide in  arbitration proceedings. No one should have to sign away their right to  go to court after experiencing sexual assault or discrimination, but  that is exactly what forced arbitration clauses do.   Arbitration can be an option to solve disagreements without going to  court, but everyone involved should get to choose. If you downloaded an  app, signed up for a credit card, or signed an employment contract, you  may have signed away your right to hold someone accountable. I don't  believe that you can sign away your constitutional rights.   Mr. Speaker, I voted for the FAIR Act to level the playing field for  consumers, small businesses, and workers across America, and I strongly  urge the Senate to take it up as soon as possible.                            ____________________
