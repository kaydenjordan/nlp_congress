 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  the Innovation Centers Acceleration Act, introduced by my friend and  colleague,  Joe Morelle.   This bill creates an $80 billion national competition that could  direct new resources for communities like Rochester, Buffalo, and  western New York to foster innovation and create new jobs and  opportunities.   I am also a cosponsor of the Endless Frontiers Act, a version which  passed the Senate with the support of our Senators, that would create  similar opportunities and competition.   For too long, Congress has lacked the vision to nation-build here at  home. Now we can enact a plan to compete with China and foster new  opportunity and growth.   Groups like the Northland Workforce Training Center, the M&T Bank's  technology hub, and the Thomas Beecher Innovation Center are leading  the way in creating tech ecosystems in my region.   Enacting this bill could help propel these entities to achieve their  full potential for the benefit of the entire community that could last  for generations.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                            ____________________
