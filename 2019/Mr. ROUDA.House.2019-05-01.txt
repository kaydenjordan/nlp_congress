 Mr. Speaker, climate change isn't a question of if or even  when. Climate change is not our future. It is our present.   Kids with asthma are finding it harder and harder to breathe on their  walks to school or to the playground. Raging fires have reduced whole  communities to ash in my home State of California. Rising seas threaten  to swallow family homes on the coast. Extreme weather has devastated  our country from the coast of Puerto Rico to the coast of Orange  County.   So, it bears asking: What will it take for politicians to see what  the American people already know to be true?   Americans are already suffering from climate change, and the threat  to humankind grows every day.   In 2015, almost every country in the world recognized the climate  crisis and signed the Paris Agreement. The United States led the way.   In 2017, this administration abdicated the throne of American global  leadership and joined Russia, Turkey, and Iran in the cheap seats.   This administration failed to lower carbon emissions and protect the  lungs, homes, and wallets of the American people.   The Climate Action Now Act demands accountability from this White  House. It is an up-and-down vote on whether the Members of this body  support a livable future for humankind.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I stand today as a cosponsor of this important  amendment offered by my colleague and fellow Californian,  Representative Torres.   Our State and many others across the country are showing the world  how to take meaningful steps to meet our Paris climate agreement  commitments.   While the current administration continues to do everything in its  power to prioritize industry conflicts of interest over the  sustainability and future of our planet, I am proud of the forward- thinking work being done in our cities, like the ones in my district,  in Orange County, and States like the one I call home, California.  These important efforts must not be prohibited.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, this amendment recognizes that American  cities, States, and businesses are stepping up and pledging to meet the  Paris Agreement goals in the wake of absent  [[Page H3395]]  and uncertain United States Federal leadership.   While the current administration takes steps to actively undermine  the position of the United States on the global stage with regard to  climate change, an unprecedented coalition of American States, cities,  and businesses are taking action and working to lead the United States  to a low-carbon future, as affirmed by the Paris Agreement.   Cities across the country and in my home State of California are  taking on the challenge of combating climate change. These cities are  implementing new sustainability initiatives by targeting 100 percent  renewable energy, recycling 100 percent of wastewater, and working  toward net zero carbon emission goals.   As California continues to be an international leader in forward- thinking policy and environmental stewardship, we are not alone.   When describing the ongoing work and the action still needed,  California Governor Jerry Brown said, ``We're at the base camp of Mount  Everest, and we're looking up at the long way we still have to go.''  That is why, without Federal leadership, States are left taking the  lead.   The United States Climate Alliance, a bipartisan coalition of  Governors committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions consistent  with the goals of the Paris Agreement, just added its 24th State this  week.   I reiterate: This bipartisan coalition of Governors is committed to  taking real, on-the-ground action to urgently address climate change by  implementing policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least  26 percent below 2005 levels by the year 2025, tracking and reporting  progress to the global community, and accelerating new and existing  policies to reduce carbon pollution and promote clean energy  deployment.   Businesses, large and small, are stepping up across a wide range of  industries. Large corporations and small businesses alike have already  taken steps to develop and deploy high-impact climate action  strategies. They see opportunities in working toward a low-carbon  future and support the aims of the Paris Agreement.   However, for this transition to succeed, federal governments must  also lead. That is why I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of  my amendment and the underlying bill. We must remain in the Paris  climate agreement and work to meet our commitment for future  generations. The time for action is now.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider), my colleague.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
