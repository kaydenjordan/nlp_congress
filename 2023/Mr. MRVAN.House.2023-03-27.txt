 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the VNA Hospice  of Northwest Indiana for receiving a Level 5 status from the We Honor  Veterans program for the third consecutive year.   The women and men who volunteer to defend and protect our national  security deserve every resource, consideration, and compassionate  assistance when they return home.   As a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and a prior  local elected official in northwest Indiana for 15 years, I continue to  be grateful for so many meaningful relationships with our veterans  community. I will continue to do all I can to ensure our veterans  receive the care and benefits that they have earned.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating the VNA Hospice of  Northwest Indiana for this recognition and appreciation of their  unwavering commitment to supporting our veterans and all those in need.                            ____________________
