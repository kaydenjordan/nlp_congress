 Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule for the week to come.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy),  my friend, the majority leader.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his information.  And the minibus that he referred to is what we refer to, I guess, as  the first minibus. Has that conference report been completed at this  point in time, Mr. Leader?   I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.  Mr. Speaker, we have some 7 days left to go, and, of course, next week  is essentially one full day, and then we have 4, maybe 5 days the  following week, depending upon what is necessary.   I would ask the majority leader, does he contemplate us trying to  effect a continuing resolution for those appropriation items which have  not been addressed in the next 7 days? And if so, how long does he  expect that continuing resolution to go?   I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I hope his optimism is  met because I think that would be a better thing for us to do, so I  appreciate that observation.   Let me ask the gentleman as well, if we accomplish what he suggests  that we might accomplish over the next 7 legislative days, there will  still be a needed CR. Assuming we adopt a resolution which will fund  all of government through a particular time, both because we passed  appropriations bills, your point being that there are nine that are  possible to pass with three remaining.   The gentleman has scheduled, as of now, for us to be meeting the  first 2 weeks in October.                                time  1100    Obviously, Members are very interested in whether or not that  schedule will be kept or whether there is a possibility that assuming  we do, in fact, fund government to some date, either through the year,  the next fiscal year, or for a period of time, for those bills that  have not passed and been signed by the President, does the gentleman  still contemplate that we will be here the first 2 weeks in October?   I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that. I would hope  that, for scheduling purposes for all Members, we could make that  decision by the end of next week so that Members would have the  opportunity to plan. I realize full well that it depends upon whether  or not, in fact, we get the work done, which is why I was asking about  the CR.   In addition to that, the gentleman has mentioned a couple of bills,  but the Violence Against Women Act, the farm bill, and the FAA, as the  gentleman knows, expire on September 30. Does the gentleman expect us  to be dealing with those bills in one form or another?   I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, so the gentleman's hope is to vote on these  conference reports prior to the 30th of September?  [[Page H7938]]    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that observation.   My presumption, therefore, is, if the conference cannot come to  agreement, I would presume that we would have an extension on those  three bills and others that might need that. Is that accurate?   I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the information.   I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
