 Mr. Speaker, I am deeply concerned that the continuing  resolution we are debating this afternoon includes a suspension of the  limit on our national debt through the end of next year.   Our national debt is already at historic levels. In fact, today our  national debt represents about $85,000 for every American man, woman,  and child, and it is going to get worse.   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that at the rate we are  going in just a few short years that debt will more than double, and  just paying interest on that debt will consume 10 percent of everything  our country makes.   Every other time we have considered raising this debt ceiling that  conversation has been accompanied by a discussion of how we are going  to pay that money back. But, unfortunately, that is not occurring  today.   I have introduced a constitutional amendment that would require the  Federal budget to be balanced, which would help us pay down this  national debt over time. But absent discussion of getting our fiscal  house in order, it is unconscionable to leave that legacy of debt to  our children and kick the can down the road.   Mr. Speaker, I must urge a ``no'' vote.
