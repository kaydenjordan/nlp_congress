 Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my  colleagues, Senator Franken and Senator Warren, who are also here for  this conversation that was kicked off earlier this afternoon by our  friend and colleague from West Virginia, Senator Manchin.   West Virginia does not have a whole lot in common with Rhode Island.  We are a coastal State. Senator Manchin comes from a very landlocked  mountainous State. Our biggest mountain in Rhode Island is probably the  Johnson landfill. But we have something in common, which is the extent  to which opioid addiction and opioid overdoses have stricken our State.  We have had over 200 deaths per year. In a State our size, everyone is  within 2 or 3 degrees of separation of everyone else. Those 200 deaths  reverberate through our whole State.   There is a small town in Rhode Island called Burrillville, up in our  northwest corner. Burrillville is a very small town in Rhode Island. I  went up there for a meeting about the opioid epidemic at Burrillville  High School. In the previous quarter, in just 3 months, that one little  town had six deaths from opioid overdoses. That is six times that the  little police force had to respond, six times the funeral parlors had  to handle grieving families, six times that death notices had to be  published in the local paper. It felt like a battering to people in  that community.   Senator Manchin has a pretty good idea to help make sure that we have  the funding to get treatment to people before these tragedies take  place. He proposes what he calls the LifeBOAT Act, which is one penny  for each milligram of active opioid in a prescription drug--one penny.  It is only a penny, but it would have raised about $2 billion last  year. So $2 billion would save a lot of people and save a lot of lives.   Just to give you some idea of the scale, Purdue Pharma has generated  estimated sales of more than $35 billion since 1995 for opioid  medications. It has annual revenues of about $3 billion, mostly from  OxyContin. That is just one company. So the idea of adding a penny  really does not seem to me to be asking very much.   The way we operate now in the Senate, I know that asking corporations  to do anything seems impossible because they have the financial whip  hand over so many Senators because of the unlimited money they are  allowed to spend and threaten to spend in our politics. But really,  after all the lives that have been lost, after all the lives have been  affected, you would expect that just out of common decency this  industry would step up and say: For a penny, we are in. So let's hope  they come around to that because I think it is a good plan.   TrumpCare, on the other hand, would be a disaster. So many people get  their opioid treatment through Medicaid and through the expansion of  Medicaid that the Affordable Care Act created. To undo that, to strip  $1.4 trillion, as President Trump has proposed, out of Medicaid is  inevitably going to deny people access to care.   I am not the only one saying this. Someone who works in Providence  with recovering heroin addicts wrote to me. His name is Travis. He  wrote to me about his clients who are receiving medication-assisted  treatments. He credits their being able to come in and get the care  that they get to the Affordable Care Act. He said that it is the reason  he and his colleagues have been able to help recovering addicts enter  effective treatment programs. It works.   Travis relates that repealing the Affordable Care Act would have what  he calls a profound impact on his clients' ability to get needed  addiction and recovery services.   I will turn the floor over to Senator Warren in a minute, but I want  to recognize one other person. I will not use last names. His name is  Mark. He wrote to me from Rumford, RI, which is a very nice part of  East Providence, RI.   This is a gentleman who became addicted to opiates at the age of 52.  He had surgery, and after the surgical procedure, his doctor gave him  opiates for the pain. The doctor was somewhat indiscriminate about  continuing to prescribe those opioids.   Mark realized that he was addicted. He went to a recovery group in  Rhode Island called CODAC, which does very good work for treatment. He  went into recovery, and he succeeded for 8 years without using opioids.   As sometimes happens, family stresses, business stresses, other  stresses intervene. In his case, a family stress caused a relapse, but  he knew what to do. He went back to CODAC. He became sober again. Now  he is back in recovery, clean and sober.   This pattern of recovery and then an occasional relapse and then back  to recovery again is very often the way people who have an addiction  get through it. To make sure that the treatment is there for them when  they relapse can be a lifesaver.   By the way, Mark is a success. He is in the music business. He has  toured around the world. The fact that CODAC was there for him on those  two occasions has allowed him to achieve that success. Again, this was  a 52-year-old individual whom a surgery sent into addiction.   I will close by pointing out that one of the things the CARA bill,  which many of us worked so hard on, accomplished was to send the  message that addiction is not a moral failing. It is a medical  condition. It should be treated as a medical condition. Not only is it  not a moral failing, I think many of us who have had family, loved  ones, friends, or any experience with folks who are going through  recovery--what we have learned is that recovery is actually a noble  accomplishment. It is not an easy path, but it is a path that demands  deep honesty, deep courage, deep trust, very often love. It is a path  that people who are walking it can and should be proud of, and we  should be proud of them for their achievements, and we should be there  for them in their relapses and make sure the care that will put them  back on that path is available.    I yield the floor to my terrific colleague from Massachusetts.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.                            ____________________
