 Mr. President, today I recognize Charlotte Weber  for being named the National Breeder of the Year by the Thoroughbred  Owners and Breeders Association.   The Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association presented Charlotte  with this award during the 33rd annual national awards dinner at the  Woodford Reserve Club in Lexington, KY. She is the owner and sole  operator of Live Oak Stud in Ocala, and for the first time, a broodmare  based outside of Kentucky received this recognition.   Live Oak Stud is a 4,500-acre thoroughbred farm and commercial cattle  operation that Charlotte has guided since 1995. Her breeding and racing  operation's distinctive black, red, and white silks have become a  nationally recognized racing symbol. Over the years, Live Oak Stud has  seen its record of success grow. Charlotte's horse, Win Approval, dam  of World Approval, was also named Broodmare of the Year by the  Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association. This horse has become a  central part of Live Oak Stud's success.   I extend my best wishes to Charlotte and look forward to hearing of  Live Oak Stud's continued success as she brings prestige to Florida  horse breeding.                            ____________________
