 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  life of Mr. Tom Wright, who passed away on January 3 at the age of 76.   Mr. Wright dedicated his life to serving both his country and his  local community. He served for 21 years as a commander in the United  States Navy, including one tour in Vietnam. After his retirement, he  continued his work supporting veterans' groups in the local Savannah  area. Mr. Wright also dedicated a great deal of his time and efforts to  the civilian maritime community in Savannah, including the Savannah  Propeller Club and the Savannah Maritime Association.   A family man through and through, he could often be found watching  North Carolina Tar Heel basketball with his family.   His presence will be deeply missed throughout our area. Mr. Wright's  family and friends will be in my thoughts and prayers during this most  difficult time.                            ____________________
