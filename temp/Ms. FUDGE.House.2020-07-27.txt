 Mr. Speaker, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow writes in part:      Life is real!      Life is earnest!      And the grave is not its goal;      Dust thou art to dust returneth,      Was not spoken of the soul.   John still lives in most of us because his soul, his spirit, and his  heart still live.   Mr. Speaker, like all Americans, I reacted with deep sadness to the  passing of my friend, Congressman John Lewis. John and I served  together for 12 years in Congress, and I was so proud to have known him  as a colleague, a mentor, and a friend.   A lot has been said about the man that John Lewis was, but what  strikes me the most is the man that he never became.  [[Page H3863]]    For a person who faced virulent hatred, he was never a man who hated.   For a person who stood as a focal point for an entire movement, he  never focused the lens on himself.   For a person born to segregation, he never excluded others from the  movement for equal rights.   For a person whose voice pierced the air like a foghorn, he never  spoke empty words.   For a person to whom grace was too rarely extended in his life, he  never allowed himself to withhold it from those around him.   For a person who was at the center of the Nation's gravest affairs,  he never passed up an opportunity to laugh or to dance.   From his refusals, he became the man whom we admire so profoundly.  John's death comes at a turbulent time for our country, and his loss is  sharply felt by the many who still fight for equality in our country.   Young Black Americans struggling for equal treatment, women fighting  for equal pay, LGBTQ advocates pushing for equal protection,  marginalized people striving to protect their right to vote, and young  leaders yearning for equity in a nation that has denied it for too long  saw in John a model for perseverance, humility, courage, and  leadership.   We could not be forgiven for despairing the loss of such a man as  John Lewis in these times. But I think John would tell us to do  otherwise. I think he might say that the movement for equality and  equity in our Nation did not start with him and it shouldn't die with  him.   He might look around at the newest generation of remarkable young  Black and Brown leaders in technology, social justice, business,  education, public service, and every other walk of American life and  feel confident that, while the work remains, the fight is in good and  capable hands.   He, undoubtedly, would look at the progress we have made and the  struggles ahead and tell us not to dwell too long on the passing of one  leader, however impactful, because there is just too much work to do.   But that is hard. It is hard for me, and I imagine it is hard for  you. Congressman John Robert Lewis was more than an icon; he was a real  person, perfect in his imperfections, and I will miss him dearly.                            ____________________
