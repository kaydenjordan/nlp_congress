 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Robert  Greenstein, founder and president of the Center on Budget and Policy  Priorities, for his work over nearly four decades, fighting for a more  just and equal society.   Bob founded CBPP in 1981 to push for policies that expand opportunity  for the lowest income children and families, and ensure that this  country's prosperity is shared with the workers who create it, not just  the wealthiest CEOs and the largest corporations. He built CBPP from  the ground up and transformed it from a tiny organization with a  shoestring budget to one of the most influential policy shapers in the  country.   Under Bob's leadership, CBPP combined in-depth analysis and research  with clear-headed strategy to drive the debate and deliver results. We  worked together to spearhead efforts to permanently expand the earned  income tax credit and child tax credit in 2015, and Bob was vital to  our success. It is probably the most important thing we have done to  life people out of poverty in the last 25 years, and it could not have  happened without Bob's leadership on this issue, stretching back  decades.   Of course it is not only tax credits; from passing the Affordable  Care Act to strengthening SNAP, from protecting and expanding Medicaid,  to fighting for more affordable housing, Bob's work at CBPP has meant  that millions of ordinary Americans have more food on the table, more  money in their pockets, and a little more economic security. Over his  career he has touched so many lives, and he has so much to be proud of.   We know we have a lot more work to do, and while Bob has earned his  retirement, I have faith that he will continue to be a force for the  progressive change that our country needs.                            ____________________
