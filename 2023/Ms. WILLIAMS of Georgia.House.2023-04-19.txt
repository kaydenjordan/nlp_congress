 Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition  to this cruel and discriminatory bill. If Republicans really meant to  protect women and girls in sports, they would make it so more women and  girls could play, not play politics with children's lives.   I submitted an amendment to award federal grants to start new school  sports teams for women and girls and to break down existing barriers to  participation.   My amendment invested in women's sports so more people could play,  more people could participate, but Republicans chose politics over  participation. There are real problems impacting women and girls in  sports, including pay inequality, sexual harassment and assault, and  unequal facilities and resources. This legislation addresses none of  these issues.   Instead, we will be voting on a horrific bill to nationalize the  cruel bigotry Republicans are implementing in states around the  country.   This bill will harm our kids' mental health. make our schools less  welcoming, and prevent trans students from living the full lives they  deserve.   I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.
