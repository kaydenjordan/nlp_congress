 Mr. Speaker, as Hurricane Florence  threatens to strike South Carolina, I am grateful to Governor Henry  McMaster, Adjutant General Bob Livingston, Attorney General Alan  Wilson, as well as Kim Stenson, Director of the Emergency Management  Division, who have all done a fantastic job of preparing for the high  winds and extraordinary flooding, while keeping the people of the State  up to date with the encouragement of President Donald Trump.   I appreciate that the Governor has been in close coordination with  President Donald Trump and together they are working to ensure South  Carolinians have all the resources for the courageous first responders  to respond to Hurricane Florence, which endangers families.   The projected phenomenal rainfall will cause unexpected flooding, so  we  [[Page H8180]]  should be ready for higher elevation with only emergency travel through  next week, as roads will be deadly, as citizens should stay in place.   FOX News is providing accurate coverage.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
