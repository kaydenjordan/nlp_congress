 Mr. Speaker, I rise, once again, to speak about the  unspeakable suffering of the Rohingya people.   Two recent developments have accentuated the vital need for the House  to speak formally and clearly about this human disaster.   First, last month, a factfinding mission of the United Nations  spelled out what is undeniable, that Burma's Rohingya Muslim population  has been subjected to ``systemic oppression'' culminating in so-called  clearance operations that ``targeted and terrorized the entire Rohingya  population.''   The U.N. report called for Burma's military leaders to be  investigated and prosecuted on charges of genocide, crimes against  humanity, and war crimes related to the atrocities committed against  the Rohingya.   Let me quote directly from the U.N. report on the violence and  brutally inflicted on the Rohingya by operations  [[Page H8111]]  conducted by the Burmese military last year:   ``The `clearance operations' constituted a human rights catastrophe.  Thousands of Rohingya were killed or injured. Mass killings were  perpetrated. . . . Villagers were gathered together, before men and  boys were separated and killed. . . . Women and girls were taken to  nearby houses, gang raped, then killed or severely injured. Bodies were  transported in military vehicles, burned and disposed of in mass  graves.''                                time  1215    ``Villagers were killed by soldiers, and sometimes Rakhine men, using  large bladed weapons. Others were killed in arson attacks, burned to  death in their own houses. In some cases, people were forced into  burning houses or locked into buildings set on fire. Rape and other  forms of sexual violence were perpetrated on a massive scale.''   Secondly, reporters who have attempted to expose these atrocities in  Burma have been targeted for harassment and arrest. Just last week, two  reporters from Reuters were sentenced to 7 years in prison by a Burmese  court for violating state-secret laws in what has been widely reported  as a sham process.   During their court proceedings, a police official testified he had  been ordered to entrap these journalists. This is nothing less than an  effort to suppress the truth.   The leader of Burma's civilian government, Aung San Suu Kyi, must  pursue the immediate and unconditional release of these courageous  reporters. Anything less represents a betrayal of justice and  democracy.   Earlier this year, Burma's national security advisor made a series of  comments designed to deny or downplay any violence and atrocities  against the Rohingya, saying the vast majority remain in Burma, and  ``if it was genocide, they would all be driven out.''   He went on to declare that the Burmese Government ``would like to  have clear evidence'' of ethnic cleansing and genocide. The evidence,  of course, is overwhelming, as presented in the current and previous  U.N. reports.   The fact is that Suu Kyi and the civilian government too often excuse  or deny genocide. The U.N. report stated that she failed to use her  position or moral authority to protect the Rohingya, and that civilian  authorities have, instead, ``spread false narratives'' about the  atrocities.   Some have preached patience with Suu Kyi, noting that she does not  have direct authority over Burma's military. They say that there is a  danger the military may dismantle the civilian government if she raises  concerns about their brutal and murderous repression of the Rohingya.   I met personally with Suu Kyi a few years ago as part of a delegation  led by Nancy Pelosi. Her story of not only perseverance but triumph  over oppression was an inspiration to all of us.   But none of this justifies silence in the face of genocide.   Over three-quarters of a million Rohingya have been forced to flee  their homes to seek refuge in neighboring Bangladesh. Many thousands  have been killed, raped, and beaten as described earlier. Dozens of  villages have been burned and bulldozed into oblivion.   The civilian government has the power to free the two jailed  reporters who have exposed particular cases of violence against the  Rohingya.

The leader  of Burma's civilian government, Aung San Suu Kyi, must pursue the  immediate and unconditional release of these courageous reporters.  Anything less represents a betrayal of justice and democracy.   Earlier this year, Burma's National Security Advisor (Thaung Tun)  made a series of comments designed to deny or downplay any violence and  atrocities against the Rohingya, saying the vast majority remain in  Burma, and ``if it was genocide, they would all be driven out.''   He went on to declare that the Burmese government ``would like to  have clear evidence'' of ethnic cleansing and genocide.

The civilian government has the power to free the two jailed  reporters who have exposed particular cases of violence against the  Rohingya. Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo should not be imprisoned for shining  a light on the truth.   Congresswoman Schakowsky is leading efforts to urge Secretary of  State Pompeo to demand their immediate release in direct discussions  with Suu Kyi, saying ``this case is only the latest example of the  ongoing erosion of press freedom in Burma, especially directed at those  covering military abuses.''   Representatives Joaquin Castro and Ann Wagner have sent a letter  directly to Suu Kyi urging the journalists' release after being  sentenced for, in their words, ``their commitment to a central role of  a free press--speaking truth to power.''   Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, has said  ``the conviction of two journalists for doing their job is another  terrible stain on the Burmese government.''   Last week, I introduced H. Res. 1057, calling on Suu Kyi to move to  immediately and unconditionally free the two reporters. It builds on an  earlier resolution that I joined with Senator Durbin and the late  Senator McCain that called for both military and civilian authorities  to end the violent repression of the Rohingya.   I urged that we in the House carry out our solemn duty and come  together now and speak with one voice. We should pass a resolution  right now saying that jailing reporters for exposing the truth is a  grave injustice, especially when that truth is the crime of genocide.   We cannot wait to respond to this injustice when it is convenient or  safe. Those whose voices have been suppressed through violence and  cruelty need us to speak for them now. We must not fail them.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is the first of four bills that came out of the  Ways and Means Committee. They came out without much controversy. The  only one that really had any is this first bill. I am not sure we will  have any speakers on our side. I will say a few words about this bill  in a few minutes.   I first want to talk a bit about bipartisanship. These four bills do  have some bipartisanship. Unfortunately, what isn't bipartisan is the  basic dispute about healthcare and about the continuation of the reform  that we on the Democratic side started some years ago with our  President.   It has turned out to be an important piece of legislation--I think  historic--and the more people look at it and the more they are covered  by it, the greater the support for it.   Unfortunately, unlike the bipartisanship in these four bills, ACA  continues to be hit by the worst kind of partisanship and continued  efforts to undermine and destroy it.   In October 2017, the administration ended cost-sharing reduction  subsidies. That has led to premium increases of 20 to 25 percent across  the Nation. In June of this year, the Trump administration expanded the  reach of junk insurance policies that have weakened the risk pool, and  these policies are not subject to consumer protections.   In July, we saw the impact of this firsthand in Michigan. The  administration announced another cut in so-called navigator  organizations. They slashed the funding from $63 million just 2 years  ago to $10 million. It had an impact throughout this country, and I saw  firsthand what it meant in the State of Michigan.   Essentially, the administration said we are going to cut and  essentially eliminate help for outreach to people in terms of their  knowing about the ACA and how, as millions of others have, they can  obtain coverage.   I think maybe most disturbing, last week, the Federal court heard  arguments in Texas v. the United States. It is a lawsuit launched by  Republicans that could jeopardize healthcare for 130 million patients  living with preexisting conditions. The Republicans like to point to  language that says that won't happen. But essentially, I think they  have their heads in the sand on this if the court were to rule in favor  of the suit. I think, to the disgrace of the administration, they  decided not to defend the government's position.   So we are here today with bipartisan bills, and it is really sad-- indeed, worse than that. We haven't had a single hearing on any of the  issues I mentioned. And the Republicans, while they come here and talk  about bipartisanship, which has been so essential until recent years  when it comes to healthcare, they now essentially are engaging in very  partisan efforts to undermine healthcare for millions and millions of  people.   So let me just say, Mr. Speaker, a brief word about this. Mr. Roskam  has been working on this for a long time, working with Mr. Blumenauer,  and I think the gentleman's efforts to strive for some bipartisanship  have been a positive.   As I said at the beginning, of all four bills, this one had the most  discussion in our committee and had some disagreement. The smart card  idea has been examined by a number of entities, including the  Government Accountability Office. According to their 2016 report--and I  have copies of their report of 2016, and there is also another report  that relates to this--according to that, their estimate was that smart  cards would help in only a minority of cases. In fact, of the 739  healthcare fraud cases that the GAO examined, only 18 would have been  fully addressed had Medicare used these cards. That is only about 2  percent of the cases.   Also, transition to smart cards is going to be significant, and the  estimate is that it is going to cost about $40 million. As we discussed  in the committee, some thought there might be a better use of this  money.   Be that as it may, this has been worked on, and Mr. Roskam and Mr.  Blumenauer have combined forces to undertake this 3-year pilot program.   So under those circumstances, wishing we had more bipartisanship on  healthcare issues that run more deeply and affect the needs of people  even more broadly, with that caveat, I do not suggest anything but  support for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further conversation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is a technical change, and it needed to be done.  The special enrollment period did not initially apply to nondeemed  enrollees. So to address this concern, CMS has promulgated regulations  allowing nondeemed enrollees to participate in this special enrollment  period.   So what this bill does is to simply codify this regulation. So it is  not clear that it is necessary to codify it, but, surely, there can be  no harm. There is a need to take action, and, therefore, I support this  bill.   As I discussed earlier on this legislation, there was bipartisan  support. I wish that that kind of bipartisanship had been spread to  issues that aren't technical and issues that involve the lives and  health of millions of people. That never has been forthcoming. The  opposite has been true.   This is an example of bipartisanship on this specific technical  issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Indiana has described very well the  purpose of this legislation. There are, I think, at least five sponsors  of this legislation, Democrats and Republicans, and it is another  example of bipartisanship on a rather technical issue, technical in  this sense.   There was always a need for regulation, and CMS proposed, now, 2  years ago, a regulation updating the requirements governing PACE.  Unfortunately, under this present administration, CMS has not finalized  these rules. What this bill essentially requires is that CMS finalize  these regulations by December 31, 2018. Hopefully, that can occur  before 2031.   We sometimes do too much on December 31 of a year. I have been here  in session a few times on December 31, I think.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill and recommend its passage, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my colleague has well described the purpose of this  legislation. As she indicated, the bill establishes a timeline through  which MACs must publish proposed LCDs online. She described what they  are so the public can be sure what MACs and LCDs are.   It would further require public meetings to review draft  determinations and ensure expert input is being sought on all  proposals.   The bill also provides that stakeholders and beneficiaries, as she  mentioned, may request reconsideration of LCDs and that MACs must  respond to these requests.   These are small but useful improvements to the local coverage  determination process. It will help improve transparency and ensure  that appropriate coverage determinations are made for Medicare  beneficiaries.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to indicate support for this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
