 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  The Baby Fold in Normal, Illinois, for being chosen as a 2021 Angels in  Adoption honoree. I nominated The Baby Fold this year because of their  passion for adoption support and services throughout my Congressional  district.   Since 1902, The Baby Fold has been transforming the lives of children  and families by focusing on the Christian values of love, hope, and  healing. They currently serve over 1,200 individuals each year across  28 different counties in Central Illinois.   The Baby Fold focuses on improving the lives of children and families  by building safe environments through adoption services, foster care to  adoption, community services, and more. The Baby Fold puts children  first so that they can be blessed with the stability and love that they  deserve.   Every day, I am grateful for adoption organizations that bring  families together, like The Baby Fold. I applaud The Baby Fold and  their volunteers for their strong dedication to children and families  throughout Illinois.       Taylorville Junior High School Awarded the National Blue Ribbon     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Taylorville Junior High School regarding their selection for the  National Blue Ribbon from the U.S. Department of Education.   The National Blue Ribbon is awarded to schools for their academic  achievement or their progress in closing the achievement gaps among  student subgroups.   Mrs. Jessica Miller, the principal at the time of the nomination, and  assistant principal, Mrs. Jennifer Wise, led several building  initiatives that improved academic performance and emotional growth by  investing in professional development, creating a community of  learners, and meeting the emotional needs of students.   The national recognition is also the result of the collective efforts  of the building administration, teachers, support staff, and the entire  Taylorville  [[Page H5684]]  community. I would like to personally congratulate both the Taylorville  Junior High School and its administrators and teachers for their  commitment and dedication to the improvement of public education for  the students in my hometown of Taylorville.               Congratulating Ken Leonard on His 400th Victory     Mr. Speaker, I would like to  congratulate my friend, Ken Leonard, on reinforcing his Illinois high  school football legacy by becoming the only coach in Illinois history  to record 400 wins as a high school football coach.   Ken is currently the head coach at the dominant powerhouse Sacred  Heart-Griffin in Springfield, Illinois. This achievement actually adds  to Coach Leonard's impressive list of accomplishments.   Ken has held the record for career wins in Illinois since 2018 and  has led the SHG Cyclones to five State championships and three State  runner-up trophies. Coach Leonard holds an overall record of 400 wins  and 80 losses throughout his 42 seasons as a head coach.   Ken began coaching at Sacred Heart-Griffin in 1984, and throughout  his tenure at SHG, Coach Leonard is credited with creating a winning  culture and inspiring countless young lives. Ken's place in Illinois  high school football has already been cemented but will forever be  cemented more with this victory.   Ken, and your entire coaching staff, and the SHG community,  congratulations on this historic win, and we are looking forward to  many more.                            ____________________
