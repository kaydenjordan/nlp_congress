 Madam Speaker, I thank the ranking member for  the time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.J. Res. 90, but I rise  in support of the Community Reinvestment Act. And I rise in support of  the goal of CRA, for a fair and more equitable treatment of financial  investment, particularly in low- and moderate-income areas of our  communities.   This resolution overturns the updated Community Reinvestment Act  regulation before it has even had a chance to take effect.   Speaking purely from a procedural standpoint, this resolution, in my  view, Madam Speaker, is not necessary. We could be spending time on the  House floor today in a much more productive way to advance the economy.   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has gone through a  rigorous Administrative Procedure Act process. I think our constituents  should know they have conducted outreach since 2017, 3 years, and have  taken all that into consideration, the Federal Reserve data, Treasury  recommendations, and have conducted both advanced notice for proposed  rulemaking and a notice of proposed rulemaking, and received 7,500  comments.   The final rule ended up incorporating much of this serious and  constructive criticism received from all stakeholders, notably, our  community groups.   Banks have been complying with the Community Reinvestment Act for  years. This is not a new rule, Madam Speaker. This rule is simply being  updated to reflect the current economic and banking conditions in our  country. The last time that was updated was 1995.   Working for a publicly traded bank in Arkansas then, I was involved  in the training and the implementation at that bank for those 1995  revisions.   Madam Speaker, as one of the few Members of Congress who has actually  gone through multiple CRA examinations, I can assure my colleagues that  this rule could benefit from a thoughtful update.   The final rule clarifies what counts for CRA credit. It updates what  bank activity counts for CRA credit. It evaluates the CRA performance  of our financial institutions in a much more fair, open manner. It  makes CRA reporting more transparent and faster. It reflects the  fintech community of digital banking in our country today. And it  enhances CRA for rural areas and Tribal areas in our country.    In short, the bank branch issue that the ranking member mentioned is  serious. We have had a shrinking number  [[Page H2575]]  of banks since the original rule was proposed in 1977, and the CRA rule  was connected to those bank branches. That is another reason for  modernizing the rule.   Since we created this bank branch closure system by our economy  contracting the number of banks, due to regulation and the like, it is  a double whammy, so let's make sure that our banks can get credit for  doing a good job on accessing of all of our communities, particularly  our minority, low-to-moderate income, and rural areas served by those  institutions.   Let's fix this problem by having the certainty that we have an  effective CRA rule, that it is implemented properly, and that we can  all see our constituencies benefited by that.   Let's let the Comptroller of the Currency do their job. They are the  banking experts. They are the ones who have been managing this work.  Congress should not be undermining it.   Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for the time, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no'' on the resolution but support the work of the  Community Reinvestment Act.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Monsignor  J. Gaston Hebert's 60th ordination as a priest as well as to salute his  lasting contributions to our Catholic diocese in Arkansas.   He was baptized and received his First Communion at St. Mary Church  in Hot Springs, where he also celebrated his first mass as an ordained  priest in 1960.   I was privileged to have Monsignor Hebert as my teacher at Catholic  High School in Little Rock, where he served as an English and drama  teacher from 1960 to 1965.   Even after he retired from serving as the pastor of Christ the King  Church in Little Rock for 20 years, he continued to serve the diocese  in Arkansas as vicar general under Bishop Andrew McDonald and  Archbishop J. Peter Sartain. And again, importantly, as our diocesan  administrator from 2006 to 2008, prior to the Holy Father's appointment  of Bishop Anthony Taylor.   Monsignor Hebert has served our community faithfully, and I thank him  for his love, dedication, and years of service.   Madam Speaker, we miss seeing him and are forever grateful.                            ____________________
