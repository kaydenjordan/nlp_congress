 Madam Speaker, this is a historic day. We have finally  found a tax that Members and my friends on both sides of the aisle  agree needs to be cut.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of today's legislation, and I am excited  that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle as well are  prepared to get rid of this destructive tax that was put in place by  ObamaCare.                                time  1645    But while we are at it, while we are repealing ObamaCare taxes, we  should include an equally destructive tax in today's repeal: the  medical device tax.   I am very proud to serve the residents of Warsaw in northeast  Indiana, the region that is often referred to as the orthopedic capital  of the world. Unfortunately, companies in my district and all across  this country have been needlessly hampered by the inability of this  Congress to fully and permanently repeal the onerous medical device  tax. When it was enforced, this tax destroyed 29,000 jobs and caused a  $34 million reduction in investments in lifesaving research and  development.   So today, while we are here voting on this bipartisan legislation to  repeal the Cadillac tax, I ask that all Members of this body be equally  mindful in moving swiftly to also repeal the medical device tax.
