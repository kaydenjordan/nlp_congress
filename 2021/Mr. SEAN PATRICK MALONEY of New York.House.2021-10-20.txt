 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend  and colleague from New York for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on my bill, H.R. 767. It honors the life  of the late Congressman Benjamin A. Gilman. It enshrines his storied  career in public service at the Fulton Street Post Office in  Middletown, New York. Ben Gilman was a true statesman and a tireless  representative to the people of the Hudson Valley.   Mr. Speaker, when I was first elected, I was told I should try to be  like Ben, to try to fill the shoes of this giant and  [[Page H5693]]  carry on his great tradition of public service and delivering results.   Ben was nothing less than an American patriot. He was born in  Poughkeepsie in 1922. He served in the Army Air Corps in World War II.  He flew 35 combat missions over Japan and earned the Distinguished  Flying Cross. After the war, he graduated from the Wharton School and  from New York Law School. He went on to be an assistant New York  attorney general in the 1950s, a lawyer in private practice, and then  found a calling in public service as a New York assemblyman from 1966  to 1972, and, of course, became my community's representative in  Congress for the next 30 years after that.   He was often called ``Gentle Ben'' because of his remarkable  humility. And because he elevated constituent service to an art form,  Ben was beloved throughout my district, never missing a pancake  breakfast with farmers or firefighters. But as chairman of the  Committee on Foreign Affairs, he was known on the world stage and  deeply respected by allies and adversaries alike.   He was called a moderate then, but that just meant he rose above the  fray and political parties and did the right thing, always putting his  people first. Above all, of course, he was a father and a husband, and  he loved his family. We pray for his widow, Georgia, even as we honor  his public career in this House.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a distinguished veteran, a congressional  ambassador, larger-than-life figure, and fellow New Yorker, I urge my  colleagues to support and pass H.R. 767 to immortalize Ben Gilman's  legacy at the Fulton Street Post Office in his home of Middletown, New  York.                                time  1245
