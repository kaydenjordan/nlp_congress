 That is correct. I know of no further questions on our  side.    Oh, I am sorry.    Mr. President, I am pleased to join the majority  leader's request.   January 6 was a day of fear for those who work here in the Capitol  and of sadness for many more watching from afar, but that awful day  also introduced our Nation to a group of heroes whom we in Congress  were already proud to call our colleagues and to whom we owe a great  debt.   In the face of lawlessness, the officers of the U.S. Capitol lived  out the fullest sense of their oaths. If not for the quick thinking and  bravery of Officer Eugene Goodman in particular, people in this Chamber  may not have escaped that day unharmed. Officer Goodman's actions  reflect a deep personal commitment to duty and brought even greater  distinction upon all of the brave brothers and sisters in uniform. So I  am proud the Senate has taken this step forward, recognizing his  heroism with the highest honor we can bestow.   (Applause, Senators rising.)
