 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hensarling for his  leadership, and especially a thank-you to the gentlewoman from New York  (Ms. Tenney), my friend, for her outstanding leadership on this issue;  and I rise in support of her legislation, the Community Institution  Mortgage Relief Act.   Homeownership is part of the American Dream; however, an ill- conceived rule promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  has made it harder for Americans to purchase a home.   In typical one-size-fits-all Washington bureaucrat fashion, the  Bureau's rule places excessive escrow and mortgage servicing  requirements on the backs of smaller community financial institutions  and mortgage servicers.   What the Bureau missed is that these lenders are rarely in subprime  lending and frequently hold the loan in portfolio for the term of the  loan. This means these lenders have a very strong incentive to ensure  that taxes and insurance premiums are being paid because they are  taking on 100 percent of the downside risk if the borrower fails to  hold up their side of the deal, and, therefore, an escrow account isn't  necessary.   However, as a direct result of the rule, there is less consumer  choice and more expense. That is because many community financial  institutions are leaving the market or have been forced to charge home  buyers more so they can afford to hire the extra professional staff  they need to comply with this rule.   For these reasons, I support the Community Institution Mortgage  Relief Act, which exempts community financial institutions with assets  of $25 billion or less from much of the regulatory burden of the  Bureau's rule.   Again, I want to thank my good friend from New York, Congresswoman  Claudia Tenney, and our chairman, Congressman Jeb Hensarling, for their  leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to vote for the  Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   I am paying special attention to this legislation, and I take pause  when I see bills like H.R. 3971 that are just a small part of  Republicans' relentless attack on the work of the Consumer Bureau.   The Consumer Bureau's work on high-cost loans and consumer  protections for them was well thought through and the result of careful  research.   Leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, many looking to fulfill the  American Dream and purchase a house were convinced to take out higher  cost loans without any regard for their ability to repay. They were  sold false promises about the costs of their mortgage without adequate  information and protections.   The Consumer Bureau took years to talk to experts, hear from  advocates, and do the research to come up with a strong rule to prevent  those types of abuses from occurring again, while also providing  regulatory relief to banks that serve rural and underserved  communities. So let me take pause and, again, focus everyone on rural  and underserved communities.   I am oftentimes appalled by the fact that we have too many  legislators who represent rural communities and underserved  communities, but when it comes to looking out for their financial  interests, they are not doing it. Yet they go back to these communities  and they talk about all the other kinds of issues. They talk about  people who are not saluting the flag properly. They will talk about  freedom of choice issues, and they will rally folks around everything  except their financial interests.                                time  1300    If rural communities are being hurt, oftentimes it is because the  very people who say they represent them are  [[Page H9804]]  not, indeed, representing them, and we can see this in this kind of  discussion.   So, again, we are focused on making sure that rural and underserved  communities are served properly, that they are not thrown to the wolves  and thrown into situations where they can't be paid attention to after  they take out these loans.   When they take out these loans, they need servicers who are trained,  servicers who are committed, servicers who understand why rural and  underserved communities need special protection, and who will work with  them, who will contact them, who will work with them to work out  situations where loan modifications may be required or requested.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to continue to oppose. I understand that  there are others who would like to open this up, and I reserve the  balance of my time.
