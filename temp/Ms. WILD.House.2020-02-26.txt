 Madam Speaker, as we mark Public Schools Week, I want to  recognize the extraordinary educators across my community and our  country.   In spite of deep, systemic inequities we face in funding for our  public schools and this administration's proposed further cuts, there  are efforts in every school district to teach and support our young  people in every aspect of their lives:   Programs like the Allentown School District's partnership with Lehigh  Carbon Community College, which allows students to earn an associate's  degree before leaving high school.   Initiatives like the efforts in Bethlehem School District to provide  universal screening for students' mental health challenges and to  increase community involvement.   Robust arts education programs like those featured in the Freddy  Awards, hosted each year by the State Theatre in Easton, recognizing  exceptional high school theater departments across the region.   Vital services like the food pantry in East Stroudsburg School  District to support food insecure students, and business education  projects like a coffee shop run by students in the same district,  providing those students an invaluable experience.   When we invest in public education, we invest in our common future as  a country. Let us commit to making those investments full and  equitable.                            ____________________
