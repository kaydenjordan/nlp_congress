 Mr. Speaker, first let me thank my good friend  Representative Carter from the great city of Savannah and the great  State of Georgia for his vision to have this time to honor a true  statesman, a legend in the State of Georgia, Zell Miller.    It is sad that we wait until someone has left this life to sing their  praises and to recognize the tremendous impact that they have had not  only on our lives, but our children and their future lives. That really  defines Zell Miller.   I never had the opportunity to work directly with Zell Miller or even  serve with Zell Miller, although I served with other Governors, but I  knew of Zell Miller. I think that says a lot about someone that, even  though you don't personally know them but you know of them, signifies  the impact that they are having on lives.   Zell Miller's death was a tremendous blow for a lot of people in our  State. I knew of him from my involvement in politics, and I knew as  Representative Carter said, that he was one of the few, if not only, to  be a keynote speaker at both the Democrat and Republican National  Conventions. That means he was truly bipartisan.   What does that mean? Well, it doesn't seem to mean a lot today, but  what it meant back then was: I care more about the people of the State.  I care more about the people of this Nation and defending the rights  and liberties and those things from which I believe in than I do a  single party.   That was Zell Miller.   If you were to go to the place where Zell was laid to rest, you would  see a headstone. As you see on most headstones, you will find the date  of his birth, February 24, 1923. There will be a dash, followed by the  date of his death, March 23, 2018. What is interesting, it isn't the  date of his birth or the date of his death that matters, but it is the  dash in between those dates that really matters.   I think it is important that we ask ourselves: What are we going to  do with that dash? Because we have all been given a dash. Zell Miller  used that dash for the good and the rights of people. You see, his dash  continues today as, literally, thousands of Georgians were able to  complete or actually receive a college education because of his vision  for the HOPE Scholarship, which is still alive and well today. That  dash is part of their lives and their future and their children's  lives.   Another part of that dash in Zell Miller's life was the titles that  he obtained. I believe titles say a lot about us and say a lot about  what we do. His titles included mayor, because he was mayor of the town  of Young Harris. He was Lieutenant Governor. He was Governor.   Another title that he proudly used, as my good colleague Buddy Carter  uses, he was a Georgia Bulldog. And for those of you who aren't from  Georgia, it is not d-o-g. It is d-a-w-g, dawg.   But also, from knowing of this incredible gentleman, there is another  title that I believe if we were to talk to him today, it wasn't mayor,  Lieutenant Governor, Governor, or even U.S. Senator that he would be  most proud of of his accomplishments. It would be that of a United  States Marine.   You see, his dash is a dash that is living on because of the lives  that it affected for so many people. And while so much has been said  about Zell Miller, let me close my remarks by saying this: There are  very few people today who, across our globe or even across our country,  can be categorized as a true statesman. One of those is Paul Coverdell.  When Paul Coverdell died in office, the Governor of the State of  Georgia at that time looked for another statesman to fulfill that seat  that was vacated by Paul Coverdell's death, and that statesman was Zell  Miller.   If there is one thing that we can gather from all of these tremendous  stories that we heard about Zell Miller today, it is that he loved his  country. He loved his State. He loved the people of this country. He  loved his God, and he fought for those principles and ideas that he  believed in. Even though he may have disagreed with others on certain  policy issues, Zell Miller was a statesman who believed in liberty. He  believed in freedom for all, and his life is a legacy.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that one day when I am laid to rest that that  dash between my birth and my death will just have a portion of the  meaning of that of Zell Miller.                          Honoring the Inman Family     Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank, again, my dear  colleague and friend from Savannah, Georgia, for yielding me this time  and allowing me to honor another Georgian who passed 18 years ago.   It was 18 years ago, in June, as Georgia heat blanketed the Inman  family as they packed their car for a family getaway in the mountains  of north Georgia. It was the Friday before Father's Day when Billy and  Kathy Inman, the parents of their son, Dustin, and their family dog set  off to go on a fishing trip for the weekend. As they headed north,  making their way along the wooded, hilly highways that make up that  part of my home State, they stopped at a traffic light in the little  town of Ellijay, Georgia.                                time  1845    As they waited for the light to turn green, the Inman family's lives  were suddenly and tragically changed. Traveling well over the speed  limit at 62 miles an hour, a car driven by Gonzalo Harrell-Gonzalez  slammed in the rear of the Inmans' vehicle. The tremendous impact  knocked Billy and Kathy unconscious.   Kathy, Dustin's mom, remained in a comma for 5 weeks. When she  finally regained consciousness, she learned that the injuries she  sustained in that wreck were so severe she would be wheelchair-bound  for the rest of her life. But more tragically, she was told the  heartbreaking news that her son, Dustin, was killed by that tremendous  impact. Within seconds, their lives were forever changed by the driver  who slammed into the rear of their car.   And while Kathy would not recover from her injuries nor would they  ever see the smiling face of their dear son again, they could at least  ensure justice was served. But soon they would learn that even that  would slip through their hands.   The car that killed their son, Dustin, and permanently disabled his  mother was driven by Gonzalo Harrell-Gonzalez, a man who had illegally  entered this country. Although illegally in this country, Gonzalez was  able to obtain a valid North Carolina driver's license, using his  Mexican birth certificate and a Mexican Matricula Consular ID card.   When local law enforcement went to the hospital to take Mr. Gonzalez  into custody, they found that he had escaped the hospital. As a  fugitive from justice, he continued to evade U.S. and local law  enforcement and soon emerged back in the streets in Mexico.   Even though the location of Mr. Gonzalez is now known by U.S. and  Mexican law enforcement, the family has not been able to get justice  for his crime. Under our treaty with Mexico, Mexico does not recognize  vehicular homicide as an extraditable offense.   The Justice Department has informed the Inman family that there is  nothing else they can do--nothing. After 18 years of grieving the loss  of their son and adjusting to a life of permanent disability for Mrs.  Inman, Mr. Gonzalez is still evading justice and has yet to pay for his  crime.  [[Page H3882]]    The tragedy can have easily been avoided if Congress had taken the  border threat and security seriously years ago. This car wreck would  have never happened, and Dustin would likely still be with us today.  Because of the severity of their injuries, Billy and Kathy were not  even able to attend their own son's funeral.   Billy will tell you that, yes, he blames the driver of the car for  the death of his son--his hunting buddy--but he also blames the  government for ignoring our open and porous borders and for allowing  someone who was here illegally to obtain a driver's license.   While there have been many speeches given in this Chamber on  immigration, we have yet to be able to have a vote or even have a  debate on what the majority of Americans are demanding, what the  President has committed to, and what we as a legislative body should  do, and that is to secure our borders.   How many more innocent victims such as Dustin Inman, Kate Steinle,  and Sarah Root--and the list goes on and on--must die before we start  taking the safety and security of American citizens seriously and  prioritize securing our borders?   Not only are our borders a thoroughfare for human trafficking, they  are also a distribution channel for cartels that smuggle contraband,  dangerous drugs, and weapons that make their way into our communities.  They are a portal for dangerous gangs such as MS-13 that bring terror,  drugs, and murder to our streets.   For too long, we have chosen partisan politics over doing what is  reasonable and right, and we put our families' livelihoods at  tremendous risk. It is beyond time to take action. It is time for  Congress to act. It is time for us to enforce our laws, and it is time  to secure our borders, not for our own political victories, but for  families such as Billy and Kathy Inman.
