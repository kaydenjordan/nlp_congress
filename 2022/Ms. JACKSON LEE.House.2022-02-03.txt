 Madam Speaker, this morning at the National Prayer  Breakfast, the outstanding speakers of President Joe Biden, Vice  President Kamala Harris, and Bryan Stevenson combined together to say,  Use your faith to make a difference. Let me applaud the President of  the United States.   And in this month of February, where we typically honor African  Americans and the history of how they contributed to this Nation, the  President announced that he would nominate to the United States Supreme  Court an African-American woman, a Black woman.   Since 1789, March 4, was when the Supreme Court first organized,  there has never been one of the major elements of society--first, a  woman, and then a Black woman, who, of course, in slavery, suffered  alongside of men and children. Black women continued, in essence, to be  subordinate. Continuing as domestics, fighting in wars, supporting  families, and intellectually some of the smartest geniuses around. They  were in fact ready to be on the Supreme Court.   They won't have a ``woke'' agenda. There won't be a question of  whether they know a law book. Let me just say, it is time for a Black  woman on the United States Supreme Court. Do it now. I thank the  President.                            ____________________
