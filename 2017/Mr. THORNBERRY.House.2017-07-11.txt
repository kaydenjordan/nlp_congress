 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Armed Services be authorized to file a supplemental report  on the bill, H.R. 2810.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.                            ____________________
