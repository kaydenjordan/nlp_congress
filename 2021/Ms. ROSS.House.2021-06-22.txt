 Mr. Speaker, I rise today also to highlight this critical  bill that will help North Carolinians.   This commonsense legislation will revise North Carolina's judicial  district lines to place Fort Bragg, one of the largest military  installations in the world, entirely within the eastern district.  Currently, the district lines bisect the base, resulting in unnecessary  administrative and logistical problems for the people of our State.   This legislation will ease the burden of traveling miles to Durham,  Greensboro, or Winston-Salem and, instead, let servicemembers resolve  court matters in nearby Fayetteville or Raleigh. A similar  redistricting occurred several years ago when Congress moved Butner  into the eastern district.   This bipartisan piece of legislation will benefit our servicemembers  and their families.   I am honored to work with my North Carolina colleagues, Congressman  Hudson, Senator Tillis, and Senator Burr, my colleague from law school  class, and the entire delegation to get this bill across the finish  line. I am pleased it passed out of the Senate, and I look forward to  passing it in the House and having it signed into law by the President.
