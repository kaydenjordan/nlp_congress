 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 375) to designate the Federal building and United States  courthouse located at 719 Church Street in Nashville, Tennessee, as the  ``Fred D. Thompson Federal Building and United States Courthouse''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 375         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. DESIGNATION.         The Federal building and United States courthouse located       at 719 Church Street in Nashville, Tennessee, shall be known       and designated as the ``Fred D. Thompson Federal Building and       United States Courthouse''.       SEC. 2. REFERENCES.         Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper,       or other record of the United States to the Federal building       and United States courthouse referred to in section 1 shall       be deemed to be a reference to the ``Fred D. Thompson Federal       Building and United States Courthouse''.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) and the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Johnson) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.                                time  1715                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 375.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 375.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Pennsylvania?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 375 would designate the Federal building and United  States courthouse located in Nashville, Tennessee, as the Fred D.  Thompson Federal Building and United States Courthouse.   I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn)  for her leadership on this legislation.   Senator Thompson was respected for his work as a lawyer, an actor,  and as a United States Senator. This legislation is a fitting tribute  that I am honored to bring to the floor today.   Fred Thompson first made a name for himself as an assistant U.S.  attorney from 1969 to 1972. That experience brought him to the national  stage in his subsequent position as special counsel on a number of  Senate committees, most notably as minority counsel with the Senate  Select Committee on Presidential Campaign Activities, better known as  the Watergate Committee.   It was then-Counsel Thompson who helped frame Senator Howard Baker's  now famous question, ``What did the President know, and when did he  know it?'' in regards to the Watergate controversy. Thompson himself  asked an even more important question related to the existence of taped  conversations in the Oval Office--tapes that led to President Nixon's  eventual resignation.   After returning to the private practice of law in Nashville, Thompson  represented the chairperson of the State Parole Board who unearthed a  cash-for-clemency scheme involving the then-Governor of Tennessee. This  case was eventually made into a book and into the film ``Marie.'' Fred  Thompson was cast to play himself, which launched his acting career.  Throughout the 1990s, Fred Thompson appeared in supporting roles in  some of the decade's biggest movies, including ``Days of Thunder,''  ``The Hunt for Red October,'' and ``Die Hard 2.''  [[Page H1548]]    In 1994, Fred Thompson ran for political office for the first time  and was elected to fill the remaining 2 years of Vice President Al  Gore's Senate term. He was re-elected in 1996 to a full 6-year term and  served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs  until his retirement in 2002.   That didn't slow Senator Thompson down. He returned to acting and won  the role of New York District Attorney Arthur Branch on the hit NBC  show ``Law & Order'' between 2002 and 2007. It was in 2007 that Senator  Thompson returned to politics by announcing his candidacy for the  United States Presidency. Although his return to the political realm  was unsuccessful, Senator Thompson's popularity did not wane. He  returned to acting on screen and on TV, wrote a memoir, and appeared  often to comment on politics. Tragically, in 2015, Senator Thompson  died from a recurrence of lymphoma.   Senator Thompson was a man of many talents. Through it all, he never  lost his roots as a Tennessean. Given Senator Thompson's dedication to  the law and public service, I believe it is more than fitting to name  this courthouse and Federal building in Nashville after him.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 375.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1174) to provide a lactation room in public buildings, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1174         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues for their work on bringing  this bill to the floor today.   H.R. 1174 is a straightforward bill that would make nursing rooms  available to new mothers in public buildings. The bill would apply to  buildings already open to the public and which already have nursing  rooms for employees. The requirements would not apply if existing space  cannot feasibly be repurposed.   This is a good bill that will make the lives of nursing mothers  easier and will improve the accessibility of public buildings.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Comstock).

The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
