 Mr. President, I want to begin by joining with so many  of our colleagues and leaders around the country expressing our  condolences to the victims of the senseless shootings in Atlanta  yesterday, in sharing our thoughts and prayers to their families and  friends. Our heart goes out to the greater community, and, of course,  we stand here to not only try to understand better what happened, how  it happened, but do the work necessary to try to ensure that it doesn't  happen again--not in Atlanta, not anywhere in the United States of  America.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs be discharged from further consideration  of S. 344 and it be referred to the Committee on Armed Services.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 121, submitted earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 1276, which was received  from the House and is at the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the Tester-Moran substitute  amendment be considered and agreed to.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. Thursday,  March 18; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be  deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day and  morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of morning  business, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the nomination of Xavier Becerra to be Secretary for  Health and Human Services; further, that the postcloture debate time on  the Becerra nomination expire at 12 noon; that if confirmed, the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; finally, that  upon disposition of the Becerra nomination, the Senate resume  consideration of the nomination of Martin Walsh to be Secretary of  Labor and that the cloture motion with respect to the Walsh nomination  ripen at 1:30 p.m.    Finally, for the information of Senators, we expect two  rollcall votes during Thursday's session of the Senate in relation to  the Becerra and Walsh nominations.                            ____________________     Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.
