 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the expanded Child  Tax Credit and Federal unemployment assistance included in the American  Rescue Plan.   In my State of Nevada and across the country, hardworking families  are suffering. The United States has lost more than 10 million jobs  since the beginning of this pandemic, with a particularly devastating  effect on women and people of color. Americans need help, and they are  counting on the Members of this body to deliver.   Interestingly, my colleagues on the other side say this bill does not  have bipartisan support.   Whom are they listening to?   Seventy-six percent of Americans support this bill, including 60  percent of Republicans. So I would urge my colleagues on the other side  to actually listen to their constituents and to deliver on their  behalf.   In just a 2-week period, more than 8 million American children go  hungry because their families can't afford enough to eat. That should  not happen in the wealthiest country on Earth. By passing an expanded  Child Tax Credit, we can bring millions of children above the poverty  line and put money in their parents' pockets.   By passing my legislation to increase and expand Federal unemployment  insurance, we will provide critical relief to those who have lost their  jobs in this pandemic.   So while we are working to recover and rebuild, we must invest in the  American people. Stop the lies and listen to your constituents.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the working families  who are counting on Congress to pass this American Rescue Plan. America  is strong. American families are resilient, and American families are  counting on this body to do its job.   Earlier this week, Morning Consult and Politico released polling  showing that the American Rescue Plan earns support from 76 percent of  Americans, including 60 percent of Republicans.   For months, my Republican colleagues have waged a campaign of  misinformation against the new coronavirus relief package, but the  American people know the toll that this pandemic has taken, and they  are united around the need for this bill to pass.   This bill will invest millions in public health to make sure every  community gets the COVID-19 vaccine. It will deliver $1,400 stimulus  checks to most Americans, following up on the $600 payment we made last  December. It will extend the employee retention tax credit to keep  workers on payroll and create new jobs. It will provide critical  assistance to frontline workers, struggling families, and the  communities that have been hardest hit by this pandemic.    I am proud to cast my vote and to listen to my  constituents.   Ranking member, please do not talk about the seniors in my district.
