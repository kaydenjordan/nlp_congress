 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   First of all, I thank Chairwoman Kay Granger and Ranking Member  DeLauro for working together as much as possible. I certainly would  thank our chairman,   David Joyce. I know we have some disagreements,  but at the end of this process, we are going to be working together  making sure that the Homeland Security bill passes in a bipartisan way.   Democrats and Republicans had a deal when we passed the debt bill  some months ago. Now our colleagues, the House Republicans, are backing  away from this deal and yielding to some extreme demands that will not  help border security.   Now the House remains in chaos as the Republicans have been  infighting and that will all but guarantee a government shutdown at the  hands of the far right in just a few days. Instead of working on a  bipartisan continuing resolution that will keep the government open,  one that will pass both Chambers and be signed into law, we are here  talking about bills that are not going to go very far in the Senate.   Again, I want to make sure that people understand that we want to  work together. We want to make this a bipartisan bill to get it done.   As the ranking member of Appropriations Homeland Security  Subcommittee and as a Member that actually lives on the border, I am  very concerned about ensuring that the border is secure and that the  Department has the resources it needs to do that successfully. Instead  of that, what are we doing? If we have a shutdown, we are going to have  over 226 folks, employees from the Department of Homeland Security,  that are going to continue to work for a period of time and not get  paid, and, again, that is not the way to create morale for our Border  Patrol and other agents that we have down there at the border.    I strongly support the hiring of additional agents, but, if there is  a shutdown, what is going to happen is that this will prevent us from  onboarding the anticipated 150 additional agents in October. It would  also stop the recruitment and vetting efforts that impact CBP ability  to onboard additional agents later on. We cannot have a shutdown, and  we have got to make sure that we work together to prevent the shutdown  itself.   Now, if you look at the bill itself, the proposed bill, let's look at  a couple of things. Yes, we did have some bipartisan investments and  oversight requirements that we worked together on, but there are  certain funding decisions and policy riders that I cannot support at  this moment.   We have to understand the border. Some of my colleagues don't  understand the border, and they call it a war zone. If my colleagues  look at the criminal records or the criminal figures that we have,  whether it is murder, rape, assault, the border is actually safer than  so many other parts of the country. In fact, Washington, D.C., is about  two or three times more dangerous, if you want to look at those  figures, than the border community.   Now, when it comes to migration issues, yes, we do have a problem,  and we do need to address it, but I think we need to stop playing  defense on the 1-yard line, which is the U.S.-Mexico border.   What we need to do is extend the perimeter where we can work with  partners like Mexico, Central America, South America to make sure that  we provide that perimeter and stop folks before they come over to our  border itself. This bill has some very outdated strategies, and one of  them I know doesn't work, and I will call that the 14th century  solution to a 21st century problem, which is the border wall. We are  spending $2.1 billion, or we intend to spend $2.1 billion on a wall  that really doesn't stop. If I can show you some of the figures, I will  explain why.   If you look at the border wall, you will see that the fence is in  many parts of the border itself, but if you see the heat maps where  people are coming into the border, it is usually where the border fence  is at.   If I can show south Texas as an example, you will see that, in south  Texas, you have a fence, and if you see the heat map, we have a fence  here, we have a fence here, we have a fence here, we have a fence  there, we have a fence there, and so on, but the activity is where the  fence is at.   Let me explain why. If you look at the fence, we have a river. The  middle of the river is actually the U.S. boundary with Mexico. We don't  have a fence there. If you look at the riverbanks, we don't have a  fence there also because it is going to get washed away.   What we do is we actually put a fence about a quarter of a mile or  sometimes even a half a mile away, and what happens, you see the fence  here, the one in the red itself, and then you see the river over here.  Instead of having a fence over here, it is actually put a quarter mile  or a mile away. Therefore, what happens when you have this situation?   Well, first of all, if you are asking for asylum, like most people  are asking, you are going to see people that will touch the riverbank.  They walked half a mile or a quarter of a mile to the fence over here  and asked for asylum, so does the fence stop them? No, it doesn't.   If you asked all those landowners, they will say, you are ceding away  thousands and thousands of acres of good farming land, good ranching  land, because you put the fence here and the river is over here.   Again, if you want to stop drugs, I know we added some money for  technology, but we have got to have the money at the ports of entry  where 90 to  [[Page H4630]]  94 percent of the meth, the fentanyl, the cocaine are coming in,  instead of through this particular area   Again, this bill also has no funding for USCIS that would help reduce  the backlog of the migration, so the people that have been waiting for  a while, we are not putting any resources in for the USCIS. We have got  to make sure that we help the folks who are trying to come in the legal  way.   We do lose a lot of opportunities. We can do a lot more to add money  to counter the fentanyl, the opioids. Again, most drugs will come in  through the ports of entry, and that is where we need to put the focus.   Finally, also, we should have an updated border security improvement  plan.   Again, I certainly want to work with my good friend, Mr. Joyce. We  are going to be together later on in the process. I know we have got  some disagreements, but we will get there.   With that, I hope that we have a good bipartisan bill at the end of  the process.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Jeffries), the distinguished Democratic leader.    Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the distinguished ranking member of the  Committee on Appropriations.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Trone), a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Ramirez).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close, and we have no  further speakers.   Mr. Chair and to my good colleague, Mr. Joyce, we are apart right  now. I know we are going to get together, but I do want to remind some  of our colleagues that we had an opportunity under the current bill  that we have right now. We added in the last couple years $2.4 billion.  That is a 15 percent increase for border patrol agents, pay increases,  add more Border Patrol agents, ICE, CBP, the other folks in.   We had the moneys to do that, but at the end of the day--and I will  just take one example--we gave money to Homeland, a 15 percent  increase, yet there are only two Members--when we all voted--on the  Republican side that actually supported the appropriations bill,  Homeland. So if we care so much about Homeland, why did we vote ``no''  on the final appropriations bill?   I know some of us are going to vote ``no,'' and I am voting ``no'' on  this one, but on the final one, I will support the final appropriations  bill.   The other thing is as the Democratic leader, Mr. Jeffries, said, we  have 3 days to work this out, and by passing this bill to the Senate it  is not going to get there. I would just like to remind Members that we  ought to be working on preventing the shutdown.   If you look at the shutdowns that we have had since the 1990s, in  1995 it was a Republican House that had a 5-day shutdown. That was  November 13, 1995. On December 15, 1995, there was another Republican- led House with 21 days of a shutdown. Then on September 30, 2013,  again, for 16 days it was a Republican-led House that allowed the  shutdown. Then on January 19, 2018, another Republican-led House  shutdown lasted for 2 days. Then on December 21, 2018, there was  another Republican-led House shutdown for 34 days.   So, again, I hope that on Saturday or on Sunday at 12:01 there is not  another Republican-led shutdown. We are asking you please give us  input. Let's sit down. Let's talk about it. I have a lot of respect for  Mr. Joyce and his staff. I know we can do this together. We will be  voting ``no'' on this, but I know at the end of this process we will be  voting together on this on a ``yes'' bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I support this en bloc amendment. It contains  a series of bipartisan amendments in support of the Members' priorities  on both sides. This is the way we ought to do it--bipartisan.  Certainly, I have no objection, and I encourage adoption of this  amendment because it supports shared priorities, including counter  fentanyl detention, Border Patrol checkpoints and ports of entry,  investigations for missing and exploited children, and more technology  for the frontline officers and agents.   Mr. Chair, I support this en bloc, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished ranking member of the Financial  Services and General Government Subcommittee.   (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Lois Frankel).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Menendez).                                time  1600     Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the distinguished ranking member of  the Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and  Related Agencies.    Mr. Chair, this is a bipartisan amendment. I support it,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment.   There are already avenues for victims of crime to engage with both  the Department of Homeland Security's Victims Engagement and Services  Line or the Department of Justice's Office of Victims of Crime. The  Department of Homeland Security has protection for victims, and the  Department of Justice also has the Office of Victims of Crime.   This office would be duplicative of those efforts and would be a  waste of taxpayer dollars. We are doing that already. Frankly, when you  say this, you are basically taking the position that crime only occurs  when you have a migrant.   The stats do not support this conclusion. In fact, the Department of  Justice released a study in 2020 and found that undocumented immigrants  had substantially lower crime rates than native-born citizens and legal  immigrants across the range of felony offenses.   I don't care where the attack came from. I want to support the  victims. I want to support the victims, and that is what the Department  of Justice's Office of Victims of Crime does. Let's support that office  and provide it more funding.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment. Again, the  Department of Justice Office of Victims of Crime supports everybody.  They don't ask you where the crime came in. They will support you. This  office would be duplicative of those efforts and would be a waste of  taxpayer dollars. Let the Victims Engagement and Services Line office  and the Office of Victims of Crime do their job. Let's make sure that  they get the support.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   I understand what my colleague is talking about. We do want to make  sure that we address border issues, but we have to make sure that we  address it in the right way.   I will talk about the report. In fact, I will be happy to tell you  that I also get frustrated sometimes when we don't get the reports, and  I will be happy to work with you and with the chairman to get you that  report.  [[Page H4648]]    I will tell you that in the bill already, there is a $25 million hold  for this report. If you add another $10 million, does that make the  pain more painful?   Keep in mind that this account doesn't just fund bureaucracy. It also  funds suicide prevention efforts and other health security measures. It  funds child welfare professionals for tender-age kids in DHS custody.  It funds the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties also.   I also get frustrated when we don't get the report. If you add  another $30 million, another $40 million, will that get you there?   You mentioned the border. Keep in mind that we are concerned, and I  want to make sure that we control our border. If you want to stop  drugs, as one of our colleagues said, most drugs will come in through  ports of entry, but we are not putting the emphasis on ports of entry.    We need to do a lot more, more canines, more technology. If you want  to look at the people who are illegally here, I remind everybody that  the number one violator for visa overstays, which have been millions  over the years, has been Canada. I don't hear any of you talking about  putting a wall between the U.S. and Canada. I say that because, again,  we have to be smart on how we address it.   I invite you down to the border. I love when people come in and spend  a few hours. I live there, and I will tell you, I will take the biggest  cities in your State--I would say if you take Atlanta and, on the  border, I take Laredo, murder, rape, and assault, we have lower crime  rates than the city, per 100,000. If you look at the national crime  rate for murders, the border crime rate is lower.   We have to look at crime as one issue and then look at migration. I  am with you. I hate open borders. I want to make sure that we work  together, but we have to do this in a bipartisan way.   I feel their frustration. There are some reports I wish we could get  faster. I will work with them and the chairman to get this report to  them.   Mr. Chair, for those reasons, I oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise respectfully in opposition to this  amendment.   The U.S. Constitution grants the Federal Government the sole  authority to control immigration and secure the national borders.   I would say that if we would do this in partnership, working with the  State and local government, like we do with the program that we started  called Stonegarden where we provide funding, that would be the way to  do it. Unfortunately, there are some States that want to go solo on  doing certain things.   Let me give you an explanation. When the Governor from the State of  Texas put out the buoys, those buoys were less than a quarter of a mile  for a river that is 1,200 miles. Less than a quarter of a mile for a  river that is 1,200 miles long is like putting a postage stamp in the  middle of a football  [[Page H4649]]  field to stop a running back from crossing the 1-yard line.   The second thing is, when the Governor has talked about stopping  every truck like he is doing, what he is doing is--he said he is  inspecting every truck. I used to do the budget for the DPS. The only  thing they can do is check license plates, driver's licenses, or the  brakes and windshield wipers. They can't even open the trucks.   What they are doing is, in Eagle Pass, in El Paso, and other places,  they are stopping millions and hundreds of millions of dollars of trade  itself. Again, we want to work with the States, but you just can't go  solo on this.   Again, when you say lawlessness at the border, I would say in the  State of Texas, if you look at the most dangerous cities that we have,  none of them are on the border. I am not going to name any of my Texas  cities, but they are the big urban areas, per 100,000, where murder,  rape, and assault are a lot higher than at the border. Again, the  border is safe when we talk about crime.   On the issue of migration, I am with you. We need to have  repercussions, but we need to put money outside the 1-yard line and put  it on the 20-yard line and work with other countries.   In fact, when you look at 2015, when President Obama had the numbers  go down, it was because Mexico was stopping people. In 2019, when  President Trump was taking credit for stopping the numbers and having  the lowest crossings, do you know why? Because we got Mexico to do its  job on the southern border.   Again, we can either play defense on the 1-yard line or we can play  defense on the 20-yard line, and we have to look at this and how we  address it.   If you want to talk about crime, look at the big urban cities. Do we  want to make sure we secure the border? I am with you. We have to have  repercussions. We have to make sure that we play defense outside the 1- yard line, but we can't have a State go solo.   They want to work with us? My brother was a DPS officer for 27 years.  I want to make sure that they work with us hand in hand, and  Stonegarden does that where we provide money to the cities, counties,  and States.   We are on the same page. We are just looking at this in a very  different way.   My good friend from my State of Texas, I am with him. I just oppose  this particular amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Again, I understand where the gentleman is coming from,  but, if we look at it, even the prior administration also understood  that the way to address this issue is to put those gates there because  of the flooding.   Congress has been looking at this issue with CBP for the last 15  years, and, while it is not perfect, I do understand the prior two  administrations have come to the same conclusion, and that is: Deal  with the monsoons, the flooding, and they put those doors to make sure  that things are not washed off.   Keep in mind that we are spending about $36 million a mile for every  fence that we put up. That is $36 million a mile. With about $3 to $5  million, we can get the best technology that can include drones, that  could include sensors, that can include so much of the technology to  address that.   Again, if you spent $36 million a mile for a fence, all you need is a  $100 ladder that would take care of the problem that you have. Again, I  will show that, even in Texas, Mr. Chairman, people are concerned about  the flooding over there, and that is why the fence is put a quarter  mile or a half a mile away, so all the landowners that are over here,  they lose their property because you are putting the fence on this  side, so the renters, the property, the private right is gone because  of the fence.   All you have is the river over here. People just walk over here to  the fence and claim asylum. We have to have repercussions at the  border. Whoever is supposed to stay, stay. Whoever is supposed to be  deported should be deported.   Again, we cannot play defense on the 1-yard line, called the U.S.  border. We need to extend the perimeter out there. Again, I feel, Mr.  Chairman, that the wall might be damaged because of the water or the  flooding, but, again, the past administration--the Trump  administration, the Biden administration, and the Bush administration-- all came up with the same conclusion when they got asked to look at  this issue, and they said: You have to put doors or gates so the rain  or the floods don't wash away the fence.   Mr. Chair, I understand where my colleague is coming from, but I will  ask the floor to vote ``no.''   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1845     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment.   I trust the work of Border Patrol agents. I trust the work of OFO,  which are the men and women in blue at ports of entry. I trust the Air  and Marine agents. I trust the work of ICE agents. I trust the work of  HSI, Homeland Security agents. I trust the work that they do.   What we are looking at, what wants to be changed, is section 221 that  says that none--this is what the law is right now--none of the funds  appropriated or otherwise made available by this act may be made  available to transport aliens unlawfully present, paroled, or  inadmissible to the United States into the interior of the United  States for purposes other than the enforcement of immigration law.   It is already here. Again, I don't think we ought to be legislating  on the House floor. I think we need to get input from the agents that I  mentioned that I support: Border Patrol, OFO, Air and Marine, ICE, HSI.  I think we need to ask for it, but the law is already there. It says:  cannot go into the interior of the U.S. itself.   Mr. Chair, I stand in opposition, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise respectfully in opposition against  this amendment, but I will say this: My good friend and I share the  border. We will continue working.   I do believe in detention beds. I do believe there is a place for  them. I do believe that we should best utilize the detention beds for  the high-risk detainees, and I believe also that we should give ICE  flexibility.   I will commit to my good friend from Texas (Mr. Tony Gonzales) and to  my other good friend from Ohio (Mr. Joyce) that I will work with them  when we get in conference committee because this is not the final bill.  I will work with them on this particular language.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   Any Secretary of Homeland Security plays a very critical role in  national security. Secretary Mayorkas has served our country as U.S.  Attorney, director of USCIS, Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security and  now Secretary.   I know that we hear a lot from the other side of the aisle where they  say that the Secretary has not achieved operational control of the  border. Operational control of the border was first defined in the  Secure Fence Act of 2006, and neither the Border Patrol chief nor the  Secretary has yet declared operational control since then.   If you look at it, two Republican Presidents, Bush and Trump, neither  of them obtained operational control. Two Democrats, Obama and Biden,  also have not obtained operational control.   I know how important the Constitution is to my colleagues, and I  would ask you to say that by targeting salaries it is simply  unconstitutional, as pointed out in the United States v. Lovett, a  Supreme Court case from 1946.   If we are going to uphold the Constitution, the Court has said that  targeting salaries is not the right way. We all want to secure the  border, but targeting somebody's salary does not get us to the end that  we want to get to.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I join the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Joyce), my chairman, in strong opposition to this amendment.   CISA Director Easterly leads an organization of over 3,000 dedicated  public servants who play a critical role in our national security.   First, Director Easterly is the operational lead for Federal  cybersecurity charged with protecting and defending the Federal  civilian executive branch networks, the dot-gov we all rely on.   Second, CISA serves as the national coordinator for critical  infrastructure security and resilience, working with partners across  government and industry to make sure that we protect and defend our  Nation's critical infrastructure from bad actors.    Again, when you target somebody by name and you want to reduce their  salary, it is unconstitutional. Targeting salaries is unconstitutional,  as pointed out by United States v. Lovett, a Supreme Court case from  1946.   I join the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Joyce), my good friend, in asking  my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Joyce), my good friend, for yielding. Again, I stand in opposition to  the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs) on this amendment.   What we are looking at here is CISA Director of Election Security  plays a critical role in our national security. Director Hale has  served his role in many administrations as a career civil servant under  Republican and Democratic administrations.   Again, I say that targeting salaries is unconstitutional, as pointed  out in United States v. Lovett, a Supreme Court case from 1946. I join  my chairman, Mr. Joyce, in urging our colleagues to vote ``no.''    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment of  my friend from Arizona.   The DHS Under Secretary for the Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans  plays a critical role in our national security. The Senate confirmed  this position to do certain things. At his confirmation, Mr. Silvers  said that the Department must secure the borders. It must be relentless  in disrupting the human and drug trafficking organizations that inflict  such devastation. It must administer our immigration system securely  and humanely and must also facilitate the lawful flows of trade and  travel that power this economy.   Again, we might have some differences on how we secure the border. We  did have an opportunity the last 2 years in the Homeland appropriations  that we added $2.4 billion, a 15 percent increase, to Homeland the last  couple of years. I remind my colleagues that except for two members of  the Republican Party that are still serving, everybody else voted no on  securing the borders--hiring more Border Patrol, hiring more ICE  agents, hiring more RFO, Air and Marine, technology. Except for two  Members that are still serving on the Republican side, everybody voted  no.   If we want to secure the border, let's look at how we do that. Again,  I say this just because we might have differences on how we do it, but  to target an individual, I would assume it would violate the Bill of  Attainder Clause of the Constitution. In fact, targeting an individual  by name is unconstitutional, as pointed out in United States v. Lovett,  a Supreme Court case in 1946.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  unconstitutional amendment. If we want to have a debate on border  policy, we certainly can do that.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.  Respectfully, to my colleague, again, if we are concerned about the  security of the country, national security, border security, again, I  will remind that the last couple of years, we have added over $2.4  billion to the Homeland Security bill, and there were only two of my  Republican colleagues that are still in Congress that voted for the  increase.   If we are concerned about security and the work that we are doing-- terrorism, counterterrorism, and threat--we all should have voted for  the appropriation bill.                                time  2000    Mr. Chair, let me bring up some figures again. We know as of July  2023, just a couple months ago, 92.9 percent of the fentanyl, 93  percent of the heroin, 94.1 percent of the meth were seized at the  ports of entry and interior checkpoints.   If you look at the U.S. Sentencing Commission, 86 to 87 percent of  the people that were caught with drugs were U.S. citizens. I want to go  after anybody that brings drugs in but, again, we, as Members of  Congress, have the constitutional duty to provide oversight over the  budget. The way we provide oversight is not by targeting somebody by  name and going after their salary.   Again, this will violate the Bill of Attainder Clause in the U.S.  Constitution, and it would also be in violation of the Supreme Court  case of 1946 that we have mentioned before.   If we want to provide oversight, there is a way of doing it and it is  not targeting somebody without their due process and basically firing  that individual.   Again, if we want to go ahead and debate how much money we put in, we  can do that, but not by targeting somebody against the Constitution.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, again, this amendment violates the Bill of  Attainder Clause of the U.S. Constitution. This amendment, again, by  targeting someone by name is unconstitutional as pointed out by U.S. v.  Lovett, a Supreme Court case from 1946.   Again, I would go back. If we are so interested in border security  and national security, we had a chance to add $2.4 billion to CBP's  budget authority, an increase of 15 percent. It doesn't matter what the  vehicle was. The bottom line is some people who voted, except for two  of my Republican colleagues, voted against pay raises for Border  Patrol, the mental health services that we provided, college help also,  clothing allowance, technology, canines, everything that is so  important to border security, except for two of my colleagues who are  still in Congress.   Again, you can say that I didn't like the vehicle and this pay raise  for Border Patrol and the other help that we provided. The bottom line  is some folks voted against border security, and now we are trying to  come back to try to change the narrative.   Again, I would say that it violates the Bill of Attainder Clause of  the U.S. Constitution and the Lovett case of 1946. If we want to  provide oversight, there are ways, and I will be happy to sit down with  my colleague from Arizona and go over that.    Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, first of all, let me just say, as a point of  privilege, it is so good to see my good friend from Louisiana. Again, I  am with him all the way. I appreciate it.   We disagree on this amendment. We might agree on defunding other  things, but not this particular one.   I will say, again, in the last 2 years, we added $2.4 billion to the  CBP operation moneys. From there, we added moneys for more Border  Patrol agents, more CBP officers, new intel specialists, trade  enforcement staff, and other personnel. We added additional technology  at the ports of entry. We added initiatives that support CBP workforce,  such as suicide prevention, wellness efforts, uniform allowances,  tuition allowance, to make sure that we support our men and women in  green, in blue, and Homeland Security in general.   Again, I will say that, if we support them, except for two Members  that are still on my Republican side, all voted against supporting  Border Patrol in all this. If we are so interested, why did we vote on  $2.4 billion of moneys for Border Patrol?   Again, this is something that I would ask you to look at. Again, what  we should be focusing right now is: How do we keep our government open?  Folks said, If you pass H.R. 2, and we are going to go ahead and get  the job done. It is right in the Senate. If this bill passes the floor,  it is going to be in the Senate.   What we ought to be focusing on is: How do we keep the government  open? Again, I would remind my colleagues that, if you look at the last  five shutdowns, the House Republicans controlled the House. On November  13, 1995, the Republicans controlled the House; December 15, 1995, it  was the Republicans who controlled the House; September 30, 2013, the  Republicans controlled the House; January 19, 2018, the Republicans  controlled the House; December 21, 2018, again, the Republicans  controlled. We had shutdowns, and, again, if we are not careful, the  Republican-controlled House will have another shutdown at 12:01 this  coming Sunday.   Again, we want to work with you. We want to sit down. You know my  position. I have always said that I don't like open borders, and we  have to make sure that we secure the border. Again, people talk about  crime. I can pick any city. I will say New Orleans. If I pick New  Orleans, you will see that crime is lower per 100,000 than in my  hometown of Laredo. Rape, murder, assaults, those crimes are lower. Our  border is safe.   Now, that is on the crime part. If you want to talk about migration,  I agree we need to do more on that, but cutting somebody's salary  doesn't get us to what we need. We need to make sure that we stop  playing defense on the one-yard line, called the U.S. border.    What we need to do is to do what happened in 2015 and 2019. President  Barack Obama sat down with the Mexicans and said, Hey, you have to stop  people from coming to the border, and guess what? The numbers went  down.   In 2019, President Trump did the same thing, and asked the Mexicans,  Hey, stop the people from coming in. Guess what? The numbers came down.   We need to make sure that we put authorities--and I emphasize-- authorities for Homeland, where they can do more outside the U.S.  border, because otherwise, we are not going to see the same thing we  saw in 2015 and 2019.   We keep playing defense on the one-yard line. I want to secure the  border, but, again, if you want to stop drugs, I will say it again,  most of the drugs will be coming in--again, the latest numbers from  July of 2023, 92.9 percent of the fentanyl, 93 percent of the heroin,  94.1 of the meth were seized at the ports of entry and interior  checkpoints.   Again, I will say that, if you look at the U.S. Sentencing  Commission, 86 to 87 percent of the people that were caught with drugs  were U.S. citizens. I don't care who brings in drugs. I want to make  sure that they are put in jail.   Again, I will say this: I know that a lot of you believe in the  border wall, but if you look, this is fencing all here, and this is  where the heat map shows. Why? Because the border fence is a quarter  mile to a mile away from the river where the international border is.   Keep in mind--I agree with you--89 to 90 percent of the people asking  for asylum don't get granted asylum officers. What we ought to be doing  is sending judges and asylum officers down here to make sure that we do  our job over here.   If we need to deport somebody, I will be the first one to say, Deport  that individual, but, again, putting a wall, $36 million a mile, when  you can get $3 to $5 million for the drones.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, since 1999, the policy has been, under the  Clinton administration, under the Bush administration, and the Obama  administration, that immigration officials still consider whether a  noncitizen will become dependent on cash benefits. I agree. That has  been the policy since 1999, and I think we ought to stick with that  policy where a noncitizen should not be dependent on cash benefits.  Follow the law, and that is what we want to do under the current  policy.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, these policies, in my opinion, should be  debated in a different bill. DHS' role here is guided by the Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC. The DHS doesn't come up  with policies. They don't develop their independent policies on these  issues. Rather, they implement policies that originate with the CDC.   We can get into a debate about wearing masks or having vaccines, but,  again, I think we need to concentrate this on another bill and not on  Homeland.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, we support border security. We also support  the U.S. Citizen Immigration Service where they have asylum officers.   One of the things we ought to be doing is adding more money to  support the asylum officers so they can be at the border, and they can  make a decision whether somebody stays or has a credible fear.   We know the numbers; 89, 90 percent of the people who ask for asylum  will be denied because the law is very specific on what asylum is.   It has to be persecution by the state based on religion or based on  political beliefs. If you are coming in because you want a job, or you  are coming in for a better life, or you are coming in because of a  drought or you are hungry or because your country is falling apart, it  is not allowed under the law.   What we ought to do is make sure that Homeland has the money to  support border security. Again, I remind my friends that the last 2  years, we added $2.4 billion to the CBP budget authority, a 15 percent  increase. Except for two Members from the Republican side, everybody  voted ``no'' on it.   Again, we want to support border security. If you want to look at  fentanyl, the fentanyl will come in through two ports in Mexico, the  legal precursors.   Then they come up here, and we have to make sure that we add money  for technology to make sure that we stop the drugs coming in.   Again, I am for border security, and I want to work with you to get  to border security. Congressman Holman in 1976, the Holman Rule--keep  in mind that the Bill of Attainder Clause says no punishment without a  trial.   I believe this is in violation of Lovett in The Supreme Court in  1946; it says this type of action is unconstitutional.   Again, if we want to have a debate, let's go ahead and have a debate,  but to target somebody's salary is unconstitutional.   I agree. We need to do more to secure the border, and I certainly  want to work with my colleagues from Colorado, Ohio, and wherever you  might be from. I certainly want to work with you.   I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, the last 2 years we had an opportunity to add  $2.4 billion to the CBP budget authority. That is a 15 percent  increase.   Except for two Members, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  voted ``no''. Money for Border Patrol, money for intelligence, money  for securing the border, and they voted ``no'' on it. We had an  opportunity to vote ``yes'', and it was voted against.   Again, I would say that if we have differences, how do we address  this, by cutting somebody's salary, which is unconstitutional?   In United States v. Lovett, the Supreme Court says you can't do this.  It is due process without a trial, punishment without a trial, which is  the Bill of Attainder Clause again.   I want to secure the border, but I want to make sure that we put  funding on this. We are about to have a shutdown this Saturday.   Again, we have been asking our Republican friends to sit down, and I  am ready to sit down and work it out. If we don't do this, we are going  to be affecting so many people.   It is going to affect 43,000 U.S. Coast Guard employees, including  38,000 Active-Duty Coast Guard military personnel.   It is going to affect 59,000 CBP personnel, including Border Patrol  agents, Customs and Border Protection officers, 16,800 ICE personnel,  including HSI agents, 58,000 TSA personnel, 19,300 FEMA employees, and  6,300 Secret Service personnel. We are not focusing on what we ought to  focus on, and that is making sure that we don't have a shutdown.   Again, Members, I would remind you that the last five shutdowns, you  were in charge, and again, five--we are going to make it number six.   We want to sit down and work with you, but again, as the minority  Members, we want to sit down and be at the table.   I ask that we oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition. This particular  individual has served in senior roles throughout DHS, including as a  career official under Republican and Democratic administrations.   As a career official, she led the initial implementation of the  Prison Rape Elimination Act standards for ICE during the Trump  administration--and she was not fired under the Trump administration.  During the Trump administration she also led the development of a 2019  National Detention Standards, which is interesting because my  colleagues included it as a provision in this bill that would require  those standards to be applied to all detention facilities.   If we have a problem with policy, let's debate policy. I can tell you  we ought to be focusing on making sure that we keep the government  open. We can pass these four bills, but I can tell you there is no  Senate conference over there. They are not going to take these bills up  in the next couple of days.   Instead of focusing on what we ought to do, that is, preventing the  sixth Republican-led shutdown since 1995, we ought to be working  together instead of doing this.   This amendment violates the Bill of Attainder Clause of the U.S.  Constitution. As the U.S. Supreme Court has said in United States v.  Lovett, 1946, it is unconstitutional to target an individual.   Mr. Chair, I ask Members to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the balance  of my time    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition.    This bill on Homeland Security passed June 21, 2023. We  are in September and we are just taking the bill right now. This bill,  Homeland Security, got passed out of appropriations on June 21, 2023,  and here we are late at night trying to pass a bill where there is no  Senate conference. They are not even considering this bill, and we are  not addressing the issue before us.   The issue before us is that the last government shutdowns were under  Republican House majorities. In fact, the longest shutdown in history  was a Republican House and Senate with Trump in the White House in  2018. Again, on November 13, 1995, December 15, 1995, September 30,  2013, June 19, 2018, and December 21, 2018, Republican-controlled  Houses had a shutdown, five of them that we are looking at, and I think  we are going to have the sixth one. Again, this bill passed on June 21  of 2023, and here we are in the middle of the night trying to decide.   Instead of focusing on what we ought to do to make sure we don't have  a government shutdown, we are focusing on a bill that might pass over  to the Senate, but there is no conference committee. What are we going  to do at 12:01?   Again, if we have a problem or a difference--I should say, a  difference in policy--I am ready to sit down. I don't want to see open  borders. I want to make sure we support Border Patrol. I don't just go  visit the border; I live there. I go with Border Patrol to church, I  see them at the stores, our kids go to school together. I want to make  sure that we support our men and women in green.   This amendment is unconstitutional. When you target salaries, the  Supreme Court has already said in United States v. Lovett in 1946, it  said, the Bill of Attainder Clause to the Constitution says that you  cannot provide punishment without due process.   If we have a difference, let's debate it. You know what? We should  have been doing this on June 22, the day after we passed it. Here we  are in the middle of the night, 9:10 p.m. Eastern time, and we are  talking about passing a bill that the Senate is not even considering  right now.   Mr. Chair, I want to sit down with my good friend from Colorado and  the chairman, Mr. Joyce, but this is not the time to be talking about  taking people's salaries away.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time, and I ask Members to  vote ``no.''    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment  because I think this is a policy that should be debated in a different  context in a different bill.   DHS' role here is guided by the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, the CDC. DHS does not develop independent policies on these  issues but rather implements policies that originate within the CDC.   Again, we can have this debate, but I think we are in the wrong  jurisdiction of the bill. This is the Department of Homeland Security  bill, not the Labor-HHS bill. If we are talking about things that are  important, I would respectfully ask that we look at the date that this  Homeland bill was on--June 21, 2023.   We should have taken this bill on June 22, 2023, but here we are, at  9:30 on September 27, looking at trying to pass one of four bills to a  Senate that has not taken H.R. 2. Certainly, they are not in conference  ready to take up any of our bills.   What we ought to be focusing on is the shutdown. That is what we  ought to be focusing on. Again, I will remind my friend that the last  five government shutdowns were under a Republican House majority. We  are, again, under a House Republican majority, whether it was on  November 13, 1995, a Republican-controlled House, 5 days of a shutdown;  December 15, 1995, a Republican-controlled House, 21 days of a  shutdown; September 30, 2023, a Republican-controlled House, 16 days of  a shutdown; January 19, 2018, 2 days; and, of course, December 21,  2018, a Republican-controlled House, 34 days.   Again, we are under a Republican-controlled House. On Sunday, 12:01,  I hope we are not talking about a shutdown because, Members, we could  pass this bill. Over there, there is no Senate waiting for this. They  are working on a continuing resolution. If we have a shutdown, it is  border security that is going to be hurt because, in October, starting  next week, we are supposed to hire 150 new Border Patrol agents.   All of that will stop. Any vetting, any hiring, anything that we are  supposed to do will be shut down. Members should have done this on June  22, 2023, but here we are, at 9:33 p.m. Eastern time, where we are  debating a bill and an amendment that has nothing to do with this. It  is the wrong jurisdiction.   I say, respectfully, that we ought to be focusing on trying to keep  the government open.   Mr. Chair, I respectfully ask Members to vote ``no'' on this, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to an amendment  that prohibits funding for the Uniting for Ukraine program.   In life, we have to make a decision: Either we are for good or for  evil. Either we are for democracy or for dictatorships. This Uniting  for Ukraine program allows Ukrainians who are displaced by the Russian  invasion of Ukraine to apply to come to the U.S. through humanitarian  parole.   This amendment seeks to stop a program and block thousands of  Ukrainians from entering the country. Here, again, is an attempt to cut  any support for Ukraine as they fight to defend the country from an  illegal Russian invasion.   Putin is attempting to rewrite the map of Europe through the use of  force. He is doing so in violation of international law and is  deliberately killing civilians, destroying the economic livelihood of  Ukraine, and taking kids from Ukraine, stealing the kids, taking them  to Russia.   War crimes are being committed on a mass scale, and the United States  and the democratic nations of the world must continue to strongly  oppose him.   Again, I remind Members that this bill passed on June 21, 2023. Here  we are, at 9:40 p.m., and we are going to be here till about 2 or 3  o'clock in the morning. I don't mind working. My parents were migrant  workers who worked hard, so we can work and stay here till whatever  time, but the point I am trying to make is that instead of looking at  this bill on June 22, 2023, here we are a few days before the shutdown  and, again, I remind everyone that the last five shutdowns have been by  Republican-controlled Houses.   This Sunday, at 12:01, we will probably see the sixth Republican- controlled shutdown. Again, I want to work with the majority. I want to  work with my good friend, who is always in a good mood, Mr. Joyce. I  want to work with him on this, but you can't say: We are in the  majority. You are in the minority. You are not going to have a say.   Some of us don't just go visit the border. We actually live there. I  work with the Border Patrol. I want to support them.   I want to remind Members that we had an opportunity to put $2.4  billion, which we did add, to support Border Patrol and control the  border. Guess what? All except for two Republicans that are still in  the House of Representatives voted against border security.   Again, we have a choice. It is either good or evil. It is either a  dictatorship or a democracy. I stand for good, and I stand for  democracy, and I ask Members to vote against this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I raise a point of order.  [[Page H4691]]     Mr. Chair, haven't we done this amendment two or three  times already?   I mean, we know that the majority doesn't want to pay the salary. We  already passed--    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I guess the question I have is, we have done  this amendment three times.   Lower it down to $1. Lower it down to $1. Lower it down to $1. I  guess his salary would now be $3 dollars since we have done this three  times.   Nevertheless, I would remind Members again that the last two fiscal  years we added $2.4 billion to CBP authority. That is a 15-percent  increase. Money that would have been used to hire more Border Patrol  agents, more CBP officers, intel specialists, threat enforcement  officers, and other personnel, adding technology at the ports of entry  where 90 or 94 percent of the drugs come in.   Again, initiatives to support the morale of the CBP workforce, like  suicide prevention, wellness efforts, uniform allowances, and tuition.   Guess what? Every single Republican, except two that are still  serving, voted no to pay the Border Patrol and give them the money so  they can do the work. They voted no.   Again, here we are, at 9:50. What are we doing? Taking a bill that  passed on June 21, 2023. We are not talking about the continuing  resolution--because again, on Sunday at 12:01, we are going to have the  sixth Republican shutdown since 1995.   Again, I thank all the staff, both on the Republicans' and Democrats'  side, for working late; Capitol Police are working late. We can stay  here as long as you want to, and maybe increase it to $4 instead of $3  on the pay for the Secretary.   Mr. Chair, I would say this: We are going to have a shutdown because  we can pass this bill, or we can say we are going to strip out the H2B  visa and get some Members who are going to vote ``no.'' Whatever you  want to do, but there is no Senate waiting to handle this bill.   Mr. Chair, I say to my colleagues again, we can stay as long as we  want to. I can stay, and some of us will be here at 2:00, 3:00 in the  morning, but again, we ought to be working on a CR because we are going  to have the sixth Republican shutdown. Five in a row; you can make it  six if you don't work with us.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment respectfully, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment,  with all due respect, but I would remind folks that we can't play  defense on the one-yard line and call it the U.S. border. We have to  make sure we move the perimeter. The Secretary has to look at threats  inside and outside the United States.   Mr. Chair, I ask the gentlewoman to look at 2015.   What happened in 2015? The numbers went down under President Obama.  Why? Because we were able to go, visit, talk to other countries so they  can stop the migrants before they came to the U.S. The numbers went  down.   In 2019, under President Trump, the same thing happened. Again, we  were able to work with those countries, traveled over there, talked to  them to make sure that they are able to stop folks before they come  over here. The numbers went down.   Again, we need to do the same thing, because it is not only the  Secretary, but if you have a shutdown--and again, I remind Members at  10:00 at night, we should have been doing this debate back on June 22,  a day after the appropriations of Homeland Security passed.   But here we are, addressing something when we know there is no Senate  waiting for this bill. There is no Senate ready that has handled H.R.  2. So again, the best thing to do to avoid the sixth Republican  shutdown since 1995 is to sit down with Democrats, do it in a  bipartisan way, and address this particular issue.   Mr. Chair, a shutdown would not be helpful for anybody. I ask my  colleagues to please look at this amendment, and I urge them to reject  it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment. It  ensures that all employees across the Department have a sufficient up- to-date understanding for climate change.   If we keep in mind, one of the agencies under DHS is FEMA. What does  FEMA deal with? Climate, hurricanes. All this strategy does is it  blocks the  [[Page H4693]]  Department from studying or even understanding one of the most pressing  issues.   Again, just understand, we can't put our heads in the sand and say  there is nothing happening on that, yet in times of crisis during a  natural disaster we expect the Department to deliver on its mission and  make decisions during evolving circumstances.   All it does is understand the evolving environment. That is all.   I will vote ``no'' and encourage my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment, and I  encourage my colleagues to vote ``no.''   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.  Again, this amendment would strike a section within a proposed rule.  Proposed rules have no force of law.   If enacted, the administration would just simply rename the section  and continue to execute the fee rules as currently as they are trying  to do that.   Let's keep in mind USCIS is a fee-funded agency. Except for a small  portion, they don't get appropriations. They work on fees. We have to  find the right balance on the fees and where we add those fees.   Again, I understand what you're trying to do, but I think this  amendment  [[Page H4694]]  will strike a proposed rule, and I don't think this is the right way to  address this. I do understand what you are saying, but based on that, I  would ask that we vote ``no,'' and I encourage my colleagues to do the  same.   I would say this as the ranking member, if Chairman Joyce would want  to sit down with me, I would be happy to sit down and have this  conversation.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment, with  all due respect to my colleague, the former sheriff, as my brother is a  former sheriff on the border.   I ask that if we have differences in opinion, instead of just  eliminating this office of civil rights, I would remind our colleagues  that this Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties covers the 260,000  personnel who work for DHS. That is, it covers the 43,000 U.S. Coast  Guard employees and the 59,000 CBP personnel. That includes Border  Patrol and OFO, who are the men and women in blue. It covers 16,800 ICE  personnel, including HSI agents and immigration enforcement officers;  58,000 TSA personnel; 19,300 FEMA employees; and 6,300 Secret Service  personnel. All of those employees are under Homeland.   Again, I do understand we might have some differences, and I will be  the first one to say let's sit down and have a bipartisan conversation  to address those concerns. To eliminate the office, I would say that  would not be the right policy.   Again, I remind folks, at 10:23, that we passed the Homeland  appropriations on June 21. We should have been doing this at 10:23 on  June 22 instead of doing this tonight.   I don't think there is a conference committee on the Senate side. We  [[Page H4695]]  ought to be focusing on how to keep the government open.   With all due respect to my good friend from Texas, the former  sheriff, we might have some differences, but I will be the first one to  sit down with him and figure out how we can address these issues.   Mr. Chair, for those reasons, I ask my colleagues to oppose this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   Again, getting information from Homeland can be frustrating. I have  been frustrated, also. I agree that they should be providing  information.   Sometimes we disagree with the policy on how to secure the border.  Sometimes I disagree with my Republican friends. Sometimes I disagree  with my Democratic friends. Again, it is a difference in policy that we  can work out.   To go after a specific person by name is against the Constitution,  the Bill of Attainder Clause, where you should have due process before  this step is taken. Targeting salaries is unconstitutional, as pointed  out by the United States v. Lovett, a Supreme Court case from 1946.   There is another way to address this. I will be happy to sit down  with my good friend from Texas to address this.   Mr. Chair, at this time, I respectfully oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment, and  I urge Members to vote ``no.''   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I urge Members to vote ``no'' on this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   I urge Members to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.   This order on voting access will ensure that all Americans can  exercise their right to vote, including voters in underserved  communities; voters who are younger or older, in rural and urban areas;  servicemembers and veterans; and other folks like voters with  disabilities or language access concerns.   Madam Chair, I ask that we oppose this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   This amendment would undermine a recent effort by the Secretary--in  fact, I believe it was only announced a few days ago--to convene  private-sector experts in homeland and national security, some widely  recognized, including former senior intelligence officials, who will  provide the DHS with a wide range of views and perspectives on the  Federal Government's intelligence enterprise to DHS' I&A and the Office  of the Counterterrorism Coordinator. All  [[Page H4707]]  we are trying to do is get information from experts.   Madam Chair, I say that we vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition, with all due respect  to my good friend from Texas.   First of all, this program is not in existence, so why are we going  to try to prohibit funds for something that doesn't even exist?   One of the things that we ought to be looking at is trying to find an  expedited way of removing folks who are not supposed to be here. As I  said before, if you get 100 people before an immigration judge, you  will see that 89 to 90 percent, generally speaking, are going to be  rejected because, again, the law is very specific as to what  persecution is.   What I am hoping the administration is trying to do is to make sure  that we expedite removals. If you expedite removals, that is the  repercussion that we all have been talking about. That is the  consequence that we all have been talking about.   To say no funds will be used--for what? That program is not in. We  need to fund expedited ways to remove people who, after they have their  day in court, should be removed.   With all respect to my good friend from Texas, I urge my colleagues  to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Chair, I stand against this amendment. I am in  opposition. I support ICE. I support enforcing the law.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment, respectfully, to  my friend from Texas.   I am looking at the language, and I assume that the first executive  order that is referenced is 13678. That one deals with authority for  criminal investigators of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and  Explosives issued by President Obama, so I assume that is not the  correct one. You are probably looking at 13768, which deals with ICE.   Nevertheless, even though he is referring to the wrong one here, this  amendment is not doing what I think he intends to do. All I am saying  is I trust ICE to prioritize and limit their resources where they can  focus on the greatest threat.   Again, if we are worried about the border, I would emphasize that for  the last 2 fiscal years, we have added $2.4 billion to CBP budget  authority, over a 15 percent increase.   I would say that except for two Members, who are not present here  today, on the Republican side, everybody voted ``no.''   Again, I ask you to focus on what we have. I assume that the  executive order that he is referring to--I would ask you if you want to  withdraw the amendment and bring it back, we will consider it tomorrow.   Otherwise, I would oppose this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time, with all due respect to my good friend from Texas  (Mr. Roy).    Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I do not believe in catch and release, and  I certainly want to give our men and women everything they need to  have, and that is why it is important that we address this issue.   Your amendment deals with a program called remain in Mexico. The only  problem is, we can't stop the funds in that program because it got  terminated in February 2021. We had an opportunity to vote on this on  May 22, but we did not bring this up at that time. Except for two  Members, everybody voted ``no'' on this on the Republican side, and it  is a little bit too late for this.   Madam Chair, I would say to my good friend from Texas, I do support  the MPP, I do support it, but this program is gone. I think we need to  have a little bit of discussion if we are going to be looking at ways  to stop folks from coming in.   I would remind folks what happened in 2015 and what happened in 2019  under President Trump and under President Obama, that is, we worked  with Mexico, not to keep them there, but actually for them to secure  their southern border with Guatemala. We need to do that again.   If we are able to do that, I think we should be able to address that  issue. I do support MPP, but this amendment is trying to stop funding  for something that doesn't exist. For that reason, I will ask my  colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition.    Madam Chair, we had an opportunity for the last 2 fiscal  years to put $2 billion to support CBP, including ICE, and that was a  15 percent increase. We had an opportunity to vote on it, and there  were folks that did not support these particular moneys for Homeland.   I have full faith in the men and women that work for DHS, they are  capable of carrying out their Federal law enforcement responsibilities  and of carrying out their statutory authorities.   This amendment is not needed. I support ICE and they will carry out  the work that needs to be done so they can enforce immigration law.   Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I stand in opposition, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I think I know what my friend from New York  is trying to get to, but, again, I would ask that she please look at  the language here. The language says section, and then there is a  blank, followed by ``None of the funds made available by this Act may  be used to provide assistance to the Department of Defense to house  persons . . . '' Persons.   What do we mean by persons? Undocumented? Military folks? Or do we  only house animals? But it says any person at military installations  except if they are there because of the Stafford Act or U.S. Coast  Guard personnel. Even that ``personnel,'' that means personnel, a Coast  Guard officer can stay there, but their families or dependents cannot  stay there.   Again, I know what they are trying to get at, but I think this  language, the way it was drafted by the attorneys, will probably do  more harm because, again, you cannot house any person except for  Stafford or Coast Guard personnel, but not their families.   Again, I don't know if you want to withdraw that or if we could  consider this, but the way this is drafted, I would ask her to please  look at this carefully.   For those reasons, I would oppose this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
