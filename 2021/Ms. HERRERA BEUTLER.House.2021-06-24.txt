 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Southwest Washington and Cathlamet resident Mark Doumit.   Sadly, Mark passed away this week at the age of 59. For decades,  Mark's life had been defined by a commitment to his home community.  Mark served two terms as Wahkiakum County commissioner, then as a State  house member representing the 19th legislative district for 10 years.   Though he left elected office, he never abandoned public service. He  served as a steady leader of the Washington Forest Protection  Association for the last 15 years until his passing.   A stalwart supporter of our forests, fish, water, and our economy,  Mark was never hemmed in by Democrat versus Republican politics. He was  a friend and an ally to me and anyone who cared about these priorities.   I want to extend my deepest sympathies to Mark's family, friends, and  [[Page H3119]]  colleagues as they grapple with this profound loss. He will be dearly  missed.                            ____________________
