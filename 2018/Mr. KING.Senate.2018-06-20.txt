 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the 150th  anniversary of Gorham Savings Bank, a notable leader of financial  services and community engagement in southern Maine. As the only bank  headquartered in Cumberland County, Gorham Savings Bank's impressive,  locally based economic focus allows the institution to serve as a  source of strength for the community.   Founded in February of 1868, Gorham Savings Bank was established by  the Maine State Legislature under its first president, Captain Toppan  Robie. A few weeks later, the bank began business when the first  deposit of 10 cents was made. Over the years, the bank has expanded to  multiple locations across southern Maine, incorporating new financial  services to meet the expanding needs of its customers. In 1998, during  my time as Governor, I attended the opening of the bank's operations  center in Gorham, ME, and hosted the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Across  its branch locations, Gorham Savings Bank provides a variety of banking  services to its customers, including resources for personal and  business accounts. Through online banking services, customers have the  tools they need to manage their money at their convenience. Today,  Gorham Savings Bank has surpassed the $1 billion mark in assets, and  last year, the bank began the restoration of the historic Grand Trunk  Railway Company Building in Portland, ME, as a new office space. With  over 200 employees across 13 locations, the community bank is an  important employer in the region.   In addition to serving their customers, Gorham Savings Bank supports  the prosperity and growth of the surrounding communities. First, the  bank promotes a number of financial literacy programs, including ones  for tax preparation and another geared towards high school students. In  the education field, Gorham Savings Bank participates in job-shadowing  programs and contributes to scholarship opportunities for individuals  looking to further their education. Gorham Savings Bank also supports  the growth of local business and hosts an annual Launchpad small  business competition, where five Maine entrepreneurial businesses  compete for $50,000 for business development. Thanks to the teamwork of  the bank's employees, Gorham Savings Bank has led efforts to fundraise  for nonprofit organizations, including the Boys and Girls Club and  United Way.   I applaud Gorham Savings Bank on their achievements over the past 150  years and look forward to their continued success as a force for good  for the State of Maine.                            ____________________
