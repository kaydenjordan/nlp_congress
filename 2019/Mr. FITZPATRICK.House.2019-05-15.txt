 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  individual and organization in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, working to  make our community a better place.   Earlier this month, Zane Moore, the president and CEO of the YMCA of  Bucks County, walked across the entire county to raise awareness of the  positive impact the YMCA has on our neighbors and funding for its  programs.   Last Thursday, Zane began his trek at the YMCA in Quakertown,  wrapping up at the YMCA in Doylestown. He picked up on Friday where he  left off, completing his journey that same day, all the way to the YMCA  in Lower Bucks County in Fairless Hills.   Madam Speaker, I applaud Zane and all the local leaders who joined  him along the way on his journey. We appreciate the work of the YMCA  and all of its efforts to promote education, physical well-being, and  recovery programs for those in our community.

Last month, 24-year Rotary Club member Max Rose received this  distinction at the 10th annual Four-Way Test Awards Fundraiser. During  his distinguished tenure, he twice served as president of the Rotary  Club of Doylestown, has been an instrumental force in the  organization's youth exchange program, and has assisted greatly in  local events such as the Borough Dam cleanup and the Doylestown at Dusk  Car Show.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Max on this well-deserved recognition.  I also thank Rotary Club president Gail Linenberg, along with all the  members of the Rotary Club of Doylestown, for their dedication and  their service to our community.       Recognizing Students and Faculty of St. Andrew School, Newtown,                                Pennsylvania     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize an  outstanding group of students in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who  recently partnered with a local organization to comfort children who  have experienced traumatic events.   At St. Andrew School in Newtown, a group of third-grade students  participated in a service project in collaboration with the Newtown  Quilters' Guild. Using lighthearted drawings by the students, the guild  will create colorful quilts and distribute them to the Newtown Township  Police Department and emergency services personnel to give to young  children who have been through difficult situations.   Madam Speaker, I applaud these students and the faculty of St. Andrew  School in Newtown, especially Principal Nancy Matteo and third-grade  teachers Ashlyn Kalicki and Lynn Dixon.   I also thank all the members of the Newtown Quilters' Guild for their  thoughtfulness, along with all the officers of the Newtown Township  Police Department on this National Police Week. We appreciate all the  work they do for our community.                            ____________________
