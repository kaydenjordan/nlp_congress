 Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this bill. The  intention of this bill is clear: It is to prevent a future Republican  President from adding a citizenship question to the United States  Census.   And yet the question of citizenship was first offered by President  Thomas Jefferson in 1800; and from its introduction in the Census of  1820 through 1950, that question was included on every Census.   Now, when you think about the language of the Constitution itself, it  gives Congress the authority to call a Census to enumerate the  population. And for what was the purpose? The main purpose, of course,  was for apportionment, for representation of the citizens of the United  States.   The reality, though, is it has become far more than that, and that  seems to be permissible within certain limits of the Constitution  itself.   Since 1950, there have been additional Federal surveys that have  included some form of the question of citizenship, not necessarily  included in the Census itself.   But in the recent case cited by Chairwoman Maloney just moments ago,  where she said that they threw it out and said you can't ask that  question, it was not because of the question. In fact, the Supreme  Court specifically said in Department of Commerce v. New York that  Congress has the right to ask that question, and the Department of  Commerce has the authority to include the question of citizenship. The  decision states, ``The enumeration clause permits Congress, and by  extension the Secretary, to inquire about citizenship on the  questionnaire.''                                time  1700    That rationale does not work from the chairwoman. I realize a lot of  my colleagues don't realize and understand and appreciate what is  happening on our southern border. From October of last year through the  end of July, Border Patrol has reported nearly 2 million encounters  along our southern border, that does not include who entered and have  gotten away.   Nearly a quarter of the encounters feature a person who had at least  one prior encounter in the past 12 months. We, as policymakers, if we  are going to get policy and data, which was just alluded to by Mr.  Connolly, we should have some of the most important data, and that is  who is in this country illegally and who is a citizen and who is not.   Whether someone is a citizen is an important datapoint that should be  recorded on the Census and on other Federal surveys. It is well past  time that Congress direct the Census Bureau to ask this question like  it did for over 100 years.   This bill is, instead, an attempt to cynically block the inclusion of  the citizenship question on the Census and seeks to insulate career  staff at the Census Bureau from any accountability. This is not--this  is not a good bill.   This bill does not help us get to where we need to get in terms of  understanding what is going on in this country so we can make policy  that is good.
