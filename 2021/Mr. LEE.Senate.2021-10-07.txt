 Mr. President, President Biden announced his vague, still- unwritten mandate for the vaccine just almost a month ago. He said  then, at the time of his announcement, that his ``patience was wearing  thin.'' Those are his words, not mine. Yet, oddly, President Biden's  administration is now in no particular rush to implement the rule. So  almost a month has now elapsed, but there is still no rule and  therefore no implementation of the rule. Perhaps President Biden and  those who work with him are realizing what countless Americans already  know: that the mandate was not well thought out.   First, neither the President of the United States specifically nor  the Federal Government generally has the authority to issue a sweeping  vaccine mandate of this nature. The Constitution doesn't empower the  Federal Government and certainly not the President individually, acting  in isolation, with the right, the authority, or the power to broadly  dictate personal medical decisions for all Americans with the stroke of  the Executive pen.   I spoke earlier this week and I also spoke last week about  individuals with religious, moral, and medical reasons to forgo  vaccinations. The President's mandate ignores their concerns and their  rights.   Much of corporate America is already starting to fire unvaccinated  workers despite the legitimate religious, moral, or health concerns  that those workers might have. Some are even being charged fees for  being married to an unvaccinated spouse. So it is not just their  decisions but that of their spouses that are causing them to confront  adverse action from their employer, all as a result of this mandate--a  mandate which doesn't yet exist. Even though time was of the essence a  month ago when it was issued, there is still no rule and still nothing  to enforce, but people are starting to enforce what they think will be  in the rule if and when it ever does get promulgated.   In recent days, I have heard from over 200 Utahns who are at risk of  losing their jobs due to this mandate. They are scared of becoming not  just unemployed but unemployable--unemployable, second-class outcasts  due to the President's order.   Have we lost compassion? Have we lost all reason? Troublingly, it  seems that these mandates aren't based in reason. The mandate  completely ignores the millions of Americans who have previously  contracted and recovered from COVID-19. These people have antibodies  against the virus.   In other countries where significant research on natural immunity has  been conducted, the results are compelling. A study conducted in Italy  shows that natural immunity is more effective than vaccines at reducing  risk of future infection. Another study of half a million people in  Denmark has shown that natural immunity provides significant, lasting  protection against infection. Finally, a study from three separate  hospitals in Israel found that natural immunity from a previous COVID  infection was ``27 times more effective than vaccinated immunity in  preventing symptomatic infections.'' But the President's mandate  announcement makes no mention of natural immunity--no mention  whatsoever. Our entire national health apparatus seems to disregard the  significant protection individuals have if they previously had and  recovered from COVID.   Now, I believe the vaccines are generally safe and effective. I have  been vaccinated. Every member of my family has been vaccinated, with my  encouragement. I see these vaccines as a miracle, one that is helping  to protect millions and millions of Americans--hundreds of millions of  Americans, for that matter. But I also recognize that millions of  Americans are already protected by their natural defenses because they  contracted COVID, before the vaccines were available in many instances,  and they have recovered and therefore have natural immunity. The  science shows that this immunity is strong, that it is effective, and  that it is widespread in America.   So I, today, am offering a bill that would require Federal Agencies  to recognize, accept, truthfully characterize, and include natural  immunity in any regulation. This bill does not say that vaccines are  bad or unhelpful; it merely asks the Federal Government to respect  widely available science.   I am glad to be joined in this effort by Senators Braun, Tuberville,  and Sullivan as cosponsors.   The bill would allow us to keep Americans employed and help us beat  [[Page S6971]]  the pandemic in a smart way, in a reasoned, rational way, and in a  compassionate way.   Now, I believe--in fact, I am quite confident that the mandate in its  entirety will be struck down as unconstitutional, as having been issued  outside the authority of the President of the United States. This  simple bill wouldn't undo the whole thing, as I believe the courts are  certain ultimately to do. This simple bill is narrow, and it would  simply give peace of mind to Americans and employers by recognizing and  upholding evidence-based realities concerning our natural defense to  COVID. It is a commonsense proposal, and I urge my colleagues to  support it.   So, Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous  consent that the Committee on HELP be discharged from further  consideration of S. 2846 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.   I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read a third time  and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I appreciate the insight and the thoughtful  attention paid to this matter by my friend and distinguished colleague,  the Senator from Washington.   I respectfully submit that we are not dealing with theatrics when it  comes to hard-working Americans, including the more than 200 Utahns  whom I have heard from just in the last 2 weeks, who are losing their  jobs or are at immediate risk for doing so based on a decision forced  upon them by an action that has been threatened but not taken and in no  way legally articulated by the President of the United States.   These are not theatrics for those who are losing their jobs. That is  just not an accurate portrayal, and it really is disrespectful to those  who are enduring that. To them, these are not theatrics. To them, this  is their ability to make a living.   As far as the characterization that these claims of natural immunity  are one off, I have yet to see any study that refutes the studies I  referenced a moment ago--not the one from Denmark, not the one from  Italy, and not the one from Israel that shows the significant immunity  benefits conferred by a previous COVID infection, one from which a  person has fully recovered. In the case of at least two of those  studies--the one from Italy and the one from Israel--the immunity is as  strong if not stronger. In fact, the one from Israel concluded that it  is 27 times more protective.   Yet we continue to hear efforts like this one today characterized as  ``theatrics,'' characterized as ``nonsense ideas like this bill''-- bills that try, in the case of the bill that we are talking about  today, to protect the employment rights and the personal decisions of  Americans who have natural immunity or, as in previous bills, those who  have a legitimate medical concern, especially where that concern is one  that has been taken on the advice of a board-certified physician who  has advised them, based on a preexisting medical condition, not to get  it.   I also heard that the President has indicated that there would be  exceptions. We don't know what those exceptions are. Many of those  exceptions are not being honored by those segments of corporate America  already moving to implement and enforce this vaccine mandate.   What is happening is that HR departments and general counsel's  offices in large corporations--those with more than 99 employees--are  understandably trying to get ahead of this so that they are not behind  when the rule actually issues, so they won't run any risk of the  aggressive, heavy fines with which they have already been threatened.  So for that reason, many of them are trying to get ahead of it, and  many of them are now using President Biden's speech about the yet-to- exist rule, and they are either threatening to fire or preparing to  fire or in some cases already have fired people regardless of any  exceptions that they think they ought to be entitled to. It is easier  for the corporation, in some instances, perhaps, or maybe more  convenient or maybe more in conformity with the liking of the  individuals making the decision to do that, but it is not fair to the  workers. It is especially not fair in light of the fact that all of  these actions are being undertaken in response to a yet-to-exist rule  promulgated by an executive branch Agency that has yet to act at the  behest of the President of the United States--one person without  statutory authority and without constitutional authority to do this.  That is tragic.    Because he doesn't have the authority to do this, it shouldn't happen  at all. At a minimum, we, as the lawmaking body within the Federal  Government, have an obligation to take it down. Even if we can't take  it all down or to stop it, we at least have an obligation to try to  make its effects less draconian, less hurtful, and less harmful to  individuals who, by no choice of their own and no fault of their own,  aren't in a position to get this, whether because of religious  convictions, natural immunity, or a health condition or something else.   It is tragic. We are better than this. We should be acting to protect  Americans, not make them more vulnerable.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Will the gentleman yield for a question?    Senator Paul, when you and I were both elected to the Senate  back in 2010, I remember the national debt was an issue then. It was  becoming large enough that people were concerned about it. As it  mounted, sometimes we had conversations about how long it might  continue--how long it might continue to spiral upward.   Are you surprised to see that here we are, 11 year later, 11 years  after you and I arrived here, and where it has gone since then?    If the gentleman would yield for a question again, I believe  it was during that summer that a number of people started focusing on  emerging economic research, including research proposed by Professors  Rogoff and Reinhart at Stanford University suggesting that whenever the  debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds a certain level, exceeds roughly 100 percent,  1-to-1, certain things start to happen, and economic growth becomes  more elusive.   As I recall, we were nowhere close, yet, to the 1-to-1 ratio. Now  that we have blown past that, what do you think that ought to tell us  about the fact that, even as we have blown past that point, we are now  being asked to raise the debt ceiling by larger and larger amounts or  as sometimes----    For a time period without any reform.    Now, we have seen, with--our status as the United States  having the world's reserve currency, the U.S. dollar, has given us some  flexibility in that area, flexibility that other countries like Greece  haven't had.   Do you think there is some risk of becoming overly confident in that  world reserve currency status? In other words, could we be jeopardizing  the very thing that we fought so hard to achieve and that so few  nations ever achieve?    In an economy where currency and circulation isn't backed up  by any tangible object and where the government has effectively the  ability to just print more money, even if that currency happens to be  the world's reserve currency, at some point after you keep printing  money, doesn't that cause problems?    Mr. President, we have a debt ceiling for a reason. It is  not completely arbitrary. It is not just made up. It is not something  that someone came up with for their own amusement. No. When the sheer  numeric volume, the quantity, the amount of our national debt ceases to  cause panic; when the principle of jeopardizing our children's future  loses effect; when the sacrifice it would cost taxpayers to pay the  debt becomes laughably large; when all else fails, Congress sets a cap  and says: Here, here, here. We have to think about this. We have to  think about this debt problem.   There is a reason why we have that. They are sound reasons rooted in  logic, rooted in mathematics, rooted in the inevitability of our own  future if we don't control the way that the Federal Government spends  money. Now, nearly half of the Members of this entire body--almost the  entirety of the Senate Republican conference--wrote a letter almost 2  months ago, saying that we would not raise the debt limit. We committed  that we were finally going to make a change for the sake of families  back home and generations still unborn. We were going to make a change  to rein in reckless spending.   Now we are faced with more spending and more debt than our country  has ever seen before. Our debt-to-GDP ratio has now reached a  staggering level of 125 percent.   The national debt is rushing toward $30 trillion, and far too  quickly, this body is signaling a willingness and, I might dare say, an  eagerness to sign on  [[Page S6980]]  the dotted line without thinking through the consequences or at least  without thinking through the consequences of everyone outside this  building, without thinking through the consequences of those who are  wealthy and well connected and will probably fare just fine regardless  of the Federal Government's reckless practice of effectively just  printing more money.   Let me tell you why that is such a problem and why I think it is so  dangerous. First of all, as I mentioned a moment ago in my exchange  with the Senator from Kentucky, once we pass this 1-to-1 debt-to-GDP  ratio, economists have scoured the landscape and looked at economies  all over the world throughout human history, throughout periods of time  in which any records have been kept at all, and they have concluded  that this 100 percent debt-to-GDP ratio is tragic; it is dangerous; it  is perilous. Once you cross that Rubicon, you are in some very, very  tough positions. Economic growth starts to sputter. It staggers. It  becomes more and more difficult to get out of the death spiral.   You see, in the past, even as our national debt has been on the rise,  we have been OK insofar as it has increased, more or less, to a degree  commensurate with the size of our economy. Economic growth has been  such that it remained, more or less, constant--less constant lately,  but it has remained somewhat proportional to the size of our economy.  Economic growth has propelled that, but that is the problem. It is the  goose that laid the golden egg. And we know what happens when you get  rid of that goose or when you meaningfully impair its ability to lay  those golden eggs.   Once we reach that point, we pass the 100 percent debt-to-GDP ratio,  we know that our economic growth will stall, and it will become far  more difficult to pay off. We also know that it matters on a very  personal level, for reasons I will get into more in just a moment, for  poor and middle-class American families everywhere, throughout Utah and  across America. People who are living paycheck to paycheck or otherwise  on a fixed income or fixed budget, like most American families, find  that when the government just prints more money--as it tends to do when  we start to borrow and then spend trillions of dollars at a time more  than the Federal Government is bringing in--that brings about  inflation. It is as though there are a basket of goods that the economy  is capable of faithfully, consistently producing from one year to  another. The basket of goods might grow or shrink a little bit from  year to year, but it is going to tend to fluctuate mostly at the  margins. The big picture is going to look fairly consistent.   So what happens when the government just prints more money and puts  that into circulation? The purchasing power of each dollar is  diminished. Now, this tends to work out fine. In fact, it can work out  really well for wealthy and well-connected individuals. The rich  usually figure out a way to get even richer off of this dynamic. They  can hedge against it. They can figure out a way to benefit in one way  or another from the chaos and sometimes even from the government  spending. But where does that leave everyone else? Well, for most  people--and by ``most people'' I mean 99 percent of Americans--it is  not going to make them wealthier. It is going to make them poorer  because most people are still living with more or less the same income,  more or less the same resources. They have still got more or less the  same basket of goods in the economy, but when you have got more dollars  in the American economy because we are effectively printing more, each  dollar matters less. It buys less--everything from gas to groceries,  from housing to healthcare. Poor and middle-class American families  suffer while the wealthy and well connected might benefit. And a small  handful of politicians receive a pat on the back, thanking them,  congratulating them as they congratulate themselves and each other for  what they characterize as a job well done.   Sure, they will always be able to point to someone who benefits from  the programs they are sponsoring that they are creating. Some of those  people won't be wealthy and well-connected interests. Some of them will  be deserving families, some of them, poor and middle-class American  families. But, you know, most families are just made poorer as  government expands its footprint.   Let's look at what happened last year alone. During the last few  years before the pandemic, we were bringing in about $3 trillion a year  in tax revenue. We were spending about $4 trillion--a massive,  embarrassing, disgraceful, indefensible deficit, an annual deficit of  about a trillion dollars a year. It was inexcusable, especially at the  height--at the peak--of an economic cycle.   Then the pandemic hit. Last year, we still brought in about $3  trillion in tax revenue, just as we had expected, just as we had during  the previous 2 years. Only this time we didn't spend $4 trillion. We  spent $6.6 trillion. We brought in $3 trillion, and we spent $6.6  trillion. We spent more than double what we brought in. We spent more  money that was borrowed than the money that was paid into the Treasury.   What did that do? Well, it dramatically increased the money supply-- abruptly, in a way that hurts poor and middle-class American families.  It is a predictable, foreseeable result.   Look, if you are playing Monopoly and all of a sudden you decide to  just double the amount of money that everyone gets in the game, it  doesn't make everybody better off; it just increases the prices that  are paid.    What happens when that is real money and those are real people, when  it is not just plastic game pieces at stake, but it is hungry mouths  that need to be fed and sheltered and cared for? That is where it  hurts. And that is what is so tragic when the Government colludes with  itself, with a small handful of people on the outside encouraging it to  do so, some whispering in the ears of the politicians, telling them  that they will be doing so many great things; that the expenditures and  the expansion of government is worth the investment.   They are not doing it with their own money. No, they are doing it  with the money of America's poor and middle class. It is really a sort  of reverse Robin Hood sort of thing. We are stealing from the poor to  give to the rich and the well connected and to give good headlines to a  small handful of politicians. Shame on us. Shame on us all. Shame on  this institution as we have done that.   Look, I came to the U.S. Senate 11 years ago, committed to reducing  the size, the scope, the reach, the cost, and the overall footprint of  the Federal Government and its impact on the lives of everyday  citizens. I did so based on the understanding and based on the  indisputable fact that whenever government expands its reach, it does  so at the expense of individual liberty and individual prosperity.   It doesn't mean that government doesn't have a place. It doesn't mean  that we don't need government; quite the contrary, we do. But it just  means that there is always a balancing that has to be taken into  account. You can't expand government without hurting average, everyday  people who are subject to those things.   Unfortunately, 11 years later, that same government is larger, more  expensive, and more burdensome than ever before. In a farcically futile  system, Americans now work for months out of every year just to pay  their Federal taxes. Then, after all that is done, they are insultingly  demeaned and told that it is not enough; in fact, it hasn't been enough  for a long time.   Even though some of you who are now taxpayers and now voters have now  worked months--at least weeks, maybe months--out of every year just to  pay your Federal taxes, and even though a lot of this debt may have  been accumulated before some of you were old enough to vote or some of  you were even born, no matter. You have got to pay it. This is making  that worse. We are making it worse for present living Americans, those  who are of voting age, working age, taxpaying age, and those who are  not. And it is also adding burdens to those who have not even been  born, whose parents have yet to meet. The regulatory state is growing  ever more costly in terms of its economic impact.   I have been studying the cost of the Federal regulatory system for  about 25 years. I first started thinking about it while I was in law  school. I remember a guest speaker came to speak at our  [[Page S6981]]  law school, and he explained that the Federal regulatory system adds  what he characterized as sort of a backdoor, invisible, de facto tax on  poor and middle-class Americans. He explained that it is a backdoor  invisible tax, it is regressive, and that it affects everyone and  disproportionately the poor and middle class because of the fact that  nowhere is any consumer able to identify the precise cost to them. In  fact, most of them don't even know that it exists because unlike their  tax bill, there is no return at the end of the year. Unlike their sales  tax that typically will show up on someone's receipt or a property tax  or anything else, there is no written indication of it that tells any  one taxpayer or citizen what it is costing them every year. But it is  there.   Anyway, back in I think 1996 or 1997, he explained that the Federal  regulatory system was imposing this backdoor, invisible, highly  regressive tax on Americans to the tune of $3 or $400 billion a year. I  remember thinking, this is staggering, because that is a lot of money.  It is a lot of money that could otherwise go toward other priorities,  whether in the government, you know, shoring up Social Security or  Medicare; or some other program providing for soldiers, sailors,  airmen, and marines with what they need; or in the lives of families,  providing for housing, education, for nourishment or other needs of our  children. It just goes into the cost of complying with Federal  regulations.   So, yes, Americans do pay for that, we explained; they just pay for  it in a way that they can't quite see. There is no single bill that  tallies the size of the expense for it, but they do pay for it  nonetheless. They pay for it with higher prices on goods and services,  everything they buy, and they also pay for it with diminished wages,  unemployment, and underemployment.   So here we are 25 years later. No one knows for sure what the Federal  regulatory system costs, but most estimates I have seen of late put the  number at about $2 trillion a year--$2 trillion. That is the backdoor,  invisible tax that Americans pay through higher prices on goods and  services, diminished wages, unemployment, and underemployment, due to  what it costs to comply with Federal regulations.   Most people don't even think much about Federal regulations, and with  good reason. People have other, better things to do. Those who do think  about them are perhaps inclined to think--maybe because they have been  taught to think or because they have never been taught otherwise--that  these costs are borne by billionaires; that they are borne by big, blue  chip corporations or a type of industrial tycoon whom you would  associate with a Monopoly game piece perhaps. But they are, in fact,  borne by poor and middle-class Americans everywhere. That is money they  can't get back, on top of the money they had to pay after working weeks  or months out of every year just to pay their Federal taxes, and then  being told: By the way, after the $2 trillion that you as a people were  required to pay through this backdoor, invisible, highly regressive  regulatory tax, so to speak, and on top of the $3 trillion that you  paid on your taxes, it is still not enough because we are now nearly  $29 trillion in debt. It is sad. It is insulting. It is discouraging.   I mentioned inflation a minute ago, and I want to get back to that  for a moment. It is the natural, foreseeable consequence of a  government that really knows no limits on what it is there to do and  knows essentially no limits on what it can spend. These days, if the  Federal Government can dream it, if politicians can desire it, they can  fund it.   There has never been an institution on planet Earth that had access  to more capital than the Federal Government does. There has never been  a government in the existence of planet Earth that has had the ability  to produce the amount of wealth that this Nation has and the ability of  its people to produce that wealth and the ability of the government to  spend that amount of money. Because of that, this government also has  tremendous bargaining power, and it has correspondingly tremendous  borrowing power that goes along with that.   In other words, because the American economy has been strong and  because the U.S. dollar has been the world's reserve currency of  choice, that has given us this ability. It might make it seem like  money, while not growing on trees technically, can be sort of printed  into existence, just taken out of thin air, and that we won't feel the  consequence for it.   Now, you can get away with that a little bit longer when you have the  world's reserve currency and in an economy as large as ours, with  credit that has been relatively good compared to that of other  sovereign nations, but it does have limits, and we are seeing those  limits now. We are seeing them in ways that we haven't seen yet. I was  worried about this, scared to death of it 10, 11 years ago when I first  got here, but it is so much worse now. It is so much worse now because  we have behaved in a way that has made it worse. You can't hide it for  that long. The piper eventually has to be paid, and the consequences  can eventually make themselves known. It is finally starting to harm  American families by reducing their real earnings and undercutting  their purchasing power.   In new research that we just released this week, the Joint Economic  Committee, Republicans--and I am the ranking Republican on that  committee--found that these rising prices are brought about as a result  of a mix of two types of inflation: transitory inflation and more  lasting inflation brought about by runaway government spending. We  found that government stimulus measures have ignited more lasting and  more systemic inflation. These inflationary pressures are building on  transitory inflation, and they are pushing prices higher.   That is why I am really concerned that, over a year after the  recession officially ended, Congress continues undaunted, unhindered,  and seemingly more eager than ever in its desire to pursue new massive  government spending measures, including a $3.5 trillion budget  resolution--the single largest spending package in history.   If Congress continues to pursue spending packages that boost consumer  demand while at the same time depressing employment and investment,  which is exactly what we are doing, then government-induced inflation  will increase even further, with even more drastic, painful  consequences for us all but especially for America's poor and middle  class. The wealthy and well connected will do just fine. The wealthiest  among us will probably get richer as a result. The politicians among us  who vote for these things will probably be patted on the back,  congratulated by a compliant, dutiful news media, and, most  importantly, congratulated by each other, while poor and middle-class  Americans will be left silently carrying the bill and bearing the pain  of what they are doing to them.   Congress should consider the inflationary risks of this pattern of  unfettered, unrestrained government spending. My colleagues should be  aware that the costs go beyond the simple sticker price of new  spending.   The American people will be better served by policies that are geared  toward returning Americans to work and removing barriers to business  investment in American workers. But we are not doing that. We are going  in the opposite direction of where we should, and as a result,  Americans are paying the price, especially poor and middle-class  Americans.   It is certainly affecting people in my home State of Utah. Eighty- five percent of Utahans who were polled recently said that they were  concerned about inflation, and they have reason to be. We have data  from all over the country. Look, nationwide, overall, prices are up 5.3  percent over last year, just in 1 year alone--5.3 percent overall  nationwide. In some areas of the economy, it is particularly acute. You  see it in meat prices, which are up 8 percent overall from last year.  Beef is an astounding 12 percent more expensive than last year. Milk is  10 percent more expensive. Gasoline costs 50 percent more than it did a  year ago. In the Salt Lake City area, home prices are up 26 percent  above where they were last year. So everything from gas to groceries  and from housing to healthcare--they are all going up in like fashion.   Global supply chains, quite frankly, can't keep up. Warnings are  already being raised about holiday shortages and huge price increases  as there just  [[Page S6982]]  aren't enough goods in the entire economy to meet demand, because,  again, you just add more money to it. It doesn't make it more  affordable; it makes it less affordable. More spending and therefore  more money chasing fewer goods will only cause prices to rise even  more. That hurts the poorest Americans the most.   The Federal Government prioritizes those who are already wealthy and  well connected with its spending, and its politicians right here in  this Chamber congratulate themselves and each other and are  congratulated by a compliant mainstream news media that for whatever  reason always wants to praise the expansion of the Federal Government  even when it hurts America's poor and middle class, which it does.   Americans are paying the price. Poor and middle-class Americans are  paying the price--those least able to do anything about it. Yes, we are  causing that. Those we prioritize, helping the wealthy and well  connected with this kind of spending--those Americans who don't have  paid lobbyists are left in the dust, holding the bags and harmed the  most.   We aren't cold or calloused for rejecting more spending--no, no. We  are considering those who end up paying the price for this Monopoly  money ploy to spend without end. The everyday Americans, the hard- working Americans shouldn't be harmed like this. Yet they are going to  be. They are already feeling that. It is indefensible.   So we are nearing the point of nearly $29 trillion in our national  debt. It is the highest debt in our Nation's history. The debt-to-GDP  ratio is now over 125 percent. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, debt- to-GDP ratio, where economic growth around the world throughout human  history--growth tends to stall out once we cross that 100 percent debt- to-GDP ratio. Just a couple of years ago, we were still in the 80- percent range, and now we are at about 125 percent.   Politicians have promised to deal with the national debt for decades.  They promised it over and over and over again, and now the argument has  shifted. Some on the other side of the aisle are saying that debt  doesn't matter or that it might even be good. In fact, they are saying  that it is so necessary that if we don't add to it, if we don't augment  it, if we don't feed this beast, then we are somehow going to cause an  economic catastrophe.   Now, look, it may be good for their socialist makeover of America. It  is disastrous for the people back home, especially those who they claim  will be benefitting from it. The debt has reached absolutely  unimaginable levels. It is almost $230,000 per taxpayer, nearing  $87,000 per citizen.   Meanwhile, businesses across the country are struggling to keep their  doors open among labor shortages, skyrocketing prices, heavy  regulation, vaccine and other mandates, and people losing their jobs.   Because the President of the United States is using authority he  doesn't have through an order he is unwilling to even share with us,  they are going to choose, in some cases, between getting a vaccine that  in some cases might be hazardous to their health based on unique  circumstances and the judgment of their own doctor--yet they have to  choose between getting the vaccine and losing their job.   Many businesses are barely inching along. So, no, they don't need  more government spending. In fact, talking to countless business owners  in Utah, more spending is the last thing they need. But it is certainly  the last thing that poor and middle-class Americans need. What happens  when we do that is they all get poorer, even as we are congratulated  and we congratulate each other for expanding government yet again.   I have had recent conversations with a number of businessowners who,  because of the heavy hand, the heavy spending practices of government,  have been unable to keep themselves even in business.   I spoke to one of many restaurant owners recently who explained his  inability, even after increasing repeatedly the offering price,  offering huge, huge sign-in bonuses--$15, then $16, then $18, then $19,  then $20 an hour on top of that hiring bonus just to hire people to  work in his restaurant in a college town with a lot of young people who  are usually willing to work in restaurants. They couldn't do it because  of government interference. The government was competing with them. The  government was paying people more to not work than they could be paid  to work. This is only compounding the problem.   None of this would be possible if we weren't effectively operating  this government with a printing press that makes the American people  poorer.   So, yes, I signed that letter 2 months ago, along with 46 Republican  Senators, almost the entire Senate Republican Conference. I signed that  not just because the letter looked neat, not because it would get  praise--I know we would get the opposite of that in the press--but  because of the people we represent, especially the poor and middle  class we represent, who will be made poorer and less secure every  single time we do this.   I can't vote to raise this debt ceiling, not right now, especially  given the plans at play to increase spending immediately by another  $3.5 trillion, which according to some is only as low as $3.5 trillion  because of creative accounting. But the real number might be more than  $5 trillion. Regardless, we can't do that. We can't afford that.   It is not that the government can't physically do it--we know its  ability to do it--but we also know that when it exercises that ability  to do that, poor and middle-class Americans suffer.   I can't do this to them, neither should any of us.   Thank you.    Mr. President, we had a number of Senators come to the floor  over the last couple of hours talking about some of the problems that  we face as a country. They are real, they are serious, and they are  being made more severe still and more severe than they need to be by  virtue of the step that the Senate is, I fear, about to take.   When we extend the debt limit without any plan as to how you are not  going to be back in the same position in just a few more months and you  are raising it or, as we have been doing it lately, just suspending the  debt limit, you are creating sort of a debt limit Mardi Gras, an era in  which any amount of additional borrowing is permitted during that  period.   It becomes especially dangerous during times like this one, where we  are spending not just to the tune of billions, not just to the tune of  hundreds of billions, not just to the tune of a trillion more than we  take in, but to the tune of many trillions more than we take in each  and every year. That is what is hurting poor and middle-class American  families. It is a reverse Robin Hood that is so perverse. It is a  reverse Robin Hood effect. We are effectively borrowing--stealing from  the poor and giving it to the rich and well connected, and we are  giving the praise that accompanies it to the politicians who clamor for  attention as a result of other people spending other people's money  that other people will have to work for to earn back and to pay it  back. Some of those people aren't old enough to vote yet; some of them  have not been born; and some will be born years from now to parents who  have not met.    It is not fair for us to do that, and that is why this isn't just  another debt ceiling debate. It is not just another debt limit  discussion. This one is so much bigger than it has been in the past.  The effects are being felt so much more directly than they have at any  other time in the past when we have raised this.   I know that this can come across to a lot of people as an intensely  partisan place. I understand how people can think that. In some ways it  is. Everything about it reminds people of that, especially the visual  images that they see. You know, we have got 100 desks in here; 50 of  them are on that side of the aisle, and 50 of them are on this side of  the aisle. And there are a number of issues on which there is a  division of thought, a set of pretty deep disagreements that sometimes  lead to votes that break down more or less along partisan lines. There  is a lot of that.   In my view, it doesn't reflect a petulant desire to disagree for the  sake of being disagreeable. It tends to reflect something a little  deeper, a little more heartfelt, and, more than anything, it reflects a  genuine difference of opinion among the people we represent.   We don't like to disagree around here. In fact, I like agreeing. I  don't like being disagreeable with those on the other side of the  aisle. Many of my very favorite people in the U.S. Senate are people  who don't share my party affiliation and who are at the opposite end of  the ideological spectrum for me. It makes it that much more fun to work  with them because there are a number of areas where we can and where we  do agree.   So there are ways in which this place is portrayed in the  entertainment media and in the news media that are accurate, insofar as  they show this sometimes heated debate that occurs across party lines.  There is some of that that occurs. It is an incomplete picture because  there are a lot of areas where we agree, where we reach conclusions  that are good, and we reach them together.   There is another feature of that, though, that is very seldom  portrayed in the news media, in the entertainment media, or elsewhere  in our society and in our culture, and it worries me. And that is about  the areas where there is bipartisanship--a bipartisanship that maybe is  good for people in this Chamber, but leaves a lot of people out in the  cold. It is good for politicians whether they have an R or a D after  their name, but it is bad for everyone else, especially the poor and  middle class. That part concerns me. It worries me a lot. You know, we  didn't get to this point, going into the pandemic at the peak of an  economic cycle, where we were spending a trillion dollars a year more  than we were taking in--we didn't get to that point without a lot of  bipartisanship.   We didn't get to the point of trillion-dollar annual deficits without  a whole lot of Republicans and a whole lot of Democrats agreeing  together to spend a trillion dollars more each year than we were taking  in with record-low unemployment, with strong economic growth. We were  still borrowing that much. Twenty-five percent--$1 out of every $4  spent by the government--was borrowed. There is a lot of bipartisanship  in that, but not all bipartisanship is equal and not all bipartisanship  is good for hard-working poor and middle-class Americans. Some of it is  downright harmful.   We didn't get to the point where we spent last year more than double  what we brought in. We brought in $3 trillion, miraculously, during the  height of the pandemic, and yet we spent $6.6 trillion last year. We  didn't get to that point without a whole lot of bipartisanship and  without a whole lot of Republicans agreeing with a whole lot of  Democrats to spend that much more than we had.   We didn't get to be almost $30 trillion in debt without a whole lot  of bipartisanship. That was a whole lot of Republicans and a whole lot  of Democrats  [[Page S6988]]  agreeing to do something that might have felt good in the moment--might  have done a lot of good in the moment--but didn't take into account the  forgotten man and the forgotten woman in the picture. The poor and  middle-class family that finds it harder to get by, to buy everything  from housing to healthcare, from gas to groceries, it didn't take them  into account. So, no, not all bipartisanship makes sense. Not all  bipartisanship has the best interests of the American people at heart.   Sometimes you need someone in the room to express hesitation, to  express reluctance. Sometimes it is one or two, and sometimes it is  half. That is why I was elated. I was pleased when a few months ago  nearly every Member of the Senate Republican conference, 46 out of the  50 of us, signed a letter.   Now, the letter explained a few things, a few things that I think are  pretty important to remember. It explained, for example, that we don't  ever want to see the Federal Government default on its debt, pointing  out that not raising the debt limit is a different decision than a  decision to default on the debt. We bring in more than enough money  every month and every year to meet the debt service obligations of  every month and every year--a significant amount more, in fact.   Sometimes changing the prioritization of spending can allow us to  borrow less than we would otherwise. So nearly every Member of the  Republican Senate conference signed this letter acknowledging that we  don't want to default. And we do find ourselves in an untenable  position in which Democrats are wanting to pass a $3.5 trillion bill  that really, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible  Federal Budget, would end up costing more like $5 trillion. And we  don't think it is right in that circumstance to just suspend the debt  ceiling and that we are not going to do it.   So we signed this letter. We said, we, the undersigned Republican  Senators are letting Senate Democrats know and the American public know  that we will not vote to increase the debt ceiling, whether that comes  through a stand-alone bill, a continuing resolution, or any other  vehicle. This is a problem created by Democratic spending, and  Democrats will have to accept sole responsibility for facilitating.   I want to be clear. It is not saying that the underlying problem was  created entirely by Democrats. But it is saying that what the Democrats  were about to do and are still planning to do is the driving reason why  we are unwilling to just suspend the debt ceiling. Remember, when we  are suspending it, we are not just raising it by a certain amount. We  are creating a period of debt ceiling Mardi Gras, a period in which any  amount of additional borrowing is allowed under the law. And when you  have got one party that wants to add to the tune of many trillions of  dollars to our already out-of-control debt, one that is now in the  range of about 125 percent of our GDP, that is a problem. It was not  unreasonable for us to make that commitment. It would have been  unreasonable for us not to make that commitment. Sometimes you need  someone who is willing to say: Maybe this isn't such a good idea.   I commend those who signed the letter. I implore all who signed it to  remember that commitment, to remember it to their voters. I don't think  it helps for us to just suspend the debt ceiling anyway, and I don't  think it helps to dismiss this simply as a cloture vote.   The point of the letter was that the Democrats have the ability to do  this on their own through the reconciliation process. If they want to  do it, they should use that process. They haven't used that process. In  light of that, we have no business facilitating it.   I see we have an additional colleague here who is interested in  speaking. In deference to him, I am going to let him proceed.   Before I do so, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have  printed in the Congressional Record a copy of that letter, dated August  10, 2021, signed by 46 Republican Senators.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, August 10, 2021.        To Our Fellow Americans: Since taking total control of the       United States federal government, with the Presidency, a       narrow majority in the House, and Vice President Harris       providing the deciding vote in an evenly split Senate,       Democrats have embarked on a massive and unprecedented       deficit spending spree. Without a single Republican vote,       they passed a $1.9 trillion ``Covid relief'' bill in March       even though $1 trillion was still unspent from previous       bipartisan Covid relief bills.        Now they have passed a $3.5 trillion Budget Resolution,       again without a single Republican vote. The non-partisan       Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has calculated       that a more honest score of this budget resolution will       likely exceed $5 trillion. Senate Democrats shamelessly       estimate their tax and spending plan will result in a $45       trillion debt level by 2031.        In order for this spending to occur, our nation's debt       limit will have to be increased significantly. Because       Democrats are responsible for the spending, they need to take       responsibility for increasing the debt ceiling. They have       total control of the government, and the unilateral ability       to raise the debt ceiling to accommodate their unilateral       spending plans. Indeed, Democrats have the ability to raise       the debt limit through the Budget Resolution by introducing       appropriate language in the upcoming reconciliation process       (or a subsequent reconciliation). Doing so would not require       a single Republican vote, and would appropriately require       each and every Democrat to take responsibility for their out-      of-control spending.        We should not default on our debts under any circumstances.       If Democrats threaten a default, it will only be because they       refuse to vote for the debt ceiling increase necessitated by       their own irresponsible spending. Democrats, at any time,       have the power through reconciliation to unilaterally raise       the debt ceiling, and they should not be allowed to pretend       otherwise.        We, the undersigned Republican Senators, are letting Senate       Democrats and the American public know that we will not vote       to increase the debt ceiling, whether that increase comes       through a stand-alone bill, a continuing resolution, or any       other vehicle. This is a problem created by Democrat       spending. Democrats will have to accept sole responsibility       for facilitating it.
