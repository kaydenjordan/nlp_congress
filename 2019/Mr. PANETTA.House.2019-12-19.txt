 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of USMCA.   That is right. The chairman is absolutely correct. I represent the  central coast of California, and I fondly call it the ``Salad Bowl of  the World.''   With agriculture being our number one industry, trade with Canada and  Mexico and, thus, the USMCA is very, very important. This deal will  provide our farmers and ranchers with continued, yet improved, access  to those important markets.   It will also strengthen those sanitary and phytosanitary standards  and make sure that sound science is used when it comes to our food  safety, and it helps California wine get into those Canadian markets.   When this administration first presented USMCA to Congress, I have to  say, it was unacceptable. However, thanks to Speaker Pelosi, Chairman  Neal, the Trade Working Group and, you bet, Ambassador Lighthizer, we  were able to come up with one of the strongest, most progressive deals  in the United States' history.   The USMCA now has some of the most stringent labor standards, some of  the most robust funding for enforceability, and some of the strongest  requirements for the environment ever.   The USMCA frames a new floor for future trade agreements. It creates  new confidence in our most important trading partners, and it provides  protection for the future of our fresh produce on our farms, for the  dignity of our workers, for the sanctity of our environment, and, yes,  for the success of our economy and our hemisphere.
