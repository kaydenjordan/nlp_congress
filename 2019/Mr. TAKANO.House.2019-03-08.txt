 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the historic vote  the House took to strengthen our democracy. The For the People Act will  help combat corruption and bring ethics and accountability back to our  political process.   I am particularly happy that the legislative changes of the Let It Go  Act will be part of this bold piece of progressive legislation.   Currently, no laws exist that limit how long candidates or former  government officials can hold on to their campaign funds after their  campaign ends or following the conclusion of their public service. It  is not their money. They should let it go.   Limits to how long surplus funds can remain in campaign accounts and  how that money can be utilized must be established. With the inclusion  of my amendment, this legislation will do just that.   For far too long, powerful special interests and big money in  politics have silenced the voices of the American people. H.R. 1 will  help shift the balance of power from a wealthy, powerful few back to  the American people. Today I cast an enthusiastic vote, a ``yes'' vote  For the People.                            ____________________
