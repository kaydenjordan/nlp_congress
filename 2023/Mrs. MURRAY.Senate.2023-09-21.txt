 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I share my  colleagues' concern with making sure the men and women of the Coast  Guard get the pay they deserve in a timely way. In fact, I don't want  any of our Federal workers to miss a paycheck. But this bill, which  essentially says the Coast Guard gets paid as long as other members of  our armed services are being paid, won't actually stop anyone from  missing a paycheck in a few weeks because the looming shutdown would  also stop pay for the military.   I appreciate that my colleagues want to talk about how Coast Guard  pay is handled compared to other branches of our armed services, but,  respectfully, the pressing issue right now is making sure everyone gets  paid, and we prevent a completely unnecessary shutdown that would hurt  our families across the country, which is why I am working around the  clock to make sure we pass a bipartisan CR and supplemental package.  And I would urge all of my colleagues to join me in that effort.   And I object.
