 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  September being National Recovery Month. Sponsored by the Substance  Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, SAMHSA, I encourage  everyone to take time this month to reach out to those they know who  are suffering or have suffered from mental and substance abuse  disorders.   Currently, 115 people die every day from an opioid overdose. Clearly,  that is way too many and, sadly, only one example of numerous types of  mental and substance abuse disorders in the United States.   If you or anyone you know is struggling, there are resources  available, including the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, SAMHSA's  National Helpline, and more. SAMHSA's website, www.samhsa.gov, has  these phone numbers, treatment center locations, grant applications for  local governments, and general health information.   With hard work, smart policy decisions, and a dedicated American  public, we can turn these numbers around.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the  100th anniversary of the 1918 influenza pandemic, one of the most  deadly pandemics in human history called the Spanish flu.   The illness claimed 675,000 lives. No part of the United States was  immune to the Spanish flu, and it claimed victims of all ages, urban  and rural citizens alike.   Sadly, we still do not know exactly what caused the 1918 epidemic,  but, even today, deadly strains of the flu are still possible.   It is important that we remember the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic to  remind ourselves how important it is to strongly invest in research and  development for lifesaving medications that may prevent a future  outbreak, like the one in 1918.   As we enter into the new flu season, I encourage everyone to see your  doctor, see your pharmacist, and get your flu vaccine.                            ____________________
