 Madam President, we have a 50-50 Senate, with 50  Republicans and 50 Democrats. Vice President Harris provides the  Democrats with our majority. The House of Representatives has a very  slim Democratic majority: currently, 221 to 212, with 2 vacancies.   When the 117th Congress began, I think most Americans were doubtful  that we would be able to pass legislation to help them, their families,  their communities, and our Nation. I am happy to report that, despite  the odds, the 117th Congress has been a historically productive  Congress. This is not a statement I make lightly, nor did I predict  this many legislative accomplishments when we began the 117th Congress  in January of 2021.   I knew America's doubts, but I also shared their fervent hope that  Congress would somehow find a way to beat the odds. And we have,  sending numerous major bills to President Biden to be signed into law.  Some of our accomplishments have been genuinely bipartisan, especially  the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the so-called CHIPS and  Science bill. That is gratifying because I believe that Congress,  especially the Senate, is at its best when it works in a bipartisan  fashion.   Some of our accomplishments have been solely Democratic victories;  notably, the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act. I  regret that we were unable to convince our Republican colleagues to  join us on those bills because they advanced public policies and  enjoyed broad bipartisan support among the American people. Democrats  will always reach across the aisle to pass legislation that enhances  our national and economic security, but we are prepared to work alone,  if necessary.   Our most recent accomplishment is the Inflation Reduction Act. The  Senate passed this legislation just before the August recess on a  party-line vote. That legislation will make it easier for American  families to afford health insurance and help seniors with prescription  drug costs. Extending the Affordable Care Act enhanced health insurance  premium subsidies through 2025--just this one provision of this bill-- and will save medium-income Marylander families about $2,200 annually.   For tens of thousands of Marylanders on Medicare who use insulin, the  Inflation Reduction Act caps their insulin costs at $35 per month. We  tried to extend that cap to Americans with private insurance. Our  Republican colleagues blocked this effort, but Democrats will continue  working to make that a reality.   For the more than 1 million Marylanders and all other Americans  covered by Medicare, the Secretary of Health and Human Services finally  will have the authority to negotiate lower drug prices for the Medicare  Program. This will help ensure that Medicare patients get the best deal  possible on high-priced drugs, saving taxpayers approximately $100  billion.   The healthcare provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act are  significant, but they are only part of the bill. The legislation makes  a historic investment to shift our economy from fossil fuels to clean  energy. This will help us cut our carbon emissions 40 percent by 2030.  The Inflation Reduction Act will lower electricity costs and emissions  and will create up to 9 million good-paying jobs here in America in the  growing clean energy sector.   I authored a provision in the legislation to provide production tax  credits to our existing fleet of nuclear powerplants. They produce 20  percent of the Nation's electricity and over 50 percent of its carbon- free electricity.   A new analysis estimates that this legislation will lower the average  household electricity bill by approximately $170 to $220 annually over  the next decade. Maryland homeowners will be eligible for tax credits  for residential solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass fuel improvements  now through 2034. They also will be eligible for a larger tax credit  for energy efficiency home improvements through 2032, as well as tax  credits for the purchase of new and used clean energy vehicles,  including electric vehicles.  [[Page S4960]]    Maryland farmers will see tangible benefits from the more than $20  billion of funds included for climate-smart agricultural practices  through existing farm bill conservation programs, including the  Regional Conservation Partnership Program and Natural Resources  Conservation Service technical assistance for reducers. These are very  valuable programs for Maryland farmers who are meeting their  obligations in regard to the Chesapeake Bay Program.   The Inflation Reduction Act also bolsters resilience programs to help  Maryland communities prepare for extreme storms and other changing  climate conditions. We live in a coastal State so Marylanders fully  understand the need to address climate change, cut greenhouse gas  pollution, and protect the Chesapeake Bay. Our State and local  governments will be eligible for new and expanded grant programs to  improve public health, decrease pollution, increase climate resiliency,  and promote environmental equity.   The legislation pays for these smart investments while reducing the  deficit and without raising taxes on working families and small  businesses. In fact, according to a nonpartisan analysis, many working  families may actually see lower taxes on a net basis over the next  couple of years as a result of the legislation.   This legislation and its targeted investments aimed at lowering costs  for American families is only one of a string of positive  accomplishments that we have been able to do in this Congress,  coordinating with President Biden. Other major legislation in the 117th  Congress includes the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, which will make  America more competitive by bringing home domestic production of  semiconductors and investing in innovation and science; the bipartisan  Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring Our Promise to Address  Comprehensive Toxics Act, known as the PACT Act, which provides  healthcare benefits for all generations of toxic-exposed veterans for  the first time in our Nation's history and will improve access to care  for all our veterans--promises made, promises kept; the Bipartisan  Safer Communities Act, which is the first major gun safety legislation  Congress has approved in decades; the bipartisan Infrastructure  Investment and Jobs Act, one of the biggest, most comprehensive Federal  commitments to repairing and modernizing our Nation's infrastructure in  modern history; the Keep Kids Fed Act, which the Senate passed  unanimously, that extended essential funding for schools, daycare  providers, and communities to ensure healthy meals for children  throughout the school year and summer; and the American Rescue Plan  Act, which Democrats passed in March of 2021 to provide billions of  dollars in relief to help Americans recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.   We have done all this, and we are reducing the deficit by $2  trillion.   Let me talk a little bit about the CHIPS and Science Act.  Semiconductors are crucial to nearly every sector of our economy. They  are in our cars, our trucks, medical devices, 5G telecommunications  equipment, and the list goes on and on and on. America created the  semiconductor industry in the 1960s. We ceded the global leadership in  the seventies. We regained it, to an extent, in the nineties but have  lost it again. In 1990, the U.S. share of semiconductor manufacturing  was 37 percent. By 2020, that share had declined to 12 percent.   The CHIPS and Science Act gets the United States back on track with  respect to domestic semiconductor manufacturing, which is crucial for  our national and economic security. This is a national security issue  that provides $54 billion in grants to domestic manufacturers and  another $24 billion in tax credits through the Creating Helpful  Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Fund.   The substitute amendment also authorizes $102 billion over the next 5  years for the National Science Foundation, the Department of Commerce,  and the National Institute of Standards and Technology--a $52 billion  increase over the Congressional Budget Office baseline.   These funds will be a shot in the arm for domestic manufacturing.  Here is a list of some firms that plan to use the funding to expand or  establish manufacturing facilities right here in the United States:  Intel and TSMC plan to build factories in Ohio and Arizona;  GlobalFoundries wants to expand a facility in Upstate New York;  SkyWater Technology and Purdue University want to collaborate on a new  $1.8 billion factory and research facility in West Lafayette, IN; IBM  and State University of New York at Albany want to establish a  semiconductor research center in Albany. And the list goes go on and on  and on. We are preparing for America to continue to lead in  manufacturing, particularly high-tech manufacturing.   I also want to highlight the science provisions in the bill. It  authorizes $20 billion to the first-of-its-kind NSF Directorate of  Technology, Innovation and Partnerships, which will accelerate domestic  development of critical national and economic security technologies  such as artificial intelligence, quantum computing, advanced  manufacturing, 6G communications, energy, and material science. We are  going to be the leaders in these areas. We should be.   It authorizes $9 billion--$4 billion over CBO baseline for several  National Institutes of Science and Technology programs, including  tripling of funding for the Manufacturing Extension Program, leveraging  that program to create a National Supply Chain Database, which will  assist businesses with supplier scouting and minimize supply chain  disruptions; and with NASA, the Artemis Program to return Americans to  the Moon as a prelude to sending humans to Mars is fully authorized and  funded.   The science provisions in this bill also extend the International  Space Station through 2030 and support a balanced science portfolio,  including Earth science observations and continued development of the  Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. We are the leaders of the space  telescope. I am proud of all the work that is done in my State of  Maryland and the images that we see from outer space.   The provisions codify the Planetary Defense Coordination Office and  requires NASA to continue efforts to protect Earth from asteroids and  comets. In this regard, this Monday, the Double Asteroid Redirection  Test--a Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab mission--will  deliberately crash a probe into a ``moon'' of a double asteroid to  shift its orbit.   It is amazing that we can do this. We are the leaders in science, and  we are making sure we are going to be the leaders in science and in  space moving forward.   I introduced the Cleaner, Quieter Airplanes Act in the previous  Congress and again in this Congress, and I am pleased the CHIPS and  Science bill directs NASA to continue research in aeronautics,  including the use of experimental aircraft to advance aircraft  efficiency and supersonic flight.   The PACT Act, in addition to providing the historic relief to toxic- exposed veterans, boosts claims processing; bolsters the Veterans'  Administration's workforce; and invests in VA healthcare facilities  nationwide to ensure the Agency can meet the immediate and future needs  of every veteran it serves, including the 300,000-plus veterans who  live in the State of Maryland. I will tell you, it provides for  improvements to the community health centers in Prince George's and  Baltimore City for our veterans.   The Safer Communities Act closes loopholes that allowed convicted  domestic violence abusers to buy firearms legally. It boosts funding  for community violence intervention and prevention initiatives, and it  provides hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to improve and  expand mental healthcare.   On the bipartisan infrastructure package, funding is flowing right  now to improve Maryland's transit, ports, roads, and bridges; expand  broadband availability; and fix our aging drinking water and wastewater  system. The bill provides $17 billion in port infrastructure and  waterways. Congestion in American ports was a key factor in the  disruption of the global supply chain. Expanding and modernizing port  infrastructure will help ensure that American manufacturers and  producers can move their goods to markets around the world. The bill  also invests $25 billion in our airports. Modernizing our airport  infrastructure will help keep people and products moving around the  country and the world.  [[Page S4961]]    I am particularly pleased the legislation includes $238 million for  the Chesapeake Bay Program. The bill also includes my bipartisan  legislation to make permanent and expand the Minority Business  Development Agency, which is the only Federal Agency dedicated to  supporting minority-owned businesses.    The American Rescue Plan provides tens of billions of dollars to  support vaccination and COVID-19 testing, driving down the death rate  from the virus by 90 percent. The bill also invested in hard-hit  communities and brought concrete relief to the Nation at a time of  great need. I was especially proud of the investments we made to help  save so many small businesses throughout Maryland and the Nation.   From the American Rescue Plan to the Inflation Reduction Act, and  everything in between, these and other legislative accomplishments have  helped address important needs across Maryland and our Nation.   At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, over 20 million Americans had  lost their jobs. And the unemployment rate rose to 14.7 percent in  April of 2020. The number of employed Americans now exceeds the  prepandemic high--the second fastest job market recovery since 1981.  The number of Americans working is at an alltime high. And the  unemployment rate has dropped a half-century low of 3.5 percent.   Since President Biden assumed office, the economy added nearly  700,000 new manufacturing jobs. This represents the strongest  manufacturing job growth since the 1950s. Manufacturing job growth in  2021 alone exceeded any other single year going back nearly 30 years.   Over the past year, the construction and new manufacturing facilities  in the United States has grown by an estimated 116 percent. In recent  surveys, the CEOs, 80 percent were either in the process of moving  manufacturing operations back to the United States from China or were  considering doing just that.   While unemployment continues at historic lows and gas prices are  declining rapidly, we are still facing challenges. Food prices, rent,  and other costs are still too high. The Federal Reserve has had to  raise interest rates, which is painful for families and businesses  alike. Most mainstream economists believe that we can avoid a recession  and the economy will have a soft landing despite the supply chain  challenges we continue to face because of COVID and Russia's war in  Ukraine. This would be a truly historic accomplishment.   President Kennedy said:         Our responsibility is one of decision, for to govern is to       choose.    Our legislative achievements over the last 20 months demonstrate that  Congress can be productive and the Federal Government is a powerful  force for good.   I hope we choose to remain on that path--Democrats and Republicans  alike--because there is still so much we can do and need to do to help  the American people.   I yield the floor.
