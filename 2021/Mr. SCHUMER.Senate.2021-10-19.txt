 Mr. President, last night, I began the process for the  Senate to hold a vote on the Freedom to Vote Act, a commonsense  proposal that would make it easier for every eligible American to  participate in free and fair elections.   The bill, which my colleagues, including yourself, very diligently  have worked on for months to put together will set basic standards to  improve ballot access across the country, end partisan gerrymandering,  and fight the influence of dark money and special interests in our  politics. It will go a long way toward restoring people's faith in our  democracy while respecting the role of States in administering  elections.   Every Senate Democrat has united around this legislation, and I thank  all of my colleagues, including you, Mr. President, who worked so hard  on this bill. I especially want to thank my friend Senator Manchin, who  has spent weeks reaching out to our Republican colleagues in an effort  to find common ground. I applaud him for his commitment to trying to  get something done on this issue in a bipartisan way if we can.   The clock is ticking for this Chamber to take meaningful action to  protect Americans' right to the franchise. So, tomorrow, the Senate  will vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to the Freedom to Vote  Act.   Every Senator will have to answer a straightforward question: Should  the Senate be allowed to simply begin a debate on voting rights, as has  been done many times throughout our history? That is what tomorrow's  vote is about: Do the Members of this Chamber think protecting our  democracy is worthy of even a debate in the Senate?   Senate Democrats think it absolutely is. If our Republican colleagues  don't like our ideas for fighting voter suppression and guarding  against election subversion, then they ought to tell us what they have  in mind. If they are so confident of their position, then let's debate  the issue on the Senate floor. What is there to be afraid of by  allowing simply a debate?   Democrats are ready to work with Republicans in good faith if they  vote to begin a debate on voting rights. We know disagreements run  deep. We don't hide from that. But if our Republican colleagues have  good ideas, we will work with them. We will listen to them, and if  these ideas are truly aligned with the goals of this bill to protect  our democracy, we will work to include them in the final text.  [[Page S7038]]    What Republicans should not do--what they must not do--is squelch any  chance for the Senate to debate something as critical and sacrosanct as  the right to vote, nor should they pretend like the Federal Government  has no role to play in protecting our democracy. On the contrary,  throughout history, the Federal Government has sometimes been the only  remedy when States try to suppress the vote. And no honest observer can  look at the way the States have changed election laws this last year  and pretend that there is nothing malicious afoot.   As Senator Manchin said earlier this year regarding congressional  action on voting rights, inaction is not an option. Let me repeat that  because this is one place where Senator Manchin and I agree. As Senator  Manchin said earlier this year regarding congressional action on voting  rights, ``Inaction is not an option.'' Inaction is not an option. I  agree. All 49 other Democrats agree with Senator Manchin. Inaction is  not an option.   The Senate can rise to the task if given the chance, but its Members  must vote to begin debate first.    Pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Committee on Banking,  Housing, and Urban Affairs being tied on the question of reporting, I  move to discharge the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban  Affairs from further consideration of Brian Eddie Nelson, of  California, to be Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, for the information of the Senate, we  expect the vote to discharge the nomination to occur about 5:30 p.m.  today.   I yield the floor.

Madam President, I now ask for a second reading and, in  order to place the bills on the calendar under the provisions of rule  XIV, I object to my own request, all en bloc.
