 Mr. President, I am honored to follow my colleague from  Wisconsin, and I rise as well regarding the nomination of Judge Ketanji  Brown Jackson to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of  the United States.   As some of you will recall, one of our colleagues from New Jersey,  Senator Booker, delivered unusually poignant and unscripted remarks  recently in the Senate Judiciary Committee about Judge Jackson's  nomination and credentials and character. He moved many of those who  were present to tears and spelled out as only he can what this  nomination means for our Nation and particularly for the millions of  Black Americans who look at Judge Jackson and see their own mothers,  their own daughters, their own sisters, and their own friends.   Unfazed by the unfair attacks that day on Judge Jackson, our  colleague said these words:         Nobody is going to steal my joy.    I second that emotion. This historic moment and this historic nominee  bring me great joy as well.   For the next several minutes, I am going to talk about Judge  Jackson's impeccable qualifications. I am going to discuss her sterling  record as a public servant, including nearly a decade as a Federal  judge, that makes her supremely qualified to serve on our Supreme  Court.   I also want to talk for a bit about the historic nature of this  nomination and attempt to put in context just what it means for our  Nation and for me personally to cast a vote to confirm the first Black  woman to serve on the Supreme Court, because today, indeed, it brings a  lot of us real joy in this body to know that we have the opportunity  and the privilege to play a small part in Judge Jackson's confirmation.   Similar to President Reagan delivering on his promise years ago to  nominate the first woman--Justice Sandra Day O'Connor--to the Supreme  Court, President Biden has delivered on his own promise. He has  nominated the first Black woman to the highest Court in our land, and  our Nation can be proud of the nominee we are here to debate and to  confirm.    Let me begin, however, by taking just a moment to thank Justice  Stephen Breyer for his exemplary service to our country.   As many of our colleagues know, Justice Breyer was nominated to the  Supreme Court by President Clinton in 1994, when I was serving as  Governor of Delaware. Our Presiding Officer was an astronaut up in the  ether above our planet. Justice Breyer was confirmed, some will recall,  by an overwhelming bipartisan vote--87 to 9.   Justice Breyer served our country with distinction for over six  decades, including as a corporal in the Army Reserve, a Federal circuit  court judge, and for nearly three decades on the Bench of the highest  Court in our land.   Justice Breyer is known as a consensus builder on the Bench--a trait  I have long admired in judges dating back to my time as Governor of  Delaware, when I had the opportunity to nominate literally dozens of  highly qualified individuals to serve on Delaware's highly respected  courts. Over the past three decades, Justice Breyer has helped forge  principled compromises to protect the constitutional rights of all  Americans and to uphold the rule of law.   During a small ceremony at the White House in January when Justice  Breyer first announced that he would be retiring, he brought with him a  pocket copy of the U.S. Constitution. In his brief remarks, Justice  Breyer reminded us of how Lincoln and Washington and so many other  giants of American history have described that document, our  Constitution. They described it as an experiment.   As Justice Breyer reminded us, during the time of Washington and  Lincoln, there were plenty of folks who doubted our system of  government could ever work, plenty of folks who said: Well, that is a  great idea in principle, but it will never work, at least not for long.  But, as Justice Breyer said that day--he said: It is our job to show  them that it does work and it will continue to work.   Our Constitution has made possible the greatest experiment in  democracy in the history of the world. Over the past several years, I  have spoken any number of times on the Senate floor about the wisdom of  the Framers of our Constitution. In the hot summer of 1787, they met in  Philadelphia, as you will recall, and designed an intricate system of  checks and balances. Article I dealt with the Congress; article II  dealt with the executive branch of our government; and article III, the  judiciary.   America is the longest running experiment in democracy, and our  Constitution is more replicated across the globe than any other  Constitution in the world. But our Constitution has never been perfect.  The Framers never pretended that it was perfect.   This past weekend, I was privileged to give the keynote address  during a commissioning ceremony at the Port of Wilmington for a new  Virginia-class, fast-attack, nuclear submarine that bears the name of  Delaware--the first Navy vessel named after the State of Delaware in  over 100 years. At the end of my remarks, there was a crowd of about  several thousand people gathered on the Delaware River, right beside  the submarine and its crew. Among the folks in that crowd were the  President of our country and the First Lady of the United States, Dr.  Jill Biden, who was the sponsor of the boat.   I asked everyone there to stand and hold hands and join me in  reciting the preamble to the Constitution, which begins something like  this:         We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more       perfect Union--    It doesn't say ``a perfect Union''; rather, it says ``a more perfect  Union.'' Why is that? Because our Framers understood that this would be  an experiment and that it would be up to each generation that follows  to decide how this experiment will proceed and if it will succeed, up  to each generation to face those who say that this great experiment in  democracy will never work.   It is through our actions on days like this that we show them that it  does  [[Page S2030]]  still work. Judge Jackson's nomination is proof that, indeed, we have  made this Nation more perfect over time and that despite our  divisions--and we have them--generations of Americans have worked  together, often across party lines, across State lines, across  philosophical lines, to make a nomination like this possible.   Like many Americans, I have seen remarkable progress in my own  lifetime. While my sister and I were born in a coal-mining town in  Beckley, WV, we were raised in Danville, VA, right on the North  Carolina border, just north of Greensboro.   Danville, VA, was known as the Last Capital of the Confederacy.  Forced to flee Richmond after Union victories started piling up in  early 1865, Confederate President Jefferson Davis actually held his  Cabinet's last meeting--their last meeting--in Danville, where I grew  up. He did that a few days before Lee surrendered to Grant at  Appomattox.   Although it was nearly a century after the Civil War ended when my  family moved to Delaware--nearly a century--racial prejudice and  discrimination still prevailed there.   Growing up, my sister and I witnessed racism up close and personal.  Every morning, for example, our schoolbus would take us to an all-White  high school 10 miles away from our home, and about half an hour later,  another schoolbus would come by and pick up Black students who had been  waiting along with us and take them to their school, past my school and  another 10 miles to their school, which was not a better school. It was  a school that none of us would be especially proud of.   If my sister and I went to lunch with our family, we would sit at the  lunch counter, but Black families were denied service.   If we went to the movie theater in Danville, VA, we sat on the ground  floor; the Black patrons had to sit up in the balcony.   That is the America many of us lived in not all that long ago--the  same America that Judge Jackson's parents, Johnny and Ellery Brown,  were born into. It was an America where discrimination on the basis of  race was sanctioned by State governments; an America where the judicial  doctrine of ``separate but equal'' was still enshrined into our laws by  the Supreme Court; where arbitrary literacy tests kept Black Americans  away from poll booths; an America that treated back Americans like  second-class citizens despite a civil war, an Emancipation  Proclamation, and ratification of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments  to our Constitution. It was an America that was far from perfect.   But through decades of struggle, and thanks to the heroes of the  civil rights movement, our Nation began to confront injustice in our  communities and inequality in our laws. And thanks to brilliant Black  lawyers like Thurgood Marshall and Wilmington, Delaware's Louis  Redding, a number of legal challenges to America's separate but unequal  classrooms went all the way to the Supreme Court.   And perhaps the greatest decision in the Supreme Court's history,  Brown v. Board of Education declared to the Nation that the principle  of separate but equal could never truly be equal. Brown v. Board of  Education did not make our Nation perfect. But it was proof that when  the Supreme Court is at its best, America and our Constitution are at  their best.   The Supreme Court changed the America that my sister and I lived in-- that Judge Jackson's parents lived in--for the better. Combined with  the landmark civil rights bills of the 1960s, including the Civil  Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, it made the  America that Judge Jackson was born into more perfect than it was for  the generations that came before her.   And I hope and pray that each generation will continue to recognize  the uniquely American opportunity that our Constitution affords us--the  ability to change our communities and our laws for the better--and take  on the task themselves.   As Judge Jackson stated in her confirmation hearing, her parents  taught her that--and I want to quote her. This is a quote from her:         Unlike the many barriers that they had to face growing up,       my path was clearer, such that if I worked hard and believed       in myself, in America I could do anything or be anything I       wanted to be.    And, my goodness, did she work hard. The daughter of two graduates of  HBCU colleges, Judge Jackson was a star on her high school debate team  and was elected ``mayor'' of Palmetto Junior High School and student  body president of Miami Palmetto Senior High School. Judge Jackson then  graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University and cum laude from  Harvard Law School, where she was an editor of the Harvard Law Review.  She clerked for not one, not two, but three Federal judges, including  for Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.   Judge Jackson could have done anything she wanted with a resume like  that--anything--including pursuing any number of well-paying  opportunities in the legal profession. Instead, Judge Jackson chose  public service, in part because service was instilled in her by her  parents, both of whom were public schoolteachers. And public service,  no doubt, runs in her family.   Her younger brother felt a similar call to serve. After graduating  from another fine HBCU university, Howard University right here in  Washington, Judge Jackson's brother enlisted--enlisted--in the U.S.  Army right after the 9/11 attacks. He was deployed to Iraq. He also  ended up going to Egypt. And then following in the footsteps of two of  Judge Jackson's uncles, he became a Baltimore police officer.   When I had the opportunity to meet with Judge Jackson in my office  last month, we talked about a wide range of things. Among them, we  talked about the diversity of her professional experience, including  her time as a public defender right here in the Nation's Capital.   As most of us know, public defenders work very long hours for very  little pay. They represent clients who cannot afford an expensive  lawyer, and in some cases, they cannot afford any lawyer at all. But  our system of government affords every person charged with a crime the  presumption of innocence, the right to a fair trial, and the right to a  competent defense.   It is a testament to the character of Judge Jackson that she is so  committed to equal justice under the law that she was willing to commit  the early stages of her career to this important work.   If confirmed, Judge Jackson would be the first Supreme Court Justice  to have served as a Federal public defender in this Court's long,  storied history and the first with significant criminal defense  experience since Justice Marshall.   Now, in 2005, I voted to confirm Chief Justice John Roberts to the  Supreme Court; not every Democrat did that. As you may recall, he was  appointed by former President George W. Bush, a Republican. Some of my  colleagues might remember, before Chief Justice Roberts was ever  nominated to a Federal judgeship, he worked in private practice where  his firm represented an individual appealing a death penalty conviction  for the murder of eight people.   During his 2005 confirmation hearing to the Supreme Court, Chief  Justice Roberts was asked about it and stated--and I want to quote him  right now. Here is what he said:         In representing clients, in serving as a lawyer, it's not       my job to decide whether that's a good idea or a bad       idea. The job of the lawyer is to articulate the legal       argument on behalf of the client.    Chief Justice Roberts likened this work to John Adams defending  British soldiers after the Boston Massacre, saying that Adams:       . . . helped show that what our [Founding Fathers] were about       was defending the rule of law, not undermining it. And that       principle that you don't identify the lawyer with the       particular views of a client or the views that the lawyer       advances on behalf of the client is critical to the fair       administration of justice.    Like Chief Justice Roberts, Judge Jackson has lived up to the values  set out over 230 years ago, and in doing so, she has protected and  defended our Constitution.   After her time as a public defender, Judge Jackson served as a vice  chair for the U.S. Sentencing Commission. She was confirmed unanimously  by the U.S. Senate.   Judge Jackson was then nominated to the U.S. District Court for the  District of Columbia. She was confirmed unanimously by the U.S. Senate  for that post.  [[Page S2031]]    And last year, President Biden nominated Judge Jackson to serve on  the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, oftentimes referred to as our Nation's  second highest court. Yet again, she was confirmed by the U.S. Senate  with bipartisan support.   During the decade that she served as a Federal judge, Judge Jackson  established a track record as a consensus builder, just like Justice  Breyer. During the decade that she served as a Federal judge, Judge  Jackson has been evenhanded and she has been impartial. During the  decade that she has served as a Federal judge, Judge Jackson has ruled  for and against the government, in favor of prosecutors and for  criminal defendants, and for both civil plaintiffs and defendants.   As Judge Jackson told our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee  recently, she has, she said:       a duty to decide cases based solely on the law, without fear       or favor, prejudice or passion.    Judge Jackson is always guided by our Constitution. And it is why she  received the support of judges nominated by Democrat and Republicans  alike, by law enforcement and the civil rights community, and by  Republicans and Democrats in this body on multiple occasions.   Now, these past few weeks, I heard some of our colleagues on the  other side of the aisle use this confirmation process to mention the  unfairness toward past nominees. Well, every one of these nominees-- every nominee that they referred to received a hearing and a vote. The  same cannot be said of Merrick Garland, former chief justice of the DC  Court of Appeals who was nominated by former President Obama to serve  on the Supreme Court. Judge Garland did not receive a hearing. Judge  Garland did not receive a vote because our colleagues on the other side  of the aisle decided to invent a new rule, and most of them even  refused to meet with Merrick Garland, one of the finest servants I have  ever known. And this shameful blockade led to what many Americans,  myself included, view as a stolen Supreme Court seat, a permanent stain  on this body's reputation and a reduction in the Supreme Court's  credibility.   Then 4 years later, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  broke their own precedent and invented yet another new rule to confirm  a Supreme Court Justice 8 days--8 days before election day, when tens  of millions of ballots had already been cast.   And while I will never forget this truly shameful behavior, this week  we have a chance to move away from politics. We have a chance to place  an extremely well-qualified nominee to the Supreme Court and to do so  with the support of Senators from both sides of the aisle.   In the end, the American people need to trust the Supreme Court to  make decisions on questions that impact every single American: whether  we have access to clean air is one of those issues, whether we have  access to clean water, whether we have access to good healthcare,  whether women have the right to make their own healthcare decisions. We  need a Supreme Court that stays above the political fray. We need a  Supreme Court that calls ``balls and strikes,'' as Chief Justice  Roberts once said--a Supreme Court that maintains the trust of the  American people as the arbiter of a Constitution that protects the  civil rights of all Americans.    Judge Jackson will bring a breadth and a diversity of experience to  the Supreme Court not often seen. Judge Jackson's resume--Harvard;  Harvard Law; clerk to three Federal judges, including Justice Breyer; a  public defender; U.S. Sentencing Commission vice chairman; Federal  district court judge; and Federal Circuit Court judge--is evidence that  she is among the most-qualified individuals in our country for this  esteemed role.   Her character and her intellect are beyond reproach. She weathered a  grueling confirmation process with grace and dignity.   Let me close by noting that Judge Jackson's nomination is proof that  today in America one's qualifications and unrelenting work ethic earn  you your spot, that public service is valued and commitment to the  principles that protect our country do mean something, that the  sacrifices of one generation slowly but surely make for a better  America for the next generation.   So count me among the millions of Americans who are inspired by Judge  Jackson's life story, a uniquely American story that provides proof  that our Nation can be made more perfect over time.   And it brings this Senator from Delaware, who grew up in Danville,  the last capital of the Confederacy, into a much different America. It  brings me great joy to be able to cast a vote for Judge Ketanji Brown  Jackson to serve as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the  United States.   And with that I yield the floor.
