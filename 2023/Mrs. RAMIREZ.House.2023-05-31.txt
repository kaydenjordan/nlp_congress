 Mr. Speaker, today we will vote on a bill that reflects  how little Republicans care about everyday people, even their own  constituents.   We should be voting on a straightforward extension of the debt  ceiling, but instead Republicans are more than willing to force our  Nation and economy into default just to score political wins.   They want to increase work requirements on SNAP, a cruel resumption  of student loan payments, and more restrictions on TANF. They are  clearly not here for families who are struggling. Well, I am.   I am here for the 1.3 million student loan borrowers in Illinois who  are being forced a resumption of payments when people are struggling to  keep up with their bills.   I am here for the 76,836 people across Illinois who are counting on  TANF cash assistance. I am also here for the 1.9 million residents of  Illinois who all count on SNAP to put food on their table.   Representing them is my responsibility, and it is why I know that we  could have worked on a clean debt ceiling, but this hostage situation  is not something I can vote for.                            ____________________
