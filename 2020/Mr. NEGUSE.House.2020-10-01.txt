 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the updated  Heroes Act.  [[Page H5424]]    I want to thank House leadership and, of course, our distinguished  chair of the Appropriations Committee, Chairwoman Lowey, for  introducing this vital update.   First, let me just say, look, we are all entitled to our own views  and opinions in this Chamber, but we are not entitled to our own set of  facts.   As I have heard some of the comments from my friends on the other  side of the aisle, I have been a bit confused because, as we all know,  4 months ago, this Chamber passed, on a bipartisan basis, the Heroes  Act, $3.4 trillion, to provide an economic lifeline to small business  and working families struggling across this country.   The Senate declared a so-called pause, decided that they would do  nothing, wouldn't meet us halfway, wouldn't come talk to the House  Democrats to try to reach a compromise bill. So we continued to get to  work, and we put together an updated Heroes Act that is now a $2  trillion bill that provides an economic lifeline to so many Americans  across our great country.   The fact that House Democrats continue to make every effort to work  with anyone in good faith to deliver for the people of our country, in  my view, is something that we should continue to pursue in this great  Chamber.                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I want to say one of the reasons I support  this bill is because it includes significant relief for small  businesses, which are the backbone of Colorado's economy.   My Republican colleague and I,   John Curtis, introduced a bill just  a few weeks ago to provide EIDL relief, essentially ensuring that we  would exclude the EIDL advance when determining forgiveness for PPP  loans.   We have heard from countless business owners in my district, in Fort  Collins and Loveland, who are struggling and who have told us that this  provision would provide needed relief to ensure that they can continue  to keep their businesses solvent, keep their doors open, serving the  people of our great State of Colorado and, of course, my colleague, the  State of Utah, and small business owners across the country.   That provision is in this bill. It is in the updated Heroes Act,  alongside so many other important provisions to help small businesses  in our country recover.   I say to my colleagues: Let's get this done. Let's pass this bill.  Let's provide the relief that the American people are counting on us to  provide.
