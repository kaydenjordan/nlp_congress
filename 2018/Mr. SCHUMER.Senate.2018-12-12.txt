 First, Mr. President, let me add my words of fond  farewell to the senior Senator of Utah. Back in the good old days, we  worked on a whole lot of things together, when the place was a little  less partisan--immigration, patents, and so many other things. He was a  fine legislator and a fine craftsman. I wish him and his entire large,  beautiful family the best.   I also note that Leader McConnell talked about the good bipartisan  work we have created in the farm bill, something good for his State and  something he has cared about for a long time. I hope the leader--and I  will talk more about this later--will use the same bipartisan spirit  and help us to deal with the appropriations bills that are still  awaiting our agreement.  [[Page S7458]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, let me talk a little bit about yesterday  afternoon. Yesterday, Leader Pelosi and I met with President Trump  about funding the government past next week. We gave the President two  options to keep the government open. The first option: Pass the six  bipartisan appropriations bills and a 1-year CR for the Department of  Homeland Security only. And, if they don't like that one, a 1-year CR  for the rest of government.   We told the President that both of these options would pass both  Chambers. It was his choice to either accept one of those two options  or shut the government down. Yesterday, unfortunately, it was clear  that the President is clinging to his position of billions of dollars  for an unnecessary, ineffective, border wall. President Trump will soon  realize that his position will not result in a wall but will result in  a Trump shutdown, and he seems to relish the idea, amazingly enough.   The President has called for a shutdown at least 20 times since he  came to office. You can add at least five or six more times to that  number from our meeting. Here is a direct quote from President Trump  yesterday: ``If we don't get what we want, one way or the other . . . I  [President Trump] will shut down the government. . . . `'   President Trump said:         I am proud to shut down the government. . . . [so] I will       take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not       going to blame you [meaning Democrats] for it. . . . I will       take the mantle of shutting it down.    It was astounding that any President, even this one, would say that.  No President should ever say that he or she would be proud to shut the  government down. No President should so glibly use the American  Government and the millions of workers who work so hard as a bargaining  chip, but that is where President Trump is headed.   President Trump made clear that he will hold parts of the government  hostage for a petty campaign pledge to fire up his base. That is all it  is. He never researched the wall. He talked about it on the campaign  and he said: Oh, Mexico will pay for it. If President Trump holds to  this position--that unless he gets his wall, he will shut down the  government--who will suffer needlessly? The American people.   Of course, Leader Pelosi and I had to spend much of the meeting  trying to untie the knots in logic the President was tying himself in.  President Trump started by bragging about how great border security is  going under his watch. That, by the way, is with no wall. If it were  truly the case as the President said, that border security is better  than it has ever been, what is wrong with another year of the same  funding? If things are going so great, why does he have to threaten to  shut down the government for his $5 billion wall? It makes no sense.  None of it is based on fact.   Mr. President, there is no wall.   Mr. President, Mexico has not agreed to pay for it. None of that is  true, and it is difficult--if nearly impossible--to negotiate with a  President in front of the press who peddles such blatant and dangerous  falsehoods.   Because Leader Pelosi and I simply didn't go along with him,  President Trump threw a temper tantrum and promised to shut down the  government unless he got what he wanted. Evidently, the Trump temper  tantrum continued even after the meeting, with news reports saying he  threw papers around the White House in frustration.   Why did he continue? Because someone finally spoke truth to power.  Someone finally contradicted him when he throws around blatant  falsehoods on such a regular basis. The President is so used to  obsequious advisers who fail to dispel his false and made-up facts that  he lives in a cocoon of his own mistruth. Leader Pelosi and I had to  tell him, no, Mr. President, that is not true. We had to puncture that  cocoon, and he threw a temper tantrum because of it.   It is unfortunate that we have arrived at this point. The President's  advisers should have been telling the President the truth all along.  Unfortunately, too many of my Republican colleagues in the Senate and  in the House seem too afraid to tell the President when he is wrong,  even though they know he is wrong. They find it easier to throw up  their hands and wait for someone else to solve the problem or  capitulate and agree with the President.   At the moment, Senator McConnell, the majority leader of this body  and my friend, is staying as far away as he can from the year-end  spending fight. We didn't hear a peep about it today. Leader McConnell  says he doesn't want a shutdown, but he refuses to engage with the  President to tell him what is transparently obvious to everyone else:  There will be no additional money for the wall. We need to pass a  continuing resolution for DHS or for all the remaining Agencies to keep  the government open.   Leader McConnell has an obligation as majority leader, and that is to  help persuade President Trump to take one of the two options we  offered. The idea that Senator McConnell has nothing to do with  appropriations as majority leader of the Senate, who still is on that  committee, does not withstand the slightest scrutiny.   If, unfortunately, the President refuses to compromise, Leader  McConnell will not be able to avoid this issue. In the unfortunate  event that President Trump causes a shutdown, the Democratic House will  come into power January 3 and pass one of our two options to fund the  government, and then it will fall right back in Leader McConnell's lap.   My view is--for whatever it is worth to him--it is better to solve  this now because the leader is going to be stuck with it 2 weeks from  now, after an unfortunate government shutdown caused by his President,  if he doesn't act now.   If I were a Republican, I would get involved right now and help pull  the President back from the brink. Democrats have given him two  reasonable options. We made it crystal clear that Democrats are for  keeping the government open. We have no demands beyond that, only the  President does.   If President Trump wants to continue his temper tantrum ahead of the  holidays and cause a shutdown, it is now so clear it is solely on his  back. We hope the President chooses one of the reasonable options we  gave him yesterday, and we hope the country can avoid a Trump shutdown.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
