 Mr. Speaker, today marks 3 years since the terrible  tragedy that took the lives of 49 people at the Pulse nightclub in  Orlando.   That is 36 months, 156 weeks, 1,095 days that the victims' families  and loved ones have had to live without their presence and without  their light.   This single incident shook our community to its core and forever  changed us. But our city showed that we are a vibrant community that  prides itself on its love and inclusion.   Following the tragedy, hundreds came out to donate blood and help  their fellow brothers and sisters in their time of need. The site was  transformed into a makeshift memorial, one that was full of love,  thoughtful notes, and flowers.   This was the largest attack against LGBTQ people in U.S. history. As  we celebrate Pride Month, we must honor their memories, be inspired by  their legacies, and recognize the positive contributions the LGBTQ  community offers to the world.   While those memories may be raw and remembering those we lost may  still hurt, we cannot forget that the love that the 49 victims brought  into this world will always be stronger than the hate that stole their  lives on that day.   Hate will never win. Love always will.   The memories of those who lost their lives will never ever been  forgotten.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of my amendment, which I am proud to  co-lead with 25 members of the Future Forum, a generational caucus that  focuses on issues important to younger Americans.   My amendment would provide additional support for youth suicide  prevention strategies in K-12 schools, colleges, and universities,  juvenile justice systems, and foster care systems.   My amendment would provide an additional $2 million for the Garrett  Lee Smith Youth Suicide Prevention State and Campus grants.   Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth in America.  In the past decade, approximately 22,000 Americans ages 10 to 19 have  died by suicide.   This is staggering, and we must remember that behind every abstract  statistic lies a shattered human life, a brokenhearted family, and a  distraught community.   This issue hits close to home for families in my central Florida  district where, in recent years, we have mourned the loss of far too  many students to suicide. Just months ago, a student died by suicide on  a school campus. She was only 17 years old.   Last year, I held youth and mental health advisory board meetings in  my district. My constituents told me that there was a need for  additional resources on campus and in our communities to help students  and young adults treat mental health conditions before they become  serious or even life-threatening.   That is precisely what our amendment would do.   Simply put, this grant funding will help save lives.   Madam Chair, I respectfully ask my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to support it.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro), the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Labor, Health  and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Utah  (Mr. McAdams), my colleague and fellow Future Forum member.    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
