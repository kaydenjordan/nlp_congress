 Madam Speaker, all Texans know that our stars are big and  bright at night. But lately, 16 stars have been the biggest and  brightest ever seen in Fort Bend County.   Here they are. These stars' names are Alana, Britney, Karly, Taylor,  Tiana, Randee, Skylar, Charlie, Claire, Reagan, Baleigh, Nia, Tyler,  Lindsey, Kendall, and Peyton. They revolve around a star called Coach  Lori McLaughlin. They are the 2018 Ridge Point Panthers volleyball  team.   We are so proud they are State runners-up in volleyball in Texas: 47- 6 was their record, 14-0 in district play. They have a warning for 2019  and beyond: The Panthers are still hungry and will be back. You can  count on it.                            ____________________
