 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of women and  their fundamental rights to reproductive healthcare.  [[Page H6512]]    While MAGA Republicans want to rip away women's rights, House  Democrats remain committed to standing with women. We trust women.   For a second time, we will vote to pass the Women's Health Protection  Act to make the protections of Roe v. Wade the law of the land once  again. House Democrats will also pass the Ensuring Women's Right to  Reproductive Freedom Act, which will prevent Republicans from suing or  fining women who travel across State lines to obtain an abortion.   Trusting women to make their own personal healthcare decisions is  what we believe as Democrats. Controlling women and stripping away  their rights is what they are as Republicans.   Democrats won't give up the fight. We stand with women. We trust  women.                            ____________________
