 Madam Chair, the United States' relationship with  Taiwan is an indispensable component in our efforts to maintain peace  and stability in Asia and across the globe.   And in today's digital age, this relationship should include a strong  and robust partnership on cybersecurity.   Over the past few years, China has clearly demonstrated its  capability and willingness to conduct cyber-attacks against our  country, such as the state-sponsored economic espionage that led to the  indictment of Beijing-linked hackers last year.   On top of implementing strict retaliatory measures to deter this  malicious behavior, we should work proactively with our allies to  establish preventative defense plans that leverage cybersecurity  sharing strategies.   Taiwan is uniquely positioned to partner with us on our efforts to  combat Chinese cyber-attacks, and this amendment will help us move  closer to enhancing our collaboration in this space so that we stay  ahead of our adversaries.
