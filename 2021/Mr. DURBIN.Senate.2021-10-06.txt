 Madam President, today, the Senate will consider Sarah  Merriam's nomination to be a United States District Judge for the  District of Connecticut. I support the nomination of this highly  qualified jurist.   As a U.S. magistrate judge for over 6 years, Judge Merriam has  presided over hundreds of matters, including a number of trials that  proceeded to final judgment. She has proven herself to be evenhanded,  impartial, and mindful of the limited role that judges play in our  system of justice.   Judge Merriam also has extensive experience litigating in Federal  court--both in private practice and as an assistant Federal defender  for nearly 8 years.   Letters of support the Judiciary Committee received for Judge  Merriam's nomination underscore the widespread respect she has earned  for her skill, qualifications, temperament, and fidelity to the rule of  law. The letters came from both Democrats and Republicans and from  prosecutors and defense attorneys.   Two Republican attorneys who practice law in Connecticut--Ross  Garber, who has worked for numerous Republican officials, and Stanley  Twardy, Jr., who served as U.S. Attorney in Connecticut under President  Reagan--wrote: ``We are former advisors and appointees of Republican  officials and have been involved in the selection and vetting of  judges. Today we write in unqualified support of the nomination of  Magistrate Judge Sarah Merriam to serve as a judge on the United States  District Court for the District of Connecticut.''   They added, ``As a magistrate judge, Judge Merriam has been a  significant and valuable part of the life of the District Court in  Connecticut. As a United States District Judge she will be a rare asset  to the District and the judiciary as a whole.''   The Judiciary Committee also received a letter from 26 former Federal  prosecutors who served in the District of Connecticut. Among them are  three former U.S. Attorneys.   These former prosecutors praised Judge Merriam as a ``highly  qualified and competent jurist'' who ``applies the law fairly and  properly without regard to personal preference.''   They concluded with their assurance that Judge Merriam ``will serve  with distinction and honor'' in the District of Connecticut.   Judge Merriam was unanimously rated ``Well Qualified'' by the  American Bar Association.   She has the strong support of her home State Senators--Senators  Blumenthal and Murphy--and she received bipartisan support in the  Judiciary Committee, with Senators Tillis and Graham joining the  Democratic members in supporting her nomination.   I urge my colleagues to join me voting in support of Judge Merriam's  nomination.                          Vote on Merriam Nomination
