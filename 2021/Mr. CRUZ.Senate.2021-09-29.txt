 Mr. President.    Reserving the right to object. Mr. President, this  continues a discussion we have been having for days and indeed weeks  and indeed months. Joe Biden is being flagrantly  [[Page S6766]]  lawless, in that he is refusing to impose mandatory congressional  sanctions passed by Congress in the Countering America's Adversaries  Through Sanctions Act, also known as CAATSA.   CAATSA was designed for precisely the purpose of taking away the  President's discretion to impose sanctions on Russia in cases where  Congress deemed it necessary to mandate them.   CAATSA passed Congress overwhelmingly. The vote was 98 to 2. Indeed,  in September 2020, my colleague Senator Wyden wrote a letter that was  joined by 10 other Democrats about Russian malign activities.   Senator Wyden's letter stated: ``Congress has mandated a broad range  of sanctions tools, and it is long past time for the administration to  send a direct message to President Putin.''   The letter continues, specifically citing the ``sanctions mandated  provided for in'' CAATSA.   President Biden is legally obligated to Nord Stream 2 AG, the company  responsible for the planning, the construction, and the eventual  operation of Putin's Nord Stream 2 Pipeline.   Nord Stream 2 AG has committed acts that require the imposition of  these mandated sanctions under CAATSA Section 228. Section 228 mandates  sanctions on any company that conducts any ``significant  transactions,'' including ``deceptive transactions,'' for Russian  companies that are already sanctioned.   In May, the Biden State Department sent Congress a certification  confirming that Nord Stream 2 AG had engaged in those actions. It is  clear that Nord Stream 2 AG falls under the mandatory sanctions of  CAATSA. Nobody, not even the Biden administration, denies that the  Biden State Department sent that certification confirming those  actions. Nevertheless, President Biden and, in particular, the  Department of Treasury is refusing to implement the law.   I have spoken directly with Secretary Yellen. I have spoken directly  with the Deputy Secretary of Treasury. The law is clear and  unequivocal. And because of the political agenda of the Biden White  House, because of President Biden's desire to surrender to Vladimir  Putin and to give him a multibillion-dollar pipeline, weakening  America, weakening Europe, and giving vast resources to Putin to hold  Europe subject to energy blackmail, Treasury is refusing to follow the  law.   Nevertheless, I have been willing to offer a compromise. I have  placed holds on nominees to the State Department and some of the  nominees to the Treasury Department. And I have offered a compromise to  lift the holds on this nominee and other nominees to the Treasury  Department, and also to lift the holds on career nominees to State if  either the Biden administration follows the law in CAATSA and impose  sanctions. That is option A. That would be the best option.   Or option B, if they decide because, for whatever political reason,  they believe surrendering to Putin is a good idea notwithstanding  America's national security interest, there is a second option that I  have offered to lift those holds, which is they could impose the  sanctions under CAATSA and then immediately delist Nord Stream 2 AG.  That would prevent the sanctions from going into effect, but it would  also trigger an automatic vote here in this Congress to override that  decision.   I have made that offer, along with Senator Toomey, in writing months  ago. It is a reasonable compromise, and yet the Biden administration  won't take it. They won't take it because they are terrified, if and  when Congress votes on that override, that an overwhelming bipartisan  majority of Congress in the Senate and the House will vote to override  Joe Biden's indefensible decision to surrender to Vladimir Putin.   Nonetheless, in the spirit of reasonableness, I am happy to offer the  Senator from Oregon the same deal or a similar deal, at least, right  here and right now.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2894    Mr. President, there is a bill that I filed that imposes CAATSA 228  sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG. Every Democrat in this Chamber has  supported sanctions on Nord Stream 2.   In a moment, I am going to ask for unanimous consent to pass the  legislation simply mandating that the Biden administration, that the  Treasury Department--and this is a Treasury nominee that we are  discussing--follow the law.   If the Senator from Oregon will agree to my unanimous consent request  and that bill passes the Senate, I will not object to this nominee if  the Senator from Oregon is willing to accept that, because that will  move the process along. The objective is to stop this pipeline that  strengthens Putin, weakens Europe, and weakens America.   And, indeed, if we pass the legislation mandating the CAATSA  sanctions, I won't object to this nominee. When that legislation passes  the House, I will lift my hold on another Treasury nominee. And when  the President does the right thing and signs it into law, I will lift  my holds on all the Treasury nominees.   So it is a reasonable, incremental step forward that gives the  Senator from Oregon the chance to demonstrate that when Democrats give  speeches about how Nord Stream 2 is bad for America, bad for Europe,  bad for the environment but good for Russia and Putin, we can now  discover whether or not Democrats actually believe what they have said  in speeches so many times.   Therefore, I ask that the Senator modify his request so that in  addition to confirming the nomination and, as if in legislative  session, that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S.  2894, which is at the desk; that the bill be considered read a third  time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I recognize  that my friend from Oregon has been busy with affairs on the Finance  Committee and so has not been involved in the now 2 years of debate  over Nord Stream 2 on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But,  unfortunately, that has resulted in the Senator from Oregon being given  talking points--perhaps from the administration, perhaps from  colleagues--that are simply factually incorrect. I am sure that is  inadvertent.   The Senator from Oregon just said that there is no way to stop this  pipeline, and that the Trump administration failed to impose sanctions  to stop  [[Page S6767]]  the pipeline. Both of those statements are factually wrong.   I was the author of two separate pieces of legislation that passed  into law concerning Nord Stream 2. Both were bipartisan legislation.  Both, I authored with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, in the  Senate. Both passed with overwhelming bipartisan support from both  Houses of Congress.    The first bill passed in December of 2019. Nord Stream 2 at the time  was more than 90 percent complete, and the argument then that was being  pushed by Russian disinformation and that, sadly, has been echoed by  the Biden administration and was just echoed by the Senator from  Oregon--the argument from Russian disinformation was, the pipeline  can't be stopped; it is too late.   We know that was Russian disinformation because it was conclusively  disproved. Putin stopped building the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline the very  day that the Cruz-Shaheen bipartisan sanctions were signed into law-- not the next day, not the next week. That day, we stopped the pipeline  in its tracks.   But, Mr. President, it was not only stopped for 1 day; it was stopped  for more than a year. For December of 2019, for January, February,  March--every month in 2020, the pipeline lay dormant. It was a piece of  metal at the bottom of the ocean. So the claim that we cannot stop this  pipeline is flat-out false because we did.   By the way, when the Senator from Oregon said the Trump  administration couldn't stop this pipeline, that, again, is just  incorrect. When the President signed the legislation, the pipeline was  stopped that day. It remained stopped for over a year.   When did Putin return to building this pipeline? The date is  important. Putin returned to building the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline on  January 24, 2021, 4 days after Joe Biden was sworn into office. And he  did so because Joe Biden and his team had already conveyed weakness  that they would not enforce U.S. sanctions law and that they would roll  over and give Putin and Russia a generational geopolitical gift. The  only reason Putin began building again is because the Biden White House  defied U.S. law to surrender to Putin.   Now, Joe Biden is entitled to believe that is a good policy idea.  What he is not entitled to do is ignore U.S. law. And the Senator from  Oregon suggests this nominee has nothing to do with that. Well, it is  the Department of the Treasury that is ignoring the CAATSA law, that is  refusing to follow the policy.   Sadly, this moment marks a new threshold in that debate. Up until  this point, it has only been the Biden White House that has been  surrendering to Russia. Sadly, now we have a Democratic Member of the  Senate objecting to legislation to stop the Biden White House from  surrendering to Russia. That is a move in the wrong direction.   That being said, my offer of reasonable compromise remains if we can  come together as we have repeatedly, Republicans and Democrats, to  force the President to obey the law and to stop surrendering to Russia  in a way that hurts America, hurts Europe.   By the way, the European Parliament--my friends on the Democratic  side of the aisle like to consider themselves lovers of our friends in  Europe. The European Parliament voted on Nord Stream 2. The vote was  roughly 500 to 50 against Nord Stream 2 because it makes our European  allies subject to energy blackmail by Putin and his successor  dictators.   This is bad for America, bad for Europe, bad for peace, bad for the  environment, but good for Vladimir Putin and for Russia. Joe Biden is  mistaken to be committing this surrender, and my friend from Oregon  errs in joining Joe Biden in that surrender to Russia.   I hope the Senator from Oregon reconsiders. I hope Congress comes  together again. But as long as that does not happen, I object.    Mr. President, I don't have objection to the article being  included in the Record, but I would note that, once again, the Senator  from Oregon is limited by the fact that he has not participated in the  debate on this in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the last 2  years, because what he stated in his first remarks was that there was  no way to stop the pipeline initially and the Trump administration  failed to do so. That was factually incorrect.   We stopped the pipeline the day President Trump signed the bipartisan  Cruz-Shaheen sanctions into law. That was December of 2019, and the  pipeline was stopped for over a year. As I mentioned, on January 24 of  2020, 4 days after Joe Biden was sworn into office, Putin began-- returned to building the pipeline because Biden had already telegraphed  his surrender to Russia.   Now, what my friend from Oregon just said is--he repeated news  coverage that the pipeline is now, today, complete. That is, in fact,  correct, that because Biden surrendered on this point, Putin went all  in and finished the pipeline. But this is where being part of the  Foreign Relations Committee discussion matters, because even though the  pipeline is now physically complete, it does not mean it is operative.  After the pipeline is physically complete, there are months of  certifications required and multiple authorities.   The legislation that Congress passed as a bipartisan matter also  imposes sanctions on any entity, any company that certifies the  pipeline. Indeed, the position of the Biden State Department has been  that even when the pipeline is complete, we can stop it from ever going  online by stopping certification.   So the legislation that I just asked for consent would do exactly  that--it would stop certification, and it would leave it as a hunk of  metal rather than an operating pipeline enriching Putin at the expense  of Europe and America. So we still have time to stop this.   One final observation. This morning, I spent a couple of hours in a  classified briefing on this topic, on Nord Stream 2. A question that I  posed to the Biden State Department--I said: What exactly did Joe  Biden, did the administration get in exchange for surrendering to  Russia in a way that will impact this country and Europe for decades to  come?   The answer, I will say, was altogether unsatisfactory. The only thing  the Biden White House got was good will from Angela Merkel, whose party  was just defeated resoundingly this past weekend in the election. So  Angela Merkel is on her way out. We got good will from someone who will  very soon no longer be the leader of Germany.   Instead, the German people voted in--elevated the Greens, who were  vocally opposed to the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. So the new government in  Germany is not going to appreciate Biden surrendering to Putin in a way  that hurts the environment and hurts Germany. But we have alienated the  Ukrainians; we have alienated the Poles; we have alienated Eastern  Europe. The European Union voted 500 to 50, roughly, against Nord  Stream 2. We got nothing, and we hurt U.S. jobs.   This is foolhardy, and I am hopeful that the Senate will exercise our  historical role over foreign policy and prevent a President and an  administration from making this mistake.   I would note, Secretary of State Blinken and the State Department  argued vociferously in the interagency process to sanction Nord Stream  2 AG, and it was the political operatives at the Biden White House who  overrode the State Department. They should not have done so, and today  the Department of the Treasury should follow the law and impose  sanctions under CAATSA or delist them and trigger a vote in this  Congress.   I yield the floor.
