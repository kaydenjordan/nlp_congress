 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 5,  the Regulatory Accountability Act.   Many speaking today in support of this legislation are right to point  out the crushing impact that Washington's overregulation has had on our  economy. We know all too well how overregulation has driven up the cost  of health care, financial services, and energy; and it is long past  time for reform.   I would like to highlight a provision of this legislation that I  offered 3 years ago that requires agencies to identify when new rules  will have a negative impact on jobs and wages.   Too often, regulators and agency heads are well aware of the negative  impact a regulation will have on Americans' jobs and wages even before  it is imposed, but they impose it anyway. Specifically, my provision  defines when rules have a negative impact on jobs and wages and  requires agency heads approving such a rule to submit a statement that  they approve the rule knowing its negative impact.   When people in this far-off Capitol take away the jobs and livelihood  of working families, as they have done with miners and power plant  workers and laborers in my district, they need to own up to it. The  Regulatory Accountability Act will help us to provide American workers  with substantial relief from what is often Washington overreach, and I  encourage all of my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation.
