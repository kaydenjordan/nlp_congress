 Mr. President, I think like most of us, I am still pretty  reeling from what happened today. What I was going to talk about was  the work I am most proud of since I have been here, with my good friend  Richard Burr and all the members of the Intelligence Committee, about a  multiyear report we did into foreign interference in our elections.  Probably our top recommendation of that five-volume, bipartisan report  was that any official or candidate should use restraint and caution  when questioning results of our elections because when you do so, you  often carry out the goals of our foreign adversaries. Use caution  because, whether knowingly or unknowingly and whether that adversary is  in Russia or China or Iran, their goals are pretty simple: They want to  make it appear to Americans, to folks around the world, and to their  own people that there is nothing special about American democracy.   I was going to try in a feeble way, maybe, to reach some of the  rhetorical heights of Ben Sasse. I knew I couldn't do that, so  instead--I know I am violating rules. Today is the day for violating  rules. This is a photo that appears today in one of the most prominent  German newspapers. You don't need to draw it up. You can draw up photos  from any newspaper or any television feed anywhere across the world.   And what is this photo of? It is of thugs--thugs--in the Halls of  this Capitol, diminishing everything we say we believe in, in this  democracy.   When you look at those images, realize that those images are  priceless for our adversaries. I am willing, tonight, in an  overwhelming way, to take a small step, in a bipartisan way, to start  restoring that trust of our people and, hopefully, the billions of  people around the world who believe in that notion of American  democracy. Remember, these images are still there.   I yield the floor.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority leader.
