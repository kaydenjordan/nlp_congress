 Madam Speaker, as President Biden pointed out last  week, here is the cold, hard truth about gas prices: The last time oil  was at its current price, the average price of gas at the pump was  about $4.25 per gallon. Today, gas prices are nearly 75 cents higher.   That difference, across just 3 months, is the result of historically  high profit margins for refining oil into gasoline.   Oil and gas companies are announcing record profits while Putin's war  in Ukraine is driving up prices at the pump. These companies are  prioritizing stock buybacks while families are struggling to pay higher  prices at the pump.   This is exactly why the House passed the Consumer Fuel Price Gouging  Prevention Act last week. Yet not a single Republican voted with us to  stop Big Oil from raking in record profits on the backs of hardworking  Americans. Families are facing a crunch, and they deserve action.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone for  yielding, and I thank Congresswoman Eshoo for her leadership on this  bill.   I applaud President Biden for having the foresight to propose the  creation of an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, also known  as ARPA-H, an agency tasked with driving breakthroughs in cancer,  diabetes, Alzheimer's, and other difficult diseases.   The new science moonshot agency is modeled on the successes of the  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, also known as DARPA. For  decades DARPA has driven advances in technologies that have changed our  lives for the better. Yet, there are so many things that we take for  granted, things like the internet and flat-screen displays. I am  confident the same will be true for ARPA-H as it seeks to accelerate  advancements in health and medicine. Thanks to President Biden's  leadership, my colleagues in Congress funded ARPA-H in March for the  current fiscal year.   Yet in order to successfully carry out its mission, ARPA-H needs  long-term resources and authorities. That is exactly what this bill  does. The ARPA-H legislation would authorize the agency for 5 years and  create the structure it needs to successfully drive breakthroughs that  would otherwise die in the commercial market.   Yet ARPA-H not only needs long-term funding but also a long-term  home. ARPA-H's mission is centered around high-risk, high-reward  research, which is a charge that Cleveland has historically proven it  is prepared to lead. With world-class healthcare systems, top-tier  institutions of higher education, advanced biomedical companies, and a  highly skilled manufacturing workforce, Cleveland has a long track  record of bringing cutting-edge innovations from discovery all the way  to production. This includes groundbreaking medical advancements like  the first face transplant in America as well as the region's cutting- edge cancer research.   Now, wherever the agency lands, it will have a meaningful impact on  the lives of Americans nationwide for generations to come. Creating  ARPA-H with 1 year of funding was a good first step, but it is time to  put this new breakthrough agency on firm footing  [[Page H5802]]  and in a firm location so we can truly start to revolutionize how we  prevent, treat, and cure a range of diseases.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Pallone again for his leadership, and I  urge my colleagues to support the bill.
