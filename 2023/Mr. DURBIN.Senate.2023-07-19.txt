 Mr. President, just about every week now, we learn  something new and deeply troubling about the Justices serving on the  Supreme Court, the highest Court in the land in the United States, and  their conduct outside the courtroom. From unreported luxury getaways  with billionaire benefactors who have business before the Court to  donor-funded teaching positions that double as all-expense-paid  vacations, to a political megadonor buying a home that belongs to a  Justice's relative and then allowing that relative to continue living  there rent-free--we have learned all of this in just a few months.   And, last week, another troubling report: According to the Associated  Press, Justice Sotomayor used her taxpayer-funded Court staff to help  sell copies of her book, in particular by pressing libraries, community  colleges, and other public institutions to buy additional copies of her  memoir and children's book in conjunction with her speaking  engagements.   Let me tell you, if I or any Member of the Senate failed to report an  all-expense-paid luxury getaway or if we used our government staff to  help sell books we wrote, we would be in big trouble. The same would be  true for Members of the House or Cabinet officials in any Presidential  administration. That is because all of us are subject to enforceable  codes of conduct that prohibit us from using taxpayer funds for  personal gain.   But the same, sadly, is not true for the nine Justices across the  street. Unlike every other Federal official, Supreme Court Justices are  not bound by a code of ethical conduct.   Let me repeat that. Unlike every other Federal official, the nine  Supreme Court Justices are not bound by a code of ethical conduct.   They are the most powerful judges in the entire Nation, and yet they  are not required to follow even the most basic ethical standards. It is  time for that to change. The highest Court in the land should not have  the lowest ethical standards.   Tomorrow, the Senate Judiciary Committee, which I chair, will  consider legislation I have joined Senator Whitehouse in introducing  known as the Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act, or  SCERT Act. Our legislation would require the Supreme Court to adopt an  enforceable code of conduct. It would also add new recusal and  transparency requirements to Federal law. And these requirements would  apply to every Justice, no matter which President of which political  party appointed them, or their ideological views notwithstanding.   I wish this legislation were unnecessary. The fact is, the Chief  Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, John Roberts, could clean up the  Supreme Court's ethical challenges on his own, and for  [[Page S3132]]  years I have encouraged him to do just that. It was more than 11 years  ago--more than 11 years ago--when I first urged the Chief Justice in  writing to adopt a binding code of conduct, but he didn't accept my  suggestion.   And what has happened in the years since? I will tell you: Sadly, the  American people's confidence in the Supreme Court has cratered. Public  support for the Court is at an alltime low.   So if we are set to restore the public trust in our Nation's high  Court, we must begin by enacting the legislation that I have introduced  with Senator Whitehouse. I thank him for his leadership on this issue  for many years. I hope every member of the Judiciary Committee, on both  sides of the aisle, votes tomorrow in support of the Supreme Court  Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act.   Mr. President, I would like to address statements made earlier today  on the floor by the Republican leader. It was his analysis and his  comments on the bill which I have just described, which he said takes  us out to the ``thinnest constitutional ice.''   The relationship of the legislative branch--Congress--and the Supreme  Court is unusual. The Supreme Court is expressly created by the  Constitution. Other courts are created by statute, and they become  important to us in so many different ways. And the relationship between  Congress and the Supreme Court is somewhat unique.   We have nine members of the Supreme Court. That is not required by  the Constitution. The number of Supreme Court Justices is established  by Congress, and it was established in the middle of the 19th century.  It is nine today. It was other numbers before that. Congress has the  power to choose the actual numbers of the Court.   And when it came to issues like televised court proceedings for the  Supreme Court, there is a bipartisan bill, which I am authoring now-- cosponsoring with Senator Grassley, a Republican from Iowa--to deal  with the actual conduct of the proceedings before the Supreme Court.   We also handle the annual budget. Congress passes the annual budget  for the Supreme Court as well.   As you can tell, it is a relationship which is intertwined. We do not  have the authority nor are we trying to exercise the authority to  change or influence a judgment. That is up to the Court itself. But  when it comes to the administration of the Court and the rules of  administration, the Congress has played an important role.   Senator McConnell described our concern about the ethical situation  in the Court as an ``uptick in pearl-clutching and hysterics.'' That  colorful term belies the fact that the things that I have described  here are very basic and concern Americans of all political faiths.   Senator McConnell said: ``We have been told we should be outraged  that the Justices dare to buy and sell property and take vacations.''  Of course, he misses the point. If they want to buy and sell property,  that is their business. But when someone else is buying and selling the  property of a Justice or his relative, that is relevant for the public  to know if the person buying the property has any business before the  Court or any impact on the judgment of that Justice.   ``It is the same old intimidation campaign by the left,'' according  to Senator McConnell, to hold this hearing and consider a bill dealing  with the ethics of the Supreme Court. What he conveniently ignores is  the fact that the first letter I sent to the Court on this subject was  11 years ago.   The Court has changed dramatically in that period of time, but my  message has remained the same, whether the Court is dominated by  liberals or conservatives or something in between. That makes quite a  difference in this argument.   He calls our effort ``open disdain for a body that refuses to  interpret the Constitution through the lens of their party's  platform.'' It is not open disdain. It is a recognition that what is  going on in the Court is unsustainable.   What they have done and the conduct that has been disclosed already  has raised serious questions about the ethical standards of the Court.  We want to make sure that changes for the better to maintain the  independence of the Court.   And still I struggle to understand the logic of those on the  Republican side of the aisle when it comes to ethics in the Supreme  Court. They seem to think it is partisan if we raise this issue.   It wasn't that long ago--just last year, 2022--that we considered the  issue of disclosure of stock transactions. A bill was passed, a  bipartisan bill cosponsored by Senators Cornyn and Coons, and it went  to the Supreme Court, and they adopted it as their standard of conduct.  Apparently, when it comes to those ethical considerations, cooperation  between the two branches is acceptable. Why isn't it acceptable today,  as we set out to do?   The first thing I did, when we initiated this subject, was to contact  the Supreme Court and let them know that we were sending a letter to  the Chief Justice inviting him to come testify and appear and describe  the situation at the Court and how it was being handled.   He respectfully declined that invitation and responded with his own  defense of the current situation. But we tried from the beginning not  to make this partisan. We tried to make it respectful under the  Constitution. I am sorry the Chief Justice did not accept our  invitation. But we tried several different ways to engage him and the  Court and found that the best way to move forward is to consider this  legislation tomorrow before the Senate Judiciary Committee.   I think it is a step in the right direction to say that our nine  Supreme Court Justices will at least be held to the same standards of  ethical conduct as every other judge in the Federal system. That is not  an unreasonable requirement, and it is one that I think would start to  repair the image of the Court, which is badly in need of repair.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess until 2:15.
