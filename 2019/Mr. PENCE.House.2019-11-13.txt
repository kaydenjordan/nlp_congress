 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend, Steve  Johnson, for receiving the prestigious Indiana Motor Truck  Association's Founders Award.   The IMTA's Founders Award is an honor bestowed to those who embody  the spirit of the association's founders and have made outstanding  contributions to the association and the Indiana trucking industry.  Steve is only the ninth individual to have received this award in the  past 14 years.   Always one to give back, Steve proudly serves his Nation in uniform  and remains involved in his local church, charitable foundations, and  children's hospitals in Indiana.   I congratulate my good friend, Steve Johnson.      Congratulating Three High Schools on Special Olympics Recognition     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate three high schools  located in Indiana's Sixth District on their achievement of becoming a  National Banner Unified Champion School.   Columbus East High School, Muncie Central High School, and South  Ripley High School were recognized by the Special Olympics for their  servant hearts and commitments to inclusion. These three high schools  achieved the status of a Unified Champion School after meeting 10  national standards of excellence set by the Special Olympics.   As institutions dedicated to inclusion, collaboration, and  engagement, we are proud of Columbus East, Muncie Central, and South  Ripley. We congratulate the students and faculty for this significant  achievement.        Recognizing Batesville High School and Ivy Tech's Partnership     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Batesville High School  for their tremendous achievement of having one-half of the 2020  graduating class earn college credits. Through their innovative  programs with Ivy Tech Community College, Batesville will see 50  percent of their graduating seniors walk across the stage with an  entire year's worth of college credits.   The Ivy Tech program gives Hoosiers the opportunity to take 16  college courses at no cost, enabling them to obtain a bachelor's degree  in just 3 years after they go to college.    I thank Batesville High School faculty and staff for continuing to  provide innovative educational programs that set our students up for  success.          Recognizing Rushville Consolidated High School FFA Program     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the Rushville Future  Farmers of America chapter for being one of six chapters across the  country to participate in the Turn the Bag Blue and Gold program.   The Turn the Bag Blue and Gold program is a partnership between FFA  and Mycogen Seeds that gives students the opportunity to visit with  farmers and polish their professional skills while raising money for  their communities. This program will allow students to sell directly to  local farmers, providing industry experience and a wonderful  educational opportunity. A percentage of these sales will go directly  to the Rushville FFA chapter.   Congratulations to Rushville FFA.                    Congratulating Indiana National Guard     Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Indiana National Guard for  the stationing of the 127th Cyber Protection Battalion at Muscatatuck.  As the seventh largest Army National Guard contingent in the Nation,  the Indiana National Guard continues to make our Nation's defenses  better.   The Hoosier State is proud to be home to cyber force structures such  as the Muscatatuck Urban Training Complex, the Defensive Cyber  Operations Element, and Cyber Protection Team 172. We are honored to  have such a distinctive battalion.   Indiana's Sixth District boasts the Department of Defense's only  live, full-scale cyber range, and I join the Army National Guard in  congratulating our distinguished Hoosiers in uniform on this  outstanding achievement.         Congratulating Boy Scouts of America Volunteer Beth Curtiss     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Beth Curtiss of  Shelbyville, Indiana. Beth was awarded the 2019 Crossroads of America  Silver Beaver Award, in association with the Boy Scouts of America.  This award is the highest honor the Crossroads of America Council may  bestow on a volunteer.   Beth has volunteered with the Boy Scouts of America for over 15  years. This is the fifth time Beth has been recognized for her  outstanding service.   I am pleased to congratulate Beth, and I thank her for investing in  our communities.                            ____________________
