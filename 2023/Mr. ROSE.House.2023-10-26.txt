 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to remember a fallen officer  from Tennessee, Sergeant William Cherry of the Macon County Sheriff's  Department.   Sergeant Cherry passed away following a head-on collision that  occurred while he was conducting a routine patrol on July 29, 2023.   Those who worked alongside him described the sergeant as a leader and  mentor. They say he wore the badge with honor and that he truly carried  out his oath as a law enforcement officer.   Sergeant Cherry cared deeply about protecting his community,  especially protecting children from potential harm. The outpouring of  support shown to his family since his passing is a testament to his  impact on the community he cared so much about, an impact that will be  felt for some time to come.   We lost a truly dedicated public servant and a great example of what  it means to be a Tennessean.   Mr. Speaker, I extend my deepest condolences to his wife and  daughter.                            ____________________
