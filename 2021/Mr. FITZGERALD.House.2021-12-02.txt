 Madam Speaker, the Biden administration's energy  agenda is a disaster. The President's decision to cancel the Keystone  XL pipeline cost hundreds of jobs in Wisconsin and undermined our  Nation's energy independence, and his policies have made energy prices  soar.   As a result, the American people are paying the price at the gas  pump. Part of my district, the Fifth Congressional District in  southeastern Wisconsin, is an EPA-designated ozone nonattainment zone,  another contributor to the very high gas prices that we are seeing.   This designation requires area gas stations to use more expensive,  reformulated gasoline. The increased cost of the reformulated gas is  passed on to consumers, resulting in gas prices 10 to 15 cents higher  in some counties in my district, compared to the county right next to  it.   The irony is that President Biden is blaming oil and gas companies  for manipulating gas prices and is encouraging the FTC to investigate.  In reality, it is the administration's old, failed policies that are  responsible for the manipulation of the gas prices. The truth is  Americans cannot afford this way of life.                            ____________________
