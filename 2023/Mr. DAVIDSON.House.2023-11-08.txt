 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment expands upon the base tax.   The base tax says that none of these funds may be used to establish a  central bank digital currency. A central bank digital currency  shouldn't be established. Establishing could mean that it has already  been created and waiting in the wings just in case we need it.   For ``Star Wars'' fans, imagine if we let the empire build the Death  Star, as long as they promise not to turn it on. Let's not do that.   Let's not build this thing in the first place. We shouldn't design it  or develop it. It shouldn't exist. That is the point of this amendment.  Stop wasting your time on something that the American people don't want  and Congress hasn't authorized. I think the base tax sort of gets at  that, but I wanted to expand upon that to be clear. We don't even want  it to exist.   Why is this important?   On March 9 of 2022, the Biden administration released an executive  order outlining the administration's approach to the risks stemming  from digital assets and blockchain technology. This included a  directive to explore a United States central bank digital currency.                                time  1100    On March 1, 2023, the Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie  Lang gave a speech focusing on the administration's efforts thus far to  design and develop a central bank digital currency: `` . . . a CBDC  would involve both a new form of central bank money and, potentially, a  new set of payment rails. Both real time payment systems and CBDCs  present opportunities to build a more efficient, competitive, and  inclusive U.S. payment system.''   She announced the creation of the Treasury-led CBDC Working Group to  complement the Fed's work on the U.S. CBDC.   These are excerpts from her speech.   Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has made substantial steps toward  developing a central bank digital currency, as well. They have done  numerous research on projects on the design, but the San Francisco Fed  is actually recruiting and hiring for a senior crypto architect of a  central bank digital currency to develop a U.S. central bank digital  currency.   Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution is clear. The authority for  creating money rests with this body, and we clearly aren't authorizing  that.   In testimony the chairman of the Federal Reserve has made it clear  that they couldn't actually establish it without congressional  authorization.   We want them to stop building it.   What is a central bank digital currency?   It is a corruption of the concept of money from its proper use as a  store of value and a means of exchange into a tool for coercion and  control.   The version that is being studied is the same version that the  Chinese Communist Party is implementing in China, which is a centrally  managed, centrally controlled database.   Now, I am not saying the United States would automatically do the  same things China is doing with it, but it would have the same features  where the central government actually sees every single transaction.  There is no intermediary. In fact, the central government becomes the  intermediary between the person and their own property. It would have a  claim on it, but their claim would rest with the Federal Government.   We do not need that kind of money in the United States. We don't want  that kind of money in the United States. It is Orwellian, and it is  dystopian. Every dystopian future has some version of corrupted money  where the money itself is used as a tool for coercion and control.   In fact, the Book of Revelation, what I consider Scripture, talks  about this, and in our time we are seeing the technology that could do  it. In over 100 countries this kind of design and development work is  underway. The United States should not partake in it. It is always  depicted as evil, and we should have no part in it.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment. To be very clear, not  only do we not want it established, we do not want it to exist.  [[Page H5588]]    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman's argument is not against  the language of this text. The gentleman's argument is about studying  something or researching it, and the clear language does not prohibit  research or study. It does prevent designing or developing it. We don't  want them to create it.   Research all you like, Mr. Chairman, understand how evil it is. I  assure the gentleman I am actually an expert on this field, and I am on  the authorizing committee. We have as a committee passed language that  prohibits the use of a central bank digital currency by the United  States of America.   So the appropriation is aligning with the work of our authorizing  committee. This is not legislating or it wouldn't have been made in  order. It is a simple prohibition of the use of funds to do certain  activities.   We don't want them to create this. They can research, they can come  and say: We have studied this, and we think there are some really  interesting ideas, and here is a proposal for something that might  exist someday.   Mr. Chairman, we simply don't want them to create it, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    The working group I think is within the purview of  study and research. We just want to make sure that they don't cross the  line into designing and developing, and it looks like they are starting  to do that. We don't want them to create something and say: See, it  already exists.   We didn't appropriate money for them to do that. We didn't tell them  to create it. We just want to be more clear on what we want you to do.  By all means, research.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, we rightly recognize one of the chief  rivals to the United States is China. Really, more specifically, the  Chinese Communist Party that has a grip on power over the people of  China, and one of the key tools for their power is their currency.   The amendment I am offering today would limit the Treasury's ability  to go along with an organization we helped to create, the International  Monetary Fund. The International Monetary Fund is supposed to support  financial stability in the world. Part of the way they do that is with  something called special drawing rights.                                time  1330    This is a basket of currencies that they extend to others, and they  added the Chinese RMB. In 2016, they officially joined the IMF's elite  basket of currencies, which determines the value of the IMF's Special  Drawing Rights.  [[Page H5604]]    Special Drawing Rights are not only a reserve asset in central banks  around the world, they also serve as a unit of account for the IMF.   The IMF's decision was something of a coup for Beijing as the RMB now  sits in this exclusive club with only the dollar, the euro, the pound  sterling, and the yen.   I believe the IMF's elevation of the RMB was premature at the time.  China lacked rule of law, as it still does today. Nevertheless, the IMF  thought validating Beijing anyway would somehow encourage their  government to pursue reform and work within the international  community.   None of this has come to pass, of course. China went on to assault  Hong Kong's democracy. They have increased state control of their  economy. They threaten Taiwan actively. They act as a lifeline to  Putin's regime in Russia, and they are actively carrying out a genocide  against Uyghurs in their own country.   Rather than look at these facts, the IMF chose last year to not only  have the RMB in the Special Drawing Rights basket but to increase its  weight from 10.92 percent to 12.28 percent, making it the third-most  prominent currency in the basket behind the dollar and the euro.   Even leaving aside China's aggression at home and abroad, the IMF  undertook this move despite China's lack of an independent central bank  and a free-floating currency, as well as China's nontransparent  policies for their exchange rate management.   I want to highlight this point. The CCP controls China's currency  management and monetary policy, and the value and interest rates of the  Special Drawing Rights are influenced by that now.   In turn, the Special Drawing Rights interest rate helps determine the  borrowing costs for IMF member countries, and that rate should be based  on transparent economic governance, not black box deliberations of the  Chinese Communist Party.   Mr. Chairman, enough is enough. My amendment would prohibit the  Treasury Secretary from supporting an increase in the RMB's weight in  the Special Drawing Rights currency basket.   A similar initiative, the Chinese Currency Accountability Act, passed  the Financial Services Committee unanimously in February. This  amendment aligns our appropriations with our authorizing committee.   While I remain baffled as to why Treasury would have allowed the RMB  to enter the Special Drawing Rights currency basket in the first place  and certainly to increase its weight, we must prevent this bad  situation from getting worse, and that is what this amendment does.   I urge all of our colleagues to support it, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to receive the update that  the administration doesn't anticipate changing it, but let's be clear.   That doesn't prohibit them having flexibility. They can actively work  to decrease the weight of the RMB. They simply can't work to increase  it. Since they say that is their stated policy goal, I think it  provides them exactly what they need.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense amendment. It  checks the power and growth of the influence of the Chinese Communist  Party and their currency, the RMB. It should not grow in its influence.  That is what this amendment could help accomplish.   I urge all our colleagues to support it, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
