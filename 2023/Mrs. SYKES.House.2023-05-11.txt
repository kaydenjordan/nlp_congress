 Mr. Speaker, before I joined Congress, I was a State  representative in the great State of Ohio. During the pandemic, my  office fielded hundreds if not thousands of calls from parents,  seniors, veterans, farmers, and families, all who needed help, and we  did.   Unbeknownst to my constituents, the IT systems at the State agencies  in Ohio processed those claims. Those IT systems needed to be updated.  The staff roles had been decimated and protections were not in place.  Months after those families sighed a breath of relief, they received a  letter demanding repayment.   Mr. Speaker, if you have never been on the other end of a phone call  where someone has cried or wailed in fear of financial ruin or about  how they are going to feed their families or pay their bills or get  their medication, I can understand why you would vote for this bill.  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, I have, and I cannot support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I understand the need to stop fraud, and I understand  the need to do this work. I look forward to doing it with you someday,  but this  [[Page H2292]]  bill would not do it. In fact, it actually eliminates $2 billion of the  funds to update the system that caused this problem and put my  constituents in this situation in the first place.   Mr. Speaker, I was sent here to fight for families, to lower costs-- not to criminalize Americans--and to support them with bills that will  help their families live the American Dream.   Mr. Speaker, I will offer a motion to recommit H.R. 1163, and I ask  unanimous consent to add the text of this amendment into the Record  immediately prior to the vote on the motion to recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, in honor of Teacher Appreciation Week, I  rise today to recognize the tireless efforts of all the educators in  Ohio's 13th Congressional District.   Our dedicated educators play a critical role in shaping the lives of  our children, forming the backbone of our educational system.   Their unwavering commitment to providing quality education to our  children not only deserves our recognition but our support.   They need action in Congress, and I am proud to co-lead the Educators  for America Act, a comprehensive legislative package which will invest  in our children and support the recruitment and retention of diverse,  well-qualified educators across the country.   I am also a cosponsor of the American Teacher Act, which will ensure  that teacher salaries reflect the tremendous value educators bring to  our communities.   Our communities are strongest when we invest in our teachers and  provide them with the resources and tools they need to succeed.   On behalf of Ohio's 13th Congressional District, I sincerely thank  our teachers for their countless contributions to our children and our  society. Their dedication and passion for teaching inspires us all, and  we are grateful for the role they play in building better lives and  brighter futures for our children, inside and outside the classroom.                            ____________________
