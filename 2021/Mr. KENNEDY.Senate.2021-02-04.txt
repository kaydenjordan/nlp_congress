 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 782 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, we guarantee freedom of speech in  America. Unlike other countries, we also guarantee freedom after  speech. One form of freedom of speech is the right to peacefully  protest. That doesn't mean that violence as a part of protest is or  should be legal in our country. In fact, it is not. Without order,  there can be no justice.   We have had, unfortunately, riots throughout this year. In fact, if  you look at the numbers, we have had over 50 deaths in our country this  year from riots, including here at our own Capitol, and this is the  most expensive period of riots in our history.   My amendment would prohibit the SBA from providing assistance, such  as the Paycheck Protection Program, the Economic Injury Disaster Loans,  7(a) loans, and other small business assistance, to anyone who has been  convicted during the past year of a felony or a misdemeanor during and  in connection with a riot.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional  30 seconds to respond.    Mr. President, do I have any additional time from my  original time?    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
