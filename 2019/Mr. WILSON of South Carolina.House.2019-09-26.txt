 Mr. Speaker, as part of National Clean  Energy Week, I am grateful for clean energy and its advances in South  Carolina.   The success of President Donald Trump has been the achievement of  energy independence for America.   South Carolina is home to seven nuclear power reactors that produce  95 percent of the State's emission-free electricity. In addition,  nuclear energy facilities in South Carolina employ over 2,800 South  Carolinians. Nuclear energy is a reliable source, providing over half  of the State's electricity.   Solar energy is also a reliable form of clean energy. Currently,  there is enough solar installed in South Carolina to power over 90,000  homes.   I have been impressed by visiting Cypress Creek Renewables, a solar  farm in Gaston-Swansea, Lexington County, welcomed by Wannelle  Lefkowitz; NARENCO solar farm in Orangeburg County, welcomed by Michael  Cox; and Green Energy Biofuel in Aiken County, reprocessing cooking  oil, welcomed by Joe Renwick; along with Ameresco, clearing woody  debris at the Savannah River Site.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
