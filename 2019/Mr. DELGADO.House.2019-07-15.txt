 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 277) to adjust collateral requirements under the Small  Business Act for disaster loans, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 277         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Access to Sufficient Capital       for Everyone in Natural Disaster areas Act of 2019'' or the       ``ASCEND Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. COLLATERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISASTER LOANS UNDER THE                     SMALL BUSINESS ACT.         (a) Amendment to the RISE After Disaster Act of 2015.--      Section 2102 of the RISE After Disaster Act of 2015 (Public       Law 114-88) is amended--        (1) by striking subsections (b) and (c); and        (2) by striking ``(a) In General.--''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall take effect as though enacted as part of the RISE After       Disaster Act of 2015.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 277, the Access to Sufficient Capital  for Everyone in Natural Disaster Areas Act, also called the ASCEND Act.   However, before we get to the substance of the bill, I want to thank  the ranking member, Ranking Member Chabot, and his staff, for working  in a bipartisan way on this package of bills.   I also would like to thank all our Members, both Republican and  Democrat, for their hard work and continued bipartisan commitment to  putting small businesses first. It is, once again, a reminder of the  importance of working across the aisle and getting things done for the  American people.   Being the only committee dedicated solely to the needs of small  firms, we remain committed on working to promote policies that will  encourage economic prosperity on Main Street.   Access to capital is essential for business success, and it is  particularly true after a natural disaster. That is why I rise in  support of H.R. 277, the ASCEND Act, which will permanently set the  unsecured credit threshold for SBA's disaster loans at $25,000.   The SBA's Disaster Assistance program was implemented to provide  timely financial assistance in the form of low-interest loans and  working capital for businesses and homeowners devastated by a disaster.   Continual improvement and modernization of the program has been a  priority of our committee for many years. And as we continue to  experience increased disasters, both in frequency and strength, it is  imperative Congress provides the necessary policies to get communities  back on their feet.   One of those policies originated in the 114th Congress as part of a  bill introduced by Chairwoman Nydia Velazquez, H.R. 208, the Recovery  Improvements for Small Entities After Disaster Act of 2015, the RISE  Act. That law raised the collateralization threshold on disaster loans  to make it easier for victims to obtain capital to rebuild their homes  and businesses. Unfortunately, this provision will expire this year, so  Congress must act.   H.R. 277 permanently raises the minimum disaster loan amount that the  SBA may require collateral from $14,000 to $25,000. This means that a  disaster victim can continue to receive a $25,000 loan, rather than  just $14,000, within 5 days of closing to speed up the reconstruction  project.   Raising the unsecured loan amount provides support for Americans when  they need it most. And for smaller businesses, time and again, we have  seen that in the aftermath of a disaster, access to affordable credit  can make the difference between remaining in business or closing their  doors and putting Americans out of work.   Without this legislation, the unsecured loan limit for agency  declarations will revert to the lower limits and create an unfair  discrepancy for disaster survivors in areas of an SBA declaration and  that of a major disaster declaration.   I thank Ranking Member Chabot for cosponsoring this legislation,  which allows more borrowers to access loans without having to put up  collateral. I urge Members to support this bipartisan piece of  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   There is little doubt that natural disasters result in economic  hardship for the people living in those communities. And no matter the  scope or the cause of a disaster, the first few weeks are critical to a  small firm's recovery.   H.R. 277 seeks to provide that lifeline by permanently increasing the  collateralization threshold to $25,000 and giving peace of mind to  disaster victims. This legislation is a much-needed response to the  record-breaking disasters of the past 2 years, the impacts of which are  still being felt in various parts of the country.   It is a commonsense move, and one supported by the Small Business  Administration. In a report assessing the SBA Disaster Loan Program,  the SBA recommended that an increase in the unsecured loan limit for  disaster loans should be made permanent.   The agency, again, stated as much in congressional testimony at a  hearing held last September before our committee and in its fiscal year  2020 budget and legislative proposals.   Again, I thank Ranking Member Chabot for his support, and I urge my  colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2142) to amend the Small Business Act to require the Small  Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman to create a  centralized website for compliance guides, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2142         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. CENTRALIZED WEBSITE FOR COMPLIANCE GUIDES.         Section 30 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 657) is       amended by adding at the end the following new subsections:        ``(e) Centralized Website.--Not later than 6 months after       the date of the enactment of this subsection, the Ombudsman       shall maintain a publicly available website that includes--        ``(1) hyperlinks to small entity compliance guides       described under section 212(a)(1) of the Small Business       Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996; and        ``(2) with respect to each such small entity compliance       guide, the contact information for an individual who can       offer assistance to small entities with respect to the rules       that are the subject of such guide.        ``(f) Report on Agency Compliance.--The Ombudsman shall       include in the annual report required under subsection       (b)(2)(C) an assessment of agency compliance with the       requirements of section 212 of the Small Business Regulatory       Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 for the year covered by such       annual report.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 2142, which eases regulatory  compliance for small businesses.   Agencies are required by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement  Fairness Act to publish small entity compliance guides for each rule  requiring a regulatory flexibility analysis. That guide is supposed to  be posted and accessible to the public no later than the day a  rulemaking becomes effective.   Yet, our committee continually hears from small business owners that  they have great difficulty locating the guides. In our own  investigation, we found that Federal agencies are inconsistent in their  compliance with this rule.   Small businesses don't always have the resources to navigate multiple  agency websites to understand their responsibilities under new laws.  Instead, they are worried about meeting payroll, hiring talented  workers, and running day-to-day operations of their small firms.                                time  1645    This bill provides a centralized location at the SBA's Office of the  National Ombudsman to make it easier for business owners to find agency  regulatory compliance guides and contact information. The SBA's Office  of the National Ombudsman was created to help the small business  community overcome regulatory barriers and ensure that agency actions  are fair and reasonable. Centralizing various agency compliance guides  in this office is a logical step to provide transparency and clarity  for small businesses.   I want to thank Dr. Joyce for working with me to identify this issue  and find a bipartisan solution to ensure America's small firms have a  one-stop shop for regulatory assistance.   I ask my fellow Members to support the bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, we know that small business owners don't  necessarily have the resources and time to navigate multiple websites  to fully understand their responsibilities with Federal laws. My bill  is an important step toward reversing these problems. H.R. 2142 will  make it easier, not harder, to comply with Federal regulations by  providing them one location for compliance assistance.   The ombudsman already maintains a site for guidance, but this bill  goes one step further by requiring that they not just provide agency  contacts, but also keep a regular, updated page of compliance guides  readily accessible to the public. My legislation renews our commitment  towards small business growth and success by creating transparency and  accountability of Federal agencies.   Again, I want to thank Dr. Joyce for cosponsoring this bill and  putting our small businesses first.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2331) to require an annual report on the cybersecurity of  the Small Business Administration, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2331         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``SBA Cyber Awareness Act''.       SEC. 2. CYBERSECURITY AWARENESS REPORTING.         Section 10 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 639) is       amended by inserting after subsection (a) the following:        ``(b) Cybersecurity Reports.--        ``(1) Annual report.--Not later than 180 days after the       date of enactment of this subsection, and every year       thereafter, the Administrator shall submit a report to the       appropriate congressional committees that includes--        ``(A) an assessment of the information technology (as       defined in section 11101 of title 40, United States Code) and       cybersecurity infrastructure of the Administration;        ``(B) a strategy to increase the cybersecurity       infrastructure of the Administration;        ``(C) a detailed account of any information technology       equipment or interconnected system or subsystem of equipment       of the Administration that was manufactured by an entity that       has its principal place of business located in the People's       Republic of China; and        ``(D) an account of any cybersecurity risk or incident that       occurred at the Administration during the 2-year period       preceding the date on which the report is submitted, and any       action taken by the Administrator to respond to or remediate       any such cybersecurity risk or incident.        ``(2) Additional reports.--If the Administrator determines       that there is a reasonable basis to conclude that a       cybersecurity risk or incident occurred at the       Administration, the Administrator shall--        ``(A) not later than 7 days after the date on which the       Administrator makes that determination, notify the       appropriate congressional committees of the cybersecurity       risk or incident; and        ``(B) not later than 30 days after the date on which the       Administrator makes a determination under subparagraph (A)--        ``(i) provide notice to individuals and small business       concerns affected by the cybersecurity risk or incident; and        ``(ii) submit to the appropriate congressional committees a       report, based on information available to the Administrator       as of the date which the Administrator submits the report,       that includes--         ``(I) a summary of information about the cybersecurity risk       or incident, including how the cybersecurity risk or incident       occurred; and        ``(II) an estimate of the number of individuals and small       business concerns affected by the cybersecurity risk or       incident, including an assessment of the risk of harm to       affected individuals and small business concerns.         ``(3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection       shall be construed to affect the reporting requirements of       the Administrator under chapter 35 of title 44, United States       Code, in particular the requirement to notify the Federal       information security incident center under section       3554(b)(7)(C)(ii) of such title, or any other provision of       law.        ``(4) Definitions.--In this subsection:        ``(A) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       `appropriate congressional committees' means--        ``(i) the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship       of the Senate; and        ``(ii) the Committee on Small Business of the House of       Representatives.        ``(B) Cybersecurity risk; incident.--The terms       `cybersecurity risk' and `incident' have the meanings given       such terms, respectively, under section 2209(a) of the       Homeland Security Act of 2002.''.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 2331, the SBA Cyber Awareness Act of 2019,  which strengthens the Small Business Administration's cybersecurity  infrastructure to handle and report cyber threats that affect small  businesses.   The Small Business Administration processes a significant amount of  small business data, and protecting these businesses is essential to  its mission. That is why they must protect its precious digital  networks from cyberattacks. But after the massive data breach at the  U.S. Office of Personnel Management, 75 percent of Americans are  doubtful that the government can protect their personal information.   With 28 million small business owners in the U.S. that provide 64  percent of new private-sector jobs, America cannot afford for small  businesses to lose faith in the SBA. Today, we take an important step  to restore American confidence in the SBA's cybersecurity protections  and prevent the harmful results of cyberattacks.  [[Page H5808]]    H.R. 2331 ensures that the SBA has an effective cyber strategy and  requires timely reporting of cyber incidents to Congress and affected  individuals. Through these measures, the SBA will better serve the  American small businesses that support the U.S. economy.   I thank Congressman Crow and Congressman Balderson for working so  diligently to strengthen the agency we oversee and protect the Nation's  small business community that utilizes its services.   I ask my fellow Members to support this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Crow), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, the Small Business Administration fuels the  U.S. economy, and through its lending and contracting programs, helps  Americans start, build, and grow small businesses, but in doing so, the  agency is tasked with handling vital information.   As we all know, cyberattacks are very real, and nobody, not even the  Federal Government, is immune.   That is why this piece of legislation, H.R. 2331, is fundamental to  the health of our national cyber infrastructure as it relates to small  firms.   The SBA must protect its digital networks from cyberattacks and  collaborate more with Congress. Modernizing the agency's IT  infrastructure and implementing an effective cyber strategy is the key  component of this bill. Doing so guarantees the SBA can adequately and  effectively defend its digital network.   This bill also requires timely reporting of cyber incidents to  Congress and affected individuals in the unfortunate event of a breach.  The sharing of this information allows us to collaborate with the SBA  to better address vulnerabilities in the system.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2331 has bipartisan support, so I once again want  to urge my colleagues to support the measure. I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1649) to amend the Small Business Act to require cyber  certification for small business development center counselors, and for  other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1649         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Business Development       Center Cyber Training Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. DUTIES OF SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER                     COUNSELORS.         Section 21 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 648) is       amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(o) Cyber Strategy Training for Small Business       Development Centers.--        ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection--        ``(A) the term `cyber strategy' means resources and tactics       to assist in planning for cybersecurity and defending against       cyber risks and cyber attacks; and        ``(B) the term `lead small business development center'       means a small business development center that has received a       grant from the Administration.        ``(2) Certification program.--The Administrator shall       establish a cyber counseling certification program, or       approve a similar existing program, to certify the employees       of lead small business development centers to provide cyber       planning assistance to small business concerns.        ``(3) Number of certified employees.--The Administrator       shall ensure that the number of employees of each lead small       business development center who are certified in providing       cyber planning assistance under this subsection is not fewer       than the lesser of--        ``(A) 5; or        ``(B) 10 percent of the total number of employees of the       lead small business development center.        ``(4) Consideration of small business development center       cyber strategy.--In carrying out this subsection, the       Administrator, to the extent practicable, shall consider any       cyber strategy methods included in the Small Business       Development Center Cyber Strategy developed under section       1841(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal       Year 2017 (Public Law 114-328; 130 Stat. 2662).        ``(5) Reimbursement for certification.--        ``(A) In general.--Subject to the availability of       appropriations and subparagraph (B), the Administrator shall       reimburse a lead small business development center for costs       relating to the certification of an employee of the lead       small business development center under the program       established under paragraph (2).        ``(B) Limitation.--The total amount reimbursed by the       Administrator under subparagraph (A) may not exceed $350,000       in any fiscal year.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1649, the Small Business  Development Center Cyber Training Act of 2019, which helps Small  Business Development Centers, or SBDCs, become better equipped to  assist small entities with their cybersecurity needs.   Small businesses have increasingly become the targets of  cyberattacks, and because of the complexity and cost associated with  identifying, monitoring, and sharing information with appropriate  agencies, only 31 percent of small firms have cybersecurity plans in  place.   Besides access to capital, cybersecurity is one of the main  impediments to entrepreneurial success. Our committee has heard many  heartbreaking stories about how it took just one attack to shutter a  business.   We have also heard time and time again the frustration business  owners feel as they attempt to protect against ever-changing threats  and navigate cyber regulations to win government contracts.   This legislation ensures that our Nation's most vulnerable businesses  are prepared to combat the imminent threat from cyberattacks.   Leveraging the vast network of SBDCs and their expertise in assisting  entrepreneurs from all over the country is a step in the right  direction to provide education and training to business owners seeking  to implement safeguards to their networks.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Ranking Member Chabot and Congressman Evans  for working together on this important issue, and I ask my fellow  Members to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am prepared  to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, cybercrime is one of the greatest risks to  every business in the world. Cybercriminals have realized small  entities are more exposed than larger businesses that have dedicated  in-house IT personnel overseeing their systems and networks.   Unfortunately, just 14 percent of small businesses have a plan in  place for keeping their company secure.   This is why Congress and the SBA must continue to make cybersecurity  training and resources a top priority for our Nation's small firms.   Through H.R. 1649, U.S. small businesses will be more prepared and  better protected against cyber threats.   This bill has bipartisan support and is essential to enhancing  America's cyber infrastructure, by starting with the most vulnerable  businesses.   Our committee remains dedicated to advancing more policies to address  the cyber challenges of small employers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2345) to amend the Small Business Act to clarify the  intention of Congress that the Administrator of the Small Business  Administration is subject to certain requirements with respect to  establishing size standards for small business concerns, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2345         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Clarifying the Small       Business Runway Extension Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the Small Business Runway Extension Act of 2018 (Public       Law 115-324) applies to calculations of the size of a       business concern made by the Administrator of the Small       Business Administration;        (2) Federal agencies rely upon such calculations to award       contracts, including governmentwide acquisition contracts, to       small business concerns; and        (3) the Small Business Runway Extension Act of 2018 has       been effective since the date it was signed into law, on       December 17, 2018.

SEC. 4. FINALIZATION OF SMALL BUSINESS RUNWAY EXTENSION ACT                     OF 2018 RULES.         The Administrator of the Small Business Administration       shall issue a final rule implementing the Small Business       Runway Extension Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-324) not later       than December 17, 2019.       SEC. 5. AMENDMENT TO SIZE STANDARDS FOR CERTAIN SMALL                     BUSINESS CONCERNS.         (a) Size Standards for Small Business Concerns Providing       Services.--Section 3(a)(2)(C)(ii)(II) of the Small Business       Act (15 U.S.C. 632(a)(2)(C)(ii)(II)) is amended by striking       ``not less than''.        (b) Size Standards for Other Business Concerns.--Section       3(a)(2)(C)(ii)(III) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.       632(a)(2)(C)(ii)(III)) is amended by striking ``not less than       3 years'' and inserting ``5 years''.       SEC. 6. TRANSITION PLAN FOR THE SMALL BUSINESS RUNWAY                     EXTENSION ACT OF 2018.         (a) Plan Required.--Not later than 90 days after the date       of the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Small       Business Administration shall implement a transition plan to       assist business concerns and Federal agencies with compliance       with the requirements of the Small Business Runway Extension       Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-324).        (b) 3-Year Calculation for Size Standards.--        (1) In general.--The transition plan described under       subsection (a) shall include a requirement that, during the       period beginning on December 17, 2018, and ending on the date       that is 6 months after the date on which the Administrator       issues final rules implementing the Small Business Runway       Extension Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-324), allows the use of       a 3-year calculation for a size standard to be applied to a       business concern if the use of such 3-year calculation allows       such concern to be considered a small business concern under       section 3(a)(1) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C.       632(a)(1)).        (2) 3-year calculation defined.--In this subsection, the       term ``3-year calculation'' means--        (A) with respect to a business concern providing services       described under clause (ii)(II) of such section, a       determination of the size of such concern on the basis of the       annual average gross receipts of such concern over a period       of 3 years; and        (B) with respect to a business concern described under       clause (ii)(III) of such section, a determination of the size       of such concern on the basis of data over a period of 3       years.       SEC. 7. REQUIREMENT TO UPDATE SAM.         Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the System for Award  [[Page H5811]]       Management (or any successor system) shall be updated to       comply with the requirements of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the measure under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2345, the Clarifying the Small  Business Runway Extension Act of 2019.   The Federal Government recognizes two categories of businesses: small  and other-than small. Since there is no Federal definition for ``other- than small,'' this category can encompass firms that barely exceed the  SBA's small business size standards, up to the multibillion-dollar  household names.   To ease the transition from ``small'' to ``other-than small'' to give  growing businesses a real chance at competing against some of the  biggest companies in the world, we enacted the Small Business Runway  Extension Act last year.   By increasing the average-receipts-based calculation for SBA size  standards, transitioning firms will have more time to grow and develop  their competitiveness and infrastructure.   However, since the Runway Extension Act became law, its  interpretation and implementation have been thwarted by the agency  responsible for its implementation. This conflict between law and  regulation has created much confusion in the Federal contracting  community.   The bill before us today clearly and unequivocally states Congress'  intention regarding the Runway Extension Act of 2018. It sets forth a  specific date by which SBA must complete their rulemaking process while  also creating a transition plan for small firms caught up in this tug  of war.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Representatives Stauber and Golden for  collaborating to find a resolution to this issue, and I urge my  colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Maine (Mr. Golden).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Stauber and Representative Golden  for working together on this important bill to ensure that  congressional intent is not thwarted when it comes to the adequate and  prompt implementation of the Small Business Runway Extension Act of  2018. That law was intended to make it easier for small Federal  contractors to transition into the open marketplace.   The SBA has interpreted that the Small Business Runway Extension Act  of 2018 applies to every other agency adopting its own size standard  but not the SBA itself. Many small businesses and legal experts  disagreed with the SBA's position, as did our committee.   This bipartisan bill reiterates that the law has been effective since  its enactment and requires the SBA to issue a final rule for its  implementation before the end of this year.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
