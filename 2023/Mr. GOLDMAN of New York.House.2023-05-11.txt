 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during Jewish  American Heritage Month with a message of grave concern about the  troubling rise in anti-Semitism around the country and the even more  troubling normalization of that anti-Semitism.   Recent data shows that anti-Semitic incidents rose again last year by  36 percent, and New York continues to lead the country in such hateful  incidents.   I am not immune from it myself, as you can see from just a small  sampling of anti-Semitic attacks I personally have received on social  media.   At a recent Judiciary Committee field hearing in my district, a man  welcomed us with this sign about George Soros, which is unquestionably  and flagrantly anti-Semitic.   As the Biden administration prepares to roll out its national  strategy to counter anti-Semitism, I urge my friends on the other side  of the aisle to stop invoking George Soros' name and join together to  combat the startling rise of anti-Semitism.                            ____________________
