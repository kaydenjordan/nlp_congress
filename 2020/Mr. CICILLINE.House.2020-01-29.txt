 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Eulogio Acevedo, who  passed away earlier this month.   Those of us who knew Mr. Acevedo will remember him as a dedicated  family man, a leader in the business community, and a relentless  champion for social justice. Born in the Dominican Republic, Mr.  Acevedo made his home in Providence, Rhode Island, along with his  beloved wife of 30 years, Maryelyn.   Mr. Acevedo lived the American Dream. An engineer by trade, he owned  and operated his own construction company for more than two decades. He  raised five children and lived to celebrate the births of four  grandchildren.   Most important of all, Mr. Acevedo gave back to the country that gave  him so much. He was an active community leader in Providence and a  political legend, a gentle but strong man who helped anyone in need.   Mr. Speaker, I am thankful that I had the opportunity to know this  great man. He was a dear friend to me. Our city and our State will miss  him deeply. May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
