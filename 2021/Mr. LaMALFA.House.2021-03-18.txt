 Madam Speaker, let's acknowledge the reality of what we  have right now, a big mess of a situation that hasn't been cured in  several decades.   We used to have a system of invited workers, called the bracero  program. Political battling has caused no new fix in all of this time.  Similarly, this bill allows good workers, decent people, to get right  with the law, with background checks, with restitution, and  requirements to stay right with their ag worker status.   The same bill passed this House through committee last Congress with  good bipartisan support. It has benchmarks that must be met by workers  who are already here with history in ag, not opening the floodgates to  more illegal entry and benefits. More recent entrants are required to  remain in ag work for 8 additional years to remain eligible. We have  caps in this bill to the current approximately 700,000 workers already  here, with capped ratchets if more are needed.   It establishes an E-Verify for ag, with strong biometric screening  for all these certified ag workers, something we have never had under  E-Verify.   It codifies in law many of the pieces adopted in the Trump  administration's H-2A rule, including staggered H-2A and making it much  less burdensome for farmers to get these workers, especially dairy,  which needs year-round workers and cannot have it now.    Madam Speaker, what this bill is not is amnesty, even  though it may be dismissed as such. Americans have demonstrated they  will not step forward to do this work, not with the nonworking benefits  they can already access. Frequent anecdotes show that those that might,  frequently quit after a few days because the work is too hard, even at  dramatically increased wages.   This law does not hand out citizenship or allow anyone to cut ahead  in line to apply for it. The same goes for green cards. No express lane  for green cards, not even government benefit eligibility.   This is simply a way to get right with the law, have a capped pool of  already in-place ag workers with legal status. That is better for the  worker, the farmer, and for our system of ID'ing who is in this country  currently. It is a vast improvement over what we have now.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, the House voted on H.R.  485, Stronger CAPTA, a reauthorization of the Child Abuse Protection  and Treatment Act.   Abuse is obviously a horrible thing that no child should have to  suffer. However, this legislation has multiple issues which I call on  the Senate to fix. Notably, it would create a national registry of  child abuse and neglect.   Now, this sounds good, but under current law, a person does not need  to be convicted or even charged with a crime to be put on a State abuse  registry, which leads to many parents being added due to misfiled  paperwork or perhaps overzealous CPS workers.   Homeschooling parents in particular face this issue, and an appeal  can take months or even years to get a name removed from the list. By  nationalizing State registries, this problem will spread nationwide  without a fix.   The legislation attempts to address this concern by creating a  working group to study and make recommendations on due process  concerns, but that is not a sufficient safeguard for Americans' due  process rights.   A 2009 HHS report on the feasibility of a national child abuse  registry noted that a national registry would be plagued by false  positives, where an innocent person sharing a name with an abuser would  be flagged in background searches.   I call on the Senate to fix this legislation.                            ____________________
