 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of Judy Chu's NO BAN Act.   In the words of John Lewis: ``When you see something that is not  right, not fair, not just, you have to speak up; you have to do  something.''   The NO BAN Act is doing something. It is stating in clear, powerful  legislation that America will never again let racism or religious  intolerance be a barrier to lawful immigration. We will not allow  ignorance or xenophobia to dictate America's immigration policies.   Our strength has always--always--been our diversity.   A functional Muslim ban or a ban of entire countries simply because  they comprise a race or a religion that some President does not like is  not just evil, it is stupid. Watch which American communities recover  most quickly from the pandemic--those with the most diverse  populations.   Madam Speaker, I stand here today, as I stood at the airport at the  onset of the ban, to ensure our immigration system cannot be hijacked  by hatred.
