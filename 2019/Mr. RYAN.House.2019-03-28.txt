 Mr. Speaker, due to unforeseen circumstances on Thursday,  March 28, 2019, I was not present to cast my vote on the question of  Agreeing to H. Res. 124, a resolution expressing opposition to banning  service in the Armed Forces by openly transgender individuals. I agree  in the strongest terms with the resolution's denunciation of the ban,  and had I been present my vote would have been yea on rollcall 135.                            ____________________
