 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize John  Barker, an exemplary citizen in my hometown of Yuma, CO. As a member of  the Veterans of Foreign Wars, VFW, Post 3378, Mr. Barker has selflessly  volunteered his time and energy toward providing invaluable services to  veterans and their families. As a result, he has been honored by the  Colorado VFW with the Salute to Service Award.   Mr. Barker goes above and beyond to help veterans in our community.  This includes regular visits to veterans admitted to hospitals and  nursing homes and ensuring that announcements of events hosted by Post  3378 are widely circulated in local media. Whether it is working to  expand the local Veteran's Memorial Park or tracking down stories from  veterans and their families to be published, he ensures that these  veterans receive the recognition they deserve.   On a more solemn note, Mr. Barker visits veterans who have entered  hospice care and presents them with a plaque commemorating their  service; in their last moments, these veterans know how grateful our  community is to them. Furthermore, Mr. Barker attends their funerals  and performs military honors as a member of Post 3378's color guard.   Indeed, Mr. Barker's volunteerism is not limited to veterans. He has  worked with local Boy Scouts, encouraging them to finish their Eagle  Scout projects, volunteered as Santa Claus at a local event, and worked  with the Colorado Department of Fish and Wildlife to make sure there  were fish to catch for the kids at Yuma's ``Huck Finn'' Day.   Mr. Barker's dedication to his community and his VFW post is  unparalleled. His VFW commander, Adam Beauprez, had no hesitation  nominating him for the Salute to Service Award and it is little wonder  that the Colorado VFW followed suit by honoring him with this  recognition.   Mr. Barker, thank you for your service. Thank you for your friendship  and your family's friendship. You make Colorado proud.                            ____________________
