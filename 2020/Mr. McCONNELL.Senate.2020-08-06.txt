 Mr. President, it has been 1 week since Senate  Democrats forced the additional Federal benefit for jobless Americans  to expire.   Senate Republicans tried everything to prevent the lapse. That  Monday, we rolled out a comprehensive proposal for another rescue  package that would have kept extra Federal benefits flowing. The  Democrats refused to act, so we tried to force the issue.   One of our Senators requested unanimous consent to continue these  benefits through the end of the year at a still historically generous  level. This plan would have also corrected the bizarre choice facing  American workers whom the system was actually paying more to stay home  than to resume working, but that wasn't good enough for the Democratic  leader, and he objected.   Another Republican Senator then asked unanimous consent to extend  Federal support exactly as it had been for 1 more week so that jobless  Americans didn't have to bear the cost of the Democrats' leisurely  negotiating pace. Once again, the Democratic leader objected.   Finally, Republicans forced a floor vote to demonstrate whether  Senators were even willing to debate the issue, whether Senators would  even consider extending these benefits, and every single Democrat  present voted no.   The week since then has seen plenty of talk and plenty of stalling  from the Democratic leaders, who have insisted on handling this  themselves--but no significant movement toward progress. They have  still kept their ranking members and more reasonable voices locked up.  The Speaker and the Democratic leader continue to obstruct the kinds of  committee-level discussions that delivered the CARES Act, which are no  longer in style. Only they are allowed to speak. Only they among the  [[Page S5230]]  Democrats are allowed to have an opinion.   Day after day, they have stonewalled the President's team. Day by  day, they have tried to invent new euphemisms to create the illusion of  progress. Yesterday's contribution from the Speaker was this: There is  now a light at the end of the tunnel, but ``how long that tunnel is  remains to be seen.'' Well, there are a lot of struggling Americans who  could tell Speaker Pelosi exactly how long this tunnel has been and  that it will continue to be endless unless the Democrats let us provide  more relief to the country.   Their second week of inaction has brought the country to a second  cliff in coronavirus aid. Last week, it was the extra Federal benefit  for laid-off workers. This week, it is the enormously popular Paycheck  Protection Program that has kept millions more Americans off the  unemployment rolls in the first place.   The PPP was written and designed in March by Chairman Rubio and  Chairman Collins as Main Street America was hurtling toward a cliff.  Their innovative policy has saved small businesses on a massive scale.  Hundreds of billions of dollars have gone out in emergency loans to  more than 600,000 small businesses.   I hear constantly from Kentuckians whose local businesses and whose  jobs would not have survived the last several months without this  program. From distilleries to medical device suppliers to domestic  violence advocates, the PPP has helped community institutions weather  the storm and keep more Kentuckians on the payroll.   This emergency program hasn't been perfect, but it has been a huge,  huge success. It has remained a success because, back in April, we  finally got the Democrats to let us provide another wave of funding  after a pointless delay and pointless brinksmanship--you may detect a  pattern here--but now many of these businesses are reaching the ends of  their ropes. Their PPP money is dwindling, but since the virus remains  with us, even where shutdown orders have been lifted, commerce has not  roared all the way back.   One survey found that one in four workers who were hired back and  kept getting paid because of the PPP has now been warned he might be  let go again, and you can bet that number will increase.   Here is how one business owner explained the looming danger to  reporters: ``If there isn't another round of stimulus, we'll start  cutting past the fat and to the bone, and that's our people, and our  people are hard to replace.''   Congress should be strengthening the PPP. Instead, the Democrats have  put it in jeopardy. This Saturday, August 8, is the official deadline  for anyone who hasn't yet gotten a loan to apply. The door closes the  day after tomorrow, and many firms that did receive the assistance are  getting nearer to the bottom of the well.   This is why the Senate Republicans' blueprint for another major  rescue package would put $190 billion into a second draw of the PPP for  the businesses that most need help. The House Democrats' $3 trillion  wish list totally left that out. They ignored the PPP. We want to re-up  it   This is just one of the many ways our serious proposal beats the  absurd far-left wish list the Democrats' own moderate Members laughed  out of the room. While they focus on unrelated liberal demands, like  tax cuts for rich people in blue States, we are focused on serious  solutions for the problems facing Americans right now.   Yet, instead of getting serious, the Democratic leaders have chosen,  instead, to misrepresent and even lie about what is at stake. The  Democratic leader's repeated misstatements about the legal protections  that the Senate Republicans and the White House want for schools,  doctors, nurses, charities, and employers have earned him ``three  Pinocchios'' from the Washington Post and a ``Mostly False'' rating  from another fact-checker. Let me say that again. The Democratic  leader's repeated misstatements about the legal protections the Senate  Republicans and the White House want for schools, doctors, nurses,  charities, and employers have earned him ``three Pinocchios'' from the  Washington Post and a ``Mostly False'' rating from another fact- checker. He doesn't even seem to realize that we modeled our medical  malpractice reforms on the COVID-related protections that his fellow  Democrats put in place in New York.   So this is where we are--another week that the Speaker of the House  and the Democratic leader have spent stonewalling the President's team  in talks and holding out for ideological pet projects with no  relationship whatsoever to the COVID crisis. Now, as a result,  struggling Americans are facing another cliff, with another important  form of relief on its last legs.   We face a second straight week of political theater from our  Democratic colleagues with no result--except more pain for families,  more uncertainty for workers, and more evidence to suggest that perhaps  the Democratic leaders were never serious about getting something  accomplished in the first place.   All across America, small business owners are hurting and hoping the  Democrats get reasonable and allow another major package to move  forward. Unemployed Americans need these endless talks to finally bear  fruit, and so do school principals and working parents and senior  citizens and nurses and doctors and university presidents and students  of all ages.   That is why I will not be adjourning the Senate for our August recess  today as had been previously scheduled. I have told Republican Senators  they will have 24-hours' notice before a vote, but the Senate will be  convening on Monday, and I will be right here in Washington. The House  has already skipped town, but the Senate will not adjourn for August  unless and until the Democrats demonstrate they will never let an  agreement materialize.   A lot of Americans' hopes--a lot of American lives--are riding on the  Democrats' endless talk. I hope they are not disappointed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the  desk due for a second reading.
