 Mr. Speaker, by now, we have all seen the horrifying video  of a slave auction in Libya. It is outrageous. Migrants and refugees,  most of them Black Africans, are being preyed upon, held in detention  camps, and bought and sold like property.   Mr. Speaker, the United States cannot stand by as an idle spectator  to the plague of slavery in Libya. People are not property.   Last week, members of the Congressional Black Caucus and I met with  Libya's Ambassador. She agreed that the Libyan Government will conduct  a transparent investigation, but they do not have the capacity to do  so. That does not absolve the United States of its responsibilities.   We must immediately investigate allegations of slavery and forced  labor in Libya. We need to impose sanctions if Libya fails to end slave  auctions and forced labor. We must ensure the U.S. Department of State  and the U.S. Agency for International Development are adequately  staffed to respond to the situation in Libya.   Mr. Speaker, Congress should adopt the bipartisan H. Res. 644, which  will do all these things and more                            ____________________
