 Mr. Speaker, a republic can survive only as long as  all political sides abide by our elections, respect our institutions,  and obey our Constitution.   The anonymous column by an official in the executive branch, who  bragged of deliberately thwarting the will of the people as expressed  through the Presidential election, expresses a sentiment that is  absolutely toxic to our form of government.   He cites no constitutional breach to thwart the lawful decisions of a  legitimately elected President but only his self-righteous disdain for  the man and his policies.   Well, he doesn't get to make that decision. Nobody elected him.  Congress, the courts, and the American people at the ballot box can  check the President, but an unelected zealot within the government  cannot.   What I find most alarming is the applause for this sentiment that we  hear from the far left. We should recognize it for what it is: a direct  attack on the most fundamental principle that holds us together as a  free people.                            ____________________
