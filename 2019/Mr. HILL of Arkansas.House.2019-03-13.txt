 Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of the life and  legacy of a friend and Holocaust survivor, Fred Hilsenrath, who  recently passed away at the age of 90.   Fred was only 4 years old when Adolph Hitler took over as chancellor  of Germany.   After spending years in concentration camps throughout Romania,  facing death, witnessing some of the most heinous and grotesque  atrocities the world has seen, Fred and his family were finally rescued  by a Jewish Russian soldier.   With his new-found freedom, Fred moved to the United States to finish  his education in electrical engineering.   After meeting his wife, Eleanor, Fred moved first to San Francisco  and, finally, to retire in Fairfield Bay, Arkansas. Here, he wanted  that slower pace of life.   In his later years, Fred advocated to young people, ``Find your  passion early and pursue it, even if adversity comes your way.''   He was a role model and friend to many across the State of Arkansas,  and I extend my condolences, respect, and affection to his friends,  family, and loved ones.                            ____________________
