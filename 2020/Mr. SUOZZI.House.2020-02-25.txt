 Mr. Speaker, I have spoken in this Chamber before about  my father's American success story as an Italian immigrant. Today, I  rise to tell the story of another Italian immigrant success story, the  story of my constituent's mother, Rosa Naccarato.   Rosa died unexpectedly this past Christmas, only 2 weeks shy of her  95th birthday.   In 1955, Rosa left Italy with her husband and six children, leaving  behind her friends and family, all in pursuit of the American Dream.  Think of the tears that were shed as family and a way of life were left  behind and as they faced the unknown.   The Naccaratos arrived in America with only $200 in their pocket.  They worked hard and experienced tremendous hardships and personal  affronts because they didn't speak English. But they refused to believe  that they were second-class citizens.   They persevered, and their children all achieved tremendous success.  Their son, Anthony Naccarato, my constituent, was recently installed as  the New York State president of the Sons and Daughters of Italy.   Anthony asked me to speak up on behalf of his mother and all  immigrants who make the leap of faith to leave everything behind and  come to America to try and live the American Dream. Hopefully, Rosa  Naccarato's story will inspire others to persevere through the  hardships, the discrimination, and the outright disrespect.   Mr. Speaker, today, we honor Rosa Naccarato. God bless her, and God  bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
