 Madam Speaker, as President Biden recently  said: The genius of Israel and America's democracy is they are both  built on strong institutions, on checks and balances, and on an  independent judiciary.   Israel's checks and balances, its independent judiciary, faced an  attack from its own, Prime Minister Netanyahu. He tried to implement  so-called reforms that would turn Israel's courts into nothing more  than an enforcement tool for his policies.   By undermining the independent judiciary and disregarding the rule of  law, sadly, Israel's own Prime Minister threatens the very foundation  on which Israel's democracy depends.   Israel must remain a democracy that protects and lifts all of its  citizens, Israeli and Palestinian. We all want to see a safe and  successful Israel. To be pro-Israel means always to be pro-democracy.   I celebrate the estimated more than 600,000 Israeli protesters who  knew they needed to stand up for their Nation, for their democracy, who  took to the streets against the blatant disregard for institutions,  checks and balances, and an independent judiciary. I applaud their  bravery that made it clear they will not tolerate the undercutting of  their judicial system, compromising their military readiness, and  moving their country in the direction of authoritarianism.    For its future, its safety, and security, for those who love her,  Israelis and Palestinians alike, Israel must not abandon that genius of  democracy, just as America cannot.

What a run our Phillies had last season. This year, Phillies fans  come to this season with, as the great Harry Kalas sings to us after  every home win, ``High Hopes'' for our Fightin' Phils.   Madam Speaker, we have high hopes for Trea Turner, J.T. Realmuto,  Aaron Nola, Zack Wheeler, Kyle Schwarber, and our world-class players  being led to glory by our manager, Philly Rob; and high hopes for the  return of Bryce Harper and the recovery of Rhys Hoskins from his  devastating ACL injury. We wish him a full recovery.   In my hometown of Glenside, we have high hopes for our two Glenside  boys, Mike and Sammy Siani. Mike was called up to the majors last  season with the Cincinnati Reds, and Sammy is well on his way.   Good luck to the Glenside Siani men, and watch out for the Fightin'  Phils this season. Let's play ball.                           Covenant School Shooting     Madam Speaker, here we are again, talking  about another school shooting.   When will enough be enough in this country?   How is it that we allow our schoolchildren to go to school each day  with the uncertainty of their own safety?   How do we allow parents to drop children off and not be able  sometimes to pick them up at the end of the school day?   At Covenant School on Monday, in Nashville, three 9-year-old babies  were slaughtered and three of their teachers, or adults, were taken, as  well.                                time  1045    It is a shameful number. We now in this country have had 15 mass  shootings at schools. When will enough be enough?   I hear an appalling silence from the majority party in this House--an  appalling silence. Call for the safety of every one of our citizens.  Call for the safety of every one of our children as they go to school,  that they can come home safely and not be terrorized by what is going  on.   Here we are the greatest Nation on the planet, and we can't keep our  children safe. Let's close the background check loophole. Let's keep  guns out of the hands of violent people. Let's get weapons of war out  of the hands of civilians, off our streets, and out of our schools. We  are failing our children and our grandchildren--this greatest Nation on  the planet.   Please stop the appalling silence. Partner with us to end gun  violence in this country and to end this shameful nightmare.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R.  1, the polluters over people act.   Environmental protection and smart regulation, alongside responsible  businesses and every single one of us, will save our planet for the  next generation, for my four grandchildren, and for your grandchildren.   When my granddaughter, Aubrey, was only 5 years old, she attended an  issues conference with a national candidate who asked Aubrey what she  cared about. Aubrey responded, ``Trash on the playground. How do we fix  that?'' a simple yet important question.   One of our most basic jobs is to protect our natural resources,  protect this global playground, and regulate companies to ensure that  they are not able to abuse and pollute our planet.   The deregulation that H.R. 1 allows will pollute our planet and harm  health. This legislation guts critical investments in climate change,  balloons the deficit, and rolls back key environmental standards, all  while failing to address energy costs for Pennsylvania's families.   They are trying to do this at the same time we are seeing some  consequences of deregulation right in Pennsylvania, leading to  environmental disasters that could poison American families, like the  derailment of the train and environmental disaster in East Palestine,  Ohio, affecting, of course, Pennsylvania's Pittsburgh suburbs, and,  most recently, the pollution of water in Philadelphia.   It seems we need more regulation, not less.   Madam Chair, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle either  forget or simply do not know that it was a Republican President,  Richard Nixon, who, in 1970, proposed the Environmental Protection  Agency, and it began operation that same year.   In the early 1970s, Pennsylvania passed a brilliant constitutional  amendment, article I, section 27, which says Pennsylvanians are  guaranteed the right to clean air and clean water and to the protection  of our natural aesthetics for generations to come. This beautiful  amendment is a reminder to all of us that we should not pass H.R. 1.
