 Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R.  4665--Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  Appropriations Act, 2024.   While I am grateful the Rules Committee made my Jackson Lee Amendment  16 in order, I strongly oppose the underlying bill.   I will, however, briefly recap why my amendment is important for this  particular measure should we be able to move forward with a feasible  appropriations bill that can accommodate this amendment.   The Jackson Lee Amendment 16 increases funds by $1,000,000 and  decreases funding by $1,000,000 for the Global Health Programs account  to highlight and support the fight against the practice of Female  Genital Mutilation.   I have been a dedicated champion against this practice for a long  while, working closely with former Congressman Joe Crowley of New York  to introduce legislation targeted at supporting the elimination of this  ludicrous practice of mutilating young women.   Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) comprises all procedures  that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia,  or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.   This practice is rooted in gender inequality and is often linked to  other elements of gender-based violence and discrimination, such as  child marriage and recognized internationally as a violation of the  human rights of women and girls.   Unfortunately, this means an estimated 200 million girls and women  alive today have been victims of FGM/C, with girls 14 and younger  representing 44 million of those who have been cut.   For example, consider that around the world, at least five girls are  mutilated/cut every hour and more than 3 million girls are estimated to  be at risk of FGM/C, annually.   The impacts of FGM/C on the physical health of women and girls can  include bleeding, infection, obstetric fistula, complications during  childbirth and death.   Other significant barriers to combatting the practice of FGM/C  include the high concentration in specific regions associated with  several cultural traditions, that is not tied to any one religion.   According to UNICEF, FGM/C is reported to occur in all parts of the  world, but is most prevalent in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and  Asia.   Due to the commonality of this practice many migrants to the U.S.  bring the practice of FGM/C with them, increasing the importance of  combatting FGM/C abroad.   Jackson Lee Amendment 16 prioritizes funding for foreign assistance  to combat Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C), an internationally  recognized violation of the human rights of girls and women comes to an  end.   Yet, as it pertains to the underlying appropriations bill, I stand  with the Administration and my colleagues to express my opposition for  the following noted reasons:   Treasury High-Leverage Programs. I strongly oppose section 7061(b) of  the bill, which prohibits funding being made available to the Clean  Technology Fund. The $425 million requested for this account would  support a loan of $1.2 billion. It is disappointing that the bill does  not support loan guarantees at the multilateral development banks,  where $111 million in subsidy would leverage $3 billion in loan  guarantees to finance energy security. The appropriations for this bill  should include the requested authority to use existing resources for  loans to the International Monetary Fund's Poverty Reduction and Growth  Trust and Resilience and Sustainability Trust, which would leverage  billions of dollars to accelerate progress in developing countries.   Global Health. I appreciate that the bill includes full funding for  the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and urges the  Congress to reauthorize PEPFAR for another five-year period to  accelerate global progress toward reaching HIV epidemic control.  However, it is deeply troubling that the bill significantly reduces  funding available for global health security, which would leave the  world more vulnerable to infectious disease threats and pandemics.   Reproductive Health Restrictions. It is also deeply concerning that  the bill includes new restrictions on lifesaving global family planning  and reproductive health (FP/RH) services and other global health  assistance; these excessive conditions would undermine U.S. efforts to  combat infectious diseases and to advance gender equality globally by  restricting America's ability to support health programs. Section  7058(b) of the bill imposes a ceiling on FP/RH funding levels that is  far below the longstanding enacted level, leaving even more women  without access to these essential health services. Further, section  7057(a) of the bill prohibits funding for the United Nations Population  Fund, which provides essential work to address preventable maternal  deaths and the unmet need for family planning, prevent and respond to  gender-based violence, and end harmful practices around the world,  including in places where the United States does not have its own  programming, as well as in many humanitarian crises. In addition,  section 7057(b) of the bill would require application of a harmful  policy that imposes excessive conditions that would undermine U.S.  foreign and development assistance. Similar prior restrictions, which  were ended by the President during his first days in office, affected  local partners around the world receiving global health assistance,  limiting the United States' ability to work with these partners and  inhibiting their efforts to confront a range of health challenges.    Diplomatic and Development Workforce. It is deeply concerning that  the bill would reduce funding for America's international affairs  workforce and operations by nearly 20 percent, which would  significantly curtail implementation of U.S. foreign policy, and would  likely reduce U.S. presence overseas. This funding level, along with  the large number of directives in the bill, would force the Department  of State to make very difficult tradeoffs, and could result in hiring  freezes, reductions in force, and contract suspensions.   United Nations (UN) and Other International Organizations. It is  further deeply concerning that the bill does not include funding for  the UN regular budget and many other international organizations. The  bill includes more than $1 billion in draconian reductions that would  undermine U.S. leadership, compromise America's ability to meet its  treaty obligations, and limit U.S. capacity to address shared global  challenges, while inviting America's adversaries to take America's  place. The bill also provides no funding for the International  Organizations and Programs account, which would eliminate critical  resources to organizations such as the UN High Commissioner for  [[Page H4725]]  Human Rights and the UN Children's Fund, which provide essential life- saving services to women and children around the world.   Humanitarian Assistance. I am also disappointed at the significant  reduction, below the FY 2023 enacted levels, provided in the bill for  life-saving humanitarian assistance during a time of record  displacement and complex challenges worldwide. The bill also provides  no new funding for the President's Emergency Refugee and Migration  Assistance Fund, which is currently depleted and requires replenishment  to enable the United States to respond to unexpected humanitarian  crises.   Prohibitions. I also strongly oppose the inclusion of prohibitions  throughout the bill, such as in sections 7064(e)(3), 7061(a), 7070, and  7059(f), that limit the Administration's flexibility in advancing key  national security and foreign policy objectives. These include  prohibitions related to funding for special envoys and similar  positions, the Green Climate Fund, LGBTQI+ protections, and the Gender  Equity and Equality Action Fund focused on advancing women's economic  security, among others.   Afghan Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs). I am disappointed that the  bill fails to provide the requested increase of 20,000 visas to the  Afghan SIVs cap or to extend Afghan SIV program through 2029. This  program demonstrates the steadfast commitment of the United States to  Afghan allies who have supported the U.S. mission in Afghanistan for  over two decades.   Rescissions. I am also deeply troubled that the bill rescinds over  $1.5 billion across the Development Assistance, Economic Support Fund,  and Peace Corps accounts. These rescissions would drastically reduce  the U.S. Government's ability to support U.S. allies and partners to  defend shared national security interests and to combat poverty,  corruption, and food insecurity.   Clean Technology Rescission. I am also disappointed that the bill  would rescind $11 billion in funding provided by the Inflation  Reduction Act for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund program at EPA.  This rescission would eliminate funds designed to mobilize private  capital into clean technology projects, especially in low-income and  disadvantaged communities, that would expand economic opportunities in  communities, reduce harmful pollution, and protect people's health  while tackling the climate crisis.   Constitutional Concerns. Certain provisions of the draft bill raise  constitutional concerns, including by interfering with the President's  authority to determine the command of the Armed Forces, to recognize  territorial sovereignty, and to conduct diplomacy.   We can do better. We are better than this. The American people  deserve better.   I cannot support this bill as it stands, and I urge all my colleagues  to vote against this cruel proposal.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I thank the manager and the chairman and  ranking member of this committee.   State, foreign operations, and related programs are the face of  America, the most powerful nation in the world, the nation that the  world looks to for guidance and direction in the interactions of this  world. I am saddened to say that this face has been altered and  threatened desperately by some of the shortchanges in the funding.   The threat to national security by abdicating U.S. leadership, and  the underfunding of the U.N. Development Program and the U.N., the  underfunding of the State Department, and the threat to women's health  equality globally around the world, is why my amendment is so very  important, and I ask my colleagues to support it.   I thank the Rules Committee, and I thank the subcommittee, for my  amendment is an important and potentially lifesaving amendment in an  unfortunate and distracting approach to State and foreign relations.   My amendment increases funds by $1 million and decreases funding by  $1 million for the global health programs account to highlight and  support the fight against the practice of female genital mutilation.   I have been a dedicated champion of this and introduced legislation  in years past supporting the elimination of this very difficult and  ludicrous practice of mutilating young women around the world.   Female genital mutilation or cutting, FGMC, comprises all procedures  that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia  or other injury to the female genital organs for nonmedical reasons.   My colleagues may be shocked to know that some of this occurs in the  United States of America. This practice is rooted in gender  inequalities often linked to other elements of gender-based violence  and discrimination, such as child marriage, and is recognized  internationally as a violation of the human rights of women and girls.  That is why it is so important that we fund women's global health.   Unfortunately, this means an estimated 200 million girls and women  alive today have been victims of FGMC, with girls 14 and younger  representing 44 million of those who have been cut.   For example, consider that around the world at least five girls are  mutilated, cut, every hour. More than 3 million girls are estimated to  be at risk right now with FGMC annually.   The impacts of FGMC on the physical health of women and girls can  include bleeding, infection, obstetric fistula, complications during  childbirth, and death.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, let me, first of all, thank the ranking  member, Congresswoman Barbara Lee, for her consistent, steady, and  unrelenting commitment to world affairs as well as to the peace and  harmony of women around the world and humanitarian practices.   That is why this amendment and this emphasis on FGMC is so important  because other significant barriers to combating the practice of FGMC  include the high concentration in Pacific regions associated with  several cultural traditions that are not tied to any one religion, so  it spreads all over.   I emphasize to this body that girls as young as 14 who can make no  determination are put upon by this process. According to UNICEF, FGMC  is reported to occur in all parts of the world but is most prevalent in  parts of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.   Due to the commonality of this practice, many migrants to the U.S.  bring the practices of FGMC with them, increasing the importance of  combating FGMC abroad.   As I said, it happens in the United States. My amendment prioritizes  funding for foreign assistance to combat female genital mutilation or  cutting, an internationally recognized violation of the human rights of  girls and women, so that it can finally come to an end.   With the negatives of this Defense appropriation, let's do something  positive with the State Department appropriations.   I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Jackson Lee amendment,  notwithstanding the vast, extensive work that is going on that is  without restraint of dealing with FGMC around the world.   Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in support of the Jackson Lee Amendment  16 to H.R. 4665--Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related  Programs Appropriations Act, 2024.   I want to thank my colleagues on the Rules Committee for making this  amendment in order.   The Jackson Lee Amendment 16 is an important and potentially life- saving amendment in an unfortunate and distracting appropriations bill.   The Jackson Lee Amendment 16 increases funds by $1,000,000 and  decreases funding by $1,000,000 for the Global Health Programs account  to highlight and support the fight against the practice of Female  Genital Mutilation.   I have been a dedicated champion against this practice for a long  while, working closely with former Congressman Joe Crowley of New York  to introduce legislation targeted at supporting the elimination of this  ludicrous practice of mutilating young women.

This practice is rooted in gender inequality and is often linked to  other elements of gender-based violence and discrimination, such as  child marriage and recognized internationally as a violation of the  human rights of women and girls.   Unfortunately, this means an estimated 200 million girls and women  alive today have been  [[Page H4763]]  victims of FGM/C, with girls 14 and younger representing 44 million of  those who have been cut.   For example, consider that around the world, at least five girls are  mutilated/cut every hour and more than 3 million girls are estimated to  be at risk of FGM/C, annually.   The impacts of FGM/C on the physical health of women and girls can  include bleeding, infection, obstetric fistula, complications during  childbirth and death.   Other significant barriers to combatting the practice of FGM/C  include the high concentration in specific regions associated with  several cultural traditions, that is not tied to any one religion.   According to UNICEF, FGM/C is reported to occur in all parts of the  world, but is most prevalent in parts of Africa, the Middle East, and  Asia.   Due to the commonality of this practice many migrants to the U.S.  bring the practice of FGM/C with them, increasing the importance of  combatting FGM/C abroad.   Jackson Lee Amendment 16 prioritizes funding for foreign assistance  to combat Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C), an internationally  recognized violation of the human rights of girls and women comes to an  end.   While the negatives of this State appropriations bill disappointedly  outweigh my positive amendment, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor  of the Jackson Lee Amendment 16--notwithstanding my strong opposition  and encouragement to vote down the underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1045     Mr. Chairman, let me indicate my appreciation to the  chairman and to the ranking member for their support of this amendment.   I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment. Let's end  FGMC against women and girls around the world forever.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am so proud to be an American, and I am  proud to be an American because the world watches as this experiment of  so many different communities--racial, ethnic, and religious groups-- have come together. By and large, we have been successful--our United  States military, our educational system, and our neighborhoods.   I am so proud to be a Houstonian, an eclectic city with so many  different, wonderful diverse communities, including the LGBTQ+  community.   Mr. Chair, I rise today with shock and dismay because my good friend  from Colorado has a train wreck of amendments against those of color  and diversity as well as the LGBTQ+ community.   Day after day, after all of these appropriations, these poison pill  riders of getting rid of the Office of Civil Rights, getting rid of the  Office of Diversity and Inclusion, is absolutely absurd.  [[Page H4780]]    Why? Because I lived exclusion in this Nation, but it didn't make me  bitter. We worked. We struggled. We marched. We died. Those in the  civil rights movement died.   Dr. King was killed because he insisted on a place where we did not  discriminate because of the color of your skin. Some have turned that  around, but what he was saying is that race exists, and it still does  in discrimination against people who are different and diverse.                                time  1315    Why did I have honors classes, and yet no college recruitment came,  or I was not invited to any college recruitment in my high school? Why  did I not have an acceptance in any college because of not being drawn  to any college recruitment?    Mr. Chair, it is not an ideological office. The  gentlewoman didn't hear. There has been racism, there has been  discrimination, and we have not accepted the fullness of the wonderment  of America. We now insult a full-time dedicated employee.   Before the Charlie Rangel Fellows, we could find little individuals  who are diverse in Foreign Service. We now have many because we reached  out and made a difference. This train wreck of attacking inclusion,  diversity, and equity is disgraceful, and my friend should stop it. Our  cities are better, our States are better, the Nation is better because  of it. This is a fine public servant, and I want to lift her up and say  thank you. The gentlewoman should cease and desist eliminating civil  rights, diversity, and inclusion because it hurts people, it harms  people whose very heritage is tied up to a history of racism and people  who died fighting for justice and equality for all of America.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, we all mourn for the loss of our brave  soldiers, not only at the time of evacuation, but also in the wars in  Afghanistan and Iraq and throughout America's history. However, the  State Department is the face of our international policies that will  create the opportunities for engagement and collaboration and change.   I chair the Pakistan Caucus. It is one of the largest caucus of  Members of the United States Congress who understand the relationship  that the United States and Pakistan has enjoyed for 76 years. What my  colleague speaks of is not the Pakistan Government or people.   Over the decades, both countries have built a multifaceted and  diverse relationship driven by cooperation in areas such as defense,  counterterrorism, trade, investment, agriculture, IT, energy, climate,  health, and education. Enduring the raging aspects of the Afghan war,  many Pakistan soldiers lost their lives fighting terrorism.   The cooperation is rooted in our shared democratic values that they  are still working to improve, and human rights as well. Today, the  bilateral relationship is moving in the right direction. This past  year, both countries have recently held dialogue on security and  nonsecurity areas. These include trade, investment, renewable energy,  climate change, health, education, as well as security cooperation,  counterterrorism, and defense.   The Pakistan diaspora has doctors and lawyers and business persons in  our communities, and they are contributors philanthropic to the needs  of this country. In the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, Pakistan  assisted the United States in safe and secure evacuation of its  citizens.   I know some who went through Pakistan. I believe this is a  wrongheaded decision. This will have a negative impact. In the midst of  a horrific flood, one of the most catastrophic floods that happened in  years that impacted 30 million people and caused the loss of life of so  many, I was the first American to be in that area this past year.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time do I have  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Lee), the ranking member of the subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, who has the right to close?    Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, many of our allies and friends live in  tough neighborhoods, and I am very glad that Pakistan lives in a  neighborhood with friends; that is India and Bangladesh, that at least  they are engaged. They also live in the neighborhood of Afghanistan  where the Taliban has risen again. Pakistan soldiers have fought  against the Taliban.   You don't turn your back on a nation where 650,000 Pakistani  Americans are living here in the United States, they are contributing,  they are patriots, and they serve in the United States military.   We have been able to facilitate safe immigration and relocation of  Afghans with Pakistan. Pakistan has provided humanitarian assistance to  Ukraine, following our lead. Our bilateral ties are further  strengthened by the presence of nearly 650,000 Pakistani Americans.   Pakistan is a democratic state working against challenges. Yes, it  is. Its parliament has just completed its third consecutive 5-year  cycle without disruption. They are planning democratic elections.   What we need to do is to ensure that Pakistan has access to migration  and refugee assistance, economic support, international disaster  assistance, global health, humanitarian assistance, and economic  development. These are important taxpayer dollars that help Pakistan  become even stronger as a democratic nation and an ally.   For the issues my good friend has spoken about, diplomacy works these  issues out.   Mr. Chair, as the founder and Chair of the Congressional Pakistan  Caucus, I stand in strong opposition to this irresponsible and  dangerous amendment.   The passage of this amendment would be detrimental to Pakistani U.S.  relations and would put the livelihood of millions of people at risk.   The United States and Pakistan have a long-standing and enduring  partnership spanning 76 years.   Over the decades, both countries have built a multifaceted and  diverse relationship, driven by cooperation in areas including defense,  counter-terrorism, trade and investment, agriculture, energy, climate,  health, and education.   This cooperation is rooted in our shared democratic values and  convergence of interests on regional and strategic security.   The passage of this amendment would severely damage our unique and  longstanding partnership.   In its Congressional Budget Justification for FY 2024 Foreign  Operations, the United States State Department reported foreign  assistance to Pakistan of about $218 million.   These essential dollars fund critical programs in Pakistan that  include:   Migration and Refugee Assistance: $62 million;   Economic Support Funds: $50 million (``Funding will support stability  and political, economic, and judicial reforms in communities bordering  Afghanistan, increase private-sector-led trade and investment, foster  people-to-people exchanges, strengthen civil society, support climate  mitigation and adaptation, and improve gender equity and women's  empowerment'';   International Disaster Assistance: $47 million;   Global Health Programs: $31 million (includes funding on  Tuberculosis, Global Health Security, Maternal and Child Health, and  Family Planning and Reproductive Health);   International Narcotics and Law Enforcement: $25 million (these  programs in Pakistan ``combat violent extremism, transnational crime,  strengthen the capacity of law enforcement, expand access to justice,  and bolster the rule of law nationwide with a focus on the newly merged  districts along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border''; and   International Military Education and Training: $3.5 million (these  programs ``emphasize professional military education, respect for the  rule of law, human rights, and civilian control of the military'')   USAID has a total of $82 million in obligated assistance for Pakistan  in FY 2023, which funds 110 activities in five major sectors:   Humanitarian Assistance: $40.12 million (15 activities led by  emergency food assistance at $21.5 million);   Economic Development: $15.5 million (13 activities include power  sector improvement at $7.5 million);   Democracy, Human Rights and Governance: $13.7 million (10 activities  include those on good governance and rule of law/human rights);   Education and Social Services: $4 million (13 activities focused on  both basic and higher education); and   Health: $1.2 million (6 activities mainly tuberculosis-related  projects).   Last year Pakistan faced a catastrophic monsoon season with floods of  Biblical proportions leaving over one third of the country under water  and directly impacted the lives of 33 million Pakistanis.   1,700 people lost their lives, one third of whom were children,  12,900 people were injured, 7.9 million people were displaced, and  there were devastating impacts to the infrastructure, crops, and  livestock throughout the country.   As the Chair of the Congressional Pakistan Caucus, I gathered members  and personally organized the first congressional fact-finding mission  to the hardest hit areas in Pakistan.   I have seen the devastation and human suffering firsthand, and I want  to clarify that Congress must continue to fund programs that help  support Pakistan's flood recovery efforts and humanitarian assistance.   By January of this year, the United States government had pledged  more than $200 million to support Pakistan's flood recovery efforts.   In June, USAID pledged an additional $16.4 million in additional  development and humanitarian assistance.   The support provided by the United States is essential to the  recovery effort, which will likely take many years.   Pakistan is a democratic state and remains committed to promoting and  protecting democratic values.   Pakistan remains a critical partner of the United States in  stabilizing Afghanistan and promoting peace and stability in the  region.   Our government should continue to engage with Pakistan, addressing  important issues related to human rights, democracy and religious  freedom, rule of law, to advance our shared commitment to these  universal values.   The amendment is not in line with the long-standing ties between U.S.  and Pakistan and its passage would disrupt the 1U.S. relations with a  partner in the region.   I urge all my colleagues to oppose amendment No. 51.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, in my meeting last week with the  President of Ukraine, we spoke about the devastation of stolen children  from Ukraine by the Russian fighters, children now that have been  taken, reprogrammed, and not returned to their families.   Today, we voted to continue to support Ukraine in its democratic  fight for freedom and democracy against the tyranny of Russia.   I now stand here today introducing the Oleksandr Ivanov Act. This  bill, on which I am joined by Representative   Joe Wilson and other  Members, is a bill to address the stolen children of Ukraine that have  been taken to Russia. This act is dedicated to Oleksandr, a young boy  who was shot dead in the car with his grandmother.   This unjust and brutal war has put millions of Ukrainian women and  children at risk of trafficking. Millions of children have been  deprived of their education and are experiencing trauma.   More than 6,000 children are in custody in Russia, and there are at  least 43 camps and facilities where the Russian Government has interned  Ukrainian children.   This legislation will provide sanctions against Russia and demand  that the children of Ukraine be returned to Ukraine.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to announce the introduction of my bill,  the Oleksandr Ivanov Act.   On February 26, 2022, Lilia Vasylivna Kolesnyk was driving from Kyiv,  Ukraine to the suburb of Bucha with her grandson, Oleksandr Ivanov when  Russian forces opened fire on their car, killing Oleksandr.   Although wounded herself, Ms. Kolesnyk was able to drive to a medical  clinic, where her grandson was formally declared dead.   This act is dedicated to Oleksandr Ivanov, his family, and all the  children and families of Ukraine who are suffering serious injury and  trauma due to Russia's unjustified, brutal, and genocidal war on  Ukraine.   On February 24, 2022, Russia, under the leadership of Vladimir Putin,  launched a premeditated war against Ukraine in an attack on democracy  and a grave violation of international law, global peace, and security.   According to the United Nations Refugee Agency, as of July 2023,  there are a recorded 5.1 million internally displaced people in  Ukraine, 6.2 million refugees from Ukraine globally, and 17.6 million  Ukrainian people in need of humanitarian assistance.   The unjust and brutal war has put millions of Ukrainian women and  children at risk of trafficking, millions of children have been  deprived of their education and are experiencing trauma, and according  to a report by Yale University, more than 6,000 children are in  Russians custody.    According to a report by Yale University Humanitarian Research Lab  (Yale HRL), at least 6,000 children from Ukraine ages four months to 17  years have been held at camps and other facilities within Russia- occupied Crimea and mainland Russia since Russia's full-scale invasion  began.    There are at least 43 camps and facilities where the Russian  government has interned Ukrainian children.   Among the camps identified by Yale HRL, at least 32 (78 percent) of  the camps seem to be engaged in organized re-education initiatives that  subject Ukrainian children to Russia-focused educational, cultural,  patriotic, and/or military teachings.   And numerous Ukrainian children have been placed into Russian foster  families.   These Ukrainian children have had their names and birthdates changed  when adopted, making them difficult to trace.   Russian propaganda cynically portrays its adoption of Ukrainian  children as an act of generosity that gives new homes to helpless  orphans.   Russian state media shows local officials hugging and kissing newly  arrived Ukrainian children and handing them Russian passports.   These children are not happy, they are being ripped away from their  families and their homes.   Forcibly transferring children of one group to another group is a  violation of Article II(e) of the Convention on the Prevention and  Punishment of the Crime of Genocide 1948 and the Geneva Convention IV,  including articles 24, 25, 50, 78 and 82.   The International Criminal Court has indicted Russian President  Vladimir Putin and Russian Commissioner for Children's Rights Maria  Lvova-Belova for the war crime of unlawful deportation of population  (children) and that of unlawful transfer of population (children) from  occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation under articles  8(2)(a)(vii) and 8(2)(b)(viii) of the Rome Statute.    As reported by the Ukrainian Ministry of Education, over 4oo schools  have been destroyed and an additional 2,600 schools are damaged across  Ukraine.   The war has also caused Ukrainian women and children to become more  vulnerable to being trafficked.   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reports that 90  percent of the 5.8 million refugees who have fled Ukraine for Europe  are women and children.   Reports have stated that traffickers patrol border entry points,  train stations, and refugee centers with the purpose of attracting,  exploiting, and targeting refugees.   Specifically, traffickers lure in refugees with promises of  accommodation, transportation, and employment, sometimes disguising  themselves as volunteers providing humanitarian assistance.   To hold accountable those who have committed these atrocities and  have put the lives of thousands of Ukrainian women and children at  risk, my bill:   Supports programs specifically for trauma treatment and healing,  rehabilitation and where necessary prostheses, for Ukrainian children  affected by the war including nationwide educational programs of  psychological support to address trauma and stress for all of Ukraine's  children, integrated into school curriculum and offered through  clinical and social services;   Supports programs to rebuild the education system in Ukraine and  education for Ukrainian child refugees, in cooperation with other  countries, international organizations, and civil society;   Supports the development of a unified and consolidated searchable  registry of missing Ukrainian children in order to facilitate  identification of children and family reunification. The registry  should ensure strict data protection and availability in the Ukrainian,  Russian, and English languages. In addition, the public should be made  aware of its existence and use;   Supports the creation of a unified central emergency call center hub  linked to law enforcement in Ukraine and in other countries to enable  reporting on and interventions on behalf of missing children originally  from Ukraine and suspected cases of human trafficking and sexual  exploitation, including online, of children originally from Ukraine.   Supports the creation of an international mechanism to facilitate  vetting of volunteers and other non-governmental front-line responders  working with refugees or with victims of other major crises or natural  disasters by government authorities or law enforcement. Such an  international vetting system could include internationally recognized  certifications verifying individuals who have been recently cleared to  work with refugees;   Supports efforts to only allow appropriately vetted and credentia11ed  individuals (such as described in the above section) access to  refugees;   Continues to support efforts by the Ukrainian government to increase  collaboration with their European counterparts on anti-trafficking  [[Page H4852]]  investigations and increased awareness efforts.   Supports the development of robust child protective mechanisms for  vulnerable children, including those from Ukraine, in Ukraine and in  countries that have received Ukrainian refugees, that include social  assistance and protection to help prevent human trafficking and sexual  abuse of Ukrainian children.   Works with Ukrainian authorities to ensure that law enforcement  officials stationed at major border crossing points during a refugee  crisis are appropriately trained to prevent human trafficking and  support other measures to monitor for indications of human trafficking  targeting refugees in areas surrounding border crossings.   My bill also imposes financial blocking and visa sanctions on any  foreign person or organization that the President or Secretary of the  Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, determine are  responsible for engaging in or facilitating the transfer of Ukrainian  children to Russia and/or Russian controlled areas of Ukraine and/or  for their forced assimilation, adoption, or placement in a foster home,  and engaging in or facilitating the human trafficking of Ukrainian  refugees.   The Oleksandr Ivanov Act also contains a provision that requires the  Department of State to submit a report on United States efforts for  reintegrating Ukrainian children affected by the war including but not  limited to: supporting the rebuilding and redevelopment of the  Ukrainian education system, and the implementation of mental health  supports to address trauma and family separations.   Holding Russia accountable for war crimes is crucial.   There can be no impunity for these heinous crimes.   Today, I call my colleagues to action and ask that they join me in  seeking liberty and justice for all those in Ukraine by cosponsoring  the Oleksandr Ivanov Act.                            ____________________
