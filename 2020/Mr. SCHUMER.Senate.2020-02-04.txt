 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the majority leader can come up on the  floor and repeat his talking points, but there are some salient points  that are irrefutable.   The first, this is the first impeachment trial of a President or  impeachment trial of anybody else that was completed that has no  witnesses and no documents. The American people are just amazed that  our Republican friends would not even ask for witnesses and documents.   I thought the House did a very good job. I thought they made a  compelling case. But even if you didn't, the idea that that means you  shouldn't have witnesses and documents, when we are doing something as  august, as important as an impeachment trial, fails the laugh test. It  makes people believe--correctly, in my judgment--that the  administration, its top people, and Senate Republicans are all hiding  the truth. They are afraid of the truth.   Second, the charges are extremely serious. To interfere in an  election, to blackmail a foreign country to interfere in our elections  gets at the very core of what our democracy is about. If Americans  believe that they don't determine who is President, who is Governor,  who is Senator, but some foreign potentate out of reach of any law  enforcement can jaundice our elections, that is the beginning of the  end of democracy.   So it is a serious charge. Republicans refused to get the evidence  because they were afraid of what it would show, and that is all that  needs to be said.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
