 MALONEY of New York. I thank the gentleman for  yielding and for his leadership.   I rise today in strong support of Speaker Pelosi's resolution to  establish a select committee to investigate the January 6 attack on our  Capitol. I thank the Speaker for her unwavering commitment to  uncovering the truth about what happened that day.   This select committee will be critical to fully understanding the  root causes of the attack on our Capitol and to passing reforms to  ensure that an insurrection never again reaches these Halls or  threatens our democracy.   Over the past 5 months, the Oversight and Reform Committee has made  substantial progress in investigating the attack on our Capitol.   The committee has asked why our Nation's law enforcement agencies  failed to anticipate a domestic terrorist attack that was planned right  out in the open on social media, television, and why critical  assistance took so long to arrive during the attack.   In the course of our investigation, the Oversight and Reform  Committee has found that officials made 12 urgent requests for security  assistance at the Capitol, yet the National Guard did not arrive until  more than 4 hours after the Capitol perimeter was breached and lives  were threatened.   We have found that warnings of the impending assault were passed  directly to the FBI in the weeks before the attack, including that  insurrectionists planned in writing to take the Capitol building. We  plan to take the Capitol building. Yet, in the face of these warnings,  we have found that our Nation's intelligence agencies failed to act.    Our work is far from done, and we must continue to seek the truth  about the January 6 domestic terrorist attack. I look forward to  supporting this select committee and its investigation and working  together to secure our democracy.
