 Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote against this  previous question so that the bill to overturn President Trump's ill- advised ban on travel can be addressed.                                time  1245    There has been a lot of dustup and discussion about this, but,  really, if you read the order, it is very clear what it does. It  suspends entry for 90 days of all immigrants--that is green card  holders--and nonimmigrants from seven Muslim majority countries. It  also suspends all refugee admission for 120 days.   Now, there has been discussion about the Middle East refugees, but if  you look at last year, most of the refugees who came in were from the  Congo and  [[Page H834]]  also from Burma. Those individuals who have suffered--they have been  tortured--are going to stay in the refugee camps at least for 120 days,  and, obviously, this disrupts the program. This will be a much longer  end to the refugee program.   Now, there is an exception, and the President has said he wants to  let Christian refugees in, and the order itself says minority  religions. There is a problem not only with violating the law because  the Immigration and Nationality Act prohibits discrimination based on  nationality and on religion, but also the premise is that Christians  who had been persecuted were not admitted as refugees. That is simply  false. That is false. There were large numbers of refugees who have  been persecuted, including Christians. This order violates the  Immigration and Nationality Act. It also violates the Constitution.  That is why my bill should be brought up.   I am going to give you just two examples. One is General Talib al- Kenani, who is an Iraqi four-star general who is commanding an elite,  American-trained counterterrorism unit that has led the fight against  ISIS for the last 2 years. His wife and children were moved to the  United States because staying in Iraq was too unsafe for them. He is  now unable to visit his family in the United States. He told CBS News:  ``We thought we were partners with our American friends, and now we  realize we are just considered terrorists.''   How does this help the fight against ISIS?   I want to give you another example. Remember the Yazidis? The Yazidis  were being persecuted by ISIS. We remember that they had been isolated  at the top of a mountain in Syria; and when President Obama was in  office, he acted. We bombed ISIS and we saved the Yazidis. This is what  President Obama said: ``When we have the unique capabilities to avert a  massacre, then I believe the United States of America cannot turn a  blind eye. We can act, carefully and responsibly, to prevent a  potential act of genocide. That's what we're doing on that mountain.''   I mention this because there is an individual, a Yazidi woman, who  had been the only Yazidi person--woman--in the Iraqi parliament, Vian  Dakhil. One week after the President's announcement, she was injured in  a helicopter crash during a mission to deliver humanitarian aid to the  Yazidis who were trapped in the siege by ISIS. She has received awards  in London, in Dubai, in Vienna, and in Geneva for her human rights  work. Ironically, she was supposed to come to Washington, D.C., next  week to come to the U.S. Capitol to receive an award from the Tom  Lantos Human Rights Commission. Now, we remember our late colleague,  Tom Lantos, the only Member of Congress who survived the Nazi  concentration camps, and we have established this humanitarian prize in  his memory. This valiant woman now can't come to Washington, to the  U.S. Congress, to receive the Tom Lantos Human Rights Prize because of  President Trump's ban on individuals coming from Syria.   This is a ridiculous situation. It is illegal, it is  unconstitutional, it is contrary to American values, and it doesn't  make any sense. So I would hope that we can defeat this previous  question and that we can do something responsible: stand up for the  rule of law, stand up for the Constitution, stand up for common sense,  and overturn this executive order.
