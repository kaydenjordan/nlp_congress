 Madam Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge The Positive  Community magazine on its 20th anniversary.   The Positive Community started as an idea of two broadcasting  professionals, Adrian Council, Sr., and Jean Nash Wells. They were  tired of all of the negative press about African Americans. They wanted  to create a publication that focused on the good news coming from these  communities.   They started with a newsletter and distributed it to churches and  community centers. It became so popular that they turned it into a  magazine. Today, The Positive Community magazine and its website  highlights great events and people from our African American culture.   I applaud their efforts and encourage more people to read it. It is  time to hear more positive stories from African Americans in their  communities.                            ____________________
