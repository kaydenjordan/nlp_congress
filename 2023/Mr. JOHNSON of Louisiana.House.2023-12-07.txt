 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to  introduce my longtime friend, Bishop Larry Lawrence Brandon, who I have  the honor of hosting as our guest chaplain in the House today.   Bishop Brandon is the senior pastor of Praise Temple Missionary  Baptist Church, which has faithfully served the people of the  Shreveport-Bossier area for over three decades.   In 1992, Bishop Brandon and six others founded Praise Temple. They  met in the homes of local church leaders for prayer offerings and Bible  study until they eventually moved into a worship space in Shreveport.   Under his dutiful stewardship, the church flourished. They have built  the ``church where the doors swing on the hinges of love,'' as their  motto states.   Last year, he moved back to his hometown of Oakland, California, to  expand his ministry, but he holds deep ties to our area back home and  is a beloved member of our community.   Bishop Brandon has been a trusted leader in the Shreveport-Bossier  area. He has served in leadership roles in local nonprofits, civic  organizations, faith-based ministries, and still serves as president of  the Northwest Louisiana Community Development Corporation.   Bishop Brandon has been a great advocate for the sanctity of human  life, and his work in the community and in biblical scholarship has  served as an important reminder of the eternal hope that we have in  Christ.   I am grateful that he is joining us as our guest chaplain.                            ____________________
