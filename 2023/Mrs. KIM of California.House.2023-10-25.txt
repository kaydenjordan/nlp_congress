 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  resolution to demonstrate that this House stands united with Israel as  it defends itself against the barbaric war launched by Hamas and other  terrorists.   On October 7, we watched in horror as hundreds of terrorists poured  across the Israel-Gaza border and massacred, kidnapped, and raped  Israelis. It is abhorrent. This is at the hands of Hamas  [[Page H5057]]  and Hezbollah terrorist groups backed and funded by the Iran regime.  They want to wipe Israel off the map. Thousands of rockets have fallen  on Israel and continue falling as we speak. This has been the worst  attack on Jews since the Holocaust.   I visited Israel last year, and I felt the constant threat of attack  that the people of Israel face. It reminded me of my time growing up in  South Korea as a young girl after the Korean war, and I felt that  constant threat coming from North Korea. This is really personal to me.  Hamas now holds around 200 hostages from Israel, the U.S., and other  countries around the world.   Israel has a right to defend itself against terrorist aggression,  bring its hostages home, and its right to exist.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Meeks for  leading this resolution, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
