 Madam Speaker, 28 days ago on Martin Luther King,  Jr.'s birthday, Virginia became the 38th State to ratify the ERA. After  decades of struggle, 48 years after congressional passage, two-thirds  of the States agreed to an amendment that secures equal rights for all  American citizens regardless of sex. This amendment would touch every  corner of our lives.   With 24 words our Nation will finally fully recognize women as equal  participants in society.   To my colleagues opposing the ERA: What are you afraid of?   How can you oppose this resolution and then look women in your  district, in your churches, and in your own homes in the eye?   Today is your chance to stand on the right side of her story. I  implore my colleagues, vote ``yes'' on H.J. Res. 79. Let us finish this  struggle and at long last have women and men finally equal under the  law with their rights enshrined in the U.S. Constitution.                                time  1030
