 Madam President, I had a press conference this Sunday  back home in Illinois to talk about what the American Rescue Plan means  to our State. It is dramatic. Dramatic.   Millions of dollars will be coming to our State to buy vaccines. I  can tell you, all across Illinois, people are asking: When is it my  turn? When do I get my chance? And we want to make sure they get that  chance sooner rather than later.   Think about what President Biden inherited just a few weeks ago.  Surely they had found some vaccines--excellent vaccines by Pfizer and  Moderna--approved by then, but he came to the White House to find that  there was no plan to administer those vaccines across the Nation.   Vaccine is important, but it is of little value if it is not in the  arms of Americans. So he set out to establish a standard that we would  be distributing this vaccine across the United States as quickly as  possible and the mechanism, the infrastructure to make certain that it  was administered by professionals who know what they are doing. That is  quite an undertaking. It is the largest vaccination in the history of  our Nation. But President Biden said he needed help to do it--not just  money for the vaccine but money for testing, money for the genomic  sequencing necessary to detect variants that might be emerging in the  United States. That was a major element of the bill that passed this  Senate last Saturday.   He also put money in there that had already been promised to the  American people. Remember when President Trump said $2,000 for every  American? We agreed on a bipartisan basis. The first downpayment was  last December, $600, and the remainder, $1,400, was included in the  bill that passed on Saturday.   I have yet to hear a Republican Senator come to this floor and  criticize that sum of money. All of them--I should say most of them  have publicly supported it, and others say little or nothing about it,  but no one is saying that it shouldn't be given as a result of the  promise made. We kept that promise. That was part of what we were  doing.   We also had a responsibility to millions of Americans who are still  collecting unemployment. As of March 14,  [[Page S1413]]  they were going to lose their opportunity to continue that unemployment  check.   There were arguments made on the floor here that these were just lazy  people and that if you give them an unemployment check, they will just  continue to be lazy and won't go back to work. I don't buy that. I  don't believe it. Are some lazy? Well, possibly. I think the vast  majority of these people are desperate. They are desperate because they  have been laid off or lost their jobs and they need to keep their  families together.   Unemployment benefits do that, and they also give fuel to the economy  to recover. We were told that by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve  and others--to put enough stimulus back in this economy so we can come  out of it strong sooner rather than later. I believe that. Yet people  like the Republican Senator from Ohio came to the floor talking about  the recovery underway and we don't really need to do as much as  President Biden had asked for. I disagree.   All across the board, the bill that we passed, whether it is money  for schools or money for hospitals or money for clinics or money for  administering this vaccine, was money that will be well spent in the  State of Illinois and all across the United States.   Now what troubles me is this: Last year, we had two major bills for  COVID relief. They talk about five. There were two major bills. The  first was in March, the CARES Act that was worth $2 trillion. That bill  passed the Senate after it had been engineered by Treasury Secretary  Mnuchin of the Trump administration. It passed the Senate with every  Senator voting yes, 96 to nothing. Every Democratic Senator voted for  it.   Then came the followup bill in December, some $900 billion for more  COVID relief, for a temporary, first-quarter-of-this-year fix. When you  look at the final rollcall there, it was 92 to 6. All six ``no'' votes  were Republicans. Every Democrat who voted, voted for it--again, a  Trump proposal that we supported on the Democratic side.   So then the tables turned on January 20, and a new President came to  town. Joe Biden said: Let me finish this and do it effectively. Give me  an American Rescue Plan.   How many Republican Senators stood up and said: Well, since the  Democrats, in the spirit of responding to this pandemic, came around  and supported the Trump plans last year, we will do the same this year.  The number--zero. Not one Republican Senator supported the bill that  passed on Saturday. We passed it with 50 Democratic votes. That is what  it took, with one Republican Senator being missing. But what a  disappointment that is, to think that this pandemic and the economic  crisis that followed was addressed on a bipartisan basis with every  Democratic vote in the major legislation last year, and this year,  under President Biden, we couldn't get one Republican Senator to join  us in that effort. It is a disappointment, but I hope it isn't a  portent of things to come. We have a lot to do, and we need to do it  together on a bipartisan basis. The American people are going to count  on us to do it.    I also might say a word about the nominations that Senator McConnell  referred to earlier. It is true that some of these nominees are getting  votes that indicate a strong majority in support, and that does  evidence Republican cooperation, and I want to thank them for joining  us in that bipartisan spirit. But it evidences something else as well.  These are good nominees. These are good men and women who can serve  this country effectively. Given the chance, they will, and the votes  that have been cast in support of them indicate that as well.   I won't go into the experience 4 years ago with the Trump nominees,  but many of them had troubled records, and some of them didn't even  file the necessary disclosures before their names were submitted to us  for consideration. So there are a lot of things that have changed in  the 4-year period of time. Now we have a chance to approve a team for  President Biden and to fill out his national security team.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 644         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
