 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Senator Klobuchar and I are here to talk  about National Adoption Month.   I think we started a little bit late, so by unanimous consent, I ask  that we be allowed to extend our closing time by the same number of  minutes.    Mr. President, it is good for both of us and our  colleagues to be thinking this month about National Adoption Month, to  recognize the celebration of National Adoption Day, which will occur  this Saturday. I have had the great privilege of serving as cochair of  the Coalition on Adoption with Senator Klobuchar from Minnesota. It is  an opportunity not only for us to work together in a bipartisan way,  but at an event we attended just the other  [[Page S7193]]  day, I was told the adoption caucus in the House and Senate is the  biggest caucus of either body and the biggest caucus of the Congress.  Of course, it should be. It is built on the idea that kids have the  need of a family and that there are families out there who want to  adopt kids. Whether that is nationally, domestically, or  internationally, we really work hard to try to make that more possible.   Our House cochairs have been great to work with. Senator Klobuchar  and I are working on several pieces of legislation right now to make it  easier for families to adopt and to make sure adopted families have the  support they need to stay strong.   One piece of legislation we are working on is the Adoption Tax Credit  Refundability Act. It is a little bit outside the norm of the  discussion of simplifying the Tax Code, but I was pleased the other day  to have some important evidence put on the table when the chairman of  the House Ways and Means Committee--who, by the way, is an adoptive  father of two sons and an advocate for adoption and for kids--when the  current adoption tax credit was not in the House bill, he said one of  the reasons it is not here is so many families who adopt kids don't pay  income tax because of the low level of their income. My thought was,  well, that is exactly what Senator Klobuchar and I were saying. That  should be a refundable credit as well as a credit, but I am glad to see  the current credit back in the tax bill that the Finance Committee is  looking at now. We want to continue to look at not only the current  credit but expanding that.   According to the Department of Health and Human Services, one-third  of all adopted children live in families with an annual household  income at or below 200 percent of the poverty level. It is because of  that the tax burden is low. They don't pay income taxes. The adoption  tax credit isn't as helpful to those families as it is to families who  actually have income tax to credit it against.   More than 400,000 children now in the United States are also in the  foster care system, and more than 100,000 of those 400,000 kids are  ready and waiting for families they can call their own. Lots of other  children need to be in families all over the world, but we can be  looking carefully at the children in our system now. We both looked-- and others have joined us in that--at the foster care system and  ensuring behavioral health screening happens within 30 days of getting  into that system. Once you get into the foster care system, often it is  because of unavoidable challenges families face, and often it is  because of challenges kids should never have to face. So that early  evaluation of what is going on there can really make a difference in  how foster kids are dealt with in the system and how they get ready--as  100,000 of them now are--to leave the foster care system and be  adopted.   Before I turn to Senator Klobuchar, I just want to mention some kids  right now who are on what is called the Missouri Heart Gallery. More  than 1,200 Missouri children are in need of permanent homes. The  Missouri Heart Gallery is a place to look, as we approach the end of  this year, to see what the stories of some of these kids are.   Brandon, for instance, who is 12, loves to play games. LEGO sets are  his favorite toy. He likes to smile and give hugs. He probably hasn't  gotten enough hugs in his life up until now, but it is possible to try  your best to catch up with kids who need hugs. He needs a stable and  loving family. He is often playing outside. It would be wonderful if he  were playing outside a house or a home that he knew was a permanent  home for him.   Shaniah and Shanae are sisters who hope to be placed together, and  they hope to have a chance to maintain contact with their aunt  following placement. Shaniah loves dancing and cheerleading. Her  favorite color is green. She hopes to be a scientist one day. Shanae's  favorite hobby is singing, and she makes friends really easily between  her dancing and singing skills that she shares with her sister. Both of  these girls would really bring a lot of life and vitality into what we  would hope would be their family forever.   Brandon, Shaniah, and Shanae are in need of permanent and loving  homes. This is a time when we ought to be thinking not only about the  obstacles to adoption, the things that encourage adoption but also how  we can make the support system for both adoption and foster care and  adoption out of foster care work better.   I know my colleagues will be eager to join Senator Klobuchar and me  in marking November as National Adoption Month and by passing our  resolution today.   I turn to my friend from Minnesota Senator Klobuchar.    Mr. President, I thank Senator Klobuchar. We will continue  to work on this. We are glad it is so well-received and these are  issues our colleagues pay close attention to. Whether it is domestic or  international, we are going to continue to find ways to open the doors  to more homes and to get access to more tire swings. I look forward to  that work.   Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 331, submitted  earlier today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution  be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess as under the previous order until 2:15 p.m. today.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:19 p.m., recessed until  2:15 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer  (Mrs. Capito).                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 10 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
