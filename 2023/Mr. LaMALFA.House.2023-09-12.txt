 Mr. Speaker, our Federal wildland firefighters have been  performing much of the heavy lifting not only this year with fires  raging in my district, but every year, especially in the Western  States.   What is their reward? If we don't get legislation done promptly, they  could see a 40 to 50 percent pay cut. How did this happen? Well, a  temporary measure was inserted into the infrastructure bill that was  supposed to last for 5 years and keep funding a bonus system up for the  firefighters. Instead, it ran out after only 2 years, and time is up  this September.   How can we have a situation where firefighters are going to receive a  pay cut of 40 to 50 percent mid-season, where they might be forced to  walk off the job because they have to go somewhere else in order to  make a living in September, as fire season could well rage on, as  indeed that is the peak of the year in the West?   We have legislation known as the Fair Pay for Federal Firefighters  Act, which will repurpose funds that are sitting otherwise unused, and  probably justifiably so in other bills, and repurpose that in order to  boost firefighter pay to at least keep them at a level playing field  for the rest of this year until we can do a proper job of legislating  this correctly to keep their pay up.                            ____________________
