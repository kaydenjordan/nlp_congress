 Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend and fellow Georgian,  Congressman Buddy Carter, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a staunch supporter and original  cosponsor of Mr. Carter's FairTax Act, a commonsense piece of  legislation designed to create a simplified and fair code that works  for everyone.   Most Americans would agree that tax season is stressful and at times  intimidating. This is largely due to the fact that our Tax Code has  become overwhelmingly complicated and the IRS is generally unavailable  on the phone. In fact, over the past year, my Gainesville district  office has processed nearly 200 casework issues involving the IRS, and  with an IRS backlog of more than 2 million returns, I know this issue  is felt by taxpayers across the country.   While great reforms were made in President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act, I believe the next necessary step is to completely overhaul  our overly complex Tax Code with the FairTax Act. The FairTax Act  represents a long-term solution by repealing all Federal, corporate,  and individual income taxes, payroll taxes, self-employment taxes, and  death taxes, replacing our misguided system with the revenue-neutral  personal consumption tax.   Under the FairTax Act, Americans would be able to keep their entire  paycheck and only pay taxes on the goods and services that they  actually purchase. With no national income tax, there would be no need  to file a tax return. April 15--or in this year's case, April 18,  today--would become just another beautiful spring day.    The FairTax Act is also a critical step to truly stop the  weaponization of the IRS. In 2013, I was a victim of the IRS' abuse  through unjustified civil asset forfeiture against my small business to  the tune of $940,000. I relentlessly fought back for months, eventually  reclaiming my hard-earned money through the court system. Then I took  my case to Congress leading to the creation and passage of what  eventually was called the Clyde-Hirsch-Sowers RESPECT Act, which  President Trump signed into law to ensure no American faces this  injustice ever again.   Unfortunately, I know that I am not the only victim of the severe  overreach of the Internal Revenue Service. In fact, to make matters  worse, just last year, my Democratic colleagues provided the IRS with a  whopping $80 billion with the primary purpose of expanding the already  bloated agency. The IRS recently confirmed it is set to hire nearly  30,000 new employees over the next 2 years drastically increasing the  agency's auditing capabilities in order to rake in billions of dollars  to pay for President Biden's pricey Green New Deal agenda.   House Republicans' first vote this Congress repealed this unnecessary  funding authorization, and it is past time for Congress to fully recoup  this money--sending a strong message that this institution values  fiscal responsibility and stands against the weaponization of the IRS.   Not only would Congressman Carter's FairTax Act eliminate the need  for the IRS, but it would also lead to economic prosperity. Economists  resoundingly agree that the FairTax Act would significantly boost our  Nation's economy. Eliminating corporate taxes would incentivize  corporations to headquarter in the United States, which would provide  new jobs and economic development in our communities. The cost savings  these companies experience will drive the competitive market,  ultimately lowering prices of goods and services for Americans. In  turn, Americans would have more freedom to reinvest in the economy  since there would be no tax on pure investments.   In closing, I am a proud supporter of Representative Carter's FairTax  Act, and I strongly urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill  to not only simplify but also improve our tax system.  [[Page H1793]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Congresswoman Miller from  Illinois, for leading on this important issue, this important Special  Order, and for being a leader in defending religious freedom.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor and celebration of Faith Month.  During Faith Month, we celebrate the enduring power of the Bible as  God's revelation to His creation, offering guidance and the promise of  eternal life through the Gospel of His word.   This sacred text has played a pivotal role in shaping the very fabric  of our Nation, acting as a guard for liberty in the United States of  America.   Over 400 years ago, settlers fled religious persecution in search of  the New World, and the Bible became the cornerstone of our Founding  Fathers' vision for a free government. Their wise leadership wove the  Word of God into the foundation and core principles of our Nation,  ensuring unity and success for generations to come.   Our Founders wisely and proudly proclaimed that our liberties are not  bestowed by the government, but by our heavenly creator. As Thomas  Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence, ``We hold these  truths to be self-  [[Page H1799]]  evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their  Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.''   This includes the most pivotal liberties, outlined in the First  Amendment, which preserves our unalienable right to religious liberty.  Undoubtedly, this remains one of the most important foundations of our  Nation, but I see little by little, day by day, these religious  liberties are in danger of being canceled or abandoned because of  persecution in government at all levels.   We must not allow that to continue, and so we must defend all our  God-given liberties from government overreach and we, in Congress, must  lead on this issue. Today and every day, may we individually and  unapologetically rejoice in our faith.   As we move forward, let us continue to use God's word as the guiding  light. Our government founded on faith and His divine plan will bring  peace, freedom, and liberty to all who call this great Nation home.
