 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I support this amendment because we want every veteran who may be  eligible to receive no-cost childcare to be able to access it. If  veterans don't know that they may be eligible to place their child in  childcare while they attend their healthcare appointments, they may  mistakenly think they will have to miss their healthcare appointments  to care for their children.   When veterans are not aware of the healthcare benefits available to  them, or don't know where or who to turn to for help, the result can  sometimes be fatal.   When 20 veterans and servicemembers commit suicide every day in this  country, and the VA under this administration only spent $57,000 last  year out of the $6.2 million set aside for suicide prevention outreach,  that is less than 1 percent. The administration's lack of commitment  shows.   As VA's top clinical priority, we cannot allow VA to continue to fail  in its duty to notify veterans of VA's mental health and suicide  prevention services, and that is why I support this amendment.   If VA is not mandated by Congress to notify and conduct outreach to  veterans, it won't do it. Many veterans who would benefit from cost- free childcare won't know it exists.    Mr. Chairman, I would also like to quickly add that  Congressman Allred, a new member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs,  is expecting his first child any day now, so it is very appropriate  that we are debating a bill today that will help so many veterans who  are parents of young children.   I thank both Congresswoman Sherrill and Congressman Allred for  offering this amendment, and if it is adopted, this committee will  ensure VA conducts outreach and notifies veterans of their childcare  benefits.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Wisconsin for  yielding.   I support this more amendment because we need to know how many  veterans and children are eligible for no-cost childcare versus how  many veterans and children are participating in this program.   Each region and medical facility should know how many veterans and  children are eligible, and this report asks for VA to report this data  in the President's budget submission to Congress so we can ensure VA is  accurately reporting the resources it needs to make this a successful  program.   Every 2 years, the VA would also be required to report other  challenges and barriers veterans face, apart from childcare services  that prevent veterans from receiving their healthcare at VA.  [[Page H1471]]    This report is also key to ensuring VA conducts the outreach and  notifications to eligible veterans that would be required if this bill  passes into law. This bill will require VA to assess whether lack of  outreach by VA, or lack of awareness by veterans of this no-cost  childcare program is a reason for lower participation.   This report would hold VA accountable for not doing everything it can  to make this benefit available for the veterans who need it. I support  this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I support this amendment offered by Congresswoman Kuster, a former  member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and a tireless advocate for  veterans in the State of New Hampshire. I am pleased that our  colleague, Congressman Pappas from New Hampshire, has joined our  committee so that we can continue to work on veterans legislation for  the veterans of the State of New Hampshire and across the country.   This amendment will require the VA to establish criteria for  childcare assistance for veterans who need to drive long distances or  face other unique geographic challenges. I believe that this amendment  would also address some of the concerns raised by our colleague Mr.  Sablan from the Northern Mariana Islands, where veterans must cross the  Pacific Ocean to access VA healthcare. I also thank the gentlewoman for  including a technical fix for the underlying bill in her amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I support this amendment because veterans should be able to receive  stipends for extended day programs for their children. Extended day  programs are before- or after-school childcare programs that are  generally less expensive than traditional childcare services and often  include tutoring or other academic assistance to children.   If placing children in an extended day program is a convenient way  for veterans to make sure their children are being cared for while they  attend their healthcare appointments, we should support making this  alternative and often less expensive childcare service available to  them.   Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to  do the same.    Will the gentleman yield?    The order of the amendments got reversed.    That is correct.                                time  0945     Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and let me  also associate myself with the remarks of the ranking member. I thank  Congressman Golden for his service and, more importantly, thank him for  sharing his story so bravely and forthrightly on the House floor. I  hope it will do much to encourage other veterans to seek counseling  with the VA.   I support this amendment because the transition from military to  civilian life can be a stressful time for many veterans. When veterans  are simultaneously caring for children, it can be difficult for  veterans, during this time when they may be looking for or starting a  new job or starting school, to get the mental health services they  need. They should not be worried about finding and affording childcare  so they can receive mental health counseling and healthcare treatment  when the VA can provide it at no cost.   Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for offering this important  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I support this amendment because veterans living in rural or highly  rural areas face many barriers to receiving healthcare. Childcare,  whether for a lack of convenience or its high cost, should not be  another roadblock for veterans who must sometimes travel great  distances for their appointments.   This amendment would require VA to report to Congress on the  effectiveness and accessibility of no-cost childcare for veterans  living in rural communities. This report can, in turn, be used to find  solutions for veterans who need both childcare and healthcare in rural  communities.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment, and I  urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I  also thank the gentlewoman for her service in our military as a Navy  pilot.   I support this very important amendment because veterans must be able  to trust that childcare centers and childcare providers caring for  their children will not place their children at risk.   At a very minimum, the veterans should know that when they receive  their health services, their children are safe. This amendment would  prevent an onsite VA childcare center, or any childcare agency that has  a contract with VA, from employing anyone convicted of sex crimes,  offenses involving a child victim, violent crimes, drug felonies, or  other offenses.   Since State and local laws often have even stricter standards when it  comes to who can be employed as a childcare provider, this amendment  would not supersede those State or local laws or any contract or  agreement that requires higher standards to be met.   At the very minimum, veterans who need childcare so they can see  their healthcare providers must trust that those who are watching their  children will keep their kids safe. I thank the gentlewoman for  offering this very important amendment.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I  support this amendment because veterans, especially women veterans, who  have been victims of military sexual trauma, often need intensive  healthcare services and mental health treatment that can require  frequent appointments at VA medical centers, clinics, and vet centers.   Finding convenient, safe, and affordable childcare should not stop  veterans from receiving treatment, especially veterans who are victims  of sexual assault in the military and suffer from the lasting effects  of that trauma.   This committee, through the Women Veterans Task Force, led by  Congresswoman Brownley, will make access to care for women veterans and  their specific healthcare needs a priority of ours. I support this  amendment and urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I rise  to support this amendment because it would allow the VA to consult with  the Department of Defense on the implementation of this bill.   Since DOD provides childcare for servicemembers and their families,  VA can look to DOD for best practices so that it can successfully and  efficiently expand this program so that every veteran eligible for no- cost childcare while they are receiving healthcare services can access  this benefit when they need it.   I thank the Congresswoman for offering this amendment, and I urge my  colleagues to support it. I might also add that I am pleased to see so  many of the amendments that my colleagues offered today are adopted. I  hope that when we vote on this much improved bill, it will pass with  unanimous support so that I can advocate for its swift passage with my  Senate colleagues.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the motion  to recommit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Lamb), who was a former criminal prosecutor before he arrived in  Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that, in the  engrossment of H.R. 840, the Clerk be authorized to correct section  numbers, punctuation, spelling, and cross-references, and to make such  other technical and conforming changes as may be necessary to reflect  the actions of the House in amending the bill, including the changes  now at the desk.
