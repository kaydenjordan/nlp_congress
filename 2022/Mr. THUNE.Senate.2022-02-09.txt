 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, one of the big drivers of our inflation  crisis was Democrats' decision to flood the economy with unnecessary  government money last March with their $1.9 trillion spending bill.   Another contributor to the problem has been supply chain bottlenecks.  Americans are getting pretty used to long delays in receiving the goods  they have ordered, to big holes on grocery store shelves, and to being  unable to rely on a store to keep a product in stock consistently.   Since the start of the pandemic, keeping goods in stock has been a  challenge, but, as with the larger inflation crisis, the White House  has seemed largely uninterested in addressing the problem. ``The  tragedy of the treadmill that's delayed''--that was a quote of the  White House Press Secretary, joking in October, a typically tone-deaf  comment from an administration often oblivious to the difficulties  facing ordinary Americans.   In fact, supply chain issues are not a minor inconvenience; they are  a real problem. It is not easy for an already overstretched mom or dad  to have to run around town trying to find essential items--items they  could previously rely on one store, at least, to have in stock.  Businesses are struggling to maintain their profit margins and meet the  demands of their customers, particularly small businesses, which have  fewer resources to work around supply chain problems. Of course, supply  chain problems are helping to fuel the price hikes Americans have been  facing on everything from food and clothing to furniture, to used cars  and trucks.   These are facts that seem lost on the administration, which has  largely ignored supply chain issues and the inflation crisis in favor  of focusing on pet projects: a massive tax-and-spending spree and  election legislation that it thinks will boost Democrat chances in the  fall.   On top of this, the administration has taken more than one action  that is making or seems likely to make our supply chain problems even  worse.   Earlier this week, for example, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety  Administration implemented its entry-level driver training rule, which  substantially expands training requirements for drivers seeking to  obtain a commercial driver's license. The new rule is likely to make it  significantly more challenging for trucking companies to train new  drivers, particularly for smaller trucking companies, which may  struggle to afford the enhanced training costs.   The trucking industry has been hit hard by the supply chain crisis,  with drivers working longer hours with fewer resources to keep goods  moving across the country. They have been heroes. This makes it a very  bad time to impose new burdens on truckers and tie up trucking  companies with additional redtape.   The administration should have delayed the implementation of this  rule until the worst of the supply chain crisis eases. Unfortunately,  the administration decided to push ahead anyway, and now truckdrivers  and trucking companies will face additional challenges, which will  likely exacerbate supply chain problems.   The Canada-U.S. cross-border truckdriver vaccine mandate is another  administration action that has created new pressures on a trucking  industry already stretched thin thanks to the supply chain crisis. I am  a strong supporter of vaccines, but mandating vaccines for cross-border  truckdrivers has only served to worsen supply chain bottlenecks. You  just need to look at the current situation in Canada to see the  evidence of that. Truckdrivers do not pose a high risk of COVID  transmission since they spend most of their workday alone. This  mandate's main legacy looks likely to be increasing the supply chain  problems we are facing.   Then, of course, there is the administration's hostile attitude  toward conventional energy production. The administration might not  like it, but the fact of the matter is that our economy will continue  to rely on conventional energy like gasoline for a while yet.  Discouraging conventional energy production, as the administration has  done, is doing nothing but worsening our inflation and supply chain  crisis and driving up energy bills for American families.   Energy prices have a substantial effect on prices in the store and on  the availability of goods. The higher energy prices are, the more  expensive it will be to produce and transport goods. The more it costs  to produce and transport goods, the higher the final price of the goods  is likely to be.   The administration's hostility to traditional energy production has  helped drive energy prices up, which is aggravating, making worse, our  supply chain and inflation crises.   Instead of imposing unhelpful new regulations, it would be nice to  see the administration turn its focus to meaningful measures to address  the supply chain crisis, like those in the bipartisan legislation I  introduced last week with Senator Amy Klobuchar.   For some time now, I have heard reports of ocean carriers refusing to  [[Page S585]]  transport certain goods--often American agricultural products, which  impacts my State of South Dakota--in favor of more lucrative cargoes.  Our legislation is designed to address this problem and create a more  level playing field for American producers.   Our bill gives the Federal Maritime Commission greater authority to  respond to discriminatory ocean carrier practices, and it provides the  FMC with tools to more quickly resolve detention and demurrage  disputes.   This legislation will bring greater efficiency and transparency to a  process that leaves many shippers frustrated--especially small  businesses--and bring long-term, positive changes to the maritime  supply chain, which I hope will benefit exporters, importers, and  consumers alike.   These are the kinds of measures the White House should be focusing  on, measures that open up the supply chain instead of weighing it down  with government mandates and regulations.   Given the administration's general lack of concern with the supply  chain and inflation crises facing the American people, I don't have a  lot of hope that the White House is going to do much to address either  of these problems, but I will continue to work with my colleagues in  Congress from both parties wherever possible to advance measures that  will ease our supply chain problems and help to get back to a situation  where goods move smoothly around our country and around the world.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
