 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the physician  shortage in the United States, and our need to act swiftly for the  future.   If this pandemic has taught us one thing, that is the need to have an  adequate number of physicians throughout our country. The current  health crisis has emphasized the importance of making those kinds of  investments in our healthcare system.   Earlier this month, the House passed the HEROES Act. I incorporated  legislation that I had introduced that would expand medical education  in underserved areas, like the San Joaquin Valley, that I represent.  This legislation is critical to addressing the doctor shortages today  and tomorrow in our country.   In January, I introduced the Expanding Medical Education Act. That is  what we need to do.   I am pleased that my colleagues in the House supported this effort  and included it in the HEROES Act. These are our heroes.   As negotiations for the next coronavirus relief bill continue, I urge  my colleagues in the Senate to act, to recognize the importance of this  issue. Do not delay. The need to enhance our healthcare capacity has  never ever been more apparent.   As a result of COVID-19, we need doctors today, we need doctors  tomorrow, and we need a part of our entire healthcare system to rebuild  it, to invest in it. Those are the kind of investments we need to make.   I will continue to fight for every dollar to ensure that our Valley  residents have access to the healthcare they deserve.                            ____________________
