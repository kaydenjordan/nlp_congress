 Mr. President, more is happening with minerals around  the world than ever before. We are seeing global demand driven by  growth and technology, legislation and regulation. Everything is just  skyrocketing. Yet the global supply is often tenuous. Really, it is  very thoroughly dominated by China, and there are clear warning signs  that we here in the United States urgently need to reduce our foreign  dependence by rebuilding our domestic supply chains.   As we stand here today, our Nation's lack of mineral security is a  glaring vulnerability. It is a threat to our security. It is a threat  to our competitiveness. It is a threat to our geopolitical power and  our ability to lead on industries of the future. The obvious solution  is to do a lot more in this space, which makes sense, but it starts  with mining, and until we have achieved stable, affordable supplies of  as many minerals as possible here at home, that vulnerability will  continue.   We have begun to put a framework in place to do that. We did this  through the legislation that I had introduced, the American Mineral and  Security Act. We also did some with the bipartisan infrastructure law  and with the provisions that Chairman Manchin added to the Inflation  Reduction Act. These are a good start, but there is no shortage of  minerals where meaningful action is still needed.   So we could talk about copper--the ``metal of electrification'' as my  friend Dr. Daniel Yergin puts it--where forecasts of shortages in the  twenties and thirties are becoming commonplace. Now, I would be the  first one to acknowledge that we cannot produce copper everywhere it is  found--I think there are just a few places that are too, too  sensitive--but we need to make up for this by approving projects in  locations where it does make sense, and that is simply not happening  right now.   We could also talk about gallium and germanium. Just before the  Fourth of July, our Independence Day, China announced export controls  for both of these critical minerals as part of their escalating war  over semiconductors. So what is our domestic reaction to that? Well, it  is not independence. It has really become more of a scramble. We have  seen with the Department of the Interior that they have repeatedly  delayed a good project in Alaska--this is the Ambler Access Project-- that would provide access to long-term supplies of both germanium and  gallium.   What we are doing here is giving China leverage. They have certainly  seized on it in what could well become a pattern across dozens of  minerals and materials. In a very real sense, in many ways, we are  giving them bullets for the gun that they will hold us hostage to. And  it is not just here in the United States. We saw it just few years back  when China cut off supplies of rare earths to Japan in an effort to  utilize that leverage.   Today, I have come to the floor to discuss a different type of  critical mineral, and that is graphite.   Graphite is described by the U.S. Geological Survey as a ``soft,  crystalline form of carbon'' that ``occurs naturally in metamorphic  rocks such as marble, schist, and gneiss.'' Graphite ``exhibits the  properties of a metal and a nonmetal,'' which include ``thermal and  electrical conductivity'' as well as ``inertness, high thermal  resistance, and lubricity.'' Graphite is valued because it is  relatively lightweight. Yet it is very dense. It is a good  semiconductor, a good conductor, and more stable than many of the  alternatives.   Now, most of us are most familiar with the graphite that we know in  pencils. Pencils don't contain lead; they contain graphite. It is also  used in things like brake linings, steelmaking, headphones, and today,  perhaps most crucially, advanced rechargeable batteries and fuel cells.  So if you care about smartphones, if you care about EVs, if you care  about climate change and the energy transition, there is really no way  around it--you will need to care a lot more about graphite than you  probably currently do.    Lithium-ion batteries typically require far more graphite than  lithium--up to 15 times more. Graphite can account for more than a  quarter of those  [[Page S2303]]  batteries' weight and up to 95 percent of their anode materials. That  makes graphite both fundamental to our mineral security and really very  irreplaceable for many technologies.   I am not a materials scientist, and I think most aren't, but for  those who aren't, Bloomberg's Liam Denning recently summarized  graphite's use in EVs as follows. He said:         Graphite is the main material for the battery's anode,       which takes in and holds lithium ions during charging and       releases them when energy is needed. . . . [G]raphite's       combination of high thermal and electrical conductivity with       chemical inertness makes it very useful when you want to       cycle through lots of energy flows without stuff degrading or       blowing up. A typical 60 kilowatt-hour EV battery might hold       160 pounds of graphite compared with perhaps 20 pounds of       lithium. And while the exact mix of other metals such as       cobalt and nickel in the other electrode--the cathode--may       change, graphite's place in the anode is more or less fixed.    So more technical than most of us would want, but just to put it in  very simple terms, if we want more smartphones and we want more EVs on  the roads, we are going to need a lot more graphite for them. That is  one of the main reasons that Chairman Manchin and I, along with  Senators Risch and Cassidy, urged President Biden back in March of last  year to declare graphite and other key battery minerals as ``essential  to the national defense'' under the Defense Production Act of 1950. I  appreciate and I thank the President for doing just that and then  working with us to secure hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal  appropriations for projects to produce them.   My view is, we don't have any more time to waste here. One rough  estimate is that every additional 1 million EVs will require 80,000  tons of graphite. That is why Benchmark Minerals projects the world  will need 97 new graphite mines by 2035 compared to just over 70 that  are operating today. It is why the International Energy Agency, the  IEA, projects that demand for graphite for clean energy technologies  could increase 25-fold--that is 2,500 percent--by the year 2040.   So you have to ask the question, are we on track to produce any of  that? The answer is no--not even remotely. A consultancy by the name of  Project Blue has projected an annual deficit of about 856,000 tons of  graphite by the year 2030.   Some of the anticipated demand can be filled by synthetic graphite,  which is made from fossil fuels such as petroleum coke, but a large  portion will need to come from newly mined natural graphite. Here is  the problem with that: The United States has not produced natural  graphite for about three decades now--since at least 1990 and perhaps  as far back as 1950, depending on your source. Instead, the United  States is entirely import-dependent, bringing in 100 percent of our  supply each year. Last year, that amounted to 82,000 metric tons of  natural graphite. And where did we get it from? China was the No. 1  source of our imports--at least 100 percent foreign dependence.   You might think it can't get any worse than that, but trust me, it  can, and it is. We can always import more volume, and that is exactly  what is happening. According to USGS, after a few down years in 2019  and 2020, our natural graphite imports rose by 48 percent in 2021 and  by 55 percent in 2022. So we are just--we need the stuff. Where are we  getting it? We are getting it imported. Where are we importing it from?  China.   Another part of the problem is that even if the United States begins  to produce graphite again, we won't know exactly what to do with it.  That is because we also lack the processing capabilities to turn  natural graphite into useful advanced material for batteries and other  products. This is, again, another area where China leads, and we are  paying very little attention here.   It will take a sustained effort to catch up on graphite processing,  so the question is, How long is this going to take? What will it cost  us? Who will our partners in these efforts be?   There has been some speculation that China's warning shot on gallium  might be a precursor for something that really hurts us, like  restrictions on graphite. According to Benchmark Minerals, China is  responsible for 61 percent of global graphite production and 98 percent  of processed graphite materials. EVs previously failed because the  technology just wasn't there. Yet it isn't hard to imagine them failing  again because the minerals and the materials aren't there.   If you are thinking ``OK, this is bad,'' you are right. It is bad.  But there is hope. There is hope on the horizon in the form of Graphite  One. This is a project in northwest Alaska. This is about 37 miles  outside of the community of Nome, AK.   This is not a picture of Nome, AK, although in the wintertime, it  could be just about that white. But what I want to demonstrate here is  what could be considered a crude writing utensil. I will just write my  name there. This is a hunk of graphite. This is solid graphite. It gets  your fingers a little bit dirty. This is a piece of graphite that I  picked up at the mine site in Nome. If I were to give you this piece of  graphite and you were to hold it in one hand and you were to hold your  cell phone in the other hand, you would be holding two pieces of  graphite. This is graphite. This is graphite. But this graphite from  Alaska would probably be the first piece of American graphite, of  domestic graphite that you have ever held in your life, because there  is nothing domestic about the graphite that goes into our cell phones  today.   This is just a small part, a small sample of what we can glean from  the Graphite One project, which USGS reports is North America's largest  natural graphite deposit. It is a world-class deposit. It is absolutely  massive compared to others around the world.   I mentioned that I was out there in Nome 3 days ago. On Saturday, I  was on the Graphite One property. It consists of well over 100 mining  claims on non-Federal land. This mine project is not new. They actually  mined this back in the early 1900s and then stopped production some  time ago. But I was able to visit the base camp there in Nome, the  Graphite Creek field camp, as well as a drill pad where the core  samples are being taken as part of the summer season. Of course, summer  in Alaska out in that region just means that is when the mosquitoes are  the most intense.   It was eye-opening to see how Graphite One is moving forward as they  are doing further exploration with this absolutely critical resource. I  have always supported Graphite One and what they are doing in Alaska,  but really, after my site visit there on Saturday, I am convinced that  this is a project that every one of us--those of us here in Congress,  the Biden administration, all of us--needs to support.   Graphite One's vision is to build a complete domestic supply chain  for natural graphite. Their project would be anchored by responsible  mining of the Graphite Creek deposit, producing tens of thousands of  metric tons a year. But it would also extend to a battery anode  manufacturing facility in Washington State, which would be colocated  with a battery recycling plant--which is why their CEO, Anthony Huston,  often describes Graphite One as ``a technology company that mines  graphite.''   This is a major opportunity for us. Previously, I have expressed some  disappointment to Secretary Granholm that the Biden administration is  heavily subsidizing a graphite processing plant in Louisiana that  imports graphite. They import graphite from Mozambique, an unstable  regime with a poor human rights record, a region where there has been  significant labor unrest and where ISIS is reportedly active.    It is not too late to realize the immense value that Graphite One  holds for our economy and our security. This project will give us a  significant domestic supply, breaking our wholesale dependence on  imports. This will be a secure supply of natural graphite from day one.  This stuff is pretty pure. Let me tell you, this was not just a random  piece of graphite; this graphite is literally under your very feet,  that you pick up with your hands. It is solid, solid material. It will  be a secure supply of natural graphite from day one without the  political and the security risks associated with so many projects that  are located abroad.   The health and environmental standards for Graphite One will both be  exceedingly high and fully transparent. The company's leadership is  working hard to ensure the project creates opportunities for the people  who live in the region in Nome, as well as the Inupiaq communities of  Brevig Mission, Mary's Igloo, and Teller.  [[Page S2304]]    This is where I want to end my comments because, during my tour of  Graphite One, I saw firsthand how even in these very developmental  stages, this project is already benefiting these Alaska Native  communities.   Graphite One is committed to Alaska hire. They are working with a  program that they call Arctic Access to help place disadvantaged  individuals into meaningful jobs. We were able to talk a little bit  about that program.   One of the individuals who really struck me was a gentleman by the  name of John. He was from Brevig Mission. He had been the water  treatment operator there in Brevig for some years. He was hired to run  Graphite One's very sophisticated water and wastewater system. John  told me he knew next to nothing about this state-of-the-art system  there, which could have been disqualifying in some places, but at  Graphite One, it didn't matter. Rather than hiring somebody from the  lower 48, they hired people to train him, and he is now succeeding. The  guy was just beaming from ear to ear about the opportunities and the  excitement that he has not only for the job but what this mine meant  for the region.   For people like John and other Alaskans, Graphite One is doing it  right. I am proud to have them operating in Alaska.   This is an opportunity for us as a country. Again, when we think  about our dependence, when we think about our vulnerability on others  for critical minerals and particularly our growing vulnerability on one  country--China--everything we can do to responsibly address this is a  step forward, and Alaska has a significant opportunity in front of us.   I would hope that every Member of the Senate and every member of the  administration will look at these as opportunities and join in doing  everything we can to support this important work.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  privileges of the floor be granted to my second session summer interns,  who are Madisen Lundamo, Jackson Church, Claire Moreland, Zev Katz,  Sierra Sterling, McKinley Rhoades, Lillian Yang, Cameron Paison, Emma  Mullet, Shanone Tejada, and to my Senate Committee on Indian Affairs  interns, who are Morgan Gray and Micah Wimmer, for the month of July  2023, as well as to my Coast Guard fellow, Amanda Klawinski, for the  duration of the 118th Congress.
