 Mr. Speaker, today is Juneteenth, a day to celebrate the  end of slavery in the United States.   The destructive history of slavery in this country flows through the  fabric of our social conscience, but much more so during the month of  June.   On June 19, 1865--hence, the name Juneteenth--the Union Army took  control over Texas. It is on that date, 2\1/2\ years after the fact,  when slaves in Texas learned about the Emancipation Proclamation. That  is how dominant the institution of slavery was. Slave owners were able  to keep freedom a secret for 2\1/2\ years.   The end of slavery didn't mean freedom came overnight. It took a  cultural transformation and the course of a hundred years before  African Americans could even vote. And the effects of slavery continue  still today.   On Juneteenth, we celebrate the end of slavery and aspire to be fully  free.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Garamendi, once again, for  stepping out and giving Members such as myself the opportunity to  express our outrage at what is going on in this great Nation of ours.  The gentleman has given me several opportunities to speak on issues  pertaining to this country that are at the core of decisions and issues  that we need to address, and his passion tonight is warranted.    Let me say, never in my life did I think that I would be on the floor  of the United States House of Representatives calling for the President  of the United States to stop tearing children away from their parents.  Yet here I am.   Perhaps it is fitting that today is Juneteenth, a holiday to  commemorate the end of slavery in the United States. Juneteenth is also  a stark reminder that our country has a dark history of ripping  children away from their parents.   African Americans know all too well that laws and policies can be  twisted to evil ends. We know all too well the pain of having our  children torn away from us and our families separated. It was a common  event during slavery. We know all too well that state-sponsored  psychological terror can have lasting effects on generations.   What is going on at our south border is evil. It is a deplorable  policy by deplorable people, and it has to stop.   The president of the American Academy of Pediatrics has explained  that the practice of ripping children away from their parents at the  border is child abuse. Let me emphasize, one of the country's leading  pediatricians has said that the United States is engaging in horrible  actions that ``disrupt the synapses and the neurological connections  that are part of the developing brain'' of these immigrant babies.   Who are we as a nation?   Now, I have heard pundits defending evil by saying that the Trump  administration is just following the law, just applying the law. I have  heard other pundits wrongly say migrant parents are breaking the law  and deserve to have their children taken away.   Attorney General Jeff Beauregard Sessions even trotted out the Bible  to defend the family-separation policy, quoting a passage that says  ``to obey the laws of the government because God has ordained the  government for his purposes.''   That is the same scripture that they used for slave-owners against  their slaves, to defend their practice of holding human beings in  bondage.   So let me answer Attorney General Beauregard Sessions and the Trump  administration's goons: Legal does not mean moral.   Slavery was legal, but it was immoral. Jim Crow was legal, but it was  immoral. Forced sterilization was legal, but it was immoral. Apartheid  was legal, but it was immoral. Tearing children away from their parents  at the border may be legal, but it is immoral.   The President could end this evil with one tweet. Congress can end it  with a vote. Let us hope that reasonable people steer the ship of the  state onto the right course before the seas of despair consume us all.   Mr. Speaker, I say to the gentleman from California, let me just say  that, as I thought about this, the gentleman has been in this body much  longer than I and has seen people come and go, great people on both  sides of the aisle that the gentleman has worked with. Well, let me  just say, what has happened? What has happened to that side of the  aisle? What is going on with our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle that they do not speak up? They all have children.   I would die for my triplets getting here if I was in a position where  I thought that my life and my children's lives were in danger where I  was. You had better believe I would come up here and try to get into  this Nation. We would all do that for our children.   Yet these people are criminals? It baffles the mind.   I know that time is fleeting, but I have seen the GOP come up with a  new nonprofit through this whole endeavor. They have created a new  nonprofit, sir. It is called ``Cage the Children.''
