 Mr. Speaker, Harvey took a lot away from us, but  it couldn't take away who we are as Texans. It has shown our resilience  and brought our communities closer together as we rebuild.   I am very proud of our volunteers and first responders who have shown  hospitality and heroism to support our neighbors in need. When disaster  struck, Texans came from across the State to help our communities  rebuild and recover from this storm.   In my district, central Texans set up evacuation shelters and donated  clothing and other necessary supplies. Our soldiers at Fort Hood and  our local fire and rescue teams headed southeast to assist in  lifesaving recovery missions because that is what Texans do: we come  together to support one another.   I know we will continue to work together as we rebuild after Harvey  and in the face of anything that comes our way.   By the way, a great big Texas thank-you to all our neighbors from  across the United States who also came to help.   Our hearts go out to those recovering disaster areas in Florida,  Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and all other communities in need  of help. Let's do it together.   God bless Texas.                            ____________________
