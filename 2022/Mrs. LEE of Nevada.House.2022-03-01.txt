 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Liz Bolhouse,  a pediatric ICU nurse back home in Las Vegas. Tonight, President Biden  will address this Congress and the Nation in the State of the Union  address, and Liz is my guest.   While we continue to recover from this pandemic, let's reflect on  what we have done. We have put over 500 million shots in arms of  Americans, our kids are back in school, our economy is getting back on  track, and a record-breaking 6.7 million jobs were created in the  President's first year.   It is hardworking Americans in southern Nevada, and all across this  Nation, who are the true heroes in this recovery. Liz is one of those  heroes. Liz has lived and worked in Nevada for 22 years as a nurse. It  goes without saying that these have been two of the hardest years in  all of our lives, but these 2 years have brought out the best in our  dedicated and selfless healthcare heroes, including Liz, and the  hundreds of Nevada nurses she represents as the SEIU Local 1107 chief  nursing steward.   I thank Liz and I thank every nurse back home and across this great  Nation for your hard work and dedication in keeping our communities  healthy and safe.                            ____________________
