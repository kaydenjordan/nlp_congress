 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 107--the  SFC Sean Cooley and SPC Christopher Horton Congressional Gold Star  Family Fellowship Program Act.   As the Representative of Fort Bragg, NC, the epicenter of the  universe, and one of the fastest growing veteran populations in the  country, I am all too familiar with what it means to be a ``Gold Star  Family''. Our community has many of these families who have lost a  loved one in the line of duty while serving our country and we remember  them each and every day.   This resolution before us today would give a renewed sense of  optimism to some of these family members by providing them the unique  opportunity to take part in a 12-month congressional fellowship in a  Congressional office. This fellowship would be modeled after other  successful programs to include the wounded warrior fellowship that  already exists.   Many of our offices have benefited by adding various types of fellows  to our staff and I'm sure we would all stand to benefit from having a  gold star family member as well. Nothing will ever be able to replace  the loss of a loved one, but today we have the opportunity to provide  an opportunity to those who have already sacrificed so much. I would  ask all of my colleagues to support this resolution and look forward to  its passage and having a gold star family fellow in my office soon.
