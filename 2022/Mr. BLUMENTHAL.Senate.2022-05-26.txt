 Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart  to pay tribute to Donald K. Ross, a tireless organizer for democracy.  Sadly, Mr. Ross passed away on May 14, 2022, at the age of 78. He will  be remembered for his lifetime of civic service and advocacy.   Born in the Bronx, NY, Mr. Ross was a leader from an early age. As  student body president, he successfully revived Fordham University's  football program, an experience he credited with teaching him how to  organize. Upon graduation, Mr. Ross spent 2 years with the Peace Corps  in Nigeria, before graduating from New York University's law school in  1970.   From there, Mr. Ross joined consumer advocate Ralph Nader's Public  Citizen movement, becoming one of the original ``Nader's Raiders.'' In  1971, they co-wrote ``Action for Change: A Student's Manual for Public  Interest Organizing,'' which led to the organization of Public Interest  Research Groups--PRIGs--across the country. These organizations combine  research and public action, encouraging public citizens to get involved  in important advocacy issues. Mr. Ross became the director of the New  York PRIG, where he advanced a number of political reforms and  advocated for increased government transparency.   Mr. Ross was also an outspoken anti-nuclear advocate. After the  tragic accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in  Pennsylvania, Mr. Ross organized anti-nuclear rallies that drew  hundreds of thousands of demonstrators. That he was able to mobilize so  many people in mere weeks after the accident is a testament to his  leadership skills and passion for the cause.   In addition to his organizing expertise, Mr. Ross was also a  dedicated philanthropist. From 1985 to 1999, he was director of the  Rockefeller Family Fund, a charitable organization where he worked to  expand access to grants for charitable causes. Additionally, Mr. Ross  cofounded and managed the Environmental Grantmakers Association, which  has grown to include over 200 member foundations around the world. A  champion of numerous causes, Mr. Ross directed the National Campaign to  Reform Juvenile Justice Systems from 2009 to 2017.   In my home State, Mr. Ross organized the Connecticut Citizen Action  Group, a statewide organization dedicated to actively engaging  residents to build a more sustainable, just society. In this and every  endeavor he undertook in his remarkable career, Mr. Ross was on the  frontlines of democracy, fighting to make our world a better place.   Connecticut and the Nation have lost a great civic organizer and  champion of democracy. Mr. Ross's tireless devotion to many worthy  causes--from environmental protection, to consumer advocacy, to  criminal justice reform, and so many others--serves as a model of  dedication and civic engagement. Through his work and his writings, Mr.  Ross has inspired a generation of citizens to become engaged in their  communities and fight for a more just world. While he will be sorely  missed, his legacy will live on in those who continue his work.   My wife Cynthia and I extend our deepest sympathies to Donald's  family during this difficult time, particularly to his wife Helen, and  his children Katherine, Margaret, and Mike. May their many wonderful  memories of Donald provide them solace and comfort in the days ahead. I  hope my colleagues will join me in remembering Donald K. Ross.                            ____________________
