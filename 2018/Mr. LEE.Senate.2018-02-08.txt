 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, there is good news, there is great news, and  then there is the story of Lucas Warren of Dalton, GA. I don't  personally know Lucas. In fact, he is only 18 months old. So he, of  course, has the good sense not to engage with or get to know  politicians, especially in Washington. But like so many millions of  Americans who have not met Lucas, I will never forget him.   Yesterday, the Gerber baby food company selected little Lucas as its  ``Gerber Spokesbaby'' for the year 2018. Lucas' winning photograph,  sent in by his parents Jason and Cortney, was selected from more than  140,000 entries. Even at a glance, it is not at all hard to see why.   This picture deserves much more than just a mere glance. I don't just  mean because of the bow tie. You see, Lucas Warren was born with Down  syndrome, which is to say that Jason and Cortney Warren are among those  Americans blessed to know, to love, and to be loved by someone with  Down syndrome. According to the Global Down Syndrome Foundation, only  38 percent of Americans are so lucky.   Those of us who are so lucky know the warmth and the tender cheer of  individuals with Down syndrome--the warmth and tender cheer they carry  with them everywhere they go. With little more than a smile, like  Lucas' in this picture, they make gentle the life of the world. All of  us are born with that mission, but we don't always fulfill it. Children  like Lucas and parents like the Warrens don't just carry their share of  that burden. They carry some of ours too. We owe them more than we can  possibly know.   ``I am a child of God,'' begins a children's song of my faith.       And He has sent me here,      Has given me an earthly home      With parents kind and dear.      I am a child of God,      And so my needs are great.    Those lyrics take on a particularly special poignancy when you know  families with special needs children, for children with special needs  not only deserve special love; they give it. They give it unceasingly  and unreservedly, just like the God who first knitted them together in  their mother's wombs.   We should all commend the Gerber baby food company for its choice of  its new spokesbaby and especially thank the Warrens for the gift of  little Lucas.   In Washington, we are often reminded of the old maxim that there are  no solutions in this life, only tradeoffs. Sometimes, it is tempting to  believe that this is true, but this photograph proves otherwise. In  this fallen world of ours, that smile--that little boy--is pure good, a  blessing to us all.   Yesterday, after the announcement, Lucas' mom Cortney said:         He may have Down syndrome, but he's always Lucas first. . .       . we're hoping when he grows up and looks back on this, he'll       be proud of himself and not ashamed of his disability.    So should we all hope for Lucas and for the rest of the world too.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, we find ourselves in another position like  those we have found ourselves in before. We find ourselves in a  position in which the government's spending authority is set to expire  in just a few hours. We have known this was coming for weeks, just as  we did with the last continuing resolution and the one before that and  the one before that. As Jacques Cousteau once observed: ``We are living  in an interminable succession of absurdities imposed by the myopic  logic of short-term thinking.''   Every time, we approach this as if it were somehow going to be  different this time. We quibble from time to time about this or that  policy. We quibble from time to time about the price tag. Sometimes we  are so focused on the policy and the price tag that we forget about the  process. It is primarily to this subject, the process, that I would  like to turn my attention for the next few minutes.   You see, the process is important around here. We come from different  backgrounds. We come from different States. We represent diverse  interests across this great country. We are not going to agree on  everything. In fact, there are a lot of things on which we strongly  disagree. That is why we have processes.   The Constitution is, itself, all about the process. In fact, the  Constitution is more or less agnostic as to the substantive policy  outcome. It is all about connecting the American people to their  government, which is there to serve them. It is all about making sure  that there is responsiveness and accountability from the government to  the people, making sure that the government serves the people and not  the other way around.   It is for this reason--and it is very important--that each Member who  holds an election certificate in this body or in the body just down the  hall from us in the House of Representatives is allowed to express his  or her opinions and have them matter. Nowhere is this more important  than when it comes to spending bills.   You see, it is in spending bills that we have the opportunity to  exercise oversight over the Federal Government--a government that  requires the American people to spend many months out of every year  working just to pay their tax bills, a Federal Government that imposes  $2 trillion every single year in regulatory compliance costs on the  American people, a government that has the power to destroy a business  or a livelihood or, in some cases, lives.   It is important that we exercise this oversight, and without spending  constraints, there can be no meaningful oversight. Without an adequate  process, the Republican form of government cannot fulfill its role. The  American people are no longer in charge of their government when this  happens.   For this reason, it is a little disturbing that a government that  spends nearly $4 trillion every single year makes its spending  decisions in one fell swoop as it does. You see, whenever we pass a  continuing resolution, what we are doing as a Congress is effectively  pressing a reset button. It keeps current spending levels intact, in  place,  [[Page S837]]  unchanged, as if there were no reviewing body, as if there had been no  election, as if the American people didn't matter at all to the process  by which they are governed. This is an abdication of our role as the  people's elected representatives. It disconnects the American people,  and we wonder--we wonder why it is that this is an institution,  Congress, that enjoys an approval rating somewhere between 9 and 14  percent, making us slightly less popular than Fidel and Raul Castro in  America and only slightly more popular than the influenza virus, which  is rapidly gaining on us. It is for this reason--because we have  disconnected the American people from their own government, and one of  the ways we do that is when we pass a continuing resolution to keep the  government funded at current levels without any additional changes.  When these things are offered, it is often within just hours of the  expiration of a spending deadline.   We have a bill before us that is quite lengthy and that we have had  access to for only about 24 hours--a little bit less than that--and we  are asked to make a binary choice as to that legislation, yes or no.  Vote for it and, in this case, there are some things that you get. You  get $90 billion in emergency spending. You get an increase of spending  caps of about $300 billion over 2 years. You get in excess of $1  trillion in new debt. Some have estimated it could be more like $1.5  trillion, but we will be talking about a $22 trillion debt by the  second quarter of 2019 as a result of this bill.   When we received this bill, we were told: You have two options. You  can vote yes and accept all of those things or you can vote no, and  there is no opportunity for anything in between there--no opportunity  to amend it, no opportunity to improve it. If you think about it, there  is really not a meaningful opportunity for debate if you don't have a  meaningful opportunity to amend a legislative provision once it is  introduced.   Members are told over and over and over again: You are either going  to vote for this and accept the government as is, with no changes or  with changes that you might find incredibly disturbing, or you will be  blamed for a shutdown. Why is this OK?   One of the things that we hear from the American people, quite  understandably, quite justifiably, is why can't you all just get into a  room and come to an agreement? Well, this is that room. There are two  such rooms here in the Capitol. One is in the Senate, and one is in the  House of Representatives. This is the room where that is supposed to  take place. There are mechanisms by which that is supposed to occur.  Through the amendment process, people offer up legislation, and they  offer to improve legislation. If they have concerns with it, they can  offer up amendments. When Members are denied that opportunity, the  American people are disconnected yet again from that process.    Who benefits from this? Well, it certainly isn't the American people,  who find that their government gets bigger and more expensive. It does  so at their expense, at the expense of the American people. Every time  we undertake this process again--we pass another continuing  resolution--we suggest that it is somehow OK to fund the government  this way, with one decision affecting every aspect of government, in  one vote put forward under sort of extortive circumstances in which  Members are told: You have to do this, or the government is going to  shut down, and you will be blamed for that if you vote against it.   This isn't right. Why couldn't we bring legislation to the floor not  hours but weeks or even months before the deadline? Why couldn't we  allow that to occur, to allow the debate, the discussion to occur under  the light of day rather than having this legislation negotiated under  cover of darkness, behind closed doors, where the American people are  left out.   I have thought about this on many occasions, and there are very few  circumstances in our day-to-day lives that are like the way Congress  spends money.   It has occurred to me that it is as if you moved into a new area, a  very remote area, and you had access to only one grocery store for  many, many miles, many, many hours away. You were on your way home from  work and your spouse called you and said to stop at the store and pick  up bread, milk, and eggs.   You go to the store and get your grocery cart. You go to the bread  aisle and put a loaf of bread, a carton of milk, and a dozen eggs in  your cart. You get to the checkout counter, and you put out your bread,  milk, and eggs. The cashier rings those things up and says: I am sorry,  you may not purchase bread, milk, and eggs unless you also purchase  half a ton of iron ore, a bucket of nails, a book about cowboy poetry,  and a Barry Manilow album. In fact, this is a special kind of store  where you have to buy all of those things. In fact, you have to buy one  of every item in this entire store in order to buy any of these things,  including the bread, the milk, and the eggs.   That would start to approximate what it feels like to spend money in  Congress, where we are told: You can't fund any part of government  unless you are willing to fund all of government, subject to such  changes as the few people who write the continuing resolution might  insert. And you, by the way, having been duly elected by the citizens  of your State, will be left out of the process other than to exercise  the binary choice of yes or no.   So we have seen that this is how we get to be $20 trillion in debt,  soon to be $22 trillion in debt. We don't get to be $21 trillion, soon  to be $22 trillion in debt without a whole lot of agreement on the part  of a whole lot of people to do that. It is a bipartisan exercise, to be  sure. Bipartisanship is necessary, but the fact that it is bipartisan  doesn't always make it holy.   You don't get to be $20 trillion in debt without a whole lot of  Republicans agreeing with a whole lot of Democrats that we are going to  do precisely that. It might inure to the benefit of a few people who  stand to benefit every time the government gets bigger or more  expensive, every time we do things this way, but it hurts everyone  else.   So process matters. The fact is, we will not always come to an  agreement as to how much we ought to spend. We will not always come to  an agreement as to those things on which we will be spending, the  requisite amount of money. But I think we should be able to agree that  the American people deserve a process, one that allows them to be heard  through the people's own elected representatives. If not us, who? If  not now, when? At what point are we going to start appropriating funds  through this government, through a process that is open, that is  transparent, that can be observed by the American people and through  which the American people can be heard?   At the end of the day, we must remember that we are great as a  country not because of who we are but because of what we do. To the  extent that we have recognized as a nation that the dignity of the  human soul matters, that the rights of the individual have to be taken  into account, and that the government works for the people, we have  prospered and will prosper in the future. But we have to be willing to  respect the American people, and we should not be surprised--when we  ignore them over and over again and when we shut them out of a process  that directly and materially impacts their lives, we should not be  shocked when they respond with horror. We shouldn't be surprised when  wave election after wave election signals dissatisfaction with this  very body, with this very entity that serves as the legislative branch  of our Federal Government.   Each time we are presented with one of these continuing resolutions  or with a one-size-fits-all spending package where we are told that we  have to either vote for it, all of it, with no opportunity to improve  it, or we have to vote against it, I have concerns with that.   I have significant concerns with this particular legislation, and I  will vote no.   Thank you, Mr. President.    Mr. President, I appreciate the keen insights of my friend  and distinguished colleague, the Senator from Maine.   I would point out here that there was a process on the tax bill. It  may not have been perfect--in fact, it wasn't--but there was a process.  We had amendments. We were allowed to offer them, to have them  considered. We did, in fact, take votes. There is no process on this.   I have been told by some of the Members of this body--some from my  party, some from the other party--that there is a process because  members of the Appropriations Committee have had input on this. That  isn't a process that belongs to the Senate; that is for one committee.  It is not a substitute for floor consideration.   There is a provision in the U.S. Constitution that makes certain  kinds of amendments to the Constitution patently unconstitutional. That  provision says that you can't do anything to alter the equal  representation of the States within the U.S. Senate. Consistent with  the spirit of that provision, we have to make sure we don't make  changes to Senate procedure in a way that creates a super class of  Senators. We don't want to get to a point, to paraphrase George Orwell,  where we say all Senators are equal but some are more equal than  others.   The process within the Appropriations Committee is not Senate  process.   We did, in fact, have a process on the tax bill. It was not perfect,  but it was a process. Here, there isn't a process. Here, there is not  an opportunity for amendments. There is not an opportunity for a single  amendment. That is a material distinction, and it is one worth noting  here.   It is also worth noting here that we have done this over and over and  over again. What is this--the fifth continuing resolution of this  fiscal year alone? This is happening over and over and over again, so  much so that many Members of this body have never seen it operate any  differently. That is a sad state of affairs and one that ought to be  troubling to Members of both political parties and to Members of this  body from every part of this great country.   Thank you, Mr. President.                            ____________________
