 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the Health and  Human Services' new Conscience and Religious Freedom Division within  the Office of Civil Rights.   Recently, they announced a proposed rule to protect workers in HHS- funded programs from being coerced into practicing activities that  violate their conscience, including abortion, sterilization, assisted  suicide, and more.   Under the previous administration, doctors and nurses were not  protected from being forced to participate in procedures that may  violate their religious beliefs or moral convictions. This is clearly  wrong. Those who are discriminated against for their religious beliefs  should be afforded the same protections as those facing any other types  of discrimination.   OCR has now opened a 60-day public comment period on the rule. I  encourage everyone across the country to participate in that comment  period.   I thank the Division once again for taking this important action to  protect religious liberty in our healthcare system.                            ____________________
