 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 965. Today,  there are more than 1.45 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than  86,000 related deaths in the United States, and these numbers continue  to increase.   Our job in Congress is to provide help and leadership in this crisis.  It is critical that we continue serving our constituents. But requiring  Members of Congress to travel back and forth to Washington to vote and  participate in official business in person during this pandemic puts  the health of our constituents and ourselves at greater risk.   All this traveling by so many Members of Congress will worsen the  crisis we are working to mitigate. If you don't agree with the rule  changes, I urge you to reconsider. If you care about the health of your  constituents, if you care about the health of yourself, your  colleagues, and your staff, and if you really want to mitigate this  crisis, then support the temporary rule and vote ``yes'' on H. Res.  965.
