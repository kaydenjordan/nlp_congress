 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill, and I  yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is the second time the House will vote on the  provisions in this bill, and the Chair just laid that out. Every single  one of these provisions was included in the so-called HEROES Act, a  partisan attempt that we debated last month.   Well, just like that $3 trillion grab bag, this bill will have no  chance in the Senate. It will not be signed by the President. At the  conclusion of this debate, we will be right back where we started.   I say to my colleagues, why not try something new, try  bipartisanship. It worked in the CARES Act and the other four COVID-19  response bills that we had, and I tell you it could work here, as well.   But rather than work across the aisle, the Democratic leadership,  gave us no advance warning this bill would be debated on the House  floor, and rather than work across the aisle, my colleagues jammed  through the bill the day the Rules Committee held a meeting on five  other bills.   Moreover, the Rules Committee reported out a closed rule on this  bill. Now, let's explain that to America what a closed bill or closed  rule means. There are three types of rules:   An ``open'' rule, meaning you can add any amendment that you want.   A ``structured'' rule, which says, you know what, we are going to  narrow those amendments to those areas that we think are most pertinent  to the bill.   And then a ``closed'' rule, which says you get nothing. You don't  have any say in trying to change this or improve this bill. It doesn't  matter. We don't want to hear from the minority. We don't even want to  hear from our own Members what ideas they might have.   So, notwithstanding there have been numerous concerns raised about  this bill, there will be no opportunity to amend it. There will be no  opportunity to strengthen it or to improve what is already, in my  opinion, a bad bill.   This outcome will only stifle debate. This outcome will only hurt the  bill's chances for any type of actual success. But clearly that is not  the goal here. It is an attempt to find another wedge issue to divide  us.   Nevertheless, I would like to emphasize that Republicans and I are  committed to working together to support efforts that are targeted and  effective in responding to this devastating pandemic. When we work  together there is nothing that can stand in our way. The CARES Act is  proof of that, as well as all the other response bills that we had.   As I mentioned earlier, Congress acted swiftly back in March to pass  the CARES Act. The CARES Act provided robust financial support to  individuals and small businesses impacted by COVID-19. The CARES Act  also increased funding for HUD, Housing and Urban Development, and its  assisted housing programs by approximately 25 percent over its  appropriated budget.   For renters, the CARES Act provided critical protections through a  Federal moratorium on evictions for residents from Federally assisted  properties. This moratorium, which lasts through the summer, is in  addition to any State or locally enacted eviction moratoria. I know  that in Michigan, in my home State, there has been that moratoria, as  well.   For homeowners, the CARES Act created a new forbearance option for  Federally backed borrowers directly or indirectly impacted by COVID-19  financial hardship.   What does ``forbearance'' mean? Forbearance means you don't have to  pay that month; you can attach those payments at the end. You have a  time out from having to go and pay your mortgage. Borrowers can  automatically claim up to 1 year of payments protection penalty free.   This historic relief has worked. In fact, it was negotiated out in a  bipartisan manner. It has been stable and stabilized and has actually  slightly declined nationwide forbearance rates as well as rent  collections largely consistent with pre-COVID trends. This is proof  that the CARES Act--a bipartisan bill that I think had four or maybe  six total votes against it, some  [[Page H2655]]  from both parties--works. This is proof that bipartisanship and  consensus approach has been the right one in the past, and it ought to  be the right one now.    Of course, we should never accept good enough. As an answer it comes  to providing housing and economic security for our Nation's most  vulnerable families. However, the bill today that we are considering,  like the bill that we considered last month, goes in the opposite  direction. Instead of following the CARES Act model to focus on those  hit hardest by the pandemic, this bill simply plays politics. This bill  dusts off an old Democratic grab bag wish list of policy goals  predating and unrelated to COVID-19 under the guise of relief, all of  which are nonstarters in the Senate, let's be clear.   If we really want to start a real conversation about affordable  housing in this country, let's start with the facts. The fact is that  far too many large, high-cost metropolitan areas' local decisions and  regulations have made the cost of housing in those areas too high for  many hardworking families. We should not be rewarding these high-cost  cities for decades of self-made mistakes with more taxpayer dollars. We  should be looking at ways to support families, not cities and  municipalities and housing authorities, but families to meet those  challenges that this pandemic has forced upon them.   Republicans have and will continue to support targeted and efficient  aid that goes to those who are most in need. We support solutions for  those that have been impacted by the pandemic that are, one,  administered efficiently. That is a key. For you as a taxpayer I would  assume you would want to have that.   Two, targeted to those who need it most. That is the safety net we  are trying to provide.   And, three, include much-needed oversight.                                time  1430    This bill fails those tests.   Let me give you one example of why this bill fails all parts of that  test. Section 101 of the bill creates a new $100 billion--that is with  a B--``emergency rental assistance'' grant program for individuals or  families ``at risk of homelessness,'' a policy both sides certainly do  and can support.   But the bill takes the policy to the next level, making funding  available to individuals making up to 120 percent not of the poverty  level but of their area median income.   So, what does that mean? That means that an individual living in San  Francisco making $131,000 would qualify for a homelessness grant.   Now, I am just a simple guy from the Midwest in Michigan, but making  $131,000 a year qualifies you for a homelessness grant? Oh, by the way,  what does that get you? $6,012 per month in rental assistance. $6,000 a  month in rental assistance.   This is not help; it is scandalous. And I don't understand how any of  my colleagues could defend that.   Well, additionally, this bill spends more than $119 billion--again,  with a B--in new funding for HUD programs, new funding, yet the bill  fails to include a single meaningful permanent reform to any of the HUD  programs. Moreover, the bill fails to provide any oversight for that  new funding.   To that end, figuring out how HUD will spend a 240 percent increase  in its budget is a critical element to ensuring that any new funding is  helping real families who are in need, who are struggling and not  getting just lost in some bureaucratic shuffle in Washington, D.C., or  at some metropolis's housing authority.   In fact, Chairwoman Waters said it best when talking about the CARES  Act: ``Since taxpayers are footing the bill, all Americans deserve to  examine any and all information related to the administration,  disbursement, and utilization of these funds.''   Boy, I wish I had the ability to put in an amendment to do just that,  but we don't have that opportunity today. So, I agree. I agree with her  on that, and we need to have that transparency.   That is why Republicans stand ready to work together to find  consensus on meaningful reforms and ways to help those households deal  with the challenges of this awful pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to take a look at this. We know it  is a recycled partisan bill. We know that it is not going to go  anywhere in the Senate. We know that it is not going to be signed into  law. Let's have a real conversation about the issues, not just pick  another political football.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Steil), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. John W. Rose), a distinguished member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, there was not a granting on the front end  of that. Will that time be counted against the majority's time?    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that.   I just wanted to clarify and make sure that we are all on the same  page.   And I might add that I deeply respect my colleague and friend from  Georgia, and we have worked on some issues.   I will note that HUD has not been able to get the money out the door  to those families that need the help with what they have already been  given, and yet we are trying to put more into that pipeline.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire of the remaining time on  both sides.    Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, may I also inquire as to how much time was  taken off of the last--for the previous speaker?    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I do have an inquiry of the majority as to  how many more speakers she may have.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to the time remaining on both sides.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let's not be Pollyannaish. The facts are facts. Yes, our  economy, for the first time in ever--certainly, in the modern era--came  to a screeching halt, not because of bad business decisions, not  because of malicious or malfeasance or illegal activities, much like we  saw in the 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 financial crisis that started in  housing.   We don't know exactly where our recovery is going to go. We have  gotten some good signs. But, again, we cannot be overly optimistic  without being prepared. But facts are facts, and here is one fact: In  April, we saw historic declines in new home purchases. I shouldn't say  ``new homes.'' These were contracts to purchase homes.   In May, we saw a historic rebound of 44.3 percent. Why did that  happen? Because in April, both buyers and sellers were sidelined by  this pandemic. Why did we see this rebound in May? Because the American  people have optimism, as well. That and basically zero interest rates  from the Fed probably helped, too.   But that is the point. We have been coming together to try to turn  this economy around.   Well, in this bill today, we are told that we can't wait. This bill  can't wait. Yet, what you need to know is, this bill is not ready. And  I will give you a perfect example of this.   Page 71, section 105 of the bill that was debated in the Rules  Committee that had been part of the original HEROES Act, the so-called  HEROES Act, from a month ago, was part of my colleague from Iowa Mrs.  Axne's standalone bill. It actually referenced a rural housing program  as having $25 trillion, not $25 million as it had been intended, but  $25 trillion in that.   Clearly, this bill has been a cut-and-paste job all the way along. It  was rushed when it was the HEROES Act, the so-called HEROES Act,  because that was part of the grab bag that was out there. It was rushed  when my colleague, Mrs. Axne, introduced it. It was rushed now in this  bill.   So, it does beg the question: What else got missed, Mr. Speaker?   Well, here is what else: We are told that the money has run out. We  have run out of the money that we have appropriated. What you need to  know is that all the billions of dollars that were allocated have not  yet been spent.   But, wait, we are told that this was spent already, and it isn't  enough. Well, what you need to know is that they want to create new  programs to spend hundreds of billions of dollars with zero new reforms  or oversight put into this bill. None. That is not responsible.   While you were told that this bill is only going to go to the needy,  the poor, the disenfranchised--after all, this is a homelessness  program--what you need to know is they are going to send $6,000 per  month--$6,000 per month--to someone making $131,000 in the Speaker's  district--$131,000.   That person qualifies for a homelessness program? I can tell you, not  in  [[Page H2660]]  west Michigan. I can tell you, not virtually anywhere else in the  country.   I don't understand how my colleagues, with a straight face, can say  that this is all about homelessness and all about helping those who  have been disadvantaged and have not had a break in life. Well,  $131,000 a year is a pretty darn good break in life, I think.   Mr. Speaker, I wish I had an opportunity to amend this bill. I would  have some amendments. I wish we were doing a modified rule. It would  even allow some of those amendments. Yet, here we are today, no input  from anybody other than what the Speaker's office and the chair's  office had said is going to be in this bill.   We are plowing ahead with a bill that we know will not see the light  of day when it hits the Senate.   By the way, I am a little confused when the chair early on admonished  me and said I should go and negotiate with the Senate about the bill  that had been passed previously.   So, I say this a little tongue in cheek, but anybody who has watched  ``Schoolhouse Rock!'' knows the House passes their legislation; the  Senate passes their legislation; and then it comes together, if we are  going to negotiate it out, not in the middle of this process.   Why not negotiate and amend the bill that is before us today, where  it properly should be happening?   Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, this is a serious, serious issue  for our country. I know this. My family has been in construction and in  housing for now three--going on a fourth--generations. We have seen it.  We have seen the ups and downs. My grandfather, my namesake, started in  the Depression era. My dad continued it through the 1970s, through the  1980s, into the 1990s. Then, I started getting involved. I have lived  through a couple of economic downturns myself, trying to keep a family  company afloat, trying to provide housing and jobs.   Mr. Speaker, here is what we need to do, in my opinion. We need to  negotiate in good faith. This bill is not an attempt to do that today.  I am disappointed in that. I wish we could, but I think, once again, we  are seeing politics triumphing over people. We are seeing political  footballs take the place of real policy issues.   When your objective is nothing but November, guess what? The American  people lose. That is the shame in today's debate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.'' I know that there  are some people on the other side of the aisle who are a little  uncomfortable with this bill but don't feel they can vote ``no.'' I  wish they had the courage of their convictions. Today, I will be voting  ``no'' and encourage my colleagues as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    I am currently opposed to the bill.    Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit would remedy some  of the shortfalls in H.R. 7301 and would add some bipartisanship to  this legislation. This motion only strengthens this legislation and  increases the chance of this bill making it through the Senate and  being signed into law.   This amendment would simply add four provisions to the bill, each of  which would reduce bureaucracy and increase oversight of these funds so  that they reach the people who need them swiftly.   First, this amendment would harmonize the definitions of homelessness  between HUD and the Department of Education. For too long, HUD has  failed to think of the children who lack a permanent and stable home,  shifting funding away from this vulnerable population, who, as the  Department of Education acknowledges, is, in practice and in fact,  homeless. Our amendment permanently ends that disparate treatment of  the kids and makes them fully eligible for the substantial increase in  funding at HUD under this bill.   Second, the amendment would include the bipartisan Yes in My Backyard  Act, H.R. 4351, which passed the House by voice vote earlier this year.  This provision would strengthen the oversight in this legislation and  compel high-cost localities to consider the local regulations that have  been put in place that increase housing costs and put increased rent  and homeownership barriers on American families. Getting rid of these  barriers would help cities all over America build more housing and  lower costs for everyone.   Third, this amendment would get rid of the bureaucratic red tape  currently in the bill that prevents some of our most accomplished and  successful housing and addiction treatment service providers from being  eligible to receive funds. Why the majority would want to disqualify  shelters and other housing service providers that make it their mission  to treat individuals who are struggling with alcoholism or drug  addiction makes no sense at all to me.   Finally, this amendment would ensure that these funds would be  directed to where they are needed: to the Nation's taxpayers and their  dependents who are struggling right now. Basic common sense says that  we should not be spending money on those who are unlawfully present in  the United States at a time when millions of Americans and legal  residents are out of work, overmatched with their bills, and fighting  to do more with less.   Combined, these provisions would help make a bad bill better and give  greater accountability and focus to the nearly $200 billion in new,  unpaid-for, untargeted, unaccounted-for spending in this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to recommit,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
