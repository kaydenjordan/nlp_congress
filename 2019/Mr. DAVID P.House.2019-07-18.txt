 ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage  my colleagues to vote against H.R. 582, the so-called Raise the Wage  Act, which is nothing more than another baseless, irrational attack on  President Trump's successful economic record.   Just this week, House Democrats voted to condemn the President, hold  his advisers in contempt, and many House Democrats voted to impeach the  President. Today, they are working to undo the economic gains seen  under the Trump administration's leadership and undermine the best  economy in my lifetime.   This legislation will arbitrarily double the Federal minimum wage to  $15 an hour, despite plenty of evidence that employers are fairly  compensating employees. This bill will hurt the very low-income people  House Democrats claim they want to help by reducing employment  opportunity and hours.   In fact, the CBO estimated that this legislation will cost the  American economy up to 3.7 million jobs and reduce real wages by $9.5  billion.   I offered a bipartisan amendment to prevent this bill from taking  effect unless the GAO could show this legislation would eliminate fewer  than 200,000 jobs in rural America, where I live, but House Democrats  wouldn't even allow a debate.   Just in Tennessee, this bill is predicted to eliminate more than  66,000 jobs, roughly the size of my hometown, which is the largest city  in my district.   In 2016, Seattle's minimum wage increased to $13 an hour, $2 shy of  what the House Democrats are proposing today, and it has already  reduced hours for low-income jobs. If legislation like this is hurting  large areas like Seattle, it will have even a worse impact on rural  America.   I think my colleague across the aisle said the States had raised  this. I think that is a perfect thing, the States ought to. They know  their local economies better than we do here in Washington.   I urge my Democratic colleagues to work with Republicans to implement  policies to give every American the tools to seek higher-paying jobs  and, once again, encourage my colleagues to vote against H.R. 582.
