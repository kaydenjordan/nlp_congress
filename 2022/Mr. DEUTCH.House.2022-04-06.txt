 Mr. Speaker, a recently released Violence Project study  has found that more than half of all mass shootings between 1966 and  2019 occurred since 2000. There have been more and more shootings. It  is getting worse and worse. Mass shootings have occurred in the  workplace, on college campuses, in our houses of worship, and in our  schools. We must do better.   These shootings cut off young lives and devastate families. We owe it  to the victims to do more to combat gun violence in our communities. We  owe it to Joaquin Oliver.   Joaquin was 17 years old when he was shot and killed with an assault  rifle at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.  This is Joaquin.   But this symbol of Joaquin is also an assault rifle. You see, this is  an assault rifle that was purchased by Joaquin's dad, Manny, without a  background check.   Manny went to a gun show in Florida and bought a high-powered rifle  without a background check. Then he went home, and he melted it down to  make this statue of his son, who was killed by a similar weapon in his  school on Valentine's Day.   This statue of Joaquin is now a powerful reminder of our weak gun  laws and the countless American lives that have been stolen, families  broken by gun violence.   When Manny went to a gun show, the seller pushed him to buy the  rifle, to buy ammunition, to buy a high-capacity magazine, all at one  time, without a background check. And Manny wondered, what's the rush?   What is the rush? Why does anyone need a deadly arsenal in one  afternoon, with no questions asked?   We have put a lot of effort into making background checks work well  for legal gun buyers. The National Instant Criminal Background System,  the NICS system, returns results in as fast as 30 seconds.   Every gun buyer at a gun show, every gun buyer online, every gun  buyer at a licensed dealer, every gun buyer should  [[Page H4200]]  go through that system to keep our communities safe. But they don't  because of a dangerous loophole like the one that allowed Manny to buy  an AR-15 at a gun show without a background check.                                time  1100    The background check system is the foundation of gun safety in  America. When that foundation is weak, like it is today, it makes all  of us less safe.   We need universal background checks. States with laws requiring  background checks on all sales have lower gun homicide rates than  States that don't. Guns from States that lack background check laws  often end up recovered from crime scenes in neighboring States without  those tough laws.   That is why we need a uniform national requirement to end weak gun  laws that contribute to trafficking.   The President visited New York City recently after two police  officers were fatally shot, and he urged the need for universal  background checks. He rightly said our country needs a comprehensive  strategy to dramatically reduce gun violence. The Attorney General of  the United States has directed U.S. attorneys to confront gun  trafficking across State lines and in cities.   I strongly support the President's call for a comprehensive strategy.  As part of that strategy, Congress should do what many States are  currently working on to ban untraceable ghost guns, similar to the law  that was signed in New York in October of last year. Congress can do  this.   Congress should also pass safe storage legislation to protect kids  from being harmed by loaded weapons kept unsafely in their homes. We  should ban weapons of war that don't belong in our community and are  regularly used to hunt innocent people. Who needs to be able to fire  off 50 or 100 rounds at a time?   Congress should recognize that high-capacity magazines have no place  in our communities and that their only purpose is to make it easy to  cause mass casualties.   These proposals have significant support. Ninety percent of  Americans, including gun owners, want universal and stronger background  checks.   Would a stronger background check system prevent every instance of  gun violence? No, of course not. Would ending large-capacity ammunition  magazines prevent mass casualties caused by guns? No, but they will  make us safer. They will make our communities safer. They will make our  schools safer. They will make the workplace safer. They will make  people feel safer as they attend religious services. They will make it  easier for law enforcement to do their jobs safely every day.   Continued inaction on confronting gun violence will only lead to more  innocent people dying from firearms. Congress must take action to get  strong gun violence prevention legislation for Joaquin and the 16  others who were taken at Stoneman Douglas, for their families, and for  America.                            ____________________
