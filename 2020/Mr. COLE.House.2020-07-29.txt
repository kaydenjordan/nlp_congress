 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the gentleman from  Massachusetts, the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee, for  yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and, Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today's debate is on a rule providing for consideration  of H.R. 7617, which contains 6 of the 12 annual appropriations bills  recently reported by the House Appropriations Committee. These six  bills include the two largest, Defense, and Labor, Health and Human  Services, Education, as well as the titles covering Commerce, Justice,  Science, Energy and Water Development, Financial Services and General  Government, and finally, Transportation, Housing, and Urban  Development.   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Appropriations Committee, it is  always encouraging to see the appropriations process moving forward.  Passing these 12 bills is one of the biggest responsibilities we have  as Members of Congress; to fund the government and keep it open and  operating for our constituents.   Despite that great responsibility, I am disappointed by the partisan  approach taken by the majority in crafting the bills in this package,  and I cannot support them at this time.   I single out the majority in my comments because the 12 bills that  were reported out of committee this year were all written to satisfy  the concerns and wishes of one party, the Democratic party. While that  is often how the appropriations process begins, it is ultimately never  where it ends. At the end of the day, for us to pass 12 full-year  fiscal year 2021 appropriations bills, in an era of divided government,  it will require Members on both sides of the aisle and in both Chambers  of Congress to reach consensus. That ultimately means that the partisan  bills like those we are considering today are nonstarters and cannot  become law.   During markup on these measures in the Appropriations Committee and  again yesterday in the Rules Committee, Republicans rightfully raised  several reasons why these bills cannot become law and should not pass  the House. Those objections were ignored. Consequently, today's bill  will have very little, if any, Republican support. That means these  bills are effectively dead on arrival in the United States Senate and  would never be signed by a Republican President, and there are a lot of  reasons for that.   First, all 12 appropriations bills are marked at 302(b) allocation  numbers that violate the fiscal year 2021 total spending limit  negotiated in the current budget agreement just last year.                                time  1030    Indeed, I remind my friends, Congress is lawfully bound to uphold  that agreement.   Instead of abiding by the negotiated numbers that were agreed to in  both Houses of Congress by both parties and by the President, the  majority has used a huge amount of emergency-designated funds as a  workaround scheme to break that good faith budget agreement.   In this bill alone, there is well over $200 billion in so-called  emergency spending. That violates the budget agreement. This will make  it much more difficult to negotiate final bills with the Senate that  can actually become law.   But what is more disappointing than the widespread use of budget  gimmicks is the prolific use of partisan policy riders throughout the  appropriations bills, including these six. These riders are simply  unacceptable, and they must come out before bipartisan agreement can be  reached.   Consider the bill that I am most familiar with, which came out of the  Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee, where I am the ranking member. The text of that bill  includes a wide variety of harmful riders.   In the first instance, the bill includes partisan policy  prescriptions that will tie the hands of the administration with  respect to Title X family planning. Most notably, the riders would  force the administration to resume grants awarded to controversial  groups that provide abortions, such as Planned Parenthood, and it would  prevent the administration from granting waivers that protect deeply  held religious beliefs of institutions, organizations, and individuals  that provide vital services funded in the bill.   The Labor, Health and Human Services title includes riders that would  undo the Department of Labor's rule clarifying the so-called joint  employer standard. If this policy rider were enacted, it would cause  chaos for thousands of businesses and millions of employees, leaving  them uncertain about the nature of their employment relationship.   Not to be outdone, the bill also includes riders micromanaging and  second-guessing how Health and Human Services administers the  Unaccompanied Alien Children Program, which will ensure that the  individuals devoting their energies to assisting such unaccompanied  minors will find themselves devoting their energy, becoming wrapped up  in evermore deeply and congressionally mandated red tape.   The same can be said for the other divisions in this package.  Throughout this minibus, the majority has inserted policy riders that  tie the hands of the administration.   They have limited the ability of the administration to reprogram  funds even when necessary. They have inserted rider after rider aimed  at preventing the President from spending money on barriers and  security measures at the southern border. And they have removed  countless bipartisan policy revisions that have been routinely carried  in previous years' bills.   Let me say it again: Partisan riders like these must come out before  a bipartisan agreement can be reached.   On top of this, while I understand we are living through  unprecedented times and have had to rightly limit our physical  interactions, I have serious concerns about considering these bills in  a six-division, trillion-dollar spending bill.   Debating these measures together as one shuts out the ability of most  rank-and-file Members to have their ideas heard on the floor, or limits  them to having their amendments included in massive all-or-nothing en  bloc packages, and places many Members in an untenable all-or-nothing  vote on both the en bloc packages and ultimately final passage of the  bill.   We can do better than that, Mr. Speaker, and we must do better than  that.   Mr. Speaker, I am still hopeful that we can reach a bipartisan  appropriations deal for the full year. If we can get the prolific  emergency spending and budget gimmicks out of these bills, and if we  can eliminate all partisan policy riders, then I think the majority in  the House will have a workable starting point to begin negotiations  with the Senate toward a bipartisan deal.   Under such circumstances, they would still not be the bills I would  have written, but they would be a reasonable basis on which to begin  negotiations. But until then, these bills are going absolutely nowhere.  They will not pass the Senate, and they will not be signed by the  President into law.  [[Page H3893]]    Frankly, I do not believe they should be passed by this House,  either.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule and the underlying  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  respond quickly to my friend.   While we appreciate the number of amendments made in order, let's  just look at the statistics. Twenty percent of all the amendments in  this bill are Republican, 60 percent are Democrat, 20 percent are  bipartisan.   Frankly, I am pleased to have hit 20 percent, because for the year,  we are down at about 17 percent of the amendments.   So while we appreciate the difficult conditions, I also remind my  friend that in the last Congress, when we held the majority, they  actually always had more amendments than the Republicans did. So let's  not get carried away with the difficulties of the situation or the  fairness of the process.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), my good friend, a distinguished Member,  and an outstanding member of the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to immediately bring up S. 939, the CONFUCIUS  Act, which passed the Senate by unanimous consent a month and a half  ago.   If enacted into law, S. 939 will address China's influence on  American  [[Page H3895]]  colleges and universities through Confucius Institutes, which are  cultural institutes directly or indirectly funded by the Chinese  Government.   Specifically, colleges and universities receiving Federal funds will  be required to certify that the institution ensures that any contract  or agreement between the institution and a Confucius Institute includes  clear provisions that protect academic freedom at the institution,  prohibits the application of any foreign law, and ensures the  institution retains full managerial authority over the Confucius  Institute.   Mr. Speaker, in recent years, Confucius Institutes have become  commonplace among higher-education campuses. While ostensibly high- minded, these organizations are funded by the Government of the  People's Republic of China and focus on a Beijing-approved view of  Chinese history. They are noted for presenting Chinese Communist Party  propaganda, ignoring human rights abuses in Tibet and among the  Uighurs, and insisting that Taiwan belongs to mainland China.   What is worse, Chinese influence on American campuses comes at a time  in which China is engaged in ongoing efforts to steal American  intellectual property and research, particularly in research  institutions like those located on our higher education campuses.   It is inarguable that Chinese espionage efforts like these pose a  clear threat to national security. Passage of the CONFUCIUS Act would  help close an open loophole on our college campuses currently being  exploited by the People's Republic of China.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to respond quickly to the overall thrust of  what is in these bills. There is no question, as my friend from Florida  said, there are a lot of good things in these bills.   My friend from Florida is actually a distinguished member of the  Appropriations Committee, one whom I have had the opportunity to work  with on many occasions. We don't object to those. But what is  undeniable is there is roughly $40 billion more in spending than my  friends agreed to only last year. Now, that is a budget cap imposed by  law.  [[Page H3896]]    Occasionally, Mr. Speaker, you have reason to do emergencies. We are  living through an emergency right now. But if you need emergency  spending, you negotiate that with the other side. There was no  negotiation here with Republicans in the House. You certainly negotiate  with the other Chamber, Mr. Speaker, particularly when it is controlled  by the other party. There was no negotiation with the other Chamber.  And you certainly negotiate with the President of the United States--no  negotiation with him either. It is just a number made up out of whole  cloth to keep my friends from having to make some tough budgetary  decisions that they agreed to make and passed into law only last year.   The second thing, as I mentioned, is these bills are chock-full of  partisan riders. That is just the reality. Now my friends know none of  these riders are going to remain in these bills or the bills will never  pass the United States Senate and never be signed by a Republican  President, so I suppose they were put in there for some internal  reason.   I hope they are not put in there to keep us from going past the  September 30 deadline, which all these bills should be finished by,  into later this year or, goodness knows, next year, when my friends  might think they might have a more politically favorable environment.  That is a disservice.   This Congress ought to get its job done. It can't get its job done  when one side decides to break its agreement, add almost a quarter of a  trillion dollars in new spending, and add dozens of new policy  provisions that they know are unacceptable.    We can have those debates. They are good debates to have, but they  don't belong in the middle of appropriations bills. I am not naive  enough to say that both sides don't do this. We certainly did it when  we were in the majority on some occasions. But when we did do it, it  always slowed down the process and made agreement more difficult.   Last year, 2019, the President, the Speaker, the minority leader, the  Senate majority leader, and the Senate minority leader sat down and  negotiated a deal. They said that these are going to be the spending  limits, and we are not going to put any extraneous things in these  bills.   To my friends' credit, last year they actually did that. They stayed  within the limit that we had set, and they did not put extraneous  things in the bill. Consequently, all those bills passed; they all got  enacted into law; we have had no government shutdowns; and we have had  regular order.   Why they decided this year to abandon the agreement that they  actually committed to last year and launch spending initiatives and  policy initiatives that they said they would not do is beyond me, but I  do remind them it will make it much more difficult to come to  agreement.   So, given that, and given the fact that my friends have not kept the  agreement that they agreed to last year, assented to last year, I am  going to oppose the rule and urge rejection of the underlying  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by telling my good friend that I have  many of the same concerns he does about the coronavirus crisis and the  need to act on another bill.   That is not what is before us today, but I look forward to when that  time comes and we have a negotiated product to working with my friend  and seeing if we can find the necessary support to make sure that is  enacted into law. Indeed, the Senate is involved in doing that right  now.   What is before us today is the work of the Appropriations Committee  of the House of Representatives, not coronavirus legislation per se,  although there are certainly elements in this bill that deal with that.   Let me again reiterate what I said just a few minutes ago: There are  a lot of good things in these appropriations bills. Appropriators work  hard and quite a few often work together. We have an excellent chairman  and an excellent ranking member, and so we cooperate. So there are many  good things in these bills. But what makes them fundamentally  unacceptable is, first, a decision to insert almost a quarter of a  trillion dollars of emergency spending that violates the budget  agreement that my friends signed only last year.   Mr. Speaker, if you need an emergency measure--that happens--then you  sit down and negotiate with the other side about what the amount is and  what the nature of the response is. There was no effort to negotiate  with Republicans on this emergency spending--not in the House, not with  the Republican-dominated United States Senate, and not with the  Republican President. So these are just numbers willy-nilly sort of  thrown in there, and they are not going anywhere. In that sense, we  have wasted a lot of time.   Second, my friends agreed, also, last year to no riders, no policy  provisions in the bills. We will just have straight government funding  bills. Last year, they did that. They kept that agreement last year.  They kept to the top line numbers, and they kept to their agreements in  terms of policy. We passed all 12 bills in a bipartisan manner. The  President signed them, and we have enjoyed the benefit of that this  year. We have had no government shutdown and we have had no crises. The  work was done in a timely fashion.    Why my friends abandoned a formula and an agreement that worked last  year to do this is beyond me. Frankly, it smacks a little bit of  election-year politics; but, regardless, the purpose is to fund the  government and to keep the government working for all of our citizens,  providing basic services.   These bills won't do that because they violated an agreement last  year and they contain things that my friends recognized a year ago  that, if we do that, then we are not going to get to any agreement on  spending. The same thing is true today. The political constellation  hasn't changed. It won't change for the balance of this fiscal year,  and it won't change for the balance of the calendar year.   If we were serious about legislating, we would write real bills that  adhere to the agreements that both sides make, not add additional  hundreds of billions of dollars of spending and add additional policy  provisions that we know  [[Page H3897]]  the other side will not accept. Unfortunately, that is what is being  done here.   So I regret that. I hope my friends at some point will decide to come  back and bargain. I suspect they will. They usually do. But we are  wasting precious time now. We could have completed all these bills.   Frankly, I will chastise the Senate here, too, because they are not  moving very fast on the basic necessity of these bills. They have a  tougher process. They can't just get a majority and ram things through  the way my friends have the ability to do when they are in the majority  and we have the ability to do when we are in the majority. It is a  little bit different in the Senate of the United States. I recognize  that.   But we should make a contribution. We should have stuck to our  agreement. We need emergency spending, which I think we do. That should  come outside the confines of this legislation in standalone, emergency  legislation agreed to by both sides negotiating in good faith. We have  done that four times this year already. We are pretty good at it. If we  would do it again for a fifth--and they are trying to do it now in the  Senate--then I think we could deal with those other items that are in  these bills that, quite frankly, belong in a standalone supplemental  dealing with coronavirus.   So, with that, I want to thank my friend for the time, and I want to  thank him for the debate. As always, I look forward to working with  him; but, for the moment, I urge the rejection of the rule and urge the  rejection of the underlying legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
