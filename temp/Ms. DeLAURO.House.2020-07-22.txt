 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   In October 1995, the Black clergy in my community asked if I could  get Congressman John Lewis of Georgia to come to New Haven for our  local elections. I was honored to welcome John to my hometown. Here is  what I said about him that evening.   ``John Lewis is a true hero of the cause of progress. It is often  said that John Lewis is `one of the most courageous persons the civil  rights movement ever produced.' The most astonishing thing about that  sweeping statement is that it probably doesn't go far enough to  describe the heroics of the man you see before you. John Lewis has  dedicated his life to protecting human rights, securing personal  dignity, and building what he likes to call `The Beloved Community.'  His display of ethics and morality has won him rare admiration from  both his House colleagues and from leaders around the world over.''   He thanked me for the introduction, and he said to the congregation,  ``I love my sister Rosa DeLauro.''   And I loved that our offices, when I first came to the Congress, were  next to each other.   I served with Congressman John Lewis for 30 years, and I consider  myself blessed. My grandchildren, Teo, Rigby, Sadi, and Jasper, met  John Lewis. He signed for them his book, ``March.''   John Lewis' ``March'' tells the story of a poor sharecropper's son  who transformed America and so much more. There are few in the world  who change it. John Lewis changed it.   The Black clergy in my community, my grandchildren, my family, you  can be sure we will carry on your work, John Lewis. Count on it.
