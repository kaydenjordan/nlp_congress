 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  Black History Month and to honor countless African American leaders  throughout our history who have pushed relentlessly to make our Union  one that is more just and more equitable for all people.   We recognize the incredible progress that they made possible and the  work that we still need to do to ensure that opportunity isn't  something that is determined by the color of our skin.   We honor the courageous and determined everyday men and women, like  Medgar Evers and Fannie Lou Hamer, who challenged every barrier in our  society and set a path for the activists of today, like Patricia  Nickols-Butler, the CEO of Community Action Partnership. She has  dedicated her entire life to making sure that not one single family in  San Bernardino County is left behind by providing them with the  resources they need to succeed.   We honor educators like Maxine Smith, who fought discrimination in  our classrooms to give every child an equal opportunity to learn, and  leaders in the Inland Empire like Dr. Soraya M. Coley, the president of  Cal Poly Pomona, who is committed to helping every student reach his  and her full potential; trailblazers like San Bernardino County's first  Black schoolteacher, Dorothy Inghram, who taught every child to reach  for the stars and never give up, or Dr. Eric Bishop, the vice president  of student services at Chaffey College, who has been a guiding force  for every student when the going got tough.   We honor the countless Black veterans who fought for our freedoms in  every war, from the Revolutionary War to our current conflicts in the  Middle East, and law enforcement officers who put their own lives on  the line every single day to keep our communities safe. We salute Chief  Derek Williams of the Ontario Police Department, whose commitment to  service began in the Air Force.   We honor the public servants like Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, the  first African American woman elected to Congress, who showed us what it  meant to be ``unbought and unbossed'' and made way for the historic  number of women running for office today; and Wilmer Amina Carter, the  first African American woman to represent San Bernardino County in the  California State Assembly. Throughout her time in office, she worked to  improve the lives of people in her community by passing laws to  strengthen healthcare, safety, transportation, and help create jobs.   We honor the moral leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who  made America listen--listen--to its conscience and sacrificed his life  to advance civil rights for each and every one of us.   And we honor Pastor Chuck Singleton of Loveland Church in Ontario and  Rialto, whose words provide comfort and healing here at home and abroad  through his humanitarian work.   The successes of African American leaders reach far and wide and are  deeply entrenched in each of our lives. May we all take the time to  uplift the immeasurable contributions that African American leaders  have made to our country this month and every single day of the year.  May we renew our commitment and join them to pick up the fight for  equality, opportunity, and justice for all Americans.                            ____________________
