 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I call  up House Resolution 996 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 996         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 6147) making appropriations for the Department       of the Interior, environment, and related agencies for the       fiscal year ending September 30, 2019, and for other       purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and       shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. An       amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the       text of Rules Committee Print 115-81 shall be considered as       adopted in the House and in the Committee of the Whole. The       bill, as amended, shall be considered as the original bill       for the purpose of further amendment under the five-minute       rule and shall be considered as read. Points of order against       provisions in the bill, as amended, for failure to comply       with clause 2 or clause 5(a) of rule XXI are waived except as       follows: beginning with the colon on page 251, line 5,       through ``2012'' on page 251, line 8. Where points of order       are waived against part of a paragraph, points of order       against a provision in another part of such paragraph may be       made only against such provision and not against the entire       paragraph. No further amendment to the bill, as amended,       shall be in order except those printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution and pro forma       amendments described in section 2 of this resolution. Each       further amendment printed in the report of the Committee on       Rules shall be considered only in the order printed in the       report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, may be withdrawn       by the proponent at any time before action thereon, shall not       be subject to amendment except as provided by section 2 of       this resolution, and shall not be subject to a demand for       division of the question in the House or in the Committee of       the Whole. All points of order against such further       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill, as amended, to the House with such further       amendments as may have been  [[Page H6275]]       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 2.  During consideration of H.R. 6147 for amendment,       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations or their respective designees may offer up to       10 pro forma amendments each at any point for the purpose of       debate.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my good friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and reported  a rule for consideration of H.R. 6147, the Department of Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2019, which  also includes the Financial Services and General Government  Appropriations Act of 2019.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate, equally divided and  controlled by the chair and the ranking member on the Appropriations  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, the appropriations package in front of us is the third  installment of the House's effort to pass all 12 appropriations bills  on the floor for fiscal year 2019. We have previously passed  appropriations bills covering Energy and Water, Military Construction,  Veterans Affairs, Legislative Branch, and Defense.   Today we turn to the work of the Appropriations Committee  Subcommittees on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies and  Financial Services and General Government.   Once the House finishes its work for the week, we will have passed 6  of the 12 appropriations bills across the floor.   Overall, the package covers $58.65 billion in spending. Of those  funds, $35.25 billion are allocated to the Interior bill and $23.4  billion to the Financial Services bill, which is equal to the enacted  level for fiscal year 2018 for both of these bills. The package  represents many months of work by the Appropriations Committee.   Mr. Speaker, as I have so often said when discussing appropriations  bills, today's package represents the most fundamental duty of  Congress, to fund the government and keep it open each year to continue  to provide our constituents with the services they need and deserve.  But, importantly, this package also fulfills an additional duty of  Congress to the American people: its fiscally prudent stewardship of  the taxpayers' hard-earned money and to ensure that we appropriately  prioritize where and how to spend taxpayer dollars in the most  efficient manner.   Mr. Speaker, the Interior and Environment Appropriations bill funds  critical programs at the Department of the Interior, the Environmental  Protection Agency, and other crucial areas. Among the areas of greatest  importance, the bill includes $3.9 billion for the Department of the  Interior and the U.S. Forest Service to fight wildfires. It includes  $500 million for payments in lieu of taxes to help local governments,  and it provides $2.6 billion for the Clean Water and Drinking Water  State Revolving Loan Fund.                                time  1230    It funds the National Park Service at $3.25 billion, an increase of  $53 million over fiscal year 2018. Of great import, not only to my home  State of Oklahoma but to Native Americans all across the country, the  bill honors our treaties and trust agreements by providing $5.9 billion  for the Indian Health Service and $3.1 billion for the Bureau of Indian  Affairs and Indian Education.   The bill also fulfills an additional commitment to the American  people by including provisions to rein in the runaway regulatory  agendas of parts of the Federal Government. It reduces the EPA's  regulatory programs by $228 million. It also fully repeals the  economically damaging waters of the United States rule and includes  various prohibitions preventing the EPA from overregulating  agricultural operations and exempting livestock producers from EPA  greenhouse gas requirements.   The Financial Services and General Government portion of this bill  provides $23.4 billion across several important accounts. It provides  $7.7 billion for the operation of the Federal court system. The bill  also provides funding to help combat the opioid crisis, including $415  million for the Office of National Drug Control Policy, including $280  million for high-intensity drug trafficking areas and $118 million for  other Federal drug control programs.   It encourages responsible spending at the Internal Revenue Service by  appropriating $11.6 billion for IRS activities, an increase of $186  million over fiscal year 2018, and continues stringent oversight and  protections of taxpayer dollars that have been included in recent  years.   The bill provides $1.66 billion for the Securities and Exchange  Commission and will help grow the economy by providing $737 million, or  full funding, in capital to various Small Business Administration loan  programs. Perhaps most importantly, this bill includes provisions that  will finally bring the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under  congressional oversight.   Mr. Speaker, as you are aware, when the CFPB was created in the  original Dodd-Frank Act, the new agency was allowed to operate without  congressional oversight because it did not receive appropriations.  Consequently, since its inception, unelected bureaucrats at the CFPB  have been allowed to operate entirely without congressional  supervision. Today's bill will remedy that and will ensure that the  CFPB falls under congressional authority, oversight, and supervision  once and for all.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all my colleagues to support this rule and  the underlying bill. The package before us represents a fulfillment of  our most important responsibility as Members of Congress and provides  appropriate funding in two divisions: Interior and Environment, and  Financial Services and General Government. I applaud my colleagues on  the Appropriations Committee for their months of work in making this  bill a reality and cheer their efforts on moving forward to completion  of the fiscal year 2019 appropriations process.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the rule and the underlying  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and  then I will turn and yield time to my friend from Ohio.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to quickly respond to my friend's concern  about the Election Assistance Commission funds.   As I am sure he is aware, that was the last installment last year,  this fiscal year, of a $365 billion authorization that was actually  done back in 2002. Currently, 39 percent of those funds for this year  are still available to the  [[Page H6277]]  States. Actually, 19 States have yet to submit any sort of request, and  the legislation itself has not been reauthorized. If the authorizing  people reauthorize it, I am sure we will revisit this matter.   It also worth noting that anything added will be available only from  October 1, and the election is 5 weeks after that. So the idea that we  are going to do something in that period of time, I think, is a bit of  a red herring.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Gibbs), my good friend from the Seventh District.    Mr. Speaker, I am reiterating my earlier announcement that  all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only, and I will not  yield for any other purpose.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H6278]]         Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close whenever my friend is.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let me make a couple of comments in response to my friend.   It was the last President, not this President, who told Russian  leaders that he would be more flexible after an election.   It was the last President, not this President, who said Russia was  not a geopolitical threat and chastised Mitt Romney when he raised it  in the campaign.   And it was the last President, not this President, who drew a red  line and then refused to enforce it.   If you actually look at the Record, it is this administration and  this party that, frankly, has begun to restore America's defenses after  years of neglect by the last administration. That is not good news for  Russia.   It is this administration that has also encouraged and cajoled some  of our allies to increase their defense level up to the levels that  they, themselves, had committed to.   It was this President that twice enforced red lines in Syria.   It was this Congress that administered ever-increasing penalties on  Russian sanctions.   So I think if you look at the actions, the actions are pretty  impressive.   But I want to actually get back to the matter at hand, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to encourage all Members to support  the rule. Today's bill represents the next step toward fulfilling our  primary obligation as Members of Congress: funding the Government of  the United States.   Although not perfect, the bill before us today will lead to the  completion of the House's work on two more appropriations bills. We  will provide funding for important government activities like fighting  forest fires, funding the Indian Health Service, enforcing tax and  securities laws, and funding our national parks; and we will ensure  that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is no longer allowed to  operate without congressional oversight.   While I look forward to completing our work and passing all 12  appropriations bills, this legislation represents an important step  along the way to fulfilling that goal. I applaud my colleagues on the  Appropriations Committee for their work.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 996 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       section:        Sec. 3. Upon adoption of this resolution the House shall be       considered to have adopted the resolution (H. Res. 999)       expressing agreement with the statements of the Speaker of       the House of Representatives made on July 16, 2018, regarding       Russian Federation interference in the 2016 United States       elections and related matters.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to  [[Page H6281]]       offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House       should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
