 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the lack of  mental health services in rural America.   As facilities close their doors and providers leave town, many people  in our rural communities are forced to travel for miles to get care or  forgo care altogether. That is harmful and unfair, which is why I  introduced a bipartisan bill to expand access to telemental health  services in rural areas.   This legislation will specifically help folks working in farming,  fishing, and forestry. These industries are critical to our economy and  way of life in my district. In fact, Oregon has the second-largest  number of Triple-F workers per capita in the entire country. These jobs  can also be very stressful, and few seek help due to stigma.   Improving telehealth access will take away that stigma, save folks  time and resources, and get more Oregonians the help they need when  they need it.   Congress has left rural America behind for far too long. It is time  we change that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join  me in supporting this very important bill.                            ____________________
