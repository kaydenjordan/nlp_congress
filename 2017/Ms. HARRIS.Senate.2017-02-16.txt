 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today, humbled to offer my first  official speech as the junior U.S. Senator from the great State of  California. I rise with a deep sense of reverence for this institution,  for its history, and for its unique role as the defender of our  Nation's ideals.   Above all, I rise today with a sense of gratitude for all those upon  whose shoulders we stand. For me, it starts with my mother Shyamala  Harris. She arrived at the University of California, Berkeley, from  India in 1959 with dreams of becoming a scientist. The plan, when she  finished school, was to go back home to a traditional Indian marriage.  But when she met my father Donald Harris, she made a different plan.  She went against a practice reaching back thousands of years, and  [[Page S1258]]  instead of an arranged marriage, she chose a love marriage. This act of  self-determination made my sister Maya and me, and it made us  Americans, like millions of children of immigrants before and since.   I know she is looking down on us today, and knowing my mother, she is  probably saying: Kamala, what on Earth is going on down there? We have  to stand up for our values.   So in the spirit of my mother, who was always direct, I cannot mince  words. In the early weeks of this administration, we have seen an  unprecedented series of Executive actions that have hit our immigrant  and religious communities like a cold front, striking a chilling fear  in the hearts of millions of good, hard-working people, all by  Executive fiat.   By fiat, we have seen the President stick taxpayers with a bill for a  multibillion-dollar border wall, without regard to the role of the U.S.  Congress under article 1 of the Constitution. By fiat, we have seen a  President mandate the detention of immigrants, both documented and  undocumented, creating a dragnet that could ensnare 8 million people.  By fiat, the President has ordered the creation of what essentially  will be a 15,000-member deportation force. By fiat, he wants to take  away State and local authority by making local police officers act as  Federal immigration officials. By fiat, the President wants to slam the  gates of freedom by instituting a Muslim ban--a ban which was as  carelessly written as it has been incompetently enforced.   In recent days, we have seen an increased severity in immigration  raids sweeping across this country, including the arrest of a DREAMer  in Seattle and a domestic violence victim in Texas. And we have seen an  administration violate court orders, attack the First Amendment, bully  Federal judges, and mock Americans exercising their right to freely  assemble.   I rise today to discuss how these actions impact my State of  California and our country. In particular, the State of California, I  believe, is a microcosm of who we are as America. In California, we  have farmers and environmentalists, welders and technologists,  Republicans, Democrats, Independents, and the largest number of  immigrants, documented and undocumented, of any State in the Nation.   I rise because the President's actions have created deep uncertainty  and pain for our refugee and immigrant communities. I rise on behalf of  California's more than 250,000 DREAMers, who were told by the Federal  Government: If you sign up, we will not use your personal information  against you. I rise to say the United States of America cannot go back  on our promise to these kids and their families.   I rise today as a lifelong prosecutor and as the former top cop of  the biggest State in this country to say that these Executive actions  present a real threat to our public safety. Let me repeat that: The  President's immigration actions and Muslim ban will make America less  safe.   As a prosecutor, I can tell you it is a serious mistake to conflate  criminal justice policy with immigration policy, as if they are the  same thing. They are not. I have personally prosecuted everything from  low-level offenses to homicides. I know what a crime looks like, and I  will tell you, an undocumented immigrant is not a criminal. But that is  what these actions do; they suggest all immigrants are criminals and  treat immigrants like criminals.   There is no question, those who commit crimes must face severe and  serious and swift consequence and accountability. But the truth is, the  vast majority of the immigrants in this country are hard-working people  who deserve a pathway to citizenship.   Instead of making us safer, these increased raids and Executive  orders instill fear in immigrants who are terrified they will be  deported or have to give up information resulting in the deportation of  their family members. For this reason, studies have shown Latinos are  more than 40 percent less likely to call 9-1-1 when they have been a  victim of crime. This climate of fear drives people underground and  into the shadows, making them less likely to report crimes against  themselves or others--fewer victims reporting crime and fewer witnesses  coming forward.   These Executive actions create a strain on local law enforcement. Any  police chief in this country will tell you that they barely have enough  resources to get their job done. So when you make local law enforcement  do the job of the Federal Government, you strain the resources for  local law enforcement and that hurts everybody's safety.    Let's consider the economic harm this order will cause. Immigrants  make up 10 percent of California's workforce and contribute $130  billion to our State's gross domestic product. Immigrants own small  businesses, they till the land, they care for children and the elderly,  they work in our labs, they attend our universities, and they serve in  our military. So these actions are not only cruel, but they cause  ripple effects that harm our public safety and our economy.   The same is true of this Muslim ban. This ban may as well have been  hatched in the basement headquarters of ISIS. We handed them a tool of  recruitment to use against us. Policies that demonize entire groups of  people based on the God they worship have a way of conjuring real-life  demons. Policies that isolate our Muslim-American communities take away  one of the greatest weapons we have in the fight against homegrown  extremism.   Here is the truth. Imperfect though we may be, I believe we are a  great country. I believe we are a great country. Part of what makes us  great are our democratic institutions that protect our fundamental  ideals: freedom of religion and the rule of law, protection from  discrimination based on national origin, freedom of the press, and a  200-year history as a nation built by immigrants.   So this brings me to my message today. We have a responsibility to  draw a line with these administrative actions and say no. This is not a  question of party. This is about the government of coequal branches,  with its inherent checks and balances. This is about the role of the  Senate, the greatest deliberative body in the world. I know, having  spent now a few weeks in this Chamber, that we have good men and women  on both sides of the aisle--men and women who believe deeply in our  immigrant communities and who understand that nationalism and  patriotism are not the same thing.   I know that it was the junior Senator from the State of Texas who  said: ``It is an enormous blessing to be the child of an immigrant who  fled oppression, because you realize how fragile liberty is and how  easily it can be taken away.''   It was the junior Senator from the great State of Kentucky who said:  ``We must always embrace individual liberty and enforce the  constitutional rights of all Americans, rich and poor, immigrants and  natives, black and white.''   It was the senior Senator from the great State of Arizona who said:  Undocumented immigrants should not be ``condemned forever'' to a  twilight status.   So, yes, we have good people on both sides of the aisle. I say that  we must measure up to our words and fight for our ideals because the  critical hour is upon us.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to convey my  wholehearted opposition to the nomination of Scott Pruitt as  Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA.   The EPA, at its core, is an Agency established to protect the  environment and the public health of our Nation. This Agency looks to  establish policies and guidelines that would benefit all Americans--and  in essence is not an Agency of partisanship. In fact, the EPA was  created through legislation led by a Republican President, Richard M.  Nixon, and enacted by a bipartisan Congress in 1970.   The EPA has a duty to protect the air we breathe, the water we drink,  and the environment we hope to pass on to future generations. In  accomplishing this mission, it enforces some of our most valued laws  like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, which have been in effect  for more than 30 years.   Unfortunately, this President asked the U.S. Senate to confirm a  nominee who has dedicated his career to undermining the very Agency he  is asked to lead. Mr. Pruitt's record and consistent failure to commit  to being a fair Administrator of the EPA further demonstrates that the  Trump administration's agenda is to weaken protections that guarantee  every American access to clean air and clean water. From his actions as  attorney general of Oklahoma up to his testimony at his hearing before  the Environment and Public Works Committee, it is clear Mr. Pruitt is  simply unqualified.   I express my strong concerns, as a Senator from California, a global  leader in environmental protections that allow our 39 million residents  to live healthy lives. It is my hope that with similar smart Federal  regulations, which are led by the EPA, our Nation can enjoy these same  benefits that I have seen Californians experience firsthand.   Californians have always been and will continue to be proud of our  environmental leadership. In 1977, California passed the first energy  efficiency standards in the country. Our friends from the States of  Florida, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New York quickly followed  suit. This set a precedent. Federal officials agreed that having  responsible renewable energy guidelines should be a priority.   Ten years later, the EPA implemented national standards across the  United States, saving a tremendous amount of energy, sustaining our  precious environment and resources for future generations, and  providing financial benefits for families and households across the  country.   To put it into perspective, one of the national energy standards for  refrigerators--that was the result of a policy initially enacted in  California--has saved more than 130,000 megawatts of electricity to  date. This is equivalent to the production of energy that roughly 250  powerplants might produce. This example is not a rare occurrence.  Energy policies have continued to be adopted from smart initiatives  started in various States.   Starting as early as 1978, California passed an energy efficiency  standard for newly constructed buildings. This standard is now adopted  not only in our Nation but worldwide. The State legislature listened to  the objective and factual data from scientists on the dangers of  climate change and, as a result, passed the California Global Warming  Solutions Act of 2006, which requires California to reduce its total  greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. We created the California Cap-and- Trade Program, which implemented an innovative, market-based system to  allow companies to continue to produce while also helping to reduce  emissions; instituted a low-carbon fuel standard, which reduced the  carbon intensity of all transportation fuels in California. We passed  the Sustainable Communities and Climate Protection Act of 2008, which  urged local transportation planning agencies to consider the statewide  greenhouse reduction standards and goals in their long-term  transportation plan, and we set a renewable portfolio standard, which  implored retail sellers of electricity to provide 33 percent of their  electricity from renewable resources by 2020 and 50 percent by 2030.   We are proud indeed of what we have accomplished in California, but  the importance of this issue goes beyond just the environment. It is an  economic issue, and it has been undeniable in helping California grow  to be the sixth largest economy in the world. California shows that a  healthy environment and a healthy economy and the choice between the  two is a false choice. We can have both. From 1990 to 2014,  California's population and economy grew while achieving a 36-percent  drop in emissions per gross domestic product. This clearly demonstrates  that you can successfully have economic growth and reduce carbon  intensity. The State has done a great job of creating employment  through the promotion of clean energy technology and green economies. A  report by the University of California Labor Center found that  the California renewable portfolio standards contributed to the  creation of 25,500 hours for what was referred to as ``blue-collar''  job opportunities and 7,200 hours of what was referred to as ``white- collar'' jobs.    Most importantly, the environmental laws that the EPA enforces  protects the health of future generations. Science has shown that  children living in communities with a higher concentration of  particulate matter developed respiratory difficulties and those  children living in regions with higher ozone levels were more likely to  develop asthma and miss school.   This is only a small part of the impact that ignoring the protections  of our environment can cause to the ones we love most. On that point,  of children missing school because of health concerns, there is a  significance to this because of a connection between what we need to do  to educate our population and also what we see in the criminal justice  system.   For example, it is well known and established the significance of a  third grade reading level. By the end of the third grade, if the child  is not at the third grade reading level, they literally drop off  because, when we think about it, we know before third grade a child is  learning how to read, and then comprehension kicks in, and they are  reading to learn. If they have not learned how to read, they cannot  read to learn and they drop off.   What is the connection between that and the concern we have about  pollution in the air and water? Well, there is a connection between  pollution in the air and asthma rates. Asthma causes children to miss  school. What we know is that we have seen that an elementary school  truant is three to four times more likely to be a high school dropout;  82 percent of the prisoners in the United States are high school  dropouts; African-American men between the ages of 30 and 34, if he is  a high school dropout, is two-thirds likely to be in jail, have been in  jail, or dead. There is a real connection between elementary school  truancy and what we see in public safety systems. What we also know is  that it costs money when children miss school. It costs us money in  terms of the money that schools miss out on because they are not being  reimbursed for attendance every day. All of these issues are connected.   As a former attorney general, I have worked to enforce California's  cutting-edge environmental laws. This is what an attorney general  should do and is obligated to do as a representative of her State.  Without reservation, I can say I am proud of the work of my office--of  my former office, the California Department of Justice, and the work  that is happening and has happened throughout the years doing the right  thing for the people of the State and for the environment.  [[Page S1355]]    In February of 2011, I filed an amicus brief in the Ninth Circuit  Court to support the efforts of the Port of Los Angeles to reduce air  pollution through its Clean Trucks Program. In 2011, I had the pleasure  of being a voice to protect an area of Southern California known as  Mira Loma Village, a town of hard-working people, by representing them  in a lawsuit to assure that a project would not significantly  deteriorate the air quality in their community.   I had been hearing stories of the grandmothers in that community for  years asking that they would be heard. I had been hearing for years,  before I visited Mira Loma, about the fact that studies showed the  children of that community had the lowest rate of lung development of  any region in that part of California. There was a serious concern  about the pollution in the air and the children of that community and  their ability to be healthy.   So this is what we did and what I was able to do as the attorney  general of the State that year. We met them with the developers in that  community, we sat down, and we had some tough discussions, but we  agreed that there had to be mitigation. They had to reduce the  emissions in that community that resulted in the public health problems  for that community. Two years later, that resulted in the city and the  developer moving forward with the project while implementing measures  to protect the residents from being exposed to diesel contamination.  Litigation was critical. The role of the attorney general to be able to  intervene and be a voice for that community and so many voiceless and  vulnerable people was critical.   In June of 2014, as attorney general of California, I publicly  opposed the lack of environmental review for the expansion of a Chevron  refinery project in a place called Richmond, CA, and demanded they  consider the public health of the nearby residents.   These are examples of the role and responsibility of a State attorney  general to take seriously their oath in terms of protecting the health  and welfare of the residents of their State. I offer these examples to  further support the concerns we have that this nominee--when he has  held such an important position and has taken an oath to represent the  people--has failed to perform his duties. I would suggest that his past  is prologue for the future. His past is an indication of what he will  do if he is confirmed as the next head of the EPA.   I would hope that instead we would have a nominee--someone who would  head these most important agencies in our government--who could say the  same thing about their record as I am proud to say about the record of  the California Department of Justice.   In my opinion, our current nominee cannot in good conscience speak to  the same type of record. Instead, Mr. Pruitt has talked about how he  wants to protect States from what he believes is ``overreach'' of the  Federal Government. His commitment to what he would call States' rights  is so strident that a December 6, 2014, New York Times article reported  that Mr. Pruitt has a painting in his office ``that shows local  authorities with rifles at the ready confronting outsiders during the  land rush era.'' He also established what he described and named as a  Federalism Unit in the Oklahoma attorney general's office that was  committed to fighting against Federal regulations. When he came before  the Environment and Public Works Committee for his confirmation  hearing, of which I am a Member, Mr. Pruitt stated that ``it is our  state regulators who oftentimes best understand the local needs and  uniqueness of our environmental challenges.'' He then went on to speak  about how States ``possess the resources and the uniqueness of our  environmental challenges.''   These statements might lead one to believe that Mr. Pruitt would be  in support of any opportunity possible to give power back to the States  to create environmental regulations. However, when I asked Mr. Pruitt  at the committee, when he came before us, if he would commit then to  upholding California's right to set its own vehicle emission standards,  he would not commit to doing so.   I will remind this body that the EPA has a long tradition of  respecting California's and other States' ability to set higher  standards where they can control the emissions and the greenhouse gas  emissions that as we have mentioned before, directly have an impact on  the health and well-being of the residents of our State and  particularly the children and the elderly of our States.   Under the Clean Air Act, California has set its own standards for how  it wants to regulate vehicle emissions. We have done this for decades  now, and previous EPA Administrators have upheld California's right to  set them.   Although there is precedence for doing so, Mr. Pruitt would not  commit to granting California the waiver to allow my State to continue  to set its own vehicle emissions standards. This is simply  unacceptable.   This is a blatant double standard for someone who claims to be  committed to breaking down regulations at the Federal level and giving  power back to the States. In fact, it makes me wonder how truly  committed Mr. Pruitt is to States' rights or if States' rights are just  a convenient argument for him in order to pursue actions that are  beneficial to industries that pollute instead of the residents and the  people of his State and, by extension, our country.   Just look at his record as attorney general of Oklahoma, a position  he used to challenge the laws of other States. As attorney general, he  challenged a California law when he joined a lawsuit that targeted a  referendum that California's voters approved in 2008 to require more  space in cages for egg-laying hens. That measure, California  proposition 2, prohibited the confinement of hens used to produce eggs  in California in any manner that does not allow them to turn around  freely, lie down, stand up, and fully extend their limbs. The law is  popular, and it was passed by the voters in my State by 63.5 percent.  In 2010, the California Legislature expanded that law to make it so  that it applied to all eggs sold in California.   Mr. Pruitt joined a lawsuit suing California over this law,  presumably because he did not like that a regulation approved by our  voters and affirmed by our State legislature would do a good job. He  just didn't like it. Mr. Pruitt's case was ultimately rejected by the  Federal appellate court because his lawsuit failed to demonstrate how  the California law presented a harm to his State. You would think that  a States' rights proponent would appreciate that one State passes a law  and it should be respected, especially when it doesn't create any harm  to his own State, but that was not the case.   Mr. Pruitt has filed seven lawsuits against the EPA that have since  been settled. In those lawsuits, he opposed the Clean Power Plan and  the Clean Water Act. He sued over regulations to make electricity- generating powerplants install technology to curb air pollution. He  sued over a plan to reduce pollution from coal-fired powerplants and a  regulation aimed at reducing greenhouse gases. He sued and filed a  lawsuit that claimed that the EPA encourages environmental nonprofits  to bring lawsuits.   It is important to know that Mr. Pruitt lost six out of those seven  lawsuits. Mr. Pruitt is a baseball fan, as am I. I love my Giants. I  find it hard to believe that my San Francisco Giants would look at a  hitter who slogged through spring training with a .142 batting average  and have no concerns whatsoever calling him up to the big league  roster. Why does the U.S. Senate have a lower standard for reviewing a  nominee who would be charged with safeguarding human health and our  environment?   What about the opportunities Mr. Pruitt has had to defend the  interests of the people he was elected to represent? What about issues  that directly impact the people of Oklahoma?   In 2011, 49 States signed on to a $25 billion mortgage settlement.  There was only one State's attorney general who decided not to sign on.  I think you know where I am heading. That one attorney general was  Scott Pruitt. Mr. Pruitt said he didn't think it was the appropriate  role of the State attorney general to advocate for the homeowners of  their States but wanted to be sure to protect the banks instead.   As a former State's attorney general, I am here to say that the role  of an attorney general is to represent the people of your State. When  an injustice is committed to one person, an injustice is committed to  all of the residents of  [[Page S1356]]  your State. In fact, after doing the work of an attorney general over  the course of 7 years in California, I will tell you that every time we  filed a suit, that document, that complaint never read the name of the  victim versus the name of the offender. It always read the people  versus the offender because in our system of democracy and in our  system of justice as a country, we have rightly said that a harm  against any one of us is a harm against all of us. Mr. Pruitt has  failed to appreciate the significance of that point.   He has developed a long list of lawsuits filed. Through all of that  litigation, he has delivered very little for the people of Oklahoma-- the very people who elected him to represent them. Why should we expect  that he will protect the interests of all Americans and the environment  we all share?   During his 6-year tenure as attorney general of Oklahoma, Scott  Pruitt stated only in one instance--a lawsuit against Mahard Egg Farm-- could he recall initiating an independent lawsuit as attorney general  against private air polluters. It was later revealed that even this  claim was misleading, and it turned out it was his predecessor who had  done the legwork and initiated the proceedings, along with the  assistance of the EPA.   In the 2014 New York Times article, it was reported that Mr. Pruitt  used his official position as Oklahoma attorney general to protect the  interests of a private gas and petroleum company, Devon Energy, not the  people of Oklahoma. Using his official government position, Mr. Pruitt  sent a three-page letter to the EPA stating that Devon Energy did not  cause as much air pollution as was calculated by Federal regulators.   In open records of exchanged emails between Devon Energy and the  Oklahoma attorney general's office, it was discovered that the lawyers  at Devon Energy were the ones who actually drafted the letter and that  Mr. Pruitt used a nearly identical letter to express it as his State's  position. Following the letter, Devon Energy wrote to his office:         Outstanding! The timing of this letter is great given our       meeting with both the EPA and the White House.    ``Outstanding,'' the energy company said--not the people of the State  of Oklahoma.   It is also unclear how far this abuse of power has gone. A lawsuit by  the Center for Media and Democracy has been filed in an Oklahoma  district court to release information on Mr. Pruitt's dealings as  attorney general. It is with great concern that we would try to rush  this nomination without these records coming to light. Senators should  have all the facts before us before we vote.   Should Mr. Pruitt be confirmed as EPA Administrator, I am deeply  concerned that he has refused to use his discretion to recuse himself  from litigation he was involved with in his role as Oklahoma attorney  general unless required to do so by the Ethics Commission.   I asked him about this during our hearing at the Environment and  Public Works Committee. I asked him if he would be willing to recuse  himself notwithstanding a finding by the Ethics Commission but based on  what is right and an appearance of conflict. He agreed, after many  questions, that he has the discretion--regardless of action, regardless  of waiting until the Ethics Commission rules--to recuse himself from  those lawsuits that he as attorney general of Oklahoma brought against  the Agency he wants to lead. He agreed he had the discretion and yet  failed to agree that he would exercise that discretion and recuse  himself because of an appearance of a conflict. That is simply  unacceptable.   It is so important that in our government, the public has confidence  in us, that they trust we will do the right thing, that they trust we  will use our discretion in an appropriate way. But this is a nominee  who has asked us to trust him to lead the EPA, the people's Agency that  has been charged with protecting the resources that are vital for all  human life. A nominee who has failed to represent his own constituents'  interests by making a career of partisanship is not the right nominee  for this office, period. He is a nominee who has lobbied for  corporations instead of the people he was charged with representing. He  is a nominee who has a clear record of using his position in a way that  has not been in the best interest of the people he serves.   There is evidence, unfortunately, of his record that is before us as  a body. We should take heed of this evidence. We should pay attention  to it, and we should not confirm this nominee to be the next head of  the EPA.   I yield the floor.
