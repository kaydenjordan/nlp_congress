 Mr. Speaker, 35 years ago yesterday, ground was broken  on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Today, there are 58,272 names listed  on that memorial. We still have work to do.   There are 1,615 names listed as MIA. As a Vietnam veteran, I want to  call your attention to all of the men and women who served, the 2.7  million who served in Vietnam, a lot of whom are with us today, and a  lot of those who will continue to celebrate the losses of our comrades.   Please remember that we all served honorably at the request of our  government, and we will continue to serve as long as the cause is just.                            ____________________
