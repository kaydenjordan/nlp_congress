 Mr. President, I wish to recognize an extraordinary  individual in my State, along with his wife. I would like to take a few  minutes today to recognize Reverend Dr. Alonzo B. Patterson, Jr., and  Mrs. Shirley Patterson.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S6341, October 5, 2017, near the top of the third  column, the following language appears: Tribute to Reverend Dr.  Alonzo B. Patterson, Jr., and Mrs. Shirley Patterson Mr.  President, I wish . . .      The online Record has been corrected to read: Tribute to  Reverend Dr. Alonzo B. Patterson, Jr., and Mrs. Shirley Patterson   . . . Mr. President, I wish . . .    ========================= END NOTE =========================     During the first week of November, Anchorage is going to host 4 days  of events to commemorate the service of two of our most beloved  community leaders, the Reverend Dr. Alonzo B. Patterson and his wife,  Shirley Patterson. Next month, Reverend Patterson leaves the pulpit of  Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church. This is a pulpit he has held for some  47 years. Mrs. Patterson, his wife of six decades, is to be recognized  for her service as well.   Anchorage is one of America's great communities, and it is not  uncommon to celebrate the retirement of a figure of Patterson's  stature, but 4 separate days of events--that is huge, and it is a  testament to the respect our community has for the Patterson family.   Think about this: Alaska has been a State for just 58 years. Reverend  Patterson has had his pulpit for 47 years. And Shiloh is not Reverend  Patterson's first pulpit in Alaska; it is his second. He came to  Anchorage after founding the Corinthian Baptist Church in Fairbanks.  Reverend Patterson grew up with Alaska, and Alaska grew up with  Reverend Patterson.   Corinthian and Shiloh could appropriately be characterized as  African-American churches. But for the African-American community in  Alaska, they are far more than churches; they are centers of Black  history in Alaska.   Zakiya McCummings interviewed Reverend Patterson earlier this year  for an article published in the Anchorage Press, and in that interview,  Reverend Patterson explained:         The church was, and always has been, the sanctuary in the       Black community. It is the meeting place, the community       center, the focus for support and help, the place you come to       be important, the psychologist for your particular problem,       the time to shout out your frustrations and the only place to       be significant. You could be a Deacon or something in the       church where in the rest of the community, you were just       another Black person. The church was for us a panacea for       many of the social ills that existed then and still have       relevance.    Given the central role Reverend Patterson has played in Alaska's  African-American community for most of our State's existence, it is no  surprise that he is regarded as a historian of Black culture in Alaska.  Ms. McCummings observed that it is a responsibility that he doesn't  take lightly. Reverend Patterson told her:         I feel like I have to be the keeper of our historical       plight and to speak to each generation in my time. It is a       powerful responsibility because if I go to sleep on my watch,  [[Page S6342]]       then the next watch will have nothing to build on. . . .       We're responsible that the gate remains open for the next       generation.    Under Reverend Patterson's watch, there was much progress. In the  1960s and 1970s, Reverend Patterson recalled, ``much of Alaska was  small family businesses, including the banks. If you were not part of  that family or their friends, you had a hard time getting a job.   Many of the jobs for African Americans were either construction or  government jobs.''   Reverend Patterson proudly recalls the first Black principal of a  State elementary school, an African-American banker who was elected to  the school board and subsequently to the Alaska Legislature, an  African-American activist in the Fairview section of Anchorage who is  regarded as the grandfather of the city's public transportation system.  Today's African-American community is built on the foundation of these  pioneers who endured.   Make no mistake about this, Alonzo Patterson was no mere spectator to  all of this progress. He was an agent of change, rooted in his  observation, and he stated: ``In ministry there are no limits except  the ones we set for ourselves.'' Under his leadership, Shiloh grew  spiritually, physically, and fiscally, and would include a church  school, a television ministry, and a jail outreach ministry.   On Shiloh's 29th anniversary, the mortgage note for the original  structure was burned under the theme, ``Burning to Build,'' and  groundbreaking for a new educational wing commenced. There was more  building to come. The Martin Luther King Jr. Family Life Center was  dedicated on May 23, 1993. In 2001, Reverend Patterson spun off a new  nonprofit organization, Shiloh Community Development, Inc., to serve  youth, minorities, and the disadvantaged. Today Shiloh Community  Development is well known for its youth mentoring program called Young  Lions of Alaska.   He is a founder of Bridge Builders of Alaska, which celebrates the  diversity of our communities and a powerful voice in Alaska's annual  celebration of Dr. Martin Luther King Day. In 2015, Reverend Patterson  was the keynote speaker at the King Day ceremonies on JBER. At that  ceremony, he warned his audience that Dr. King's dream is at risk of  dying. He said:         This dream is at risk if nothing is done, and nothing is       holding us back but ourselves. Stop waiting for miracles;       believe in yourself to make society better. Each of us can do       our part, by loving and respecting others.    This is just one example of his powerful voice. Reverend Patterson's  sermons were always inspiring, many legendary, and it explains why he  is regarded as a pastor's pastor, growing not only his congregants but  the generations of ministers who will follow in his footsteps. As one  who has joined in the congregation there at Shiloh on numerous  occasions, I can attest that there was never a Sunday that I did not  leave feeling inspired by the words of Dr. Patterson.   They aren't calling the appreciation festivities for Reverend  Patterson a retirement ceremony. They are calling it a transition,  probably because nobody believes Rev. Alonzo Patterson has any  intentions of pursuing a future of leisure. Leadership and inspiration  runs in Alonzo Patterson's DNA.   We wish him and Shirley well in their next calling, and we take  comfort in the fact that their contributions to our community are far  from over. November marks a transition, not a retirement--and certainly  not a eulogy--for this extraordinary Alaska family.   On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I thank Dr. Patterson and his  lovely wife Shirley for their good works, and thank them in advance for  their continued leadership.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following nominations:  Executive Calendar Nos. 323, 324, 325; that the Senate vote on the  nominations en bloc, with no intervening action or debate; that if  confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table en bloc; that the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action; that no further motions be in order; and that any  statements relating to the nominations be printed in the Record.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    Mr. President, it is my hope that we will be able to  come to agreement with regard to the nominees whom I have just asked  for consideration. These are individuals who have been moved out of the  Energy and Natural Resources Committee to be named to the Federal  Energy Regulatory Commission. This is a Commission that has been  without a functioning quorum for months on end. They have just recently  been able to achieve that quorum, but they are not yet to a full  complement.   We worked hard to reach an agreement with colleagues so these names  could advance so the FERC could get to work in an expeditious manner.  There is much to be considered. The work that has piled up, that has  cost our economy, that has cost our country over these many months, as  we have seen these delays when you don't have a functioning FERC, has  been considerable. We want to try to reach agreement, but I am  disappointed that we are not going to be able to advance them this  afternoon.    With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to  Ermalee Hickel, the wife of our late Governor, Wally Hickel, who passed  away on September 14 at the age of 92. Ermalee was married to Wally  Hickel for 65 years until his death in 2010. She is buried next to her  husband in Anchorage Memorial Park, standing up, facing Washington,  just as Governor Hickel was.   This is the way the power couple of post-Statehood Alaska desired to  be remembered. Standing up for Alaskans to  [[Page S6357]]  Washington, DC. A powerful symbol not only to Alaskans, but Washington,  that the battle for Alaska's sovereignty is far from over and that the  Hickels, in spirit, stand with Alaskans as we wage this battle to  conclusion, however long that may take.   Wally and Ermalee's son, Jack Hickel, remembers these words  explaining why his father wanted to be buried standing up. ``He said,  if they don't do it right he's going to crawl out of his grave and  straighten them out. He thought they were going to screw everything up.  He wanted to keep his eye on them.'' Now there will be two pair of eyes  gazing east.   Ermalee, I should warn you, has two pretty tough eyes. She was widely  known as ``more beautiful than a butterfly, but tougher than a boot.''   The history books will mention that Ermalee was twice the first lady  of Alaska, as well as the wife of a Secretary of the Interior. They  might mention that she was a strong woman, but that really doesn't tell  you much about the person, and there is really much more to the story.   Ermalee was born to Lewis and Aline Strutz. The Strutzes moved from  Montana to Anchorage in 1924. They bought a house downtown and raised  six kids in that house: four girls and two boys. Anchorage was a pretty  small town in the day, but it had plenty of life. As a high school  student, Ermalee did it all. She was a softball player, editor of the  school paper, and quite popular. She never missed a dance. She ushered  at the movie theatre and, unique to Anchorage, worked at a cannery.  Upon graduation, she went to work on the local base as the secretary to  a military officer, a very important job for an outstanding individual.  The Strutz girls were like that--popular, successful, from a really  good family.   Wally Hickel, on the other hand, arrived in Anchorage from Kansas in  1940 with all of 37 cents in his pocket. His family was in insurance,  but he left Kansas to pursue his passion in boxing. That led him to  California, and when it didn't work out, Wally booked a ticket in  steerage on a vessel headed to Alaska. He replenished his bank account  by winning a $125 purse at a boxing tournament conducted during Fur  Rondy, the Anchorage winter carnival. Wally married a local girl,  Jannice Cannon, who went to school with Ermalee. Wally and Jannice had  a son, Ted. Jannice tragically died in 1943 at the Mayo Clinic. Wally  returned to Anchorage, a single dad, and took a job inspecting aircraft  on the ramp of Alaska airbases.   In 1945, Ermalee and Wally were married in a small Catholic Church  and went on to build a family. It was a tough time for the both of  them. Wally still had to pay off Jannice's medical bills and worked a  second job as a bartender and a bouncer to make ends meet.   Wally subsequently quit his job on base and told Ermalee that he  figured it out. Anchorage was growing and construction was its future.  Turns out, he was right. The family found stability and a modicum of  wealth. That gave Wally the freedom to pursue his interest in politics.  Over time, Wally's investments in Anchorage's growth provided a strong  financial foundation for the family.   Throughout it all, Ermalee was a steadfast partner--managing the  house, putting chains on the tires of the car to take the kids skiing,  even ironing the pants of her hero, Charles Lindbergh, when he came to  Juneau to address the Alaska Legislature. Lindbergh asked Ermalee if  she would get ``the help'' to press his pants. Turns out Ermalee was  ``the help.''   ``Ermalee was calm, empathetic and insightful. Wally turned to her  and followed her counsel. She guided and protected him, out of sight,''  wrote Anchorage author and historian Charles Wohlforth. She read to  schoolchildren and visited with elders in the Pioneer's Homes. She  visited the soup kitchens and the juvenile detention facilities. She  fought for benefits for the disabled, raised awareness of fetal alcohol  syndrome, and sought to protect seniors from scammers. She did it all  without ever seeking credit. Ermalee was always gracious and lovely to  me.   Wohlforth headlined his column remembering Ermalee Hickel's legacy  with the words ``Ermalee Hickel led Alaska, too.'' She did with dignity  and grace from the beginning to the very end. It is an honor and a  pleasure to share this story of an Alaskan life well lived with the  Senate today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to acknowledge and thank the  Senator from North Dakota. She has been a champion for the Native  people, the indigenous people around the country, including in my State  of Alaska. Whether it is working to address the issues related to  childhood trauma, which so many of our young Native children face, or  the issues relating to domestic violence, sexual assault, and human  trafficking--these are scourges that we see directed, unfortunately, at  so many of our Native women in the State of Alaska, in the State of  North Dakota, and around the country.   She has cited the statistics. I think sometimes we just get numb by  the statistics. When you are told that you are four times the national  average, that sounds bad. But what does that mean? When you put a face  to it, when you hear the tragedy repeated through the stories, these  are not just statistics that we are speaking of. These are real women.  These are our sisters. These are our neighbors. These are our friends,  and these are human beings who deserve to be respected in their lives  but also respected in other tragic deaths. How we work to address these  difficult issues needs to be a focus and a priority for us.   So I appreciate what the Senator from North Dakota is doing in  bringing attention to our Nation's lackluster--and that is kind of a  polite term here--response to the tragedy of missing and murdered  Native women and girls.   I am proud to lend my voice to the proposition that Congress, in the  exercise of our trust responsibility to our Native peoples, has a  responsibility to do more. You would think that that trust  responsibility demands us to be paying even closer attention, and yet  it seems that we just withdraw from that, that that responsibility is  not acknowledged.   Now, it is not often here in the United States that we benchmark our  treatment of indigenous peoples against Canada, but in this case, there  is actually a compelling difference between Canada's national response  to the tragedy of missing and murdered Native women and our seeming  indifference here in the United States.   Down in southeastern Alaska, right across on the Canadian side, lies  a town called Prince Rupert. It is in British Columbia. The Alaskan  ferry comes in from Washington State and stops in Prince Rupert and  then moves into Alaska. Prince Rupert is also the terminus of Highway  16, and the locals refer to Highway 16 as the ``Highway of Tears.''  They refer to it as the ``Highway of Tears'' because it is a road on  which Native women and girls have vanished for decades now. The  question is, How many? Who is disappearing? Some would say as few as 12  and perhaps as many as 43. CBS News devoted a segment of its news  magazine show ``48 Hours'' to the Highway of Tears.   Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau committed 54 million Canadian  dollars to a national inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous  women and girls. I will admit that there is some controversy over  whether the national inquiry is actually fulfilling its mission, but my  point here is that Canada stepped up. They have acknowledged that this  is an issue, that this is a problem, and they have responded to the  disproportionate victimization of Native women and girls, and they have  done so in a tangible way. Here in the United States, as my friend and  colleague has noted, we are more than a bit late in acknowledging that  the problem even exists.   Earlier this year, the Senators from Montana--both Senator Daines and  Senator Tester--were successful in designating May 5, 2017, through a  resolution, as the National Day of Awareness on Missing and Murdered  Native Women and Girls. The resolution recites that some Tribal  communities face murder rates that are 10 times the national average,  as Senator Heitkamp has noted. According to the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention, homicide was the third leading cause of death  among Native women between the ages of 10 and 24 years and the fifth  leading cause of death for Alaska Native women between 25 and 34 years  of age. So we are trying to raise attention and awareness. We are  trying to shine a spotlight on this issue.   I certainly think it is high time that Federal law enforcement answer  the question, Why? Why is the murder rate for Native women so high, and  why are we not addressing it in a comprehensive fashion? The Senator  from North Dakota has pointed out that in many areas, jurisdictional  issues are at play, and I agree. That is not an excuse. We acknowledge  that we have challenges with jurisdictions. Let's figure this out.  Women are disappearing and dying.   In Alaska, it is not so much jurisdictional issues; it is the fact  that in far too many of our communities, we lack any law enforcement  presence. We might have a VPSO--a village safety police officer--but  they are not armed. They are very limited in terms of their ability to  provide for levels of enforcement. More frustrating than so much of  that is that women who have been victimized feel as though reporting  doesn't get them anywhere because there is no follow-through. There is  no prosecution. There has been no effort that will allow them to have  any level of recourse, much less justice, visited upon them.   As we talk about these issues of jurisdiction and law enforcement and  the rates that we see, I think we need to be clear that the discussion  today--the call for justice--is not driven by statistics and rates. It  is driven by their faces. It is driven by the loss of people's  daughters, people's siblings, people's friends, including Savannah and  Stella and Nicole and Mona Lisa. These are all real people, real women  with names, with faces, with families.   In Alaska, the face we so often associate with the lack of progress  when it comes to addressing the issue of missing and murdered Native  women is the face of Sophie Sergie. This year marks the 24th  anniversary of the death of Sophie Sergie from Pitkas Point. This is a  Yup'ik village in southwest Alaska.   On August 26 of 1993, Sophie was found dead in the women's bathroom  dorm on the University of Alaska Fairbanks campus. She was raped. She  was shot dead. It is believed that her body remained in that bathroom  for some 13 hours before it was found. The murder weapon was never  recovered. That case is still a cold case 24 years later. But we don't  forget Sophie Sergie, just as  [[Page S6366]]  we don't forget the women the Senator from North Dakota has shared  stories about. We cannot forget these women.   Unlike the tragedies along the Highway of Tears, we really don't know  how many Native women and girls have gone missing and murdered. That is  a big part of the problem. But I will tell my colleagues that if you  ask advocates for Native women, the answer comes back: It is no secret.  We all know somebody. We all know somebody who has gone missing,  somebody who has been murdered.   That was the testimony of Tammy Jerue. She is the executive director  for the Alaska Native Women's Resource Center, and she testified before  a congressional briefing last February. Tammy told the briefing that  her organization has documented as many as 50 names of women. When we  think about it, numbers on that order were significant enough for Prime  Minister Trudeau to commission a national inquiry. So it causes us to  ask the question, What about us? What number do we have to get to  before there is a call to action, before we wake up and say: This is  not acceptable. This is not acceptable that our Native women are  disappearing, are being murdered.   Native women are asking why Federal law enforcement has no protocol  for addressing the crisis in our Indian Country, why there is a lack of  coordination among criminal justice agencies in this country to set  aside the jurisdictional challenges and investigate these tragedies in  an effective manner, and why there is a lack of victim services.   In the Indian Affairs Committee, we had a hearing on human  trafficking, sex trafficking. It was pretty revealing about the lack of  victim services--specific--that could be there to help our Native  victims. Right now, the families of missing and murdered Native women  in Alaska have to cover the cost of a traditional burial. They have to  cover the cost of immediate long-term counseling, and so many other  expenses they can't afford. We maintain a victims of crime fund here in  this country to address these sorts of costs, but there is no dedicated  Tribal funding stream. We have had some pretty bipartisan efforts here  in the Senate to establish one, but we haven't even been able to do  that bare minimum to provide for the victims.   The issue we are discussing today is tragic and frustrating. It is  depressing. But to remain silent is to truly further marginalize Native  women and girls, and that is unacceptable. Perhaps we are not going to  devote tens of millions of dollars to a national inquiry; However, it  is high time that we acknowledge a problem that has failed to make  headlines in this country, because you first have to acknowledge that a  problem exists to make headway in addressing that problem.   So, again, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for her strong and  steadfast advocacy on behalf of not only our Native women but our  Native children, our indigenous peoples across this country. I  appreciate all that is being done, and I look forward to working with  her again as we try to shine a brighter light on a very tragic  situation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Reed, Mr.          Kaine, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Van          Hollen, Mr. Markey, Mr. Carper, Ms. Warren, Ms. Hirono, Mr.          Cardin, Mr. Booker, Ms. Hassan, Mr. Sanders, Mrs. Murray, Mr.          Blumenthal, and Ms. Harris):   S. 1945.
