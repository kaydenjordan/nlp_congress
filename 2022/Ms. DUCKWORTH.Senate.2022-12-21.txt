 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the       order for the quorum call be rescinded.         Madam President, I come to the floor to talk about an       important nominee to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an       Agency that plays a critical role in protecting workers and upholding       civil rights.        The EEOC enforces Federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate       against a job applicant or an employee because of the person's race,       color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or genetic       information.        In short, it is because of the laws that the EEOC enforces that many       of us are here today, and Karla Gilbride is an exceptionally qualified       nominee to serve as the EEOC's general counsel.        Ms. Gilbride has 15 years of experience in advocating for the right       of all Americans to enjoy equal opportunity under the law, including       representing workers who have faced discrimination or who have been       unable to access courts because of forced arbitration provisions.        As codirector of Public Justice's Access to Justice Project, she       recently won a unanimous Supreme Court decision in which she       represented a worker in a dispute over whether a Taco Bell franchise       could force an arbitration of the worker's overtime claims. She has       also worked to secure workers' protections from sexual harassment, as       well as securing people with disabilities' access to licensing exams,       emergency shelters, housing, and transportation.        Ms. Gilbride's nomination is supported by over 40 organizations,       including the National Women's Law Center, the AFL-CIO, the National       Employment Lawyers Association, the Disability Rights Advocates, and       the National Disability Rights Network.        As EEOC's general counsel, I know that Ms. Gilbride will continue to       work to help all Americans thrive but especially those hard-working       Americans facing unsafe working conditions and those who might be       systemically left out due to the increasing use of sophisticated       technology. The EEOC has such important work to do, and it should do       that work with a Senate-confirmed general counsel.        I hope my colleagues will join me in confirming Ms. Gilbride to this       critical role so she can get to work.        Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, as in executive session,       that the Senate consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 1203,       Karla Ann Gilbride, of Maryland, to be General Counsel of the Equal       Employment Opportunity Commission for a term of four years; that the       Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate;       that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid       upon the table; and that the President be immediately notified of the       Senate's action.         Madam President, I am disappointed that the Senate is       not able to confirm Ms. Gilbride today. As I said earlier, she is an       excellent nominee to fill this role.        I look forward to working with my colleagues to move quickly and       confirm her when we return in January.        I suggest the absence of a quorum.
