 I rise today to voice my support for H.R. 1112,  The Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019. This bill will strengthen  our federal gun background check procedures by closing the  ``Charleston'' loophole, thus ensuring that guns can no longer be  erroneously sold due to incomplete background checks.   This epidemic of gun violence has left its scars on my home state of  Texas. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  revealed that there were 3,353 gun-related deaths in Texas in 2017  alone. Hundreds of these victims are children and teenagers under 19  years of age.   Our country has struggled with gun violence for too long, and the  multitudes of loopholes in our laws are complicit in our difficulties.  This bill will not only eliminate a significant loophole, but it will  do so without infringing upon Second Amendment rights. It will ensure  that only responsible and able individuals are able to purchase guns in  our country.   I share our nation's concerns about the widespread proliferation of  guns in our neighborhoods, and I agree that reasonable restrictions on  firearms are essential to a comprehensive strategy to reduce crime and  violence in our society. We must take sensible steps to ensure that  these firearms do not fall into the wrong hands.   Furthermore, it has come to my attention that the mental illness  reference in this bill may be outdated and not in line with current  medical and legal standards. I will be reviewing this issue as we  progress through the 116th Congress.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.-
