 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 953, Reducing the  Regulatory Burdens Act. As I have noted before on similar bills in the  past, I remain concerned that this bill would mean that no Clean Water  Act protections would be required for pesticide application to water  bodies that are already impaired by pesticides.   The Clean Water Act in no way hinders, delays, or prevents the use of  approved pesticides for pest control operations. In fact, the Clean  Water Act permit provides a specific emergency provision to prevent  outbreaks of diseases such as Zika virus.   Under the terms of the permit, pesticide applicators are covered  automatically under the permit and any spraying may be performed  immediately for any declared pest emergency situations. In most  instances, sprayers are only required to notify EPA of their spraying  operations 30 days after the beginning of a spraying operation.   Most pesticide applications in the United States are done in  accordance with FIFRA, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and  Rodenticide Act which only requires proper labeling on pesticide  products regarding usage.   However, FIFRA labeling is no substitute for ensuring that we  understand the volumes of pesticide we seem to apply to our rivers, our  lakes, our streams on an annual basis.                                time  1515    According to a 2006 USGS report on pesticides, commonly used  pesticides frequently are present in streams and groundwater at levels  that exceed human health benchmarks and occur in many streams at levels  that may affect aquatic or fish-eating wildlife and also human life.   In the data that the States provide the EPA, more than 16,000 miles  of rivers and streams, 1,380 of bays and estuaries, and 370,000 acres  of lakes in the United States are currently impaired or threatened by  pesticides.   The EPA suggests that these estimates may be low because many of  these States do not test for or monitor all the different pesticides  that are currently being used. I am very concerned of the effect these  pesticides have on the health of our rivers, our streams, and  especially the drinking water supplies for all our citizens, especially  the most vulnerable, the young, the elderly, and the poor and  disenfranchised people who have no representation. We have much cancer  appearing, and we have no idea what it is. Adding pesticides is not  helping.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a Federal report on how pesticides  in California are the leading cause of impairments to water quality.           U.S. EPA Report on California Water Quality Assessment           California Causes of Impairment for reporting year 2012         Pesticides are the Cause of water impairment in California       for 4,534 miles of rivers and streams, 235,765 acres of       lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, 829 square miles of bays and       estuaries, 35 miles of coastal shoreline, 42 square miles of       ocean and near coastal waters, and 43 acres of wetlands.     Currently in California there are over 4,500 miles  of rivers and streams, 235,000 acres of lakes and reservoirs, and 829  square  [[Page H4540]]  miles of bays and estuaries in my State that are impaired by  pesticides. This is a significant concern in my home State, where every  drop of water has to be cleaned and needs to be conserved, reused, and  cherished.   We hear that pesticide application is already regulated under FIFRA  and that the Clean Water Act review is not needed. I understand the  concerns about the duplication of effort and the need to minimize the  impacts that regulations have on small business or business at large.  All the supporters are mostly farmers and other business entities.   However, I am still very concerned that these pesticides are having a  very significant impact on water quality and that, with this bill, we  are creating the exemption from water quality protection requirements  without considering the impacts to the waters that are already impacted  by pesticides, as they are in California.   This, in turn, costs our water users, our ratepayers hundreds of  millions of dollars to filter these pollutants out of water before it  is potable. This is something I deal with on an ongoing basis as the  ranking member of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment.  We currently have aquifers that are contaminated by the continued use  of pesticides and fertilizers. Millions of dollars have been spent on  the 20-plus-year-long cleanup effort of a Superfund site in my area  that has pesticides as one of the contaminants.   We cannot, and should not, take away one of the only tools available  to monitor for adverse impacts of pesticides in our rivers, our  streams, and our reservoirs. Over the past 6 years, this tool has been  reasonable, has been workable to pest control operators and  agricultural interests alike, and needs to be retained. I urge my  colleagues on both sides to vote ``no'' on this bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Peterson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record the following letters to be  made part of today's record: A letter from 46 national and State  conservation and public health interest groups opposed to H.R. 953,  and, secondly, a list of over 150 different organizations who oppose  efforts to undermine the Clean Water Act protections for direct  pesticide applications, including the Alabama Rivers, San Francisco,  and the list goes on.   And the organizations: Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments;  from Alaska, the Alaska Community Action on Toxics; From Arkansas, the  Earth Cause Organization; from California, Audubon and many others;  from Alabama, Alabama Rivers; from Colorado, Colorado Riverkeeper; from  the District of Columbia, Potomac Riverkeeper; from Florida, Emerald  Coastkeeper; from Georgia, Altamaha Riverkeeper and Altamaha  Coastkeeper; from Idaho, the Idaho Conservation League; from Illinois,  the Illinois Council of Trout Unlimited; and from Iowa, Quad Cities  Riverkeeper. And the list goes on, Mr. Chairman.                                                       May 22, 2017.      Re Oppose H.R. 953 (Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017).         Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members       and supporters nationwide, we urge you to oppose H.R. 953       (``Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017''). A  [[Page H4543]]       more apt title for this damaging legislation is the ``Poison       Our Waters Act'' because it would eliminate Clean Water Act       safeguards that protect our waterways and communities from       excessive pesticide pollution. The Pesticide General Permit       targeted in this legislation has been in place for nearly six       years now and alarmist predictions by pesticide manufacturers       and others about the impacts of this permit have failed to       bear any fruit.        This bill is the same legislation that pesticide       manufacturers and other special interests have been pushing       for years. It has been opposed not only by the Obama       Administration. but also more than 150 public health,       fishing, and conservation organizations (see attached list).       Contrary to earlier claims made by its proponents, this bill       will not improve nor impact spraying to combat Zika virus and       other human health threats. The Pesticide General Permit at       issue already allows for spraying to combat vector-borne       diseases such as Zika and the West Nile virus. According to       the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the permit       ``provides that pesticide applications are covered       automatically under the permit and may be performed       immediately for any declared emergency pest situations''       (emphasis added).        Further, the Clean Water Act has no significant effect on       farming practices. The Pesticide General Permit in no way       affects land applications of pesticides for the purpose of       controlling pests (that is, spraying that doesn't discharge       into water bodies). Irrigation return flows and agricultural       stormwater runoff do not require permits, even when they       contain pesticides. Existing agricultural exemptions in the       Clean Water Act remain.        Repealing the Pesticide General Permit--as this damaging       legislation seeks to do--would allow pesticides to be       discharged into water bodies without any meaningful oversight       since the federal pesticide registration law (the Federal       Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)) does not       require tracking of such applications.        Now that the Pesticide General Permit is in place, the       public is finally getting information that they couldn't       obtain before about the types of pesticides being sprayed or       discharged into local bodies of water. All across the       country, pesticide applicators are complying with the       Pesticide General Permit to protect water quality without       issue,        The Pesticide General Permit simply lays out commonsense       practices for applying pesticides directly to waters that       currently fall under the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act.       Efforts to block this permit are highly controversial, as       evidenced by the attached list of groups opposed.

Mr. Chairman, there is one other thing that I want  to bring to the attention of this committee. One of the potential human  health applications related to unregulated discharges to water is  drinking water.   In May of 2017, the Natural Resources Defense Council released a  report entitled, ``Threats on Tap,'' that documented potentially  harmful contaminants in tap water in every State of the Union. This  report, based on information obtained from State and local public  drinking water utilities, documented tens of thousands of drinking  water violations related to chemicals and other contaminants currently  found in our domestic water supply.   The report included a focus on synthetic organic compounds commonly  found in a wide variety of products, from household cleaners to  industrial, commercial, and agricultural products, including pesticides  and herbicides regulated under FIFRA.                                time  1545    According to this report, human exposure to these contaminants can  lead to cancers--I repeat, lead to cancers--developmental effects,  central nervous system, and reproductive difficulties, endocrine  issues, or liver and kidney problems.   According to an appendix of this report, which I include in today's  Record, in 2015, there were 6,864 drinking water violations associated  with synthetic organic compounds, potentially affecting as many as 2.6  million drinking water users. Of these, a number were for direct,  health-related violations affecting more than 300,000 individuals. This  report documented ongoing drinking water violations for the worst of  the worst pesticides in terms of human health effects, including,  atrazine, chlordane, endrin, and glyphosate.   Mr. Chairman, thanks to this report, we have more information on  exactly where these drinking water violations are occurring and how  increased use of pesticides on or near water increases the risk that  humans will be exposed to these dangerous chemicals when they turn on  the tap; which begs the question: Why the proponents of this bill want  to reduce the public disclosure and monitoring requirements of the  Clean Water Act relating to pesticide applications?   Do these proponents want to let these pesticide applications and  chemical companies go back in the shadows where information on the  release of pesticides is no longer known?   I include in the Record a list of chemicals and their potential  health impact.

Mr. Chairman, I just implore all our colleagues to  take a good look at what this can have an effect on our general  populace, I mean, the human impact, and I trust that they will vote  ``no'' on this bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment  offered by the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty). The amendment  would help ensure the protection of public health from discharges of  toxic chemicals such as benzene, chlordane, and vinyl chloride.   In my view, the protection of our families and children from  seemingly limitless exposure to toxic chemicals in our air and our  water and our neighborhoods should be paramount, yet here we are today  considering legislation to waive the simple requirement that a chemical  pesticide sprayer fill out an application providing notice of where he  intends to spray known toxic chemicals, such as the ones I mentioned,  all known to have toxic effects on humans.   The amendment under consideration says that we should, at a minimum,  disclose and monitor the dangerous chemicals for potential toxic  effects. These are chemicals that Congress has already designated as  ``toxic,'' ``hazardous substances,'' or ``extreme hazardous  substances'' in Federal statute.   As Congress, we should want to make sure that these dangerous  chemicals do not wind up in our rivers and streams, potentially  contaminating our local drinking water sources and leading to greater  toxic exposure by our families and children.                                time  1600    The level of protection is worth 10 minutes of time by a commercial  pesticide applicator.   Mr. Chair, I approve Ms. Esty's amendment.    I totally support the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman). If this amendment is adopted,  it would maintain the existing Clean Water Act general permit  requirements to protect commercial, recreational, and subsistence  fisheries, and Tribal treaty obligations. I support the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
