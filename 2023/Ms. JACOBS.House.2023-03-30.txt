 Madam Speaker, I rise today as an incredibly proud San  Diegan and the proud daughter of an SDSU alum to congratulate San Diego  State University for making it to the Final Four for the first time in  program history.   After the tournament was canceled in 2020 during one of SDSU's best  seasons, our dreams of a championship appearance were dashed.   This team has risen to the challenge, and this year's tournament has  been electric for SDSU, defying the odds and expectations set against  them.   Led by Coach Brian Dutcher, they have been focused, steady, and  resilient. They beat No. 1 seed Alabama 71-64 in the Sweet 16. They  beat Creighton 57-56 after senior Darrion Trammell sank a free throw  with 1.2 seconds left in the game.   Out of 363 Division I men's basketball teams, SDSU has outlasted all  but three. They will face off against Florida Atlantic this weekend.   With more than 400,000 alumni, our entire community and all of  California are behind you and rooting for you.   Let's go, San Diego State.                            ____________________
