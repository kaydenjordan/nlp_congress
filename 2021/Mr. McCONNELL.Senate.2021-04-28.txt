 Mr. President, tonight President Biden will deliver  his first address to a joint session of Congress. I will be there, and,  like my fellow Kentuckians watching at home, I will be curious to hear  how President Biden tries to square his rhetoric with the  administration's actions over the past 100 days.   Back in January, many Americans hoped they could take the incoming  President at his word. After a year spent beating back a historic  pandemic  [[Page S2259]]  and grappling with civil unrest, President Biden pledged he would be  ``a President for all Americans,'' with plans to ``repair,''  ``restore,'' and ``heal.''   The American people elected a 50-50 Senate, a closely divided House,  and a President who preached moderation. He promised that his whole  soul was committed to uniting our people. Many hoped his administration  would reflect that promise, but the first 100 days have left much to be  desired.   Over a few short months, the Biden administration seems to have given  up on selling actual unity in favor of catnip for their liberal base,  covered with a hefty coat of false advertising.   That is how the so-called American Rescue Plan, a grab-bag spending  bill that directed less than 10 percent to vaccines and pandemic  healthcare, was marketed as a COVID-19 relief measure. In actuality, it  sent sums of money to State governments whose revenues had already  rebounded and declared war on the formerly bipartisan consensus that  welfare spending should actually be linked to work.   Or take H.R. 1, the sweeping effort by Democrats to mount a partisan  takeover of all 50 States' voting laws, along with the Federal Election  Commission for good measure. After a Republican won the White House in  2016, this was billed as a massive overhaul for a broken democracy. Now  a nearly identical plan is, instead, being marketed as a modest dose of  preventive maintenance. It is still the same takeover it has always  been.   And now we have the American Jobs Plan, another multitrillion-dollar  smorgasbord of liberal social engineering that would decimate entire  industries and spend only a small fraction on roads and bridges. It is  being sold as a serious effort to rebuild our Nation's infrastructure.  It is pretty brazen misdirection.   At both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, Democrats have chosen to live in  an alternate universe where both the campaign promises they made and  the mandate the American people delivered were actually completely  different than what happened right here on planet Earth.   Unfortunately, the real-life effects of this false advertising  campaign have come thick and fast: pain and uncertainty at home and  dwindling leverage and virtue-signaling abroad   First came mixed messages on the status of the pandemic. Existing  vaccine distribution efforts surpassed President Biden's supposedly  ambitious daily target on the day he was sworn in.   When their own top health officials accidentally let slip the hard  science on school reopenings, the administration bowed to Big Labor and  walked back their comments.   And the President continues to issue directives that are strangely  out of step with the science, like his big announcement several weeks  ago that, if citizens behave themselves--behave themselves--he would  actually permit them to enjoy small outdoor gatherings on July 4th that  the CDC guidance already said would be safe right now.   Then there is the environmental policy. On day one, President Biden  rushed to cancel a pipeline project that would have employed thousands  of Americans and freeze permitting for more safe, reliable domestic  energy. He also announced an urgent return to an Obama-era deal that  has proven unable to curb the signatories' carbon emissions and  unnecessary for the United States to reduce our own.   Why would he do that? Because the far left demanded it. In fact, the  most radical liberals in Congress have taken credit for the input of  their Green New Deal manifesto over this President's new agenda.   Meanwhile, Democrats have decidedly avoided taking ownership of the  results of their own campaign rhetoric on immigration. Reckless mixed  messaging has come home to roost in the form of a humanitarian and  security crisis on our southern border. Soaring numbers of migrants are  arriving, some wearing Biden campaign shirts, convinced, as one put it,  that ``Biden promised us that everything was going to change.'' Among  them are record numbers of unaccompanied children, cramped into  overflow facilities, who have become the tragic face of this story. Yet  through it all, the White House's foremost concern seems to have been  to avoid calling this what it is: a crisis.   And while broken immigration policy threatens security at our  borders, a dangerously misguided foreign policy threatens our safety  and standing overseas. Years of carefully assembled multilateral  sanctions had created an economic straitjacket around Iran's terrorist  state. But in its haste to turn the clocks back to the Obama era,  President Biden's negotiators have offered to give up massive portions  of this leverage just to get Iran back to a failed nuclear deal.   Further east, American forces have been ordered to make a hasty,  total withdrawal from Afghanistan; to leave coalition partners and  vulnerable Afghans high and dry, especially women and girls; to pave  the way for Taliban rule; and to enable an al-Qaida resurgence that  could again threaten our homeland.   And while national security experts are nearly unanimous in urging  the administration to focus on competition with Russia and China, the  White House has proposed to cut defense spending after inflation and  put our Armed Forces on the back foot--ignoring the facts, passing the  buck, and squandering leverage.   This is not what the American people bargained for, and they know it  doesn't have to be this way. Past Presidents and Congresses have found  ways to work effectively to make lasting and bipartisan progress on  important issues. For example, when we have crafted smart policies to  improve actual infrastructure, big bipartisan majorities have signed  on.   Just last year, when we worked across the aisle on targeted rescue  packages to help American families weather a once-in-a-century  pandemic, not one--not one--of the five bills we passed last year  earned fewer than 90 votes right here in the Senate. This year, the  story has been different.   Behind President Biden's familiar face, it is like the most radical  Washington Democrats have been handed the keys, and they are trying to  speed as far left as they can possibly go before American voters ask  for the car back.   But it is not too late. This White House can shake off its daydreams  of a sweeping socialist legacy that will never happen in the United  States. They can recommit to solving our Nation's actual problems, to  fostering consensus instead of deepening our divide.   That is what the American people want and what they deserve, not an  administration that chooses to govern like it owes everything-- everything--to the radical left.    Madam President, our country recently took a long- overdue step toward honoring the courageous Americans who served in the  First World War. Earlier this month and more than a century after the  formal end of the war, the United States raised the flag over the newly  constructed National World War I Memorial. I am immensely proud of this  tribute in our Nation's Capital to the 4.7 million Americans who  sacrificed to preserve our way of life. Today, I would like give  special thanks to a remarkable Kentuckian who became a driving force  bringing this memorial into existence. My longtime friend Terry Hamby,  from Cadiz, is the chair of the World War I Centennial Commission. He  deserves our sincere gratitude for his leadership and perseverance in  giving every American the opportunity to honor our heroes.  [[Page S2285]]    Through the generations, the Hamby family has proudly answered the  Nation's call to military service. The noble tradition dates back to  the Civil War and Terry's great-grandfather's service in the Union  Army. His grandfather and father each courageously defended our country  in a global war. Next, it was Terry's turn to wear the uniform as part  of a Naval Air Wing in Vietnam. He later joined the U.S. Army Reserves  until he retired following 26 years of military service. Terry's son  continued the family legacy by joining the Navy in the Persian Gulf.  Service and sacrifice are personal to this family.   Even when Terry retired from the military, he continued working to  support the world's greatest fighting force. His hometown in Christian  County, KY, neighbors Fort Campbell, one of our country's premier  military installations. Terry founded a contracting firm to provide  services to the Defense Department and the men and women stationed at  the base nearby, including the famed ``Screaming Eagles'' of the 101st  Airborne Division.   To know Terry is to instantly like him. I have had the privilege to  call him a friend for many years, and I have always been impressed by  his love of our country and respect for the men and women who protect  it. So when I had the chance through my leadership position to appoint  a member of the World War I Centennial Commission, Terry was the clear  choice. His family's tradition of service, as well as his civilian  contributions to the military, gave him an important perspective for  this project. I also knew the commission would benefit from Terry's  business mindset as it raised funds to advance its mission. His  colleagues on the commission quickly recognized his talents too. They  elected Terry to chair the organization and this monumental effort to  honor America's heroes.   The memorial found a fitting home only blocks from the White House in  a park named for General John J. Pershing, the commander of the  American Expeditionary Forces on the Western Front of World War I.  After an international competition with more than 300 entries, the  commission selected a design titled ``The Weight of Sacrifice.'' Terry  and his wife, Carolyn, recently took Elaine and me on a tour of the  memorial. One of its most striking features is an approximately 60 foot  long depiction of ``A Soldier's Journey.'' Dozens of overlapping  figures tell the stories of warriors leaving home for the battlefield  before their ultimate triumph. It is emotional piece that shows these  soldiers' toil and sacrifice to build a lasting peace.   Even now that the memorial is officially open to the public, Terry  hasn't stopped working to honor the World War I generation. He has  turned his attention to gathering support for recognition of female  telephone operators called the ``Hello Girls.'' Other than nurses,  these were the first women in uniform who played a consequential role  in our country's wartime effort. With Terry working for their cause, I  am confident these selfless women will receive the national attention  and gratitude they deserve.   So I encourage my Senate colleagues and all Americans to plan a visit  to the World War I Memorial. It is a striking commemoration of our  brave men and women in uniform, those who supported them, and the  Americans who never came home. Terry Hamby has earned our praise for  his unyielding drive to build this tribute. Without him, the United  States would still be waiting for a proper memorial to these heroes.  Kentucky and our country are proud of the mark he has left on our  Nation's Capital.                            ____________________
