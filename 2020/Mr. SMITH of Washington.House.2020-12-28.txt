 Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate  only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Thornberry), the ranking member of the committee, pending which I yield  myself such time as I may consume.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and insert extraneous material on the veto message  of the President of the United States to the bill H.R. 6395.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise to strongly urge Members to uphold what we did in this Chamber  just a couple weeks ago and what the Senate did, as well; and that is  we passed an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill, with roughly 80 percent of  the vote in both the Senate and the House.   The legislative branch made it absolutely clear that we support this  piece of legislation, and as the gentleman from Texas just noted, we  support it with very good reason.   It is enormously important to give our troops the support that they  need to carry out the job that we all are asking them to do. That is, I  think, one of our minimum obligations as Members of Congress. And this  bill reflects that.   This bill is the process of a lengthy effort involving Members of  both Chambers, both parties, that have come together and put together  an incredibly strong piece of legislation. That is why it passed so  overwhelmingly just a couple weeks ago. And nothing has changed.  Nothing has changed. The bill is exactly the same and every little bit  as important.   Now, the President has the right to veto it, but I think we, as  Members of  [[Page H9161]]  the legislative body, have to look at the reason behind that. Was it  because of something in the bill?   Pieces of legislation come through here all the time, and we  occasionally miss something. The President finds out, and we say: Gosh,  I didn't know that. That is not what happened here.    I really want Members to understand the President vetoed this because  of something that isn't in the bill and was never going to be in the  bill, something totally unrelated to national security and something  that we were not going to do in any event.   There is literally no reason to veto this bill for the reasons that  the President did and certainly no reason for us not to uphold what we  did in passing this bill. This is really important that we exercise our  legislative prerogative.   There are all kinds of crucial provisions in this bill, but I will  just point to one, and that is the one that Mr. Thornberry mentioned  earlier, to give you an idea of why it is important that the  legislative branch do its job in exercising oversight of the Department  of Defense in providing national security policy, and that is the cyber  issue.   Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Langevin, chairman of the  subcommittee that deals with this issue, and Ranking Member Stefanik,  they have worked together to really put together an incredible package  to try to better address these very cyber issues that we are now  facing. That is what we do in this legislation, and it is not always  exciting, but it is incredibly important to meet our obligation to our  troops and to the national security of this country.   It is enormously important that we pass this bill. We did it once.  Let's just do it one more time, and then we can all go home for the  year. We can be done, and we can be proud of what we have accomplished.   I urge Members to vote in favor of this bill to do what we did just a  couple weeks ago. Show the country that the legislative branch can  still do its job.   I will close on one note, which we make a lot of times.                                time  1700    This is the most bipartisan committee in Congress. That is not an  easy thing to achieve. We have a lot of things that we passionately  disagree about in this body, and we should, but on the Armed Services  bill, we manage to come together. It is not always easy, but we get it  done.   I think it is enormously important that we let the country know that  that process hasn't died. We put together a product, a bipartisan,  bicameral product that has gotten an overwhelming number of votes.   Let's show the American public that the legislative process works at  least a little bit better than sometimes they think it does, that we  can get our job done and, in this case, get our job done for the men  and women who put their lives on the line to protect this country. We  owe them nothing less than that.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
