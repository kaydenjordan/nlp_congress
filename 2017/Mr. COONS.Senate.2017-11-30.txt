 Will the Senator yield for a question?    Will the Senator yield for a question?    I wanted to briefly ask my friend, the Senator from  Florida, if I correctly heard, as I believe I just did, that an entire  range of economic groups--advocates from the National Association of  Manufacturers, Business Roundtable, even Grover Norquist--as recently  as the last Presidential campaign believed that a corporate rate cut  from 35 to 25 would be significantly stimulative, would accomplish the  goals of improving growth; is that roughly what you were just saying?
