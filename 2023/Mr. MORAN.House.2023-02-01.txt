 Mr. Speaker, as Biden's border crisis continues to cost  American taxpayers billions per year, I rise today to introduce my  first bill, the Border Security Investment Act.   This legislation will target the millions of immigrants who entered  our country illegally, use American resources, don't pay taxes, and  then proceed to send money back to foreign countries.   More specifically, it would place a 37 percent user-based transaction  fee on remittance transfers made through money service businesses where  the remittance originates in the U.S. and is sent back to one of the  top five nations of origin for illegal immigration.   Revenue collected is placed under two trusts; both for border  security. In the first trust the funds will be used by the Federal  Government specifically for salaries and wages for Customs and Border  Protection, physical barriers, and detection technology only. The  second trust is allocated to reimburse States for their expenditures  for border security enforcement measures.   Any unspent money under this legislation from these two funds  exceeding $50 billion is allocated to the Treasury solely for the  purpose of reducing national debt.   While there is still plenty of work to be done, this bill is a first  step in securing our border, keeping our communities safe, and working  toward a balanced budget.                            ____________________
