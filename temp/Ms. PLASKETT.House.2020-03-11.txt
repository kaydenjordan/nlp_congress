 Madam Speaker, as we approach April, you will begin to  hear more and more about the Census.   The Census is the most important count of people in our country,  responsible for allocating nearly $800 billion in Federal funding, and  it takes place only once every decade.   By standing up and being counted in the 2020 Census, Madam Speaker,  you are ensuring that your State or territory has access to the funding  it needs for police and fire departments, healthcare, roads, and many  other vital programs.   Madam Speaker, you don't need to be an inventor, a doctor, or even a  Member of Congress to shape the future of your community. By being in  the 2020 Census, you will help inform funding for local school programs  and roads in our community.   We all count and we all get to shape our future by participating in  the 2020 Census. You can make a difference in our community this year  and respond to the 2020 Census, whether online, by mail, or by phone.   Be counted this April.                            ____________________
