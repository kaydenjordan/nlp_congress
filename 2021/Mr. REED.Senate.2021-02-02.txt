 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I am reintroducing the Stop Subsidizing  Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act with Senators Blumenthal,  Whitehouse, Merkley, Baldwin, Warren, Van Hellene, and Brown. This  legislation fully closes a loophole that has allowed publicly traded  corporations to deduct the cost of multimillion-dollar bonuses from  their corporate tax bills. U.S. taxpayers shouldn't continue to have to  subsidize these massive bonuses.   Under section 162(m) of the tax code as amended by the 2017 Trump tax  law (TCJA), when a publicly traded corporation calculates its taxable  income, it is generally permitted to deduct compensation costs from its  revenues, with limits up to $1 million for some of the firm's most  senior executives.   In the 115th Congress, the TCJA got rid of some of the prior 162(m)  loopholes by taking provisions from my Stop Subsidizing Multimillion  Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act, including removing the exemption for  performance-based compensation, which previously permitted compensation  deductions above $1 million when executives met performance benchmarks,   While these steps were a start, even more should have been done, such  as applying section 162(m) to all employees of publicly traded  corporations so that all compensation is subject to a deductibility cap  of $1 million. This was the only provision from my Stop Subsidizing  Multimillion Dollar Corporate Bonuses Act from the l15th Congress that  was not incorporated into the Trump tax law.   Partially closing these 162(m) loopholes saved taxpayers $9.2 billion  according to the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), but last Congress,  the JCT estimated that fully closing the loophole along the lines of  the legislation I am reintroducing today would save taxpayers an  additional $27 billion dollars.   Under this legislation, publicly traded corporations would still be  permitted to pay their executives as much as they desire, but  compensation above and beyond $1 million would no longer be subsidized  through our tax code. This is simply a matter of fairness, ensuring  that corporations--and not hardworking taxpayers who face their own  challenges in this economy--are paying for the multi-million dollar  bonuses corporations have decided to dole out to their senior  executives. Instead of showering corporations with additional benefits  they certainly don't need, we should be doing everything within our  power to help more families, who are barely surviving, make it to the  other side of this public health emergency.   I thank Public Citizen, the Institute for Policy Studies--Global  Economy Project, Americans for Financial Reform, the AFL-CIO,  International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and MIT Professor Simon Johnson  for their support. I urge our colleagues to join us in cosponsoring  this legislation and pressing for its passage.                                  ______                                         By Ms. HIRONO (for herself, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Bennet, Mr.          Blumenthal, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Casey, Ms. Cortez Masto, Ms.          Duckworth, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr.          Markey, Mr. Merkley, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Ossoff, Ms. Rosen, Ms.          Smith, Mr. Van Hollen, Mr. Warner, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr.          Wyden):   S. 181.
