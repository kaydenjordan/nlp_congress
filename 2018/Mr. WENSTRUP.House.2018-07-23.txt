 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to share the benefits of tax  reform.   Earlier this year, President Trump visited the Sheffer Corporation, a  small manufacturing company in my district that pledged $1,000 bonuses  to all 126 of its employees as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   During the President's visit to Cincinnati, he invited Sheffer  employees on stage to talk about their plans for their new bonuses.   A mom in the audience said she is using her bonus as spare cash for  when she sends her children off to college this year. As any parent of  a college student knows, the expenses add up and every dollar makes a  difference.   The President also invited a young man to the stage to speak. He  wants to start a family, and said that this money will go towards a  home to raise his children.   While the recent law is an enormous step forward, we must and will  continue to move forward to implement smart policies that give  Americans the freedom to compete, innovate, and seize the opportunity  to carve out a better future for themselves and their families.                            ____________________
