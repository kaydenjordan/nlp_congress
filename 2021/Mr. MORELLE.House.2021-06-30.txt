 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in support of a simple  concept: A consumer's right to repair the goods they own.   For too long, large corporations have used embedded technology to  prevent small business owners and everyday Americans from repairing  their own equipment. This needs to change, which is why I am proud to  introduce the Fair Repair Act to put power back in the hands of  consumers where it belongs.   The concept behind this is as old as it is simple: if you own  something, you own all of it, including the right to repair it.  [[Page H3316]]    This pandemic has magnified our need to be self-reliant and have the  ability to repair our own devices, especially when large retailers are  forced to shutter.   My bill will guarantee consumers and small businesses that right by  requiring manufacturers to make diagnostic repair information, parts,  and tools readily available rather than forcing individuals to go to  an original equipment manufacturer.    This commonsense legislation will help make technology repairs more  accessible and affordable for items from cell phones to laptops to farm  equipment.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to working with my colleagues to bring  this legislation to the floor and finally give individuals the autonomy  they deserve.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my dear friend and fellow member  of the Rules Committee, Mr. DeSaulnier, for giving me the opportunity  to speak for just a moment.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the rule that would allow us to  consider the INVEST in America Act.   This long-overdue infrastructure legislation will prioritize direct  Federal investments in roads, bridges, transit, and rail, while also  leveraging modern and innovative approaches to reliable and sustainable  infrastructure investments.   As we continue our recovery from the pandemic and seek to revitalize  our communities, we know an essential part of that is strengthening our  local infrastructure. Modernizing our infrastructure helps to meet  growing mobility demands, create jobs, and grow the economy, all while  creating stronger and more interconnected communities.   I am thrilled that this legislative package lays the groundwork for  major investments across the country while also supporting  opportunities to strengthen our local infrastructure through targeted  priorities.   My own community of Rochester, New York, will only grow stronger  through the enactment of the INVEST in America Act, and I look forward  to seeing this critical legislation passed into law.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to have helped move this transformative  bill forward, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  vote in favor of the rule and the underlying bill. And I call on our  partners in the Senate to join us in making this investment a reality.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio for his tireless work on this  effort, and my dear friend, Mr. DeSaulnier, for yielding time.
