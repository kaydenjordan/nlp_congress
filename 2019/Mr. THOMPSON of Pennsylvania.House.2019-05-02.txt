 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  May as National Foster Care Month. This is a time to recognize more  than 400,000 foster youth in America. During this month, we renew our  commitment to ensuring that every child has a safe and loving home.   Mr. Speaker, I am a member of the Congressional Caucus on Foster  Youth, and to this day, I have a foster brother as part of my family. I  know firsthand how a loving, supportive home can make all of the  difference in a young person's life.   More than 200,000 children enter the foster care system every year,  which translates to a child entering care every 2 minutes.   All children deserve a safe, loving, and permanent home. We have a  responsibility to continue to create policies that will improve  outcomes in the overall well-being of foster youth and their families.   I thank every foster parent, volunteer, and mentor who works to make  sure that the needs of our children are not only being met, but giving  them the opportunity to thrive in a loving home.                            ____________________
