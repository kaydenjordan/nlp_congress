 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  celebrate the Bellefonte Little House. This celebration has been  delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the community is finally  able to gather and celebrate 60 years of a Girl Scout meeting house as  well as a space for the community to gather.   The Bellefonte Little House is one of the last remaining Girl Scout  Little Houses in the Nation. At one point in time, Little Houses  existed around the country, in cities and towns, serving as a physical  meeting place and a home for Scouting.   The Bellefonte Little House provides a gathering place for troops in  the Bellefonte area, and the local organization supports approximately  20 troops in the school districts of Bellefonte area, Bald Eagle area,  and Penns Valley.   In addition to celebrating 60 years of the Little House, the local  Girl Scout organization is celebrating and honoring volunteer efforts  of many who mentor and guide girls in kindergarten through grade 12 in  their Girl Scout journey.   Madam Speaker, as someone who is actively involved in Scouting, I  recognize the importance of gathering places like the Bellefonte Little  House to our communities.   Congratulations to the Bellefonte Little House and all those who  continue to volunteer in the Girl Scout community on this remarkable  anniversary. May this continue to be a place for Scouts to gather for  years to come.                            ____________________
