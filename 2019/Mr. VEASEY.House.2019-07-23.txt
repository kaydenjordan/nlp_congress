 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life of  Pastor R. L. Rogers, a good friend, a man of God, a community leader,  father, and husband. Pastor Rogers transitioned from labor to eternal  reward this past weekend.   Pastor Rogers attended high school in south Texas before graduating  from the Southwestern Theological Seminary in Fort Worth. Pastor  Roger's time in seminary started his journey in faith and helping our  community that expanded over five decades.   Pastor Rogers was the founder and the only pastor for 53 years of the  Harvey Avenue Baptist Church, a place of worship that is a cornerstone  in the Fort Worth community. That was only the beginning of his  accomplishments.   Pastor Rogers was also an avid volunteer for important causes like  mentoring the youth in our community and serving as a chaplain at the  Tarrant County Jail. He was also a nationally known evangelist, a  pastor, and Gospel preacher.   Pastor Rogers was a pillar in the community spending his 53 years  teaching and encouraging the word of God. It was an honor to know  Pastor Rogers and just to know the legacy that he has left behind in  our community.   My heartfelt condolences to his family. We thank you for sharing  Pastor Rogers with us in the Fort Worth community for so long.                            ____________________
