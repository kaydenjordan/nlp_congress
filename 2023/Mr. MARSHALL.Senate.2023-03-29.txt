 Madam President, I rise today in support of the joint  resolution for congressional disapproval striking down the President's  revised definitions of waters of the United States.   As a fifth-generation farmer, I know how hard-working Kansas farmers  work daily to protect our environment and conserve our precious  resources. Farmers serve as our land's original and best stewards. We  all want to leave this world cleaner, healthier, and safer than we  found it.   Since coming to Congress, we have worked hard alongside our farmers  and ranchers and rural landowners to ensure our waters become cleaner  and healthier and, at the same time, protect our land and water from  aggressive government overreach.   This includes working with the previous administration to roll back  purposeless, ``one size fits all'' Federal WOTUS regulations that drive  up the cost of doing business for Kansans and are detrimental to their  ability to care for their crops and livestock.   As Kansas farmers, ranchers, businesses, and even municipalities know  all too well, the Obama-era definition of WOTUS in 2015 dramatically  expanded the Federal Government's reach with minimal improvements in  water quality.   Today, this White House's reckless expansion of the WOTUS rule only  adds more regulations, more redtape, and costs to everyday life in  Kansas. This level of Federal overreach is harmful and ill-advised.   It is important to note that my colleagues and I requested the  administration suspend the rulemaking until the Supreme Court completes  its consideration of Sackett v. EPA. This would allow Congress to craft  a lawful, predictable, and reasonable rule.   But this request has fallen on deaf ears. Moving forward with this  rule is the administration's attempt to revive the Obama-era WOTUS  rule, which was rightfully blocked in nearly half of the United States  due to litigation in courts across the country.   Now, as the saying goes, history repeats itself, and a Federal judge  recently blocked the implementation of the brandnew rule in Texas and  Idaho.   Now, back home, my farmers are already bracing for the impact. In  fact, I heard from one organization that said:         Farmers and ranchers should not have to hire a team of       lawyers and consultants to determine how we can farm our       land.    And I agree.   Kansan after Kansan I have met with on this issue has told me this  administration didn't consider their input on the new WOTUS definition,  further proof of the clear disconnect between DC bureaucrats and the  hard-working farmers and ranchers who provide our Nation's food.   Agriculture, oil and gas, energy, the housing industry, road  builders, bridge builders, construction workers, and municipalities  have all voiced their disapproval of the rule and the costs of the  negative impacts that its adoption will have on American industries and  consumers.   It seems this administration only listens to radical  environmentalists rather than the hard-working, pragmatic voices of the  people who love the land which has been handed down from generation to  generation, just like in my family--people who care every bit about the  environment as any soul on Capitol Hill does. These are the same people  who feed, fuel, and clothe America.   This rule is the Biden administration's attempt to federalize our  waters  [[Page S1021]]  and take control of our private land and leave our producers with more  questions than answers, more costs than gain.   In fact--get this--mitigation costs related to the current White  House WOTUS may cost farmers and ranchers over $100,000 per acre. The  value of this land itself might be $1,000, $2,000, maybe $5,000 an  acre, but mitigation will cost us $100,000 per acre.   Let me ask a couple of simple questions: Should a dry creek that only  has water run through it during a rain be a waters of the United  States?   Should playas in western Kansas be a waters of the United States?   Should ditches draining into a dry creek bed be a waters of the  United States?   Should water trickling off the terraces my grandfathers built 50-some  years ago to prevent soil erosion and the tall lush grassy waterway  that is home to pheasants and quail and turkey and deer and rabbits-- should this be a waters of the United States?   Under President Biden's rule, the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineer  will attempt to answer these questions on a case-by-case basis, meaning  that the answer and the cost might change every time. That is no way to  do business.   In a time of economic uncertainty, this unpredictable, ambiguous  rulemaking will amplify the efforts of inflation felt by ag producers  and American consumers. No American industry would be safe from the  impending rising costs, all while the Biden WOTUS rule fails to achieve  the goal of improved water quality.   The regulated community spent the better part of the last decade  trying to operate under several different definitions of ``waters of  the United States.'' We cannot allow the Biden administration to take  us backward yet again.   Farmers and other ag producers are the original stewards of the land,  and we all have a special interest in protecting the quality of our  Nation's waters. Consistent and clear guidelines and regulations are  key to such protections. We cannot keep moving the proverbial goalpost.   The Biden administration's failure to understand the ramifications of  this is alarming. As Members of Congress, we must ensure agricultural  producers and other stakeholders have the regulatory certainty to take  care of our Nation's land and water resources, the lands and waters  that we love, the lands and waters that we are leaving to the next  generation--to my children and to my grandchildren.   I, therefore, urge the support of the Joint Resolution for  Congressional Disapproval, striking down this administration's revised  definition of ``waters of the United States.''   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.J. Res 7, a  bill that will immediately terminate the COVID-19 national emergency  declaration.   Over a year ago, this body voted to end the COVID national emergency  declaration. Actually, it has been a year and 26 days ago. Then, it was  just 5 months ago that this body voted for a second time to end the  COVID national emergency with an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 61 to  37. Today, we hope the third time is the charm, that the rumors are  true that the President will finally sign this legislation and end this  chapter of physical, mental, and financial strife seldom seen in our  world's modern history.   Emergency powers are given to the executive branch so the Commander  in Chief has the flexibility to quickly act in the event of a crisis.  That declaration was appropriate in 2020, but now it is time for the  proper constitutional checks and balances to be restored. It is time to  end any and all authoritarian control and unilateral spending decisions  without congressional consent.   Many, many Kansans have asked me, ``What's the holdup, why is the  White House waiting to end this emergency declaration?'' Well, sadly, I  have to tell them, because the emergency declaration has allowed the  administration to justify increased spending and push harmful mandates.   Under this national emergency, we have seen a massive increase in  government spending across the board. This spending over the past 2  years has resulted in the highest level of inflation Americans have  encountered in 40 years. The gross Federal debt has increased by $3.7  trillion--$3.7 trillion--since this President took office, an increase  of 12 percent. We sadly watched as interest rate hikes, combined with  skyrocketing inflation, have raised the amount of debt many Americans  hold and made almost everything cost more.   On top of all of this, the authority granted to the President by this  emergency declaration has been the direct justification for the White  House's efforts to cancel as much as $20,000 in debt for Federal  student loan holders--a plan that would cost taxpayers an additional  $400 billion.   We all understand what it means when politicians say: Never let a  good crisis go to waste. But it doesn't stop there. With the national  emergency in place, the administration also moved to mandate vaccines  for private companies with 100 or more employees. If not halted by the  courts, this massive Federal overreach would have forced millions of  Americans to choose between the jab or their job.   Next, the White House tried to force healthcare workers, Federal  employees, contractors, and even members of our military to receive the  vaccine against their choice. Thankfully, these were also halted by the  courts across the country.   These are the consequences of a 3-year emergency declaration. Take a  good look at the decisions made under this prolonged, supersized  government rule, and you will quickly understand why our Founding  Fathers warned of this type of abuse of power when they authored the  Constitution and made it a top priority to keep each branch of  government in line with systems of checks and balances.   I come to the floor today hopefully for one last vote on terminating  this declaration.   Is the emergency indeed over? Well, our President himself said as  much in a September 2022 interview on CBS's ``60 Minutes.'' I quote the  President's direct words: ``The pandemic is over.''   Enough is enough. It is time to end this chapter and let Americans  get back to their own lives.   I ask my colleagues to join me again in a strong bipartisan fashion  in sending this resolution to the President's desk to end the national  emergency declaration for COVID-19 once and for all today.   I yield the floor.                             Vote on H.J. Res. 7    The joint resolution was ordered to a third reading and was read the  third time.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
