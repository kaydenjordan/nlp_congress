 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding  time. And I want to thank Ranking Member Walz and Chairman Roe for  their work on the issue of accountability and their tireless commitment  to our Nation's veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Department of Veterans  Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017.   Throughout the debate over accountability at the Department of  Veterans Affairs, I have advocated for legislation that holds VA  employees accountable, without violating their constitutional right to  due process.                                time  1500    This legislation strikes that balance far better than previous  accountability proposals. This compromise respects current grievance  procedures, maintains existing due process protections, and improves  the appeals process by requiring managers to present employees with all  of the evidence before they move on a disciplinary action.   Today we are voting to strengthen whistleblower protections. This  bill codifies the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower  Protection, and it mandates that its Director is a Senate-confirmed  position instead of a political appointee. It also offers training on  how to handle whistleblowers correctly, which will encourage employees  to come forward if they witness misconduct.   Do I have concerns about this bill? Absolutely, I do. This is not the  accountability legislation that I would have written. We must always  remember that a third of VA employees are veterans themselves, and they  deserve the workplace protections afforded to them in the Constitution  as well as the respect of this Congress. But my concerns pale in  comparison to the serious and numerous institutional issues raised by  accountability bills previously advanced in the House.   Passing this bill today will accomplish several important objectives:   We will fulfill the repeated requests from veteran service  organizations and the VA itself for a stronger accountability system.   We will support the VA's continuing effort to create a culture of  excellence.   We will provide veterans greater confidence that the VA is prepared  to meet their needs.   Finally, by passing this bill, we can shift our focus from who is  fired from the VA to who is hired at the VA.   As I stand here today, there are nearly 50,000 vacant jobs at the VA.  This is a significant and urgent challenge. Ultimately, the success of  the Department of Veterans Affairs will depend on recruiting, training,  and retaining the highest quality talent available.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs  Committee to streamlining the hiring process and ensuring that the VA  has the staff and expertise it needs to provide veterans the care and  support they have earned.   I applaud the Senate for forging this compromise, and I again want to  recognize Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz for their important  work.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.
