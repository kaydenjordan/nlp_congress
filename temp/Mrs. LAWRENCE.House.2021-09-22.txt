 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the FY22 NDAA.   As the co-chair of the Democratic Women's Caucus, I am proud to see  two of my amendments, 238 and 239, included as part of this en bloc.   These amendments would help us understand the factors that influence  women servicemembers to stay in or leave the military as well as to  take action to improve mental health outcomes for pregnant veterans.   Unfortunately, pregnant veterans have been found to be  disproportionately impacted by mental health disorders and must be  given adequate support to prevent childbirth complications.   This language would encourage the VA to support the use of doulas for  expectant mothers and increase access for doulas for pregnant veterans.   This is a time we must come together in our support of the growing  number of women in the military.
