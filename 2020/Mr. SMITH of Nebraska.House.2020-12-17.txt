 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Steve  Nelson, a corn and soybean farmer from Axtell, Nebraska, on his  retirement as president of the Nebraska Farm Bureau.   The Nebraska Farm Bureau is a leading voice for Nebraska agriculture  producers because of its hardworking members and leaders like Steve,  whose hard work and leadership have made the Third District of Nebraska  the top-producing agriculture district in America.   Steve has served as president through the completion of two farm  bills, ensuring the needs of Nebraska producers are reflected and met  throughout the process--no small task.   I have appreciated Steve's persistence in the face of many challenges  we have faced in Nebraska recently, especially the historic floods,  storms, the irrigation tunnel collapse, and certainly other  uncertainties. Those affected, though, were always able to turn to the  Nebraska Farm Bureau.   I would like to thank Steve for his great work, and I wish him well  as he continues as a farm producer at home and advocating for our  State's farmers and ranchers.                            ____________________
