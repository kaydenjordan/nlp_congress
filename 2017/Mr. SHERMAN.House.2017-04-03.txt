 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 92.   I am the chief Democratic cosponsor and the gentleman from South  Carolina is the sponsor of this resolution condemning North Korea's  development of multiple intercontinental ballistic missiles, and for  other purposes. It should be noted that this resolution now has 120  bipartisan cosponsors, including the ranking member and chairman of the  committee, the chairman of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee, and  myself as ranking member of the Asia and the Pacific Subcommittee.   This resolution is necessary at a time when the regime of Kim Jong-un  is as belligerent as ever. His intentions are clear. He is conducting  intermediate and intercontinental ballistic missile tests and nuclear  tests for the purpose of being in a position to intimidate the United  States and the rest of the world. Just this month the regime in  Pyongyang released a fake propaganda video showing the imagined  destruction of a U.S. aircraft carrier by its forces.   In addition to the five nuclear weapons North Korea has already  tested, Kim Jong-un continues to test ballistic missiles, including  submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and is moving toward  intercontinental ballistic missiles. These missiles have as one of  their chief purposes to be able to reach the continental United States  and particularly the Pacific Coast of the United States.   We used to have the luxury of saying that North Korea just wants  attention; they just want this or that concession. But now their goal  is clear. It is to threaten hundreds of millions of Americans. It is  clear that North Korea is testing missiles and bombs for the purpose of  developing warheads that can do just that.   The resolution we are considering today, H. Res. 92, condemns North  Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile tests, calls for the United  States to apply economic sanctions on North Korea, and calls on China  to pressure North Korean leaders to cease their provocative behavior,  abandon and dismantle their nuclear missile program, and it calls upon  China to curtail, or at least threaten to curtail, their economic  support of Pyongyang.   President Xi is coming to the United States. He will meet with our  President in Florida. And I hope that the recent comments that we are  going to handle this issue on our own are not what comes out of  Florida, because, instead, we must demand that China pressure North  Korea.  [[Page H2607]]    According to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission,  China accounts for over 90 percent of North Korea's foreign trade and  approximately 95 percent of its foreign direct investment. Beijing  needs to know that there are serious challenges to its relationship  with the United States if it does not assist us in this effort.  Officials in Beijing cannot assume that their companies will always  have access to the United States market.   There are those who say it is unthinkable to link our trading  relationship with China to its position on North Korea. I believe it is  unthinkable for us not to use all the tools at our disposal to try to  prevent the least predictable leader in the world--and perhaps the  least stable--from having the capacity to hit the United States  mainland with intercontinental nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I will add a comment to the upcoming visit of President  Xi to Florida and President Trump's statement in advance of that: Well,  we don't need China to get tough on North Korea.   The fact is, President Trump has not given us a plan that would put  effective pressure on Pyongyang that does not involve China. There is  no magic road to dealing with the North Korean threat that does not go  through Beijing.   My fear is that, in the guise of being the tough guy who doesn't need  China's help, in fact, President Trump is preparing to fail to get  China's help in controlling North Korea, is preparing to be weak in  dealing with China and to weakly accept their unwillingness to act, and  then disguising it all in some machismo statement of strength: Oh, we  don't need China.   We do need China. There is no plan to control North Korea that  doesn't involve China. Macho statements are not an excuse for real  strength in dealing with President Xi.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would simply say that I commend the gentleman from  South Carolina, Mr. Wilson, for authoring this resolution, which has  secured the support of 120 bipartisan cosponsors, including the chair  and ranking member of the full committee and the chair and, in my case,  ranking member of the relevant subcommittee.   I, again, call on my colleagues to join me in supporting H. Res. 92,  condemning North Korea's development of multiple intercontinental  ballistic missiles, and for other purposes.   We need an official congressional condemnation of North Korea's  continued ballistic missile testing and its related nuclear program. We  need to ramp up sanctions on North Korea, while applying pressure to  China, hopefully later this week, for being North Korea's economic  lifeline.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 54 and  commend its authors and cosponsors.   With the new administration of President Macri, I think that there  will be a deepening relationship between the United States and  Argentina, and this resolution recognizes that. It also encourages the  Argentine Government to continue to investigate and prosecute those  responsible for the 1994 bombing of the Argentine-Israeli Mutual  Association, located then in the center of Buenos Aires, and the death  of Argentine special prosecutor Alberto Nisman, who died mysteriously 1  day before he was going to submit a report to the Argentine Congress  regarding that 1994 bombing.   I think it is apparent that that 1994 bombing was conducted by Iran  in cooperation with Hezbollah, and we all want to encourage the  Argentine Government to find out whether there was foul play in the  death of Alberto Nisman and, if so, who was behind what has all the  hallmarks of an assassination designed to prevent that report from  being submitted to the Argentine people and Congress.   I commend the authors of this legislation. I urge its adoption.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 479, the North Korea State  Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act of 2017.   I want to associate myself with the chairman's remarks. He summarizes  well the need to adopt this legislation. I want to commend Judge Poe  for introducing this legislation. I was very pleased to introduce it  alongside him.   We earlier considered H. Res. 92. In that debate, we discussed the  nuclear and missile program of North Korea. Now it is time to focus for  the next few minutes on their use of terrorism.   We need to consider North Korea's obvious state support of terrorism  around the world. North Korea has engaged in kidnappings, targeted  assassination, cyber attacks, and support to terrorist organizations in  various regions.   North Korea was designated as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1988,  but it was taken off that list in 2008, following commitments by  Pyongyang to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. We dismantled their  status as a state sponsor of terrorism. North Korea certainly has not  dismantled its nuclear program.   Kim Jong-un has only increased the pace of his nuclear ballistic  missile testing and is nowhere near dismantling that program. So now it  is time to focus again on North Korea's terrorist actions around the  world.   We can go back several decades when the North Korean Government  kidnapped Japanese civilians--some because of their talents in making  movies; most in order to force them to  [[Page H2613]]  teach Japanese etiquette to North Korean spies.   Now, you may say: Well, that was decades ago. Why are we designating  them as a state sponsor of terrorism now?   Well, those people still have not been released to this day. And, if  they have passed on, their bodies have not been returned to their  families.   We are all aware of how North Korea engaged in cyberterrorism against  Sony Pictures because Sony Pictures made a movie they didn't like.   We know that, just a month or so ago, a North Korean agent killed Kim  Jong-nam, the half brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. This act  of terrorism took place at the airport in Malaysia and was summarized  by the chairman.   In the case of Chaim Kaplan v. Hezbollah, a United States District  Court found that, in 2014, North Korea materially supported terrorist  attacks by Hezbollah, a designated foreign terrorist organization.   And finally--and this list is incomplete but last on my list--is  North Korea's assistance in helping Assad try to develop nuclear  weapons of his own. We are aware that Assad's nuclear facility, built  almost entirely based on North Korean technology and using North Korean  equipment, was destroyed in 2007. Assad has murdered hundreds of  thousands, it looks like the figure is now half a million, of his own  citizens. Imagine the destruction Assad would have engaged in had he  been able to develop nuclear weapons with the support and technology of  North Korea.   H.R. 479, the North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act,  expresses the sense of Congress that North Korea likely meets the  criteria to be designated as a state sponsor of terrorism and requires  a determination by the Secretary of State within 90 days as to whether  or not North Korea meets that standard.   This bill is an important step in confronting North Korea's support  for terrorism around the world and for the danger that it poses to the  civilized world.   Mr. Speaker, I call upon my colleagues to join me in supporting this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1800     Mr. Speaker, I would note that this bill passed our  committee without any opposition.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would note that this bill passed our  committee without any opposition.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In closing, this bill is an important step in confronting North  Korea's support for terrorism around the world. We should not stand  idle while North  [[Page H2614]]  Korea engages in terrorism, including kidnappings, target  assassinations, cyber attacks, support for other terrorist  organizations, and nuclear proliferation.   I again call upon my colleagues to join me in passing this bill, H.R.  479, the North Korea State Sponsor of Terrorism Designation Act of  2017.   I note that this bill passed our full committee without a single  opponent.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
