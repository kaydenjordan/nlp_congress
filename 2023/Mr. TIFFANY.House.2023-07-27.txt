 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Alicia Monson  of Amery, Wisconsin, on breaking the American record in the 5,000  meters this past weekend. She ran 5,000 meters in 14 minutes and 19.45  seconds, beating the previous record by 4.47 seconds.   This is not the only record she has set this year. In February, she  broke the North American indoor record in the 3,000 meters, and in  March she set a new North American 10,000 meters record.   Alicia has been representing Wisconsin's Seventh District since she  was in high school running cross country and track. She went on to  become one of the top runners for the University of Wisconsin--Madison  before becoming an Olympian in 2021.   Mr. Speaker, I can't wait to see what record she breaks next. Keep  making Wisconsin proud, Alicia.                            ____________________
