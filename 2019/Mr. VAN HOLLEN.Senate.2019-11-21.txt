 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, right now, as we are gathered here on  the Senate floor, the Senate and House conferees are in the process of  trying to negotiate a final agreement on the NDAA. That is the National  Defense Authorization Act. One of the key issues in the final  discussions over the NDAA involves a provision designed to protect the  integrity of American elections against outside interference from  Russia or any other adversary. It is a provision based on bipartisan  legislation that Senator Rubio and I introduced over a year ago to  deter Russian interference in a future American election. The  legislation is called the DETER Act, the idea being: Let's deter Russia  from attacking our democracy.   I believe it would be grossly negligent for the conferees to the  National Defense Authorization Act to bring back to the House and the  Senate a measure that does not include a provision to defend our  democracy from Russian interference. The entire Senate must share that  sentiment because we unanimously voted on a resolution just a short  time ago to include such a provision in the National Defense  Authorization Act.   I have in my hand a copy of that resolution. It was S. Res. 330. It  instructs the managers on the part of the Senate on bill S. 1790--that  is the National Defense Authorization Bill--to require certain measures  to address Federal election interference by foreign governments.   It goes on to instruct the Senate conferees to require the  appropriate official of the executive branch, after each Federal  election, to promptly submit to Congress a determination as to whether  the Government of the Russian Federation, or any other foreign  government, has interfered in such election and a detailed assessment  of any such interference that identifies, to the maximum extent  practicable, the individuals responsible for the interference and to  promptly impose sanctions on any foreign government that has been  determined to have interfered in a Federal election, including  specified individuals and entities within the territory of the  government.   That is what the U.S. Senate unanimously voted on to instruct our  conferees to the National Defense Authorization Act negotiations. What  I just read is the guts of the idea in the bipartisan DETER Act that  Senator Rubio and I have introduced.   Here is what we know. We know that Russia interfered in the 2016  election. How do we know that? It was the unanimous verdict of the  entire U.S. intelligence community, including the leaders of  intelligence agencies appointed by this President. It was also the  bipartisan verdict of the Senate Intelligence Committee--a committee  that painstakingly documented the fact that election systems in all 50  States were targeted by Russia in 2016--to different degrees but in all  50 States. In fact, that Senate Intelligence Committee report was the  first public--the first public--acknowledgement of how extensive the  Russian efforts were to interfere in the 2016 elections.   We know the Russians did this in 2016. We know that Vladimir Putin  sees interfering in our elections as a way to divide us against one  another. We know that Vladimir Putin fears democratic forms of  government and wants to undermine public confidence in those  democracies.   How do you undermine public confidence in those democracies? By  attacking the election process so that people doubt the validity of the  outcome of an election. When that happens, if the public loses faith in  the outcome of our elections, then we have really undermined the  legitimacy and confidence in our democratic system. That was 2016.   The measure I am talking about doesn't relate to 2016. It relates to  the future. Here is what our intelligence community just informed the  country about within the last few weeks. I am holding in my hand a  statement that was released on November 5, just a few weeks ago. It is  from Attorney General William Barr, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper,  Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan, Acting Director  of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, FBI Director Chris Wray, U.S.  Cyber Command Commander and NSA Director GEN Paul Nakasone, CISA  Director Christopher Krebs. Here is what they said 2 weeks ago.         Our adversaries want to undermine our democratic       institutions, influence public sentiment and affect       government policies. Russia, China, Iran, and other foreign       malicious actors all will seek to interfere in the voting       process or influence voter perceptions. This document is not       about the past; this document is about the future, about       our future elections, including the 2020 election, which       is now less than a year away.    We know in 2016 the Russians attacked our electoral process. We now  have all of the leaders of Federal Government intelligence agencies and  law enforcement telling us they predict Russia will do it again in  2020.   We have a Russian missile headed for our democracy, and the question  for all of us is, What are we going to do about it? What are we going  to do to protect our democracy and the legitimacy of our electoral  system?   First of all, we should harden our election system. We should make it  more difficult for Russia to break into our voter registration files.  Certainly, we should make it more difficult for them to break into  voting machines. We should also make sure we build more defenses to  prevent the Government of Russia from using social media to mislead and  confuse voters. We should do all those things to better defend our  election system, but I am of the view--and a lot of folks who have  followed Russia and Vladimir Putin for a long time--that the best  defense is a good offense. We can harden our systems here, but that  doesn't stop Russia and Vladimir Putin from trying to break into our  election systems. It doesn't prevent Russia and Putin from trying to  use our social media to influence our voters. The only way to prevent  them from trying is to let them know in advance that there is a big  price to pay if they get caught.   Right now it is cost-free for Russia to interfere in our elections.  In fact, it is a net benefit because Putin divides us. Putin leads  voters and citizens to question the legitimacy of our democracy. He is  winning in this current calculus. We need to change his calculus. We  need to make it clear that the cost of interfering in our elections far  outweighs these benefits that he is gaining.   That is what the DETER Act is all about. What the DETER Act does is  set up a process whereby, if we catch Russia interfering in our future  elections, including the 2020 elections, there will be automatic,  swift, and very stiff economic penalties--not penalties on a couple of  oligarchs but penalties that will hurt his economy, penalties on his  banking sector, and penalties on part of his energy sector. If we adopt  this provision, then we are making it very clear in advance to Vladimir  Putin that if he interferes, and we catch him, there is a very stiff  price to pay.   The whole purpose of this act is not to impose sanctions; it is to  avoid sanctions by making it clear upfront what the costs will be if  Putin interferes in our elections. The whole point is to use the threat  of automatic, swift, and tough sanctions to discourage and deter the  Russians from interfering in the first place.   I haven't heard anybody provide one substantive argument for why we  should not do this to protect our democracy. I can think of no more  important place to include this provision than the national defense  authorization bill because if the national defense authorization bill  is not about defending our democracy, I am not sure what it is about.   So the question is, Why are we still debating this in the conference  committee for the national defense authorization bill? I can't figure  out who is opposing it other than the fact that somebody is. I was told  it was the Republican Senate leader and the chairman of the Senate  Banking Committee who are opposing this provision. If that is the case,  they really need to come to the Senate floor and explain this because  the Senate unanimously instructed Senate conferees to adopt just  [[Page S6745]]  such a provision--unanimously. That includes the Senate majority leader  and the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. They didn't object.  Yet somehow now we are in the middle of a conference committee on  defending our country, which I thought meant also defending our  democracy, and we have these folks who don't want their fingerprints on  it who are somehow trying to defeat this measure.   Here is what I have to say. If this provision is not included in the  NDAA, it would be grossly negligent because we know from our own  intelligence community 2 weeks ago that the Russians are coming to  attack our elections again, and we are going to pass a defense  authorization bill where we sit on our hands and do nothing about it?  That would be outrageous.   This measure needs to be in the NDAA bill. I will tell you, if it is  not, I am going to be here on this floor regularly asking for unanimous  consent to bring this bill up for a vote. I am going to have the  majority leader have to come down here regularly, or whomever he wants  to designate, to object to a unanimous consent agreement for a  provision to defend our elections.   I hope it is included in the Defense authorization bill. That is the  place it should be. If it is not, I will be down here every day, and  the clock will be ticking down day by day for the 2020 election, our  Intelligence Committee will continue to warn us about Russian  interference, and I am going to want to hear in public--in public--why  some of our colleagues don't want to take action to defend the  integrity of our democracy; why they want to allow Putin to have his  way cost-free. That is a question I will be asking every day. I hope I  don't have to ask it every day. I hope we do what the Senate already  instructed our conferees to do, which is to include it in the National  Defense Authorization Act.   I yield back my time.
