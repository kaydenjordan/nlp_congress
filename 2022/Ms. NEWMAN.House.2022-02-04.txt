 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate how the America  COMPETES Act will empower manufacturing workers and small businesses on  Chicago's southwest side and suburbs.   For too long, America's supply chain has relied on countries like  China to bring us critical goods and services. And who has suffered? Of  course, it is not the CEOs who ship jobs overseas. It is America's  factory workers, small businesses, and local manufacturers.   This bill is for them. And that is exactly why I have introduced  amendments to this bill to boost American jobs and strengthen the  supply chain with new workforce development programs.   Let's support American workers, invest in American businesses, and  let's create millions of American jobs.   By passing the America COMPETES Act, we will do just that.                            ____________________
