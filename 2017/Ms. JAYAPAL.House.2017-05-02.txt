 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill,  H.R. 1180, the Working Families Flexibility Act.   There is nothing in this bill that provides any flexibility to  working families. In fact, Mr. Speaker, we all seem to have names for  this bill, but mine is that it should be called the employer  flexibility act because that is what it really does. It gives employers  flexibility to not pay for time worked. It is a smoke-and-mirrors  promise that ultimately helps employers but hurts workers.   The choice between overtime pay and comp time is a false choice for  workers, Mr. Speaker. We know what happens in the reality of the  workplace. The vague promise of time off in the future is often never  realized, and many hourly workers may feel compelled by employers to  forfeit their overtime pay to accept comp time.   Workers do need more flexibility, more money, and more control over  their lives, but this bill is a cruel joke on workers. At a time when  America's working families are strapped for both time and money, this  bill takes time away from families and offers them less money in every  paycheck. In the end, there is no guarantee that employers will let  their employees take the time off when they need it.   Here is the story of Camilla, from my home State of Washington. This  is what she wrote:         It was my first job out of college. I was given comp time       in lieu of overtime pay. I worked so much overtime that, in       just over 6 months' time, I had accrued 2 weeks of comp       time. When I scheduled my time off, I was told I could not       take the time off, as I had not worked there for a full       year. I had already purchased airfare. I ended up quitting       my job.    zMr. Speaker, I urge our Republican majority to go back to the table  and return with legislation that provides real flexibility to American  families: raise the minimum wage; ensure that hourly workers have paid  sick leave; make sure that families don't suffer from pay  discrimination. That is what the American people expect us to be  working on. Not false choices in the name of flexibility.
