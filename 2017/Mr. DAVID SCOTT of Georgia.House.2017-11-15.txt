 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  Neal. I appreciate this time.   Madam Speaker, my heart is heavy tonight, and it is heavy because we  are faced with the absolute, most dangerous, destructive, and deceitful  tax reform bill in the history of this Congress. Now, let me tell you  why.   On the other side, you have heard Member after Member on the other  side get up and tell you: This is going to get a tax cut, we are going  to give the wealthy a tax cut, we are going to give the corporations a  tax cut. But none of them have told you, or the American people, how  they are going to pay for it.   And the great tragedy is, the most deceitful thing about what my  colleagues on the other side are doing to the American people is they  are doing these tax cuts for the wealthy, the tax cuts for the  corporations, on the backs of the poor, the middle class. Let me tell  you why.   They won't tell you that they are paying for this tax cut because  on--$1.5 trillion that they will cut from Medicaid, from Medicare.   Madam Speaker, Medicaid is for the children. There are literally  millions of children on there.   You heard one of my colleagues go down. We are losing 20 veterans to  suicide every single day. No mention of that. Yet they will cut the  veterans program designed to help them to pay for this tax cut.   Not to mention the student loan interest rate. Young people across  this country, you need to rise up. Seniors, we need to rise up.    We need to rise up and stand and fight  for this country. Let our minds go back to 1770, in Boston, at the  harbor, when they threw the tea over that founded the foundation of our  great democracy.   I ask the American people to stand up and help us Democrats defeat  this dangerous bill.
