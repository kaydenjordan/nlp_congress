 Mr. Speaker, this week, the President of the United  States turned his back on our Nation's immigrant heritage. With the  repeal of DACA, he is creating havoc in the lives of 800,000 young  Americans.   Yes, Mr. President, these are Americans. The average DREAMer came  here at age 6. Some of them were so young when they arrived that they  do not remember the journey. Many of them only speak English. And now  you are going to deport them? That is how you make America great again?   The President of the United States told DREAMers that they ``did not  have reason to worry'' because he has a ``big heart.''   This decision belies that claim. It shows the heartless, small- minded, and fear-driven politics driving this administration's  policies.   Where the President has failed to show leadership, Members of  Congress, from both parties, must step up. Mr. Speaker, bring to the  floor today legislation to codify DACA. Let's have an up-or-down vote  on the Dream Act and protect these young people. They are the face of  America.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The Chair  will remind Members to direct their remarks to the Chair.                            ____________________
