 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 130) condemning the continued violation of rights  and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong by the People's Republic of  China and the Government of the Hong Kong special administrative  region.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 130         Whereas despite international condemnation, the Government       of the People's Republic of China (``PRC'') continues to       disregard its international legal obligations under the Joint       Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great       Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the       People's Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong       (``Joint Declaration''), in which the PRC committed that--        (1) Hong Kong would enjoy a high degree of autonomy;        (2) for at least 50 years the ``social and economic systems       in Hong Kong'' would remain unchanged; and        (3) the personal rights and freedoms of the people of Hong       Kong would be protected by law;         Whereas, as part of its continued efforts to undermine the       established rights of the Hong Kong people, the PRC National       People's Congress Standing Committee (``Standing Committee'')       passed and imposed upon Hong Kong oppressive and       intentionally vague national security legislation on June 30,       2020, that grants Beijing sweeping powers to punish acts of       ``separating the country, subverting state power, and       organizing terroristic activities'';        Whereas the legislative process by which the Standing       Committee imposed the national security law on Hong Kong       bypassed Hong Kong's local government in a potential       violation of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special       Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China       (``Basic Law''), and involved unusual secrecy, as       demonstrated by the fact that the legislation was only the       second law since 2008 that the Standing Committee has passed       without releasing a draft for public comment;        Whereas, on July 30, 2020, election officials of the Hong       Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) disqualified       twelve pro-democracy candidates from participating in the       September 6 Legislative Council elections, which were       subsequently postponed for a year until September 5, 2021, by       citing the public health risk of holding elections during the       COVID-19 pandemic;        Whereas, on July 31, 2020, in an attempt to assert       extraterritorial jurisdiction, the HKSAR Government announced       indictments of and arrest warrants for six Hong Kong       activists living overseas, including United States citizen       Samuel Chu, for alleged violations of the national security       law;        Whereas, on November 11, 2020, the HKSAR Government removed       four lawmakers from office for allegedly violating the law       after the Standing Committee passed additional legislation       barring those who promoted or supported Hong Kong       independence and refused to acknowledge PRC sovereignty over       Hong Kong, or otherwise violates the national security law,       from running for or serving in the Legislative Council;        Whereas, on December 2, 2020, pro-democracy activists       Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow, and Ivan Lam were sentenced to       prison for participating in 2019 protests;        Whereas ten of the twelve Hong Kong residents (also known       as ``the Hong Kong 12'') who sought to flee by boat from Hong       Kong to Taiwan on August 23, 2020, were taken to mainland       China and sentenced on December 30, 2020, to prison terms       ranging from seven months to three years for illegal border       crossing;        Whereas, on December 31, 2020, Hong Kong's highest court       revoked bail for Jimmy Lai Chee-Ying, a pro-democracy figure       and publisher, who was charged on December 12 with colluding       with foreign forces and endangering national security under       the national security legislation;        Whereas, on January 4, 2021, the Departments of Justice in       Henan and Sichuan province threatened to revoke the licenses       of two lawyers hired to help the Hong Kong 12; and        Whereas, on January 5, 2021, the Hong Kong Police Force       arrested more than fifty opposition figures, including pro-      democracy officials, activists, and an American lawyer, for       their involvement in an informal July 2020 primary to select       candidates for the general election originally scheduled for       September 2020, despite other political parties having held       similar primaries without retribution: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) condemns the actions taken by the Government of the       People's Republic of China (``PRC'') and the Government of       the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (``HKSAR''),       including the adoption and implementation of national       security legislation for Hong Kong through irregular       procedures, that violate the rights and freedoms of the       people of Hong Kong that are guaranteed by the Joint       Declaration and its implementing document, the Basic Law;        (2) reaffirms its support for the people of Hong Kong, who       face grave threats to their rights and freedoms;        (3) calls on the governments of the PRC and HKSAR to--        (A) respect and uphold--        (i) commitments made to the international community and the       people of Hong Kong under the Joint Declaration; and        (ii) the judicial independence of the Hong Kong legal       system; and        (B) release pro-democracy activists and politicians       arrested under the national security law; and        (4) encourages the President, the Secretary of State, and       the Secretary of the Treasury to coordinate with allies and       partners and continue United States efforts to respond to       developments in Hong Kong, including by--        (A) providing protection for Hong Kong residents who fear       persecution;        (B) supporting those who may seek to file a case before the       International Court of Justice to hold the Government of the       PRC accountable for violating its binding legal commitments       under the Joint Declaration;        (C) encouraging allies and partner countries to instruct,       as appropriate, their respective representatives to the       United Nations to use their voice, vote, and influence to       press for the appointment of a United Nations special mandate       holder to monitor and report on human rights developments in       Hong Kong;        (D) ensuring the private sector, particularly United States       companies with economic interests in Hong Kong, is aware of       risks the national security legislation poses to the security       of United States citizens and to the medium and long-term       interest of United States businesses in Hong Kong;        (E) continuing to implement sanctions authorities,       especially authorities recently enacted to address actions       undermining the rights and freedoms of the Hong Kong people       such as the Hong Kong Autonomy Act (Public Law 116-149) and       the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 (Public       Law 116-76), with respect to officials of the Chinese       Communist Party, the Government of the PRC, or the Government       of the HKSAR who are responsible for undermining such rights       and freedoms; and        (F) coordinating with allies and partners to ensure that       such implementation of sanctions is multilateral.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 130.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 130, Condemning  Continued Violation of Rights and Freedoms of the People of Hong Kong  by People's Republic of China and Government of Hong Kong Special  Administrative Region.   I have introduced this resolution to demonstrate this body's already  strong, bipartisan support for the people of Hong Kong.   The situation in Hong Kong has been alarming for several years now.  We have witnessed the degradation of civil liberties and human rights  as the PRC continues to disregard its international legal obligations  under the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration.   For months, in 2019, the people of Hong Kong peacefully took to the  streets in historic numbers to preserve their democracy and demand  their rights and freedoms. Unfortunately,  [[Page H1928]]  these peaceful protesters were met with excessive force by the police  and the further imposition of restrictions on expression and assembly.  Thousands have been beaten, injured, and illegally detained in  violation of due process.   Rather than listen to the demands of the majority of Hong Kongers,  the Chinese Government blatantly bypassed Hong Kong's local government  and imposed a sweeping national security law on Hong Kong and its  people with very little accountability or transparency. The vague,  overly broad measures this security law put in place are little more  than a thinly veiled attempt to erode Hong Kong's autonomy and restrict  the space for peaceful expression. It steals from the people of Hong  Kong the ability to exercise the freedoms of speech and association and  creates an environment of fear around the expression of any political  sentiment.   It is no surprise that since the passage of this law, political  censorship has spiked significantly and Hong Kong officials have become  increasingly brazen in undermining democratic norms, such as  disqualifying pro-democracy candidates from participating in the  legislative council elections and removing democratically elected  lawmakers from office.   Hong Kong authorities have also used the national security law to  target and silence pro-democracy activists at home and abroad. They  have even issued arrest warrants for activists living overseas,  including a U.S. citizen, for alleged violations of national security  law.   Hundreds of pro-democracy figures and activists have been arrested or  sentenced to prison, including Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow, Ivan Lam, the  ``Hong Kong 12,'' and Jimmy Lai Chee-Ying, while others await a further  crackdown. But the resolve of the people of Hong Kong has not wavered,  and neither will the resolve of the people of the United States, our  allies, and this body.   Mr. Speaker, see, democracy is the cornerstone of the work we do in  the people's House. We must support the people of Hong Kong as they  fight for the rights and freedoms promised to them under the Basic Law.  With the passage of this resolution, the House reaffirms its continued  support for the people of Hong Kong.   We stand by activists who continue to come forward in their cause for  democracy and human rights at great risk to themselves, their families,  and their future. But by passing this resolution, the House sends a  strong, bipartisan message demanding that the Chinese and Hong Kong  Governments respect the will of the people of Hong Kong.   We will continue to push for democracy and respect for human rights  in Hong Kong. We will continue to demonstrate that we stand in  solidarity with the pro-democracy figures and activists who have made  tremendous sacrifices for their city and for their core human rights.   This is an important resolution, and I support it and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the very distinguished Speaker of the House of  Representatives.                                time  1730     I continue to reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers if the gentleman  from Texas is ready to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first, let me thank the ranking member for making sure  we make a unified, strong, bipartisan statement, and all of my  colleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee on both sides of the aisle  because H. Res. 130 sends a strong and unequivocal message: The United  States stands firmly in support of the people of Hong Kong and the  rights, freedoms, and autonomy they are promised in the joint  declaration and basic law.   This resolution signals that the House's support of the people of  Hong Kong and their struggle for democracy shall not waiver and shall  remain firm and resolute.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that all of my colleagues will join Ranking  Member McCaul and myself in supporting this resolution, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1251) to support United States international cyber  diplomacy, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1251         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.         (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Cyber       Diplomacy Act of 2021''.        (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act       is as follows:  Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. Sec. 2. Findings. Sec. 3. Definitions. Sec. 4. United states international cyberspace policy. Sec. 5. Department of state responsibilities. Sec. 6. International cyberspace executive arrangements. Sec. 7. International strategy for cyberspace. Sec. 8. Annual country reports on human rights practices. Sec. 9. Gao report on cyber diplomacy. Sec. 10. Sense of congress on cybersecurity sanctions against north                korea and cybersecurity legislation in vietnam.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress makes the following findings:        (1) The stated goal of the United States International       Strategy for Cyberspace, launched on May 16, 2011, is to       ``work internationally to promote an open, interoperable,       secure, and reliable information and communications       infrastructure that supports international trade and       commerce, strengthens international security, and fosters       free expression and innovation . . . in which norms of       responsible behavior guide states' actions, sustain       partnerships, and support the rule of law in cyberspace''.        (2) In its June 24, 2013, report, the Group of Governmental       Experts on Developments in the Field of Information and       Telecommunications in the Context of International Security       (referred to in this section as ``GGE''), established by the       United Nations General Assembly, concluded that ``State       sovereignty and the international norms and principles that       flow from it apply to States' conduct of [information and       communications technology] ICT-related activities and to       their jurisdiction over ICT infrastructure with their       territory''.        (3) In January 2015, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia,       Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan proposed a troubling international       code of conduct for information security, which could be used       as a pretext for restricting political dissent, and includes       ``curbing the dissemination of information that incites       terrorism, separatism or extremism or that inflames hatred on       ethnic, racial or religious grounds''.        (4) In its July 22, 2015, consensus report, GGE found that       ``norms of responsible State behavior can reduce risks to       international peace, security and stability''.        (5) On September 25, 2015, the United States and China       announced a commitment that neither country's government       ``will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of       intellectual property, including trade secrets or other       confidential business information, with the intent of       providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial       sectors''.        (6) At the Antalya Summit on November 15 and 16, 2015, the       Group of 20 Leaders' communique--        (A) affirmed the applicability of international law to       state behavior in cyberspace;        (B) called on states to refrain from cyber-enabled theft of       intellectual property for commercial gain; and        (C) endorsed the view that all states should abide by norms       of responsible behavior.        (7) The March 2016 Department of State International       Cyberspace Policy Strategy noted that ``the Department of       State anticipates a continued increase and expansion of our       cyber-focused diplomatic efforts for the foreseeable       future''.        (8) On December 1, 2016, the Commission on Enhancing       National Cybersecurity, which was established within the       Department of Commerce by Executive Order 13718 (81 Fed. Reg.       7441), recommended that ``the President should appoint an       Ambassador for Cybersecurity to lead U.S. engagement with the       international community on cybersecurity strategies,       standards, and practices''.        (9) On April 11, 2017, the 2017 Group of 7 Declaration on       Responsible States Behavior in Cyberspace--        (A) recognized ``the urgent necessity of increased       international cooperation to promote security and stability       in cyberspace'';        (B) expressed commitment to ``promoting a strategic       framework for conflict prevention, cooperation and stability       in cyberspace, consisting of the recognition of the       applicability of existing international law to State behavior       in cyberspace, the promotion of voluntary, non-binding norms       of responsible State behavior during peacetime, and the       development and the implementation of practical cyber       confidence building measures (CBMs) between States''; and        (C) reaffirmed that ``the same rights that people have       offline must also be protected online''.        (10) In testimony before the Select Committee on       Intelligence of the Senate on May 11, 2017, Director of       National Intelligence Daniel R. Coats identified six cyber       threat actors, including--        (A) Russia, for ``efforts to influence the 2016 U.S.       election'';        (B) China, for ``actively targeting the U.S. Government,       its allies, and U.S. companies for cyber espionage'';        (C) Iran, for ``leverag[ing] cyber espionage, propaganda,       and attacks to support its security priorities, influence       events and foreign perceptions, and counter threats'';        (D) North Korea, for ``previously conduct[ing] cyber-      attacks against U.S. commercial entities--specifically, Sony       Pictures Entertainment in 2014'';        (E) terrorists, who ``use the Internet to organize,       recruit, spread propaganda, raise funds, collect       intelligence, inspire action by followers, and coordinate       operations''; and        (F) criminals, who ``are also developing and using       sophisticated cyber tools for a variety of purposes including       theft, extortion, and facilitation of other criminal       activities''.        (11) On May 11, 2017, President Donald J. Trump issued       Executive Order 13800 (82 Fed. Reg. 22391), entitled       ``Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and       Infrastructure'', which--        (A) designates the Secretary of State to lead an       interagency effort to develop an engagement strategy for       international cooperation in cybersecurity; and        (B) notes that ``the United States is especially dependent       on a globally secure and resilient internet and must work       with allies and other partners toward maintaining . . . the       policy of the executive branch to promote an open,       interoperable, reliable, and secure internet that fosters       efficiency, innovation, communication, and economic       prosperity, while respecting privacy and guarding against       disruption, fraud, and theft''.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the Committee       on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on       Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.        (2) Information and communications technology; ict.--The       terms ``information and communications technology'' and       ``ICT'' include hardware, software, and other products or       services primarily intended to fulfill or enable the function       of information processing and communication by electronic       means, including transmission and display, including via the       Internet.        (3) Executive agency.--The term ``Executive agency'' has       the meaning given the term in section 105 of title 5, United       States Code.       SEC. 4. UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL CYBERSPACE POLICY.         (a) In General.--It is the policy of the United States to       work internationally to  [[Page H1931]]       promote an open, interoperable, reliable, unfettered, and       secure Internet governed by the multi-stakeholder model,       which--        (1) promotes human rights, democracy, and rule of law,       including freedom of expression, innovation, communication,       and economic prosperity; and        (2) respects privacy and guards against deception, fraud,       and theft.        (b) Implementation.--In implementing the policy described       in subsection (a), the President, in consultation with       outside actors, including private sector companies,       nongovernmental organizations, security researchers, and       other relevant stakeholders, in the conduct of bilateral and       multilateral relations, shall pursue the following       objectives:        (1) Clarifying the applicability of international laws and       norms to the use of ICT.        (2) Reducing and limiting the risk of escalation and       retaliation in cyberspace, damage to critical infrastructure,       and other malicious cyber activity that impairs the use and       operation of critical infrastructure that provides services       to the public.        (3) Cooperating with like-minded democratic countries that       share common values and cyberspace policies with the United       States, including respect for human rights, democracy, and       the rule of law, to advance such values and policies       internationally.

It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the President should designate all entities that       knowingly engage in significant activities undermining       cybersecurity through the use of computer networks or systems       against foreign persons, governments, or other entities on       behalf of the Government of North Korea, consistent with       section 209(b) of the North Korea Sanctions and Policy       Enhancement Act of 2016 (22 U.S.C. 9229(b));        (2) the cybersecurity law approved by the National Assembly       of Vietnam on June 12, 2018--        (A) may not be consistent with international trade       standards; and        (B) may endanger the privacy of citizens of Vietnam; and        (3) the Government of Vietnam should work with the United       States and other countries to ensure that such law meets all       relevant international standards.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material on H.R. 1251, as amended.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1251, the Cyber  Diplomacy Act of 2021, as amended, by my good friend and the Foreign  Affairs Committee's ranking member, Mr. McCaul. I thank him for his  work on this important bill.   This Congress, the House Foreign Affairs Committee aims to prioritize  efforts to reassert American leadership on a variety of issues. I can't  think of any issue that is more timely than ensuring American  leadership is prepared to confront the growing national security  challenge in cyberspace.   The U.S. is increasingly under attack online by foreign actors,  whether it is the recent SolarWinds hack or other attempted cyber  intrusions on critical American infrastructure.   Now more than ever, we need a senior cyber diplomat who can support  American efforts to keep the internet open, interoperable, reliable,  and secure.   To demonstrate how seriously the United States takes these issues, it  is vital that we strengthen the State Department's tools to address the  challenges in cyberspace to American foreign policy. The State  Department needs a bureau capable and focused on tackling the growing  global challenges of cybersecurity, the digital economy, and internet  freedom in order to be  [[Page H1934]]  better prepared to advance America's international interests on cyber  policy.   Madam Speaker, that is exactly what this Cyber Diplomacy Act will do.  Our allies and adversaries are prioritizing international engagement to  set the standards and rules that govern how the internet is structured  and used. The United States has always been a leader in this space, and  now is the time to redouble our efforts to ensure we remain an  influential voice in establishing the rules of the road.   It is critical that the United States prioritize our diplomatic  efforts in this area and work with our partners and allies to establish  agreed-upon norms. To keep the internet open and accessible, we must  push back against countries that will exploit the internet to pilfer  our intellectual property and hack into our country's most sensitive  information, and which seek to derail international norms.   This bill is critical to supporting these key priorities. It  authorizes the Bureau of International Cyberspace Policy to lead the  State Department's cyber diplomatic efforts, including on issues  relating to international cybersecurity, internet access and freedom,  and international cyber threats, including countering terrorists' use  of cyberspace.   This bill also directs the President to devise a strategy related to  U.S. engagement with foreign governments on international norms with  respect to responsible state behavior in cyberspace.   I am also pleased that in authorizing this office, we make clear  bipartisan congressional intent that the Bureau of International  Cyberspace Policy is comprised of a diverse workforce. Like the rest of  our national security policy establishments, we know that ensuring a  diverse and inclusive workforce improves the effectiveness of national  security activities, and this bill makes that intent very clear.   Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support this critical and, again,  bipartisan measure that will reassert American leadership on this  important issue, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 1251, the Cyber Diplomacy Act, introduced by my  friend and the ranking member, Mr. McCaul, is bipartisan legislation  that is essential to America's national security and positioning our  country to meet the current and future threats in cyberspace head-on.   This bill will give the State Department the tools it needs to  further secure peace, stability, and economic prosperity for the United  States in the cyber realm now and in the future.   Again, I hope all of my colleagues join both Mr. McCaul and myself in  supporting this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1800     Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 124) supporting the people of Belarus and their  democratic aspirations and condemning the election rigging and  subsequent violent  [[Page H1935]]  crackdowns on peaceful protesters by the illegitimate Lukashenka  regime, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 124         Whereas the Republic of Belarus held a presidential       election on August 9, 2020, that was neither free nor fair;        Whereas the presidential election took place without       appropriate observation from local independent groups and       international delegations;        Whereas since the presidential election, Belarusians have       demonstrated their strong desire and commitment to a       democratic future by organizing peaceful protests in Minsk       and across the country;        Whereas Belarusian civil society, led by Sviatlana       Tsikhanouskaya, has called for the resignation of Alyaksandr       Lukashenka, the peaceful transition of power, the       organization of new, free, and fair elections and the release       of all political prisoners;        Whereas Belarusian opposition leaders have faced       intimidation, harassment, and detention, including direct       threats leading to the forced exile of Sviatlana       Tsikhanouskaya in Lithuania as well as the kidnapping and       imprisonment of Maria Kalesnikava and other opposition       leaders;        Whereas in the months since the election, Belarusian       authorities have arbitrarily detained and brutally assaulted       tens of thousands of peaceful protesters, journalists, and       opposition figures, of which hundreds remain in detention;        Whereas human rights groups have documented hundreds of       horrific accounts of torture, including sexual violence and       rape, along with other instances ill-treatment and excessive       force used against detainees arrested for peaceful protest;        Whereas on August 13 and 14, 2020, relatives of detainees       held in the infamous ``Akrestsina'' detention facility in       Minsk recorded the sounds of ``incessant beatings which were       clearly audible in the street, and numerous voices screaming       out in agony with some begging for mercy'';        Whereas thousands of Belarusians have fled to neighboring       countries seeking political asylum;        Whereas independent journalists and the free media have       faced intimidation, violence, mass arrests and prosecution,       with many foreign journalists being stripped of their       accreditation;        Whereas Katsyaryna Andreyeva and Darya Chultsovatwo, two       journalists who work for Belsat, an independent Polish-based       satellite television station aimed at Belarus, have each been       sentenced to two years in prison simply for reporting live       from a rally in Minsk in November 2020;        Whereas Ihar Losik, a popular Belarusian blogger on       Telegram, went on a hunger strike for 6 weeks to protest the       politically-motivated charges that he helped organize riots       after the fraudulent presidential election;        Whereas member states of the Organization for Security and       Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), of which the United States and       Belarus are members, invoked paragraph 12 of the 1991 Moscow       Document of the Conference on the Human Dimension of the OSCE       (Moscow Mechanism) to establish a mission of experts to       review allegations of human rights violations;        Whereas the OSCE Rapporteur's Report under the Moscow       Mechanism on Alleged Human Rights Violations related to the       presidential elections of August 9, 2020, in Belarus,       published November 5, 2020, concluded that there was       ``overwhelming evidence that the presidential elections of 9       August 2020 [had] been falsified and that massive and       systematic human rights violations [had] been committed by       the Belarusian security forces in response to peaceful       demonstrations and protests'';        Whereas women have played a leading role in peaceful       demonstrations across the country, protesting the police       brutality and mass detentions by wearing red and white,       carrying flowers, and forming ``solidarity chains'';        Whereas the information technology (IT) industry in Belarus       has played a prominent role in the democratic movement by       demanding an end to violent oppression, as well as creating       safe platforms for demonstrators to communicate and track       people who have been detained or went missing during mass       detentions;        Whereas Belarusian authorities have continually disrupted       internet channels in an attempt to limit communication among       demonstrators and targeted lead technology companies and       their employees advocating for democracy;        Whereas Belarusian state-owned television channels have       encouraged violence against peaceful demonstrators;        Whereas a recent survey of IT specialists found that 15       percent of IT specialists working in Belarus have already       relocated to neighboring countries, and over 40 percent of IT       specialists no longer want to work in Belarus, resulting in a       devastating loss of talent for Belarus, possibly permanently       damaging the Belarusian technology industry along with the       Belarusian economy;        Whereas hundreds of former law enforcement officers in       Belarus who have defected in defiance of illegal orders to       commit human rights violations and cover up crimes against       civilians and those who have assisted law enforcement       officers in defecting have faced harassment, financial       penalties, arrest, detention, and other punitive measures;        Whereas several peaceful demonstrators have died as a       result of police violence, including 31-year-old Roman       Bondrenko who was violently beaten by plainclothes police       officers and, as a result, suffered head injuries that       resulted in his death;        Whereas Belarusian universities continue to expel students       and dismiss educators and researchers for participating in       peaceful protests;        Whereas child protective services have threatened multiple       civic activists with termination of parental rights for       bringing minor children to peaceful protests;        Whereas factory workers at state-owned enterprises have       been continuously harassed for trying to organize independent       trade unions and have been forced to sign political letters       opposing sanctions by the European Union under threat of       termination of their employment;        Whereas a transatlantic community of legislators has       emerged in support of uplifting the democratic aspirations of       the Belarusian people;        Whereas international advocacy, including by co-host       Latvia, succeeded in preventing the illegitimate Government       of Belarus from hosting the 2021 Ice Hockey World       Championship;        Whereas the United States, the European Union, the United       Kingdom, and Canada have enacted sanctions and other punitive       measures against dozens of individuals and entities found       responsible for the perpetration of violence against peaceful       demonstrators, opposition members, and journalists, among       others;        Whereas Alyaksandr Lukashenka continues to undermine the       sovereignty and independence of Belarus through efforts to       integrate Belarus into a so-called ``Union States'' under the       control of Russia;        Whereas the House of Representatives passed the Belarus       Democracy, Human Rights, and Sovereignty Act of 2020 with       unanimous consent, sending a clear message of overwhelming,       bipartisan support for the democratic movement in Belarus;        Whereas the Belarus Democracy, Human Rights, and       Sovereignty Act of 2020 was signed into law via the fiscal       year 2021 omnibus spending bill, expanding the President's       authority to impose sanctions related to Belarus, including       on Russian individuals who have undermined Belarus'       sovereignty, as well as authorizing increased assistance to       counter internet censorship and surveillance technology,       support women advocating for freedom and human rights, and       support political refugees fleeing the crackdown in Belarus,       among other things; and        Whereas the Belarusian opposition, led by Sviatlana       Tsikhanouskaya, organized a Day of Solidary on February 7,       2020, where countries, cities, and political and elected       leaders, as well as everyday citizens around the world       demonstrated their support for the six months of historic       peaceful protests since the fraudulent presidential election       that took place on August 9, 2020: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) finds that the August 9, 2020, presidential election in       Belarus was neither free nor fair and, therefore, does not       recognize the government-announced results or Alyaksandr       Lukashenka as the legitimate President of Belarus;        (2) calls for new free and fair elections under       Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe       observation;        (3) affirms that the people of Belarus have the right to       determine the future of Belarus without unwelcome       intervention from the Russian Federation or any outside       actors in violation of Belarusian independence and       sovereignty;        (4) condemns the human rights violations committed by       Belarusian authorities, including against peaceful       demonstrators, civil society activists, opposition leaders,       students, educators, employees at state-owned enterprises,       medical personnel, and journalists, and calls for such       authorities to halt any further acts of violence against       civilians;        (5) calls for the immediate release of all political       prisoners and those unlawfully detained in connection with       the peaceful demonstrations including independent journalists       and family members of United States citizens;        (6) recognizes the sacrifices and bravery of the Belarusian       people and the incredible organization by Belarusian women to       peacefully demand a free and fair democratic process while       enduring the state-sponsored violence that followed the       August 9, 2020, election;        (7) calls on Alyaksandr Lukashenka and Belarusian       authorities to engage in an open and constructive dialogue       with the opposition members and other stakeholders to bring       about a peaceful transition of power;        (8) calls for the protection of civil society actors and       members of the opposition against arbitrary arrest and       violence while conducting peaceful discussions relating to       the peaceful transition of power in Belarus;        (9) recognizes the Coordination Council established by       Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya as a legitimate institution to       participate in a dialogue on a peaceful transition of power;        (10) urges continued cooperation among the United States       and its transatlantic allies  [[Page H1936]]       and partners to explore avenues in support of the democratic       movement in Belarus;        (11) calls for further targeted sanctions coordinated       between the United States, the European Union, the United       Kingdom, Canada, and other allies and partners against       Belarusian authorities who committed human rights violations       and engaged in activities that resulted in the falsification       of the August 9, 2020, election results;        (12) encourages when considering, in coordination with       transatlantic partners, the sanctioning of Belarusian state-      owned companies that have directly violated the rights of       their workers as a result of their participation in or in       connection to the ongoing democratic movement in Belarus that       the Administration take into consideration the potential       implications of making these companies more vulnerable to       takeovers by Russian or Chinese state-owned companies;        (13) calls on the transatlantic community to review and       consider reassessing any financial assistance that supports       the Lukashenka regime, including participation in state debt       issuances or procurement contracts;        (14) supports increasing funds available for foreign       assistance to Belarusian civil society groups as well as       legal assistance for activists and independent journalists,       among others, as called for in the Belarus Democracy, Human       Rights, and Sovereignty Act of 2020;        (15) urges the President to provide the United States       Agency for Global Media with a surge capacity (as such term       is defined in section 316 of the United States International       Broadcasting Act of 1994 (22 U.S.C. 6216)) for programs and       activities in Belarus, including to protect the brave       independent journalists reporting from within Belarus as       called for in the Belarus Democracy, Human Rights, and       Sovereignty Act of 2020;        (16) calls for an international investigation into the       human rights abuses committed during and after the August 9,       2020, presidential election; and        (17) continues to support the aspirations of the people of       Belarus for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law, and       reaffirms that the fulfillment of such aspirations is       critical to ensuring the continued strength of Belarusian       sovereignty and territorial integrity.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H. Res. 124.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 124.   This resolution, introduced by the chair of the Subcommittee on  Europe, Energy, the Environment and Cyber, Mr. Keating, my good friend,  is an excellent measure that solidifies this body's already strong  bipartisan support for the people of Belarus. I also thank the ranking  member for his work.   After Alyaksandr Lukashenka stole the August 9, 2020, elections, the  Belarusian people, led by thousands of women dressed in white and  fearless opposition leaders, including Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya,  peacefully took to the streets in historic numbers to demand the right  to chart their own democratic future, a future free of Lukashenka's  dictatorial grip.   Tragically, but unsurprisingly, these peaceful protestors were met  with the same brutal, violent tactics that have defined Lukashenka's  nearly three-decades-long rule. In his desperate attempt to cling to  power, thousands were beaten, injured, and illegally detained without  due process by security forces. Meanwhile, critical access to the  internet, international broadcasting, and other forms of communication  and expression were cut off to suppress the dissent, control the flow  of information, and prevent the opposition from organizing any further.   But the resolve of the Belarusian people, the brave, peaceful  protestors, the opposition in exile, and the vibrant Belarusian  diaspora has not wavered. The resolve of the United States, our allies,  and this body must not waver either.   With the passing of this resolution, the House shines a spotlight on  the illegitimacy of the Lukashenka regime and his abhorrent human  rights violations.   We must continue to build on the work of the Belarus Democracy, Human  Rights, and Sovereignty Act of 2020, an effort led by another  distinguished member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and, as  indicated by Ranking Member McCaul, a longtime champion for human  rights in Belarus, Mr. Smith of New Jersey. We thank him for his work.   By passing this good, bipartisan resolution, the House will  strengthen its longstanding commitment and record on democracy and  human rights. We will continue to demonstrate that we stand in  solidarity with the freedom-loving Belarusians, who continue to  struggle for their fundamental democratic and human rights every day.  We do this hand in hand with our allies and partners across the  Atlantic.   Madam Speaker, I stand today not only to support this measure, but in  support of democracy and the sanctity of the democratic process and  solidarity with the people of Belarus.   This is a very important resolution. I support it and I urge all of  my colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Keating), the distinguished chair of the  Subcommittee on Europe, Energy, the Environment and Cyber; an esteemed  member of the Foreign Affairs Committee; and the author of this  important bill.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I join with Ranking Member McCaul that this  resolution makes it clear that the United States will not be silent on  human rights violations as perpetrated by the illegitimate Lukashenko  regime and we stand with the Belarusian people in their peaceful fight  for democracy. I hope all join in supporting this resolution.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 965) to establish a comprehensive United States Government  initiative to build the capacity of young leaders and entrepreneurs in  Africa, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 965         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 3. YOUNG AFRICAN LEADERS INITIATIVE PROGRAM.         (a) In General.--There is established in the Department of       State the Young African Leaders Initiative (``YALI'')       program.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 965.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 965, the YALI Act of  2021, introduced by Representatives Karen Bass and Chris Smith.   Since 2010 the Young African Leaders Initiative has been building the  next generation of Africa's youth to lead the way in civic engagement,  entrepreneurship, and business development.   We must remember that by 2050, almost one-third of the world's  population will be in Africa, and the United States must continue to  forge strong ties with our African partners and cultivate its youth for  a future of principled leadership.   By helping Africa's young leaders, YALI remains an important avenue  for promoting U.S. foreign policy goals in Africa. It will be key in  strengthening our partnerships with African countries that are working  to create the pathway for Africa's youth to make positive and enduring  impacts on their communities.   If passed, H.R. 965 will provide a strong mandate for the  implementation and congressional oversight of YALI and its key  initiatives, including the U.S.-based Mandela Washington Fellowship and  the Regional Leadership Centers established throughout sub-Saharan  Africa.   This, too, is a very important bill. I support it and urge my  colleagues to do the same. With that, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), the distinguished president of the NATO  Parliamentary Assembly and esteemed member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I will just say quickly thanks to  Representatives Bass and Chris Smith. This will help build the next  generation of Africa's youth. I hope all my colleagues will join me in  voting for this very important bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1392) to protect Saudi dissidents in the United States, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1392         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protection of Saudi       Dissidents Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Jamal Khashoggi, a United States resident, Saudi       journalist, and Washington Post columnist, was killed and       dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey on       October 2, 2018.        (2) At the time of his murder, Khashoggi was living in       Virginia under an ``O'' visa and was in the process of       applying for a permanent residency.        (3) A report by the Office of the Director of National       Intelligence (ODNI) found that Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince       Muhammad bin Salman approved an operation in Istanbul, Turkey       to capture or kill Khashoggi.        (4) The assessment of the ODNI was based on ``the Crown       Prince's control of decisionmaking in the Kingdom, the direct       involvement of a key adviser and members of Muhammad bin       Salman's protective detail in the operation, and the Crown       Prince's support for using violent measures to silence       dissidents abroad''.        (5) The report also reiterates that ``the Crown Prince has       had absolute control of the Kingdom's security and       intelligence organizations'' since 2017.       SEC. 3.

(b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Director of National Intelligence,       in coordination with the heads of other relevant United       States intelligence agencies, shall submit to the appropriate       congressional committees a report with respect to--        (1) whether and how the intelligence community fulfilled       its duty to warn Jamal Khashoggi of threats to his life and       liberty pursuant to Intelligence Community Directive 191; and        (2) in the case of the intelligence community not       fulfilling its duty to warn as described in paragraph (1),       why the intelligence community did not fulfill this duty.

SEC. 7. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5  legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 1392, as amended.    I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1392, the Protection  of Saudi Dissidents Act of 2021, an important bill introduced by the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly).   Though Saudi Arabia has taken steps to reform, its progress has been  marred by the Saudi Government's brutality against dissidents and most  notably the detention and abuse of numerous peaceful protesters and the  brutal killing of Washington Post journalist and U.S. resident, Jamal  Khashoggi.   The Biden administration's release of the DNI report was a good step  toward accountability for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, but further  steps need to be taken.   This bill imposes reasonable limits on U.S. weapons transfers to  Saudi intelligence agencies shown to be involved in the killing of  Jamal Khashoggi and political repression until such repression and  abuse of dissidents comes to an end.   In conclusion, let me be clear, nothing in this legislation would  deny the Saudi Government the ability to defend its territory against  attacks from external threats or inhibit its ability to defend the  United States military, diplomatic personnel, or facilities in the  kingdom.   It is important that the United States stands clear on these matters,  speaking loudly in defense of human rights and taking action when they  are grossly violated.   I ask the support of all my colleagues to vote for this bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, April 16, 2021.      Hon. Adam B. Schiff,      House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Schiff: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       1392, Protection of Saudi Dissidents Act of 2021. I       appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the House Permanent Select Committee on       Intelligence under House Rule X, and that your Committee will       forgo action on H.R. 1392 to expedite floor consideration. I       further acknowledge that the inaction of your Committee with       respect to the bill does not waive any future jurisdictional       claim over the matters contained in the bill that fall within       your jurisdiction. I will also support the appointment of       House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence conferees       during any House-Senate conference convened on this       legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                  Gregory W. Meeks,      Chair.                                   ____           House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on             Intelligence,                                                    April 19, 2021.      Hon. Gregory Meeks,      Chairman, House Foreign Affairs Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Meeks: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       1392, the Protection of Saudi Dissidents Act of 2021. Certain       provisions in the legislation fall within the jurisdiction of       the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, as set       forth in Rule X of the House of Representatives for the 117th       Congress.        In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed       expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill,       I am willing to waive this committee's right to sequential       referral. By waiving consideration of the H.R. 1392, the       Intelligence Committee does not waive any future       jurisdictional claim over the subjects contained in the bill       which fall within Intelligence's Rule X jurisdiction.        Please place this letter into the committee report for the       Protection of Saudi Dissidents Act and into the Congressional       Record during consideration of the measure on the House       floor. Thank you for the cooperative spirit in which you have       worked regarding this matter and others between our       respective committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Adam B. Schiff,                                                          Chairman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), distinguished president of the NATO  Parliamentary Assembly, esteemed member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, and author of this important bill.    Madam Speaker, let me just thank again Representative  Gerry Connolly for this critical bill holding Saudi Arabia accountable  for its brutal suppression of dissidents.   Let me also say this helps ensure that the Saudi diplomatic  facilities are not used as a staging ground for their efforts to  suppress dissidents.   It is crucial that the United States stand strongly in defense of  basic rights and freedom of expression and not allow U.S. weapons or  support to be used by Saudi Arabia for the purposes of intimidating,  abusing, or even killing peaceful Saudi dissidents.   I hope my colleagues will join me. With that, I yield back the  balance of my time.
