 Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend from the Virgin  Islands (Ms. Plaskett) for yielding to me.   I had to come down as I saw this attempt to use our jurisdiction to  undermine our independent agencies. And I want to put an emphasis on  independent agencies because they have always been treated differently.                                time  1630    Executive Order 12866 has long subjected agency rulemakings to some  review by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, but  independent agencies have been treated differently. Congress  deliberately created them as independent to exempt them from political  review for their regulatory actions by the White House.   The agencies we are talking about are very often agencies that deal  with our economy. They are almost always agencies whose subject matter  is controversial, like the National Labor Relations Board, which deals  with labor management matters, or the FTC, whose role is to prevent  anticompetitive business practices, not to mention the Fed.   Now, the executive order provides OIRA with the ability to do cost- benefit analysis ``unless prohibited by law.'' Those words are our - congressional words, ``unless prohibited by law.''   Now, that language is not in this executive order. Does it mean that  it is erased so that, with respect to environment and public safety  rules for example, ``prohibited by law'' no longer obtains and cost  benefit can be done so that you can weigh the cost or the benefit of  rules? The benefit would be clear, but the cost of rules that are so  protective of the public that we have exempted them in the past--the  silence is deafening.   Agencies also have always been able to indicate, because they have  the only real knowledge, whether or not their rulemakings are  significant. How could we give this exclusive authority now to OIRA?  The politicization of independent agencies, making them subject to  White House oversight, is very dangerous. It robs them of what is  perhaps the most important part of their independence. This bill goes  many steps too far.
