 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to stand here today as a  single mother and a small business owner in support of the Family and  Small Business Taxpayer Protection Act.   One of the most outrageous provisions in the Democrats' hyperpartisan  Inflation Reduction Act was giving the IRS $72 billion to hire an  additional 87,000 agents. Look, the hiring of 87,000 new IRS agents  only squeezes American taxpayers, including small business owners like  myself, the backbone of our communities.   My colleagues on the other side, let me tell you this: I live and  work and now represent a border district that houses a Border Patrol  sector. They need feet on the ground. They have the same number of  agents on the ground as compared to 3 years ago. Why aren't you  fighting that hard for these agents?   The Biden administration will tell you that they have increased  agents, but they have only increased agents in the processing and  administration, which ultimately has led to the mental health  deterioration.   The American people deserve a government that works for them, not  against them.
