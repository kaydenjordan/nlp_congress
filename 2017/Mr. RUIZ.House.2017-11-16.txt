 Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the administration's proposed  national parks entrance fee hike from $25 to $70 per vehicle, which  will prohibit many American families from enjoying these beautiful  sites.   Joshua Tree National Park in my district welcomes as many as 2.5  million visitors each year, contributing $128 million to our local  economy. It is a haven for so many: local veterans find solace and  healing in the quiet of nature; children experience the beauty of their  first hike; visitors come to love the grandeur and the mystique of our  desert when they come to stay in Joshua Tree; families bond over the  lasting memories they make in the park.   Everyone, not just the rich, should have access to these incredible  places. Working families are deserving of access to our national parks.  Nearly tripling the price of entry means that many families will be  priced out of visiting these parks, including many people in my  district who live right next to Joshua Tree National Park.   Our national parks are not just only for the economically privileged.  They are for we, the people, to enjoy.                            ____________________
