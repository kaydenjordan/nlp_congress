 Madam President, I rise today to reflect on the landmark  legislation that this body passed with overwhelming bipartisan support  last week. It isn't every day that folks in Congress can work together  in a bipartisan way to get something done that will benefit Main  Streets across rural America, but that is exactly what we did last  week. I am very proud of that effort.   I say a big thank-you to the chairman of the Banking Committee,  Chairman Crapo, for the work he has done, his ability to listen, his  commonsense perspective, and his patience. It would not have happened  without those qualities that Chairman Crapo exhibited.   I also want to single out three Senators who worked very hard on this  bill. There are a number of others who did, too, but I am just going to  mention Senators Heitkamp, Donnelly, and Warner. Those folks did  yeoman's work in bringing into view the challenges that our banking  industry has out there, coming up with solutions for those challenges,  and coming up with consumer protections to put into this bill to move  it forward. There were many others. I think there were 17 or 18  cosponsors on the Democratic side of the aisle, but I say a special  thank you to Senators Heitkamp, Donnelly, and Warner for their  advocacy, input, knowledge, expertise, and their ability to work to get  things done.   People ask me: Senator Tester, why did you write this bill? Well, I  was a part of the folks who wrote this bill for good reason. I remember  very well that during the financial crisis, then-Secretary of the  Treasury Henry Paulson came in--it was in 2008, I believe--and said  that we were on the cusp of a financial meltdown in this country. I  remember some of the free and irresponsible activities that were done  in the financial system. I remember bringing regulators in front of the  Banking Committee and ripping them up one side and down the other as to  why we had gotten into this situation. In the end, we came up with a  bill called Dodd-Frank.   Dodd-Frank was put together after a lot of public input and a lot of  hearings, and it was put into effect really to regulate the folks who  got us into the situation we were in. At that moment in time, we had  banks that were too big to fail, folks who were doing no-doc or low-doc  loans, and foreclosures happening everywhere. We put in the regulation.   One of the things we heard when we put in the Dodd-Frank regulation  was that it was a big bill and that it was going to need to be changed,  adapted--however you want to put it--moving forward. I believe that  bill was passed in 2009. Here we are 8 or 9 years later, and we look at  Dodd-Frank and see that in some cases, it has done exactly as was  intended, especially for the larger banks. Some could argue that there  is more work to be done there.   One of the negative things that resulted from the Dodd-Frank  regulation was that some of that regulation bled down onto our local  community banks and credit unions. This is particularly concerning to  me because I come from a very rural part of this country. It is a small  town where, when my grandfather homesteaded, they had all sorts of  options when they marketed their grain. In the 1940s and 1950s, when my  folks took over in my small town, I believe there were five grain  elevators there. When Sharla and I took over in the late 1970s, there  were three. Today, there is one.   You ask, why does that have anything to do with the banking industry,  Jon? Well, it is consolidation. And the consolidation didn't happen  overnight; it took decades. You end up with less competition in the  marketplace when it comes to selling your grains.   That same thing could be adapted to what has gone on in our community  banks over the last 8 or 9 years, where they have been bought up by  bigger banks. The bigger banks will tell you that they have to get  bigger to be able to compete with the regulations put on them. So they  were bought up, and the same thing will extrapolate out over time.   Those folks who say: Well, this isn't necessary because banks are  making a lot of money--look, banks may be operating today, but they are  looking into the future, as any good business does, and they are saying  to themselves: Do I really have what it takes to stick around? They can  see the writing on the wall, and they are selling out because of it.  There are no ifs, ands, or buts about this--this will result in less  consumer choice and more consolidation, making the bigger banks even  bigger and really helping the folks who caused the crisis back in  2008--ultimately, the biggest of the big banks.   We have seen the consolidation at grocery stores, grain elevators,  and even bars. The truth is that it isn't all due to one single thing.  The consolidation in the financial industry and on the ground isn't due  to just regulations. Technology has its impact, and a moving population  also has its impact.   As I looked at this 5 years ago, I said: If we don't do something to  tweak Dodd-Frank, we are going to end up in a situation where we don't  have consumer choice to buy that house or expand that business or start  that new business--what entrepreneurs do. So as a policymaker, I  thought it was my job to look ahead to the next generation of people  who are going to be out there in rural America, whether it is a Main  Street small business or a farm or a family who is working for a  business. That is why I helped write this bill, because from a rural  America perspective, it was the right thing to do, and it was time to  do something for the next generation, for our kids and our grandkids,  so that they could have the kind of opportunity that, quite frankly, my  folks and my grandparents had given to my generation.   I am not the kind of person who will sit back on the sidelines and  complain about stuff over a cup of coffee. When we see a problem, my  folks taught me to work and try to fix it. I see a problem, and there  is little doubt in my mind that if we had not done what we did last  week to give some regulatory relief to community banks and credit  unions, things would have continued to get worse in rural America. They  still may get worse in rural America, but at least we have done what we  needed to do in this body to try to change that.   There are some out there who, for whatever reason--and I haven't  quite been able to figure it out yet--are spreading misinformation  about this bill. Maybe it is just the day we live in. So let me set the  record straight about this bill.   This bill does not help the Wall Street banks. It does not. Those who  say it does are not correct. This bill does not set us up for another  financial crisis. In fact, the authors of the original Dodd-Frank bill,  Chris Dodd and  [[Page S1778]]  Barney Frank--both smart guys whom I admire--wrote:         As the authors of the original Dodd-Frank reform law, we       want all Montanans to know that the banking bill Senator       Tester helped write does not dismantle Dodd-Frank as some       people claim. Jon knows Montana and challenges facing rural       America. While we did not agree with every part of this bill,       it helps local credit unions and community banks across       Montana while keeping protections in place that are designed       to prevent another financial crisis.    Those are the original authors. That is why it is called Dodd-Frank-- because it is from Chris Dodd and Representative Barney Frank.   The other thing the bill does not do is it does not leave banks  unregulated. There is implication by some out there that this bill  deregulates 25 of the 40 largest banks. To me, that implication is that  now they are no longer regulated. The fact is, all the banks are highly  regulated for safety and soundness. Quite frankly, this does not leave  banks unregulated. They still have plenty of regulation to go through.   In conclusion, the bill we passed last week does several things. I  believe it is going to increase access to capital, particularly in  rural America. I think it makes the regulation fit the risk, while  still continuing to crack down on risky behavior. It has great consumer  protection components to it. Last and certainly not least, from my  perspective, it is good for rural America.   I yield the floor.
