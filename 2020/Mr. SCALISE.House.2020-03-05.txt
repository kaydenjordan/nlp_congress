 Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend, the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is the majority leader of the House, for the  purpose of inquiring about the schedule for next week.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   In relation to the NO BAN Act, I understand there was a disagreement  over whether or not the gentleman supported the President's ability to  restrict travel from certain countries based, not on whether they were  a Muslim country, but based on whether or not they were a country that  was not in compliance with our Department of Homeland Security  requirements and criteria to ensure that they are properly vetting  people who come to our country for national security purposes and,  specifically, to ensure that people who are known terrorists and people  who have other known criminal backgrounds are not able to come into our  country.   Most countries around the world, including a number of Muslim  countries, are in compliance and, in fact, have a very good cooperative  travel agreement between the United States and those countries, but  there were a limited number of countries back in 2017 that the  President ultimately determined, working through the Department of  Homeland Security, were not in compliance.   He listed those countries. He added a few more to it later. I know a  number of people on the majority side were in disagreement with that.  Some took that to court. It ultimately went all the way to the U.S.  Supreme Court. The Supreme Court upheld this travel ban.   But I would want to point out to the gentleman that the Department of  Homeland Security has been very clear to these countries that if they  comply with the basic reporting requirements--again, that every other  country in the world that has that same travel agreement with the  United States has--if they were to come into compliance, then they  would be removed from the list.   In fact, Chad is one of the countries that was originally listed.  Chad worked with us--as every country should--and said: We are going to  comply. We want to make sure that we are properly sharing information  so that people who are coming to the United States from Chad now are  properly vetted for terrorism and other criminal activities.   They got removed from the list.   The other countries, by the way, have been invited to do that. They  have chosen not to. Why they have chosen not to is a good question they  should be asked. We should not criticize the President for using his  executive authority to keep this country safe and to keep terrorists  from coming into this country and ensuring that those nations that send  people to the United States--as we send them to their countries--are in  compliance with the requirements of the Department of Homeland  Security.   So why would a bill like that be brought up, especially at this time  when now with this coronavirus there are a number of countries that we  have seen, starting with China, that have a serious outbreak that we  are trying to prevent from coming into our country?   Under this bill that would be coming forward, not only does it limit  the President's ability to protect us from having countries be able to  send terrorists into our Nation, now it would limit the President's  ability to respond to a health crisis like the coronavirus where there  are some countries that are listed, like China and Iran, that have to  be screened or can't send people from those countries if they have been  in those countries in the last 14 days, it would tie the President's  hands from even responding to that crisis.    We have seen just today the Governor of California--probably not  somebody who is philosophically aligned with the President too often-- just sent a cruise ship back into the Pacific Ocean and said the cruise  ship can't come into San Francisco. And that is the Governor's power  and authority to provide for the health and safety of his State.   Why would we want to tie the hands of the President of the United  States when he wants to ensure the health and safety of the people of  this country?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, clearly, we will debate that because the  Supreme Court has already addressed the constitutionality upholding it,  but it has no genesis in religious tests. It has a genesis in the  security of this country.   Again, if you go look at the nations that are listed in the ban, Chad  went and did the things that the Department of Homeland Security said  you needed to do to be in compliance, and they got removed from the  list.   Every other country on that list has also been invited to go and just  do basic sharing of information to ensure that the people coming from  those countries are not terrorists, are not criminals, are not going to  provide a security threat to our Nation.   It is a clear test. Every other country in the world already does it.   Why does Libya choose not to comply? I don't know, but they haven't.   Why does North Korea choose not to comply? I don't know, but they  haven't.   Like Chad, go and address these deficiencies, and then you can be  removed from the list. Chad has already done that. Every other country  can.   We will debate it, but it does put additional red tape in front of  the President that would preclude him in the health arena from  responding to the nations that have a threat of the coronavirus, like  the President was quickly able to do with China, quickly able to do  with Iran. He would not be able to quickly respond in the future under  the bill that is proposed.   Clearly, we will heavily debate that next week.    Mr. Speaker, clearly, we do have disagreements on that.  Hopefully, we can work through those in the debate next week.   There is another bill that is going to be, hopefully, coming up that  we can get agreement on, and that deals with the renewal of components  of the FISA law.   I know the Committee on the Judiciary earlier this week had a markup  that they ultimately pulled back on. There are negotiations ongoing  between Republicans and Democrats to try to come to an agreement on not  only how to renew the FISA law, but also how to make the reforms that  are critical and necessary to the FISA law, to address the abuses that  we know happen.   I would ask the gentleman first if his side is in a position of  identifying some of the areas we can find agreement on, on reforms,  because I believe Ranking Member Nunes had submitted a number of  specific reforms, and the gentleman's side is reviewing those.   Has the gentleman had a chance to review them? Does he have an  alternative proposal? Because the reforms are critical to the renewal.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman to answer that.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that the gentleman talked  about a response. I haven't seen that response yet, but I look forward  to working with our folks who are heavily involved in these  negotiations to see if we can reach agreement because, in the past, the  program has had many supporters, Republican and Democrat, but clearly  some detractors on both sides as well.   It is a very critical tool in our national security. The FISA courts  have been used to stop terrorist activity, to prevent other terrorist  attacks, but there is clearly other weighing that goes back and forth  on civil liberties and ensuring that the rights of Americans are  protected.   It is a balance that was tested, frankly, in 2016, when we saw clear  abuses of the FISA court. The first time we had seen those kinds of  identified abuses, they were limited, but they were blatant. It is a  dangerous affront to our Nation's national security if you have people  at intelligence agencies who abuse their power.   In fact, the Horowitz report was very specific in outlining 17  different exact abuses of the FISA court. Some of this is still being  investigated through the Durham investigation, which will, hopefully,  yield a list of specific people.   I will just read from parts of the Horowitz report.   ``As more fully described in Chapter 5, based upon the information  known to the FBI in October 2016, the first application contained the  following seven significant inaccuracies and omissions.''   He goes on in this report: ``In addition to repeating the seven  significant errors contained in the first FISA application and outlined  above, we identified 10 additional significant errors and three renewal  applications, based upon information known to the FBI after the first  application and before the renewals,'' where abuses of this FISA law  occurred.   Now, I think, on both sides, we would agree that if somebody in a  position of national security abuses their power deliberately, they  need to be held accountable. One of the concerns we have is that the  law does not allow strong enough penalties.   I am hopeful that, when the Durham report comes out, the people who  were identified as abusing their power in 2016 ought to be held  accountable and, in fact, ought to go to jail for what they did because  what they did not only undermined our electoral process, but it  jeopardizes a law that has bipartisan support but has bipartisan  opposition as well.   If somebody abused their power to taint that process, the FISA court,  it undermines the integrity of the FISA court. We all need to work  together to ensure that anyone who abuses their power is held fully  accountable, not only to hold them accountable, but to ensure it  doesn't happen again. No Republican, no Democrat candidate for  President ought to be concerned that people in intelligence agencies  are abusing their power to try to undermine an election.   If it happened, as we know it did--and the Horowitz report is very  specific. Hopefully, the Durham investigation names names. Hopefully,  those people are held accountable and go to jail so that nobody else  does it again.   But as we know, there is the possibility for that to happen under  current law. That is why it is so important that we get this agreement  to make necessary critical reforms, to put guardrails in place; to keep  the process available to our national security experts so that they can  continue to stop future terrorist attacks; but to also ensure that if  somebody abuses the process, it makes it harder for them to do it; but  if they still cross the line, that there are strong criminal penalties  in place for those who would violate that law.   I know we have laid those out. I am glad to know you have come back  with a response. Hopefully, we can get that agreement in the next few  days before this law expires. Clearly, there is strong support,  hopefully, on both sides, for putting real reforms in place that fix  and address the abuses that occurred in 2016, as identified by the  Horowitz report.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman for anything else on that.    Mr. Speaker, clearly, the gentleman from Maryland and I  both agree that this FISA law has a strong role to play in our national  security, but there is also acknowledgment that there were abuses that  happened. Not only was there the Horowitz investigation, but now you do  have the Durham investigation that will, hopefully, conclude and  identify where those abuses took place and that those people would be  held accountable.   We have had talks with the Attorney General, who recognizes, yes, he  also agrees that this FISA law is critically important, wants to have  this section renewed, but he does recognize that reforms can be made.   How exactly we can come to an agreement--just like with your side, we  are having those negotiations. And so, if people do acknowledge that  abuses occurred, I think it would be in all of our best interest, as we  are addressing this law that has had detractors on both sides, that we  strengthen the integrity of the law, because it has been exposed now.  It has been exposed that there were problems that occurred.   The other sections where those problems occurred are permanent law.  This is not. This is coming up for renewal, but it is part of the FISA  law. And, clearly, as we debate the FISA law, all of this becomes part  of that debate, and, hopefully, all of it can get resolved within the  debate on the components that expire March 15.   I am confident we can get this done because I have seen the  bipartisan interest. We just need to make sure that what we bring to  the floor addresses the problems that occurred so that it, hopefully,  never happens again.   I will be happy to yield if the gentleman had anything else on that.    Mr. Speaker, I look forward to seeing the gentleman next  week, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
