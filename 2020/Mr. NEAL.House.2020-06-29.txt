 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am really pleased today to join with the Speaker and  other committee chairs to have successfully introduced the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act and welcome the  measure's consideration in this House today.   Hearing the former chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee a  few minutes ago, a decent guy, he said that there was room for  bipartisanship in the healthcare debate. I mean, I have been here for a  long time. Where was the bipartisanship--and I am going to submit  something. Republicans, in all the years I have been in this House,  they have not agreed amongst themselves on healthcare, never mind  agreeing with Democrats on healthcare.   So, for years, we have worked to expand access. That is what this  argument is about today. We want to make sure that affordable  healthcare exists  [[Page H2624]]  for the American family and to build upon the coverage gains of the  Affordable Care Act.   The COVID-19 crisis only adds urgency to an already pressing problem  for millions of American families, a problem that has been consistently  exacerbated by the Trump administration's relentless crusade to  dismantle the American healthcare system.   Recall on the campaign trail when President Trump was asked by  reporters what he intended to replace ObamaCare with, and he said:  Don't worry, pal, you are going to love it.   That was the answer.   Just last week, under the cover of night and while many Americans  were likely sleeping, the Trump administration took another step toward  invalidating our healthcare laws. They filed a brief with the Supreme  Court in support of undoing the ACA and ending protections for nearly  130 million Americans with preexisting conditions.   I helped to write this law. I am really proud of it.   They staked out this position during a pandemic, when millions of  Americans need healthcare more than ever.   Our new Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act is  utilized to expand tax credits for lower premium costs for the American  consumer. For the first time in the history of the ACA, no one will pay  more than 8.5 percent of their income on a silver plan through the  marketplace.                                time  1130    I will quickly share the other scenarios that people will witness  savings through:   A family of four earning $40,000 would save nearly $1,600 in premiums  each year.   An adult earning about $19,000 would see premiums cut to zero, saving  $800 a year.   And a 64-year-old earning $57,000 a year would save more than $8,700  in premiums each year.   These are significant savings that would make a big difference for  Americans particularly during the current health and economic crisis  that we find ourselves in.   I want to thank Representative Underwood for her tireless work on  these provisions and advocating for the millions of Americans who will  see their premium costs go down, recalling that when the ACA was  offered and embraced 20 million Americans received health insurance.   I want to thank Representative Wild for leading the effort to remove  a longstanding barrier for families with an offer of affordable family  coverage, as well as Representative Neguse for his work on behalf of  Social Security beneficiaries who were at risk of losing premium tax  credits for the time they were covered by the ACA marketplace.   These tax credits aren't the only benefits consumers can expect under  this very important legislation. We also slashed prescription drug  costs, we reduced consumers' deductibles, encouraged more States to  expand Medicaid and establish their own ACA marketplace, and to put an  end to the expansion of junk insurance plans.   Notably, this legislation reduces the number of uninsured Americans  by more than 4 million people. These are issues that matter to everyday  Americans perhaps now in this COVID crisis more than ever. Ensuring all  Americans can access quality healthcare without risking their family's  financial security really shouldn't be a partisan issue.   After almost 70 votes on Republican bills to repeal or undermine the  ACA, I am really happy to stand on this floor today in support of this  legislation that will continue to build on the gains of the ACA, for  legislation that increases access to affordable, quality healthcare,  and for legislation that is for the American people.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this timely  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Madam Speaker, I would point out that 100 percent of the  children in Massachusetts have healthcare today and 97 percent of the  adults.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington State (Ms. DelBene).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Alabama (Ms. Sewell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta).    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Murphy).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Gomez).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nevada (Mr. Horsford).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Suozzi).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Chicago (Ms. Schakowsky).                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, this is very sensible legislation. It builds upon the  Affordable Care Act. It keeps the protections of preexisting  conditions. It makes the children's healthcare initiative permanent.  But most importantly, it expands the opportunity.   I am going to reiterate something I said earlier about the experience  we have had in Massachusetts with the Affordable Care Act. 100 percent  of the children in Massachusetts have health insurance. Ninety-seven  percent of the adults in Massachusetts have health insurance, and it  polls in the high seventies in terms of consumer satisfaction. It was  the experiment that worked.   We should be expanding healthcare opportunities for members of the  American family, not trying to deny them. We shouldn't be filing a  lawsuit in front of the Supreme Court suggesting that we should do away  with the Affordable Care Act.   Last point, and I mean this very sincerely, as long as I have been in  this House, Republicans have never agreed amongst themselves on health  insurance, never mind trying to find an agreement with us. They have  always disagreed sharply about the role of government in health  insurance. So before they give us a lecture on how this ought to  proceed, perhaps they could offer a competing plan that has never  happened in my time in Congress.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
