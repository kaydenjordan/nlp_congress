 Madam Speaker, the Supreme Court's decision to overturn  Roe v. Wade was dehumanizing and dangerous. It does not reflect the  will of the majority of Americans who deeply value control over their  own bodies.   As leader of the State senate in Vermont, I worked to make sure that  my State was the first in the Nation to explicitly protect reproductive  freedoms in its constitution. It is time to provide these same  protections for all Americans.   While Republicans seek to control women's bodies to try to distract  us from their extreme stances with farcical resolutions, my Democratic  colleagues and I will not stop until reproductive freedoms are restored  as the law of the land.   The American people are overwhelmingly with us. They want their  rights. They want their freedoms.   As a woman, as a mother, as a Congresswoman, I will continue to fight  for a world where abortion care is legal, safe, and accessible for all  Americans.                            ____________________
