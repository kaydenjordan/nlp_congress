 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia  (Mr. Collins) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, I hardly know where to begin. With all that is going on  in the country and in the world--we have children being ripped apart  from their families at the border; we have Republicans working with the  White House trying to take away healthcare protections for the American  people; and we have a President who seems unhinged--with all that is  happening, this is what we are dealing with today on the House floor  this morning. Basically, it is a resolution to try to undermine the  Mueller investigation, which is investigating potential Russian  involvement and collusion in our election.   That is a big deal. We should all want to get to the bottom of this.  We should all want the truth. Instead of wanting to get to the truth,  my Republican friends throw roadblocks in the way, one after another  after another, to try to get people to try to discredit the  investigation and to try to derail the investigation. It is  unbelievable to me.    The President this morning tweeted that Russia continues to insist  they had nothing to do with meddling in our election. I can't believe  the President of the United States is tweeting that. What is wrong with  him?   Every single intelligence agency in our government says that the  Russians meddled in our election, and we have the President of the  United States this morning tweeting that Russia says they didn't do it,  so we have got to believe Russia.  [[Page H5822]]    I don't know how my friends can defend this. At some point, you have  to say, ``Enough.''   I get it. Republicans want to constantly circle the wagons around the  President with every outrageous thing he says and does, but this is  about a foreign power--an adversary--meddling in our elections.   What is the response? Let's try to disparage the investigation. Let's  try to undermine the investigation.   It is unreal that we are going through this exercise today, but I  guess we have come to expect this.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say, also, that the process in this House  that got us here today to debate this resolution was a disgrace and an  affront to the way this Chamber is supposed to conduct business. In all  my time here, I haven't seen a committee minority of either party  treated as disrespectfully as Democrats were on Tuesday. That is when  the Judiciary Committee considered this resolution of inquiry.   Democrats showed up on time and sat patiently waiting for this  hearing to begin--and they waited, and they waited, and they waited  because the Republican majority gaveled the hearing to order more than  an hour after it was supposed to begin. They didn't even have the  courtesy to tell the minority about the delay.   Things got only worse from there. When the hearing actually got  underway, Democrats were cut off at every turn. The Republican majority  moved the previous question, cutting off debate and preventing  consideration of Democratic amendments. They blocked parliamentary  inquiries and a unanimous consent request. Committee Republicans even  took the extraordinary step of overruling their chairman after an  amendment was ruled out of order. It was heavy-handed, and it was  undemocratic.   My Republican colleagues should be ashamed of the way they conducted  themselves. Maybe they are, because the chairman of the committee  appeared to hide in the hallway during the vote until he was called by  another Member, and when he did vote, he voted ``present.'' So did the  Acting Chair.   Mr. Speaker, were they unwilling to stand up to the more conservative  elements of their caucus? or did they condone what went on?   I don't see how anybody in this Chamber could endure such an  embarrassing process. It is unfortunate that the majority of the Rules  Committee essentially enabled it by using emergency procedures to  quickly move this resolution.   This is a new low for a majority that has already turned this  Congress into the most closed Congress in history. There have already  been 89 closed rules this Congress, and it is only June. There has not  been a single open rule under Speaker Ryan--not one.   It is fitting that this measure from the Judiciary Committee is being  considered under the majority's 90th closed rule because the Judiciary  Committee is now the second most closed committee in this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, what does the majority have to show for this bad  process? We have another bad product here, this time a partisan measure  meant to undermine the Russia investigation.   Now, we know this isn't a serious attempt at oversight because the  Republican majority apparently doesn't believe in fulfilling its  oversight responsibilities to begin with. Republicans have refused, for  example, to examine foreign payments to the Trump organization. They  refuse to examine extravagant travel by members of the administration.  They refuse to examine HUD Secretary Carson's $31,000 dining set.   Who buys a $31,000 dining set? Where do you find a $31,000 dining  set?   They refuse to investigate the use of private email by administration  officials, including Jared Kushner and Stephen Miller, and countless  other scandals involving EPA Administrator Pruitt.   The list goes on and on and on and on. We actually have a long list  here, Mr. Speaker, of what we should be investigating. If my Republican  colleagues would like a copy, I am happy to provide it to them. But  suffice it to say, there is no oversight with regard to the misdeeds of  this administration.   Mr. Speaker, what happened to the Republicans' zeal for oversight?  Former Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Issa  subpoenaed the Obama administration more than 100 times in just a 4- year span. I didn't always agree with him on his investigations, but at  least the Oversight and Government Reform Committee was performing some  oversight.   Republicans today are completely missing in action under President  Trump. This is an administration that has been embroiled in one scandal  after the next. It is an administration dripping with corruption. This  makes the Nixon administration look like Common Cause. I have never  seen anything like it. Apparently, the Republicans only believe in  oversight if it involves President Obama or Secretary Clinton.   Let me remind my Republican colleagues that there wasn't a single  scandal in President Obama's 8 years in office that implicated him: no  Cabinet official was forced to resign in scandal; no senior White House  official had to leave in the face of wrongdoing. Only with the Trump  administration can you have one scandal start at breakfast only to have  another one by the time you sit down for dinner.   We should be doing our job--getting to the bottom of what is  happening and holding people accountable--but instead we are throwing  sand in the gears of the Russia investigation. This is crazy.   Now, let me remind everyone of what Special Counsel Mueller's  investigation has yielded so far.    Twenty people and three companies have either been indicted or pled  guilty. That includes George Papadopoulos, foreign policy adviser on  President Trump's campaign, who pled guilty to making false statements  to the FBI; Michael Flynn, the President's former National Security  Advisor, who also pled guilty to making false statements to the FBI.   Paul Manafort, his former campaign chair, was indicted on charges of  conspiracy, money laundering, and making false statements. He was later  also charged with tax, financial, and bank fraud charges. He is sitting  in jail today. As we have this debate right now, Paul Manafort is in  jail.   Rick Gates, the President's campaign aid, was also indicted on  similar charges.   That is just a small sample based on what we know today. We will see  what else the Special Counsel's investigation finds.   So this goes beyond your basic policy disagreements. This is about  whether the minority in this Congress is allowed to do the job they  were elected to do--not just this Democratic minority, but any  minority, because we have seen and we could see again this year just  how quickly power shifts in Congress. This is about whether this  Congress is going to fulfill its oversight responsibilities or sweep  possible wrongdoing under the rug.   Now, we have a chance today to demand better from this majority, so  we should vote against this rule and demand a better process. That is  the only way we are going to see a better product.   Just one final thing before I reserve my time. I say to my Republican  friends: Look at what you are doing to this institution. You are  destroying it. Not only the closed process, the most closed Congress in  the history of our country, but the way you move legislation forward.  The way Democrats in the Judiciary Committee were treated on this  resolution, in all my years here, I have never seen anything like it.   I get it. We have a President who wants to behave like a king and who  thinks, when he speaks, everybody should sit up to attention just like  they do when Kim Jong-un speaks. But this is supposed to be the  people's House, and you are diminishing this institution. This has to  stop.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, as I said in the beginning, there are a  whole bunch of troubling things happening in our country today. The  Supreme Court's Janus decision was just yet another very disturbing  development that really attacks working men and women.                                time  0930    Mr. Speaker, a union's ability to collectively bargain benefits both  its members and nonmembers alike. Unions are responsible for many of  the worker protections Americans enjoy today, and they continue to  fight for fair pay and good working conditions, including for 17.3  million public employees.   We have unions to thank for our weekends, for paid vacations, for  overtime pay, for the 8-hour workday, for child labor laws, for  pensions, for the minimum wage, for sick leave, for Social Security,  for parental leave, for holiday pay, and the list goes on and on and  on.   However, yesterday, the Supreme Court dealt a devastating blow to  hardworking employees, the unions that represent them, and the  protections they provide us. In a 5-4 ideological decision, the Court  invalidated the laws of 22 States and undermined public sector unions.  This decision enables free-riding by those who benefit from union  agreements but do not want to help cover the costs of collective  bargaining and enforcement.   Unions fight for every single worker. Therefore, every worker should  pay their fair share.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to bring up Representative Cartwright's  legislation, H.R. 6238, the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act.  This bill protects the rights of State and local government employees  to join unions and collectively bargain.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright) to discuss his proposal.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire from the gentleman how many  more speakers he has.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as I said at the outset, there are lots of things that  we should be doing oversight on and that they we are not.    The Oversight Committee has chosen not to look into all the scandals  in this White House. They have chosen instead to look the other way.   I mentioned EPA Administrator Pruitt. He has demonstrated over and  over that he has no regard for taxpayer money. He is living a lifestyle  of the rich and famous at EPA. He has no respect for his position and  no desire to follow our ethics law. His many abuses of his position  demand that we fully investigate his actions.   For example--I love this--he spent $43,000 on installing a soundproof  booth in his office. Who does that? GAO stated that he was required to  notify Congress before spending more than $5,000 on office  improvements, but he goes ahead and spends $43,000 on a soundproof  booth, I guess to make private phone calls. He racked up nearly  $200,000 flying first class and luxury aircraft on the taxpayers' dime.  One of those trips was to Italy. It cost $30,000. He rented an  apartment from an energy lobbyist for $50 a night here in Washington.  He enlisted an aide to help find his wife a job.   You can't make this stuff up. And crickets from the Oversight  Committee and my Republican friends in Congress.   Congress needs to investigate the alarming drug price trends in this  country. This is an emergency, a life or death issue for our  constituents. Because of high drug prices, one in four Americans cannot  afford to fill a prescription. These high drug prices are not due to  foreign markets, but they are due to our unfair pricing system.   We issue patents to drug companies, allowing them to have exclusive  rights on drugs. Make no mistake, patents are important for  incentivizing and rewarding innovation. However, drug companies found  ways to game the system by prolonging their patents and continuing  their tight hold on lifesaving medications.   A study by UCLA found that 74 percent of new patents from 2005 to  2015  [[Page H5824]]  went to drugs that already existed. Patents allow these drug companies  to charge patients unfair prices without facing competition. That is  just unacceptable.   But I guess we shouldn't be surprised that there is no investigation,  because my Republican friends are working with this White House to  undue patient protections in the Affordable Care Act. They are even  trying to take away preexisting condition protections.   Right now, because of the law, if you have a preexisting condition,  an insurance company cannot discriminate against you and demand that  you pay more. They have to give you the insurance. They want to take  that away. This is unbelievable. We should be investigating this stuff.   I could go on and on and on, but we are not doing that. What we are  doing is, we are bringing a resolution that has been put forward by  some who are trying to undermine the Mueller investigation and who do  not want the American people to focus on the involvement between Trump  operatives and the Russians.   When I would go up to Massachusetts on the weekends, it used to be  that people would ask me who in the Trump administration met with the  Russians. Now the question is: Who in the Trump administration didn't  meet with the Russians?   What I love about the people who are testifying before the Mueller  committee, they now are getting in trouble because they are realizing  that, if you lie, there is a consequence, so they all have amnesia.  They met with Russian operatives time and again, and they forget. They  mysteriously remember when they are confronted with the evidence.   We all should be shocked by this. A foreign adversary interfered in  our election. Every single intelligence agency in our government  confirms that. And yet you have the President of the United States  today tweeting: Oh, Russia insists they didn't meddle in our election.   Oh, my God, I can't believe this. The President of the United States  is tweeting that today. It is shameful. Stop defending this  unacceptable behavior, and stop defending a process that is  unacceptable as well.   I mentioned the terrible treatment Democrats received in the  Judiciary Committee when this thing was reported out. I have never seen  anything like that in my life. Democrats waited for an hour and they  were just shut out of any opportunity to amend the measure or even  speak.   Welcome to the United States Congress. This is supposed to be the  people's House. This is supposed to be the shining example of  democracy, and you get people who have questions or who have ideas who  are shut down in committee.   Then we bring it to the floor after going through the Rules Committee  last night, and it comes to the floor under a closed process. This is  the most closed Congress in history. This is the 90th closed rule.   What does that mean? It means that this legislation cannot be  amended. There is limited debate. You have to vote for it up or down,  my way or the highway. Everybody, Democrats and Republicans, are  blocked from offering any of their ideas or any of their potential  improvements to this bill. Nothing.   This is the 90th closed rule, completely closed rule, in this  Congress, the 90th bill that has come before us where neither Democrats  nor Republicans can offer anything.   It is frustrating beyond words to be here today. The system here is  rigged. This is going to pass on a party-line vote, I guess. But this  is not the way the people's House should be run. This is disgraceful.  At some point, my Republican friends who care about this institution  have to say enough is enough. They have to demand a more open, more  transparent system here. This cannot stand.   So, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question, so  we can address the terrible impacts of the Supreme Court decision in  the Janus case and vote ``no'' on the rule. We should not be doing this  today. We should not be engaged in an attempt to try to defend  the indefensible or undermine an important investigation into Russia's  meddling in our election.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
