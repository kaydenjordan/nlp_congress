 Mr. Chairman, I start by thanking my friend,  Chairman Diaz-Balart for his hard work on State and Foreign Operations  appropriations legislation. I know he and his staff have worked  tirelessly over the last several months to get this bill in the  position it is in now, and I thank them for their hard work on this.   Mr. Chairman, earlier this year, May 24, my constituent, Cameron  Robbins--  [[Page H4832]]  along with probably hundreds of other high school graduates from the  Baton Rouge area--went on a trip to The Bahamas to celebrate his high  school graduation. Tragically, Cameron went overboard on a sunset  cruise a few hours after arriving.   Mr. Chair, I think we got the first call around midnight. We were on  the phone until 4 a.m., working, literally overnight, waking up  admirals and captains and all kinds of folks from the United States  Coast Guard, and working with the Royal Bahamas Defence Force to ensure  there were appropriate search-and-rescue efforts to find Cameron.   Regrettably, Mr. Chairman, despite the efforts of the United States  Coast Guard and the Royal Bahamas Defence Force, Cameron's body was  never found.   You can imagine the tragic impact on the family, on the students, and  on the entire community.   Mr. Chairman, the Bahamian Government is our friend. We are allies.  We are obviously very close, and we have close economic relationships.   The police in The Bahamas conducted a very extensive investigation.  They interviewed students who were nearby to find out what happened.  They interviewed the captain of the vessel; interviewed everyone who  was involved.   Mr. Chairman, you can imagine the family at this point.   We simply asked: Could you please just share your investigation  report? That is it. Just share the investigation report. The family  just wants to learn as much as they can about this tragedy.   I am going to say it again, Mr. Chairman: Cameron's body was never  recovered.   Unfortunately, the Bahamian Government and the Royal Bahamas Police  Force have not provided anything, have not provided any answers.   We sent our Coast Guard over to do search-and-rescue missions. We had  surface ships, we had helos, we had aircraft over there. The Bahamian  Government has provided nothing. They have been totally unresponsive.  They haven't responded to me, and they haven't responded to the State  Department.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter to Prime Minister  Davis of The Bahamas.                                      Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, September 4, 2023.      Hon. Philip E.B. Davis,      Prime Minister of The Bahamas, Harold DeGregory Complex,           Freeport, Grand Bahama.        Dear Mr. Prime Minister: Your direct help is needed to       acquire the police report on Cameron Crossley Robbins (DOB 1/      11/2004), a United States citizen who went missing off       Paradise Island on 24/5/2023. Mr. Robbins and his family are       constituents who I represent.        While on a boating excursion aboard the Pirates Revenge an       accident ensued that caused Cameron Robbins to go missing. We       are aware that the Royal Bahamas Police Force interviewed       most of the passengers and crew of the Pirates Revenge, among       others. We believe the Royal Bahamas Police Force and the       Royal Bahamas Defence Force have comprehensive, helpful       information regarding the incident.        As you may know, the Royal Bahamas Defence Force initiated       search and rescue efforts, then quickly requested the support       of the United States Coast Guard to lead the search and       rescue, which they did for three days until The Royal Bahamas       Defence Force called off the search. The United States Coast       Guard has provided us all the information they have gathered       regarding the incident and search.        We believe the Royal Bahamas Police Force has the authority       to share their report with the Robbins family, and we       therefore respectfully request that you do everything in your       power to help provide the family with the police report.        I am sure you agree that it is inconceivable how any of       this information should remain inaccessible to the family.       Thank you in advance for your courtesy and cooperation. It is       greatly appreciated.            Sincerely,                                                     Garret Graves,                                                Member of Congress.     Mr. Chairman, I do have an amendment that  would restrict funds for the Bahamian Government contingent upon their  cooperation of simply sharing information and discussing this with the  chairman and the ranking member of the State, Foreign Operations, and  Related Programs Subcommittee.   Mr. Chair, I will not offer that amendment right now, but I would ask  the chairman and the ranking member to please work with us on this  matter.   I will say it again. The Bahamian Government is our friend. They are  our allies. However, this is a tragic situation.   I would ask the chairman to put himself in the place of the parents,  and work with us to help us get the information that the family is  looking for.
