 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I think that the gentlewoman from Illinois speaks on behalf of a lot  of Members in this Chamber. Nobody wants to see a trade war. Nobody is  advantaged by a trade war.   I think so many of the provisions that are in this underlying bill,  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2, are designed to create more stability for farm  families.   The gentlewoman is absolutely right when she references the  instability trade war conversations create. So much more important,  then, that we come together now to provide that safety net and that  stability that is included here in H.R. 2.   I appreciate the gentlewoman's encouragement that we get to the other  end of these trade negotiations, and I do believe that is something  that we all share.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman just spoke about one of the amendments  that is going to be offered today. In total, there are 51 different  amendments that have been made in order both in the rule that we did  yesterday and this rule that we hope that our colleagues will support  today, 51 different amendments proffered by Members of this Chamber to  try to make this bill better. If we pass this rule today, we will be  able to move to the underlying bill for consideration of those  amendments.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  to associate myself with the gentleman from Florida in his commitment  to public service. He is a relatively new Member to this Chamber, but  he has been fighting for his constituents since he arrived, and I  admire him for that.   There are lot of men and women in this Chamber who fit that bill, Mr.  Speaker. I wish we spent more time celebrating those good public  servants among us.   Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure at this time to yield 5 minutes to  the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), a gentleman who fits exactly  that mold. The gentleman from Maine has come time and time again to  this floor, to committees, every single opportunity he has, to build  bipartisan support, to work together with his colleagues, to work not  just on behalf of the citizens of Maine, but on behalf of all  Americans. He really is a model for energy and partnership on something  that everyone in this Chamber would agree on.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The farm bill is a little different this year than what we have seen  in years past. We would ordinarily have more bipartisan support here on  the floor. We got sideways on a couple of issues early on in the  process, but the arguments that we are hearing aren't different than  the arguments we traditionally hear in a farm bill, as if we are  pitting those families in need of food against those families who  produce the food. We are not.   This bill is H.R. 2 for a reason, Mr. Speaker. A lot of folks don't  understand how bill numbers get handed out in this institution. They  get handed out by order of priority.   H.R. 1 was the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. That bill has brought  unemployment down to the lowest levels in my lifetime and economic  growth to the highest levels we have seen in decades.   H.R. 2 is the farm bill, because if you want to know who benefits  from American farm policy, it is anybody who eats--anybody who eats.   I tell folks, Mr. Speaker, we don't need to give every child a  laptop. We need to send every child on a mission trip around the globe  to see how other families live, to see how other countries do it. We  are so blessed in this country, and we take it for granted oftentimes.   For example, I can put up charts about the distribution of farm  policy until the cows come home, but the largest 15 percent of farms in  this country produce almost 90 percent of all the food.   I will say that again. Those folks who are doing it bigger and better  than anybody else, those 15 percent of farmers produce almost 90  percent of American food. And I will tell you something, Mr. Speaker,  we can't afford to lose those 15 percent of farmers.   What keeps food in this country available and affordable is a  consistent farm policy, which is why, time and time again, Republicans  and Democrats come together from across rural America to try to provide  certainty to American agriculture.   It is the largest part of the Georgia economy, Mr. Speaker:  agriculture. That is true of so many districts, so many States across  this land.   This ought to be a partnership. It is not today, and I regret that.  We are going to have opportunities to make that change going forward,  but just understand, for folks who are here seeing this debate for the  very first time, go back and see the farm bill debate from 5 years ago.  You will see the same accusations. You will see the same  recriminations. You will see the same fear and scare tactics used. Then  you will see a huge bipartisan vote because this bill is so important  to so many Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My colleague has gone through some really challenging times in her  community, and this Chamber has stood with her in those times. She has  been a great advocate for her community in the face of some really  extraordinary disasters.   We can make accusations on this floor all we like, but we could also  spend some time bragging about those things that bring us together.  There are already disaster provisions in law--disaster provisions that  provide specifically disaster SNAP, for example, when communities are  so hard-hit. We do have these conversations, we do have these concerns  for one another and our communities, and we do work together to address  those concerns.   We are not always successful, Mr. Speaker, but I promise you we are  less successful when we don't work together than when we do.   My understanding--I don't sit on the Agriculture Committee, but my  friends across the aisle do--is that not a single Democratic amendment  was offered in committee.   It is my understanding--and, again, I don't sit on the committee. I  don't mind being corrected. I won't be embarrassed at all to have the  Record corrected. But my understanding is there were 5 hours of markup  in the Agriculture Committee, and not one idea for improving the bill  was offered.   Now, that is a legitimate, strategic position to take if folks want  to take it, Mr. Speaker. I just don't understand it as someone who  wants to get the job done and make a difference in a collaborative way  on behalf of the American people.   This bill is getting better every single day. It has gotten better  through every conversation. As you heard my friend from Washington say  in his opening statement, so many farmers with real-world experience-- we heard yesterday from Members who have real-world labor and workforce  development experience. This bill is getting better every time.   If we support the rule that we are discussing at this time, Mr.  Speaker, it will make 31 additional amendments in order so that we can  improve the bill even further.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    I would be happy to answer the inquiry, or we could just  leave it as an inquiry.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, we do have additional speakers remaining,  and, of course, if we make this rule in  [[Page H4158]]  order, if we pass this rule, we will have 31 different amendments and  speakers coming down on each one of those as well.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Georgia is a rural State, like so many jurisdictions represented in  this Chamber. Sometimes you have a big city in one part of the State  and the rest of the State is rural. The conversations we have in  Georgia are often not Republicans against Democrats politically; it is  Atlanta against the rest of the State politically.   Folks often don't connect the dots between the food that they are  buying on the shelf at Kroger being directly related to whether or not  farmers are producing that food in the field.   We have made huge strides in terms of trying to bring more fresh  produce not just into our school systems but into our local farmers  markets, huge strides into making sure that electronic benefits aren't  just able to be used at the local convenience store but are able to be  used in farmers markets so that higher quality produce can end up on  families' tables.                                time  1315    Again, Mr. Speaker, we can find disagreement in every bill that comes  to the floor, but we can also find progress. There is a lot of progress  in this bill. We will support this rule, we will get to the underlying  bill, and we will spend the rest of the day discussing exactly that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we feel very passionately about issues on this floor. I  want to give my colleague from Alabama an opportunity to retract the  accusation that this is a mean-spirited and cruel bill. I know the men  and women who serve on the Agriculture Committee, and they don't have a  mean-spirited or cruel bone in their body. They care about farmers, and  they care about families.   We can argue about whether or not if you are a working aged, able- bodied, childless man in this country whether or not we ought to try to  get you a job while you are collecting Federal benefits. We can talk  about that. I don't  [[Page H4159]]  think that is mean-spirited at all. I don't think that is cruel at all.  I think that is exactly what we ought to be doing to lift families up  out of poverty.   But I would say to my colleagues with their passion--which I know is  heartfelt--feeding hungry children is a shared priority, and we see  that every single day in the bills that are passed here; and we do  damage to this institution and we do damage to the very honest and  needed debates we have in this Chamber when we characterize one another  in ways that we know are not accurate.   I know the men and women on the Agriculture Committee. I know why  they chose to serve on that committee. I believe in the work they are  doing. I regret that we are having this disagreement today, but we  don't need to question each other's motives or integrity in order to  make this debate of value.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), who is one of my classmates in the class of  2011. We were once Budget Committee mates together back in the day.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan. He actually  spent a good deal of his time just the other day in a Budget Committee  hearing trying to help get us some bipartisan solutions.   He got grilled by both the Republicans and the Democrats. Everybody  wanted their ounce of Michigan flesh in that day. But at the end of  that conversation--and I don't say this flippantly--I felt more  optimistic about our coming together and doing some very difficult  infrastructure investments in this country than I did when I walked  into that room.   Those things don't happen without people investing the kind of time  and energy that Representative Kildee has invested over his career. I  want to tell the gentleman how much I appreciate that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would advise my friend I am prepared to  close when he is.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friends on the Agriculture Committee  for the work they did on this bill. It is not easy to do big pieces of  legislation. We do a farm bill every 5 years. It is always a hard thing  to do, and my friends on the Agriculture Committee have taken the  slings and arrows. You have heard the accusations that have been made  just here on the floor today.   The unemployment rate in this country, Mr. Speaker, is as low as it  has ever been in my lifetime, and the number of childless, working-age  men who are sitting it out is as high as it has ever been in my  lifetime.   We can argue about how to care about people more, we can argue about  how to love people more, but I will tell you, helping someone to find a  job matters.   Historically, Mr. Speaker, it is one of those things we agree on. For  whatever reason, we have made it the topic of something we are going to  pretend to disagree on today.   There are more jobs available in this country than ever before. I  think we owe it to families that haven't been able to connect  themselves with that job market to help them to do better.   Mr. Speaker, so often, we talk about all the lawyers in Congress, all  the lawyers who are bureaucrats, all the folks who are working on  policy that they just don't understand. I want to close with where my  colleague from Washington State began. Of course, he is a former  agriculture commissioner from Washington State. He said this.   He said he is not the only farmer in this House. There are 20  farmers, ranchers, and producers serving here in the people's House: an  almond farmer from central California, a blueberry farmer from Maine, a  rancher from South Dakota, a cattleman from Kentucky, a rice farmer  from Minnesota, and a hops farmer from the Yakima Valley in Washington  State.   Mr. Speaker, this body really does reflect working Americans, folks  out there trying to be the breadbasket to the world, trying to put  fresh produce on the shelves for every American family to benefit from.  This bill continues our commitment to serving the hungry, and it  continues our commitment to being the finest agricultural production  nation that this planet has ever seen.   Vote ``yes'' on this rule. Let's consider some amendments to make  this bill even better, and then let's send it to the Senate and give  the American people a bill they can be proud of.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
