 Madam Speaker, the average price of gasoline has more than  doubled since President Biden was sworn into office. That is not a  coincidence. After all, before he took office, he told us he would  ``end fossil fuel.''   Now, Americans are finding out the hard way what happens when we  elect a President that wants to end fossil fuels. The cost of living  rises faster than we can keep up with because almost everything we  wear, eat, and use is transported using fossil fuels.   Meanwhile, yesterday, the President announced he would be invoking  the Defense Production Act to make more solar panels. Give me a break.   The President needs to concede his war against American energy and  allow companies to drill and explore for new oil. It is that easy. Yet,  he refuses.   President Biden simply must do better.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia for  yielding me time to speak on this very important and lifesaving program  as we commemorate the 30th anniversary of the creation of the 340B  program.   I applaud the gentlewoman from Virginia for her leadership on this  issue and for organizing this opportunity for Members on both sides to  speak about how important this issue is to each of our districts.   I also thank the other Members here tonight and those who routinely  support the 340B program. More than 220 Members of the House recently  joined a letter to Health and Human Services, urging the Department to  crack down on drug companies denying 340B discounts. By having such a  large group of Members in support of that letter, to which I proudly  lent my name, we demonstrated the broad bipartisan support the 340B  program enjoys across the entire country.   Madam Speaker, I include the text of that letter in the Record.                                     Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, February 26, 2021.      Acting Secretary Cochran,      Department of Health and Human Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Acting Secretary Cochran: We write today as leading       congressional proponents of the 340B drug discount program to       ask you to take immediate action to ensure that manufacturers       are prohibited from imposing unilateral changes to the       program in direct conflict with congressional intent and       decades of written guidance.        We were pleased to see 28 attorneys general urge former HHS       Secretary Azar to protect the 340B programs. We believe that       letter and the Department's Office of General Counsel's       advisory opinion, released on December 30 and described       below, represent some of the most compelling legal arguments       for the actions we ask you to take.        As you know, Congress enacted the 340B Drug Pricing Program       in 1992 following the creation of the Medicaid Drug Rebate       Program. In order for their drugs to be covered by Medicaid,       manufacturers are required to offer discounts to certain       public and nonprofit health care organizations known as       covered entities, including Federally Qualified Health       Centers, Ryan White HIV/AIDS Clinics, Medicare/Medicaid       Disproportionate Share hospitals, rural hospitals, and       children's hospitals. According to the legislative history,       Congress's intent in creating the discount program was to       ``stretch scarce federal resources to reach more eligible       patients and provide more comprehensive services.''        The 340B statute requires drug manufacturers to ``offer       each covered entity covered outpatient drugs for purchase at       or below the applicable ceiling price.'' There are no       provisions in the statute that allow manufacturers to set       conditions or otherwise impede a provider's ability to access       340B discounts. The Health Resources and Services       Administration (HRSA), which oversees the program, has       indicated on multiple occasions, dating back to the early       years of the program, that the 340B statute requires       manufacturers to provide 340B discounts to covered entities       when covered entities purchase drugs to be dispensed through       contract pharmacies on a covered entity's behalf.        Beginning in the summer of 2020, several drug manufacturers       began to announce a range of actions to avoid honoring 340B       discounts for certain drugs, many with the highest prices,       delivered to covered entities' contract pharmacies. Some       manufacturers have announced they will no longer ship       discounted drugs to contract pharmacies; others will ship to       only one contract pharmacy per covered entity.        HHS has reviewed manufacturers' refusals to provide 340B       discounts to covered entities' contract pharmacies and found       them to be unlawful. In a December 30th 2020 advisory       opinion, then-general counsel Robert Charrow wrote, ``[T]he       core requirement of the 340B statute . . . is that       manufacturers must ``offer'' covered outpatient drugs at or       below the ceiling price for ``purchase by'' covered entities.       This fundamental requirement is not qualified, restricted, or       dependent on how the covered entity chooses to distribute the       covered outpatient drugs.''        Unfortunately, publishing the advisory opinion has not       deterred manufacturers from continuing with unlawful price       hikes. Many covered entities are struggling with severe       financial losses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. They       cannot afford to be unfairly targeted by large pharmaceutical       corporations or be forced to pay higher up-front costs for       the drugs their patients need.        Furthermore, an information technology company has allied       with manufacturers to change the 340B program from one of       upfront discounts to post-sale rebates, a change that would       greatly increase costs for covered entities and give       manufacturers tremendous leverage over covered entities. Such       action is inconsistent with HRSA's long-standing guidance       that the 340B program is an up-front discount program.''        The December 14th letter from the attorneys general called       on HHS to ``address drug manufacturers' unlawful refusal to       provide critical drug discounts to covered entities.''       Consistent with that letter, we urge you to:        1. Begin assessing civil monetary penalties on       manufacturers that deny 340B pricing to  [[Page H5326]]       covered entities in violation of their obligations under the       340B statute;        2. Require manufacturers to refund covered entities the       discounts they have unlawfully withheld since 2020;        3. Halt, through guidance or other means, any attempt to       unilaterally change 340B upfront discounts to post sale       rebates; and        4. Immediately seat the Administrative Dispute Resolution       Panel to begin processing disputes within the program.        As the attorneys general stated in their December 14th       letter, ``Each day that drug manufacturers violate their       statutory obligations, vulnerable patients and their health       care centers are deprived of the essential healthcare       resources Congress intended to provide.'' Thank you very much       for your prompt consideration of these important matters.     Madam Speaker, even though the 340B program has received  such overwhelming support from Members of Congress, multiple  administrations, hospitals, doctors, pharmacists, and patients, it  still finds itself struggling to survive from relentless efforts to  undermine its existence by some pharmaceutical companies refusing to  abide by the law. HHS must take immediate enforcement action against  all of these noncompliant drug companies.   As many of us here tonight understand, the 340B program is an  important avenue for offering lower drug prices for our most vulnerable  citizens. It is often a lifeline of financial support for the small,  rural hospitals in middle Tennessee and across the country. These very  same hospitals are often the only source of care for communities in  expansive geographic areas.   I have no other word to describe it other than ``unconscionable''  that companies founded to help sick patients by providing lifesaving  medication deliberately undermine a law to increase affordable access  to their lifesaving medications. It is truly disgraceful.   Tonight, we are going to hear more about this malpractice. I hope by  highlighting this issue here on the floor of the U.S. House of  Representatives, we will encourage other Members of the House and the  Senate to take immediate and decisive action to protect the 340B  program.    Madam Speaker, I want to talk a little more about the  importance of H.R. 4390, the PROTECT 340B Act of 2021, which was  introduced by the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley), my  friend, and is co-led by the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms.  Spanberger), the lead organizer of this Special Order.   Passage of the PROTECT 340B Act of 2021 is essential in order to push  back against recent attacks on the 340B program.   This bill would prohibit pharmacy benefit managers, otherwise known  as PBMs, from discriminating against 340B providers or their contract  pharmacies.   The PROTECT 340B Act is supported by America's Essential Hospitals,  340B Health, National Association of Community Health Centers, and Ryan  White Clinics for 340B Access. To ensure PBMs are held accountable, it  allows the HHS Secretary to impose civil monetary penalties.   This is the definition of a good bill. It has broad, bipartisan  support in the House as well as among outside groups, and it even has  an enforcement mechanism that hits the bad actors where it hurts them  most--their pocketbooks.    Madam Speaker, again, I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia  for yielding, and I join her in calling on our colleagues to join us in  this effort to preserve and protect the 340B program.   I will share a success story that highlights how Members worked in a  bipartisan way to solve a major issue within the 340B program.   Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, some hospitals lost their 340B  eligibility due to the influx of COVID-19 patients that overwhelmed  some hospitals and diminished their ability to meet the requirements of  the 340B program. Two of those hospitals were in my district in rural  Tennessee. However, the gentlewoman from California, Representative  Matsui, introduced H.R. 3203, which was designed to restore eligibility  to hospitals that lost their 340B status due to the pandemic. I was  proud to lend my name as a cosponsor to this bipartisan bill.   I am happy to report that because of this bipartisan support and the  leadership of Members like Representative Matsui, this issue was fixed  in section 121 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022. Because  of this bipartisan effort, I am pleased to report back that both  hospitals in my district in Tennessee have since regained that 340B  eligibility.   Madam Speaker, I hope this story shows that Members are capable of  protecting and strengthening the 340B program in a bipartisan way.    Madam Speaker, again, I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia  (Ms. Spanberger). She has done a commendable job putting tonight's  Special Order together, gathering support from both sides of the aisle  to come speak here tonight about the 340B program, and being one of the  Members leading the fight to protect the lifesaving 340B program.   Madam Speaker, by their presence on the House floor tonight and the  persuasive and powerful words they have spoken, these Members have sent  the unmistakable signal that we are all resolutely prepared to fight on  behalf of our constituents who benefit from the 340B program, even if  it ruffles some powerful feathers.   If Big Pharma would just play by the rules and abide by the law, I am  sure we wouldn't be in the position we are today. However, the big  pharmaceutical companies aren't playing by the rules, and they are  showing no signs that they have an interest in doing so.   All we are asking is that they, too, are held accountable to the law.  That is it. Nothing more, nothing less. In the meantime, we will  continue to push back on their brazen attempts to undermine the law  because I know we are on the right side of this fight.   I encourage all Members to reach out to the Federally qualified  health centers, the Ryan White Clinics, Medicare/Medicaid  Disproportionate Share hospitals, rural hospitals, and children's  hospitals in your districts that are 340B participants. You will find  that the 340B program has an enormous impact on communities all across  this country.   Lastly, I reiterate my support for H.R. 4390, the Protect 340B Act,  and I sincerely beseech House leadership to bring the bill to the floor  for a vote.
