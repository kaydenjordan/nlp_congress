 Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the  350th anniversary of the town of Suffield, CT. The celebration of this  historic milestone, actually achieved last year in the height of the  pandemic, is just as deserved as it is overdue.   How lucky Connecticut is to have won Suffield away from neighboring  Massachusetts in 1749. With roots dating back to the 1600s, Suffield's  early days were defined by the bounty of its fertile farmland along the  western banks of the Connecticut River. Soon, beautiful Colonial and  Victorian-era homes were built along the town's now iconic Main Street.  Industry and commerce began to flourish, and by the 1900s, Suffield was  a model Connecticut town, able to marry together agrarian humility and  forward-looking modernity into one common identity.   Today, Suffield still boasts bucolic farms, breathtaking views from  the Metacomet Ridge, and historic architecture. But a thriving small  business  [[Page S7338]]  community, a top-rate school system, and active civic groups are  showing the way to the future.   For three and a half centuries, Suffield has been a foundational part  of the rich history of the Connecticut River Valley. The town has come  a long way since its inception and continues to evolve with the times,  while maintaining its idyllic, small-town charm. Congratulations again  to the entire town of Suffield on this impressive anniversary: I am  grateful to represent a town with such a storied past and an equally  bright future.                            ____________________
