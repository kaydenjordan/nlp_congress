 Mr. Speaker, due to my attention being required  in the matter of life-or-death circumstances of a constituent, I was  unable to attend the vote series today. Had I been present, I would  have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 213 and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 214.                             personal explanation
