 Mr. President, I rise today to continue a discussion we  have had on the floor over the last year or so on the issue of  opioids--that would be addiction to heroin, prescription drugs, and now  this new form of synthetic heroin coming into our communities called  fentanyl or carfentanil.   Sadly, I must say that things are not getting better. In fact, in the  States we represent, in our communities, we see more and more evidence  of not just addiction but overdoses and deaths. Fentanyl, in  particular, is more deadly than heroin--30 to 50 times more powerful-- and is resulting in not just more overdoses but more deaths per  overdose. This has become a crisis to the point that it is the No. 1  cause of death in my home State of Ohio and across the country,  surpassing car accidents.   This is the 35th time I have come to the floor to talk about this  issue and what we ought to do. We have made progress. In the last year  alone, we passed legislation, including the Comprehensive Addiction and  Recovery Act, to help with prevention, treatment, and recovery, and to  help our law enforcement and other first responders, with Narcan, be  able to reduce the number of deaths--this miracle drug that reverses  the overdoses--to be able to save lives.   We also passed the Cures legislation, which sent money straight back  to the States that would help to provide the treatment that is so badly  needed. Probably 8 out of 10 people who are addicted are not receiving  treatment. Sadly, there is a revolving door where people are coming  under the grip of this addiction, committing crimes, going to prison,  getting out, getting into the addiction again, and going back into the  criminal justice system once again.   This legislation we passed is now starting to be implemented. It  takes a little while for things to get moving around here. I am happy  to say that the States have now received some of this funding. Some of  the programs--about half of those in the Comprehensive Addiction and  Recovery Act are now implemented. I urge the administration to  implement the other half of the programs, and I have done that every  time I have come to the floor over the last few months.   Unfortunately, I also have to come to the floor today to talk about  something that is going to make it harder to address this issue should  it become reality. As some of you may know, recently it was reported  that there was a document from the White House Office of Management and  Budget saying that the White House is considering cutting funding  dramatically for the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the ONDCP.  This is the office that coordinates the drug issue for the White House,  the administration. The proposal that was leaked to the media said that  it would be a cut from $388 million a year to $24 million a year. That  is a cut of 95 percent. What does that mean? It means the staff would  be, obviously, reduced dramatically. They have 33 people who would lose  their jobs, people who are out there every day on the frontlines,  trying to use a relatively small number of people to expand this effort  all over the country. It would eliminate a lot of grant programs,  office administrators, including what is called the High Intensity Drug  Trafficking Areas Program, or HIDTA, and a program called the Drug-Free  Communities Support Program.   I want to touch on those two programs quickly and make the point as  to how important they are, hoping that the administration is hearing us  and hoping my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will help us ensure  that this proposal does not become reality, that we don't end up, at a  time when we have an unprecedented drug crisis in this country--the  worst drug epidemic we have had in our lifetime--pulling back on these  important programs.   Why does this matter? Again, having a drug czar, which is what the  Director of the Office of National Drug Policy is called, is very  important to coordinate the efforts. In fact, it is cost-effective to  have a drug czar rather than having different agencies and departments  competing and sometimes in duplication with each other, to have one  person in the White House in charge, talking about the importance of  this.   President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan established the  drug czar. The reason they did it was they wanted to be sure America  and the White House were speaking with one voice on this issue. I have  known every drug czar since then. I have known every one of them over  the last--what would that be?--30 years. I think it is incredibly  important to have this job filled with the right person to get out  there and deliver this message that it is important that we work  together on prevention and education to try to keep people out of drugs  altogether, and should people become addicted, how do we maximize the  chances of their success by getting them into treatment and recovery?   The program I mentioned a minute ago, the High Intensity Drug  Trafficking Areas Program, is one that pretty much every Senator knows  about. Why? Because in pockets of every State, there are areas in which  there is a particular problem with drugs. This program, the High  Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program, does something unique. It  says: OK, we  [[Page S2834]]  are going to put Federal law enforcement together with State law  enforcement and local law enforcement to intensely focus on this issue  at the local level. As you know, that is necessary because so much of  this is interstate, even international, and by having this intense  focus, there has been enormous success in my State and States around  the country.   Under the program, you have to have one full-time law enforcement  officer at the Federal level, State level, and the local level. What I  have found back home is that typically you have a sheriff or a police  chief who runs this locally and has a lot of his officers involved but  really is able to maximize what he or she can do because you have this  involvement from the State highway patrol, you have this involvement  from the FBI, you have this coordination.    The Ohio HIDTA alone has removed $90 million worth of illicit drugs  from our streets. It has apprehended more than 4,000 fugitives involved  in drug trafficking operations. Think about the difference that makes.  It makes our communities safer; ultimately, of course, it is going to  save a lot of lives.   So I think this is one that is really working. If you ask your law  enforcement locally about it, they will tell you that if they don't  have a HIDTA grant, they probably wish they did. It is very  competitive; not everyone can get one. But if you can show that you can  use the money effectively and if you have a really serious drug problem  in your area, having that HIDTA program is important.   The second program I mentioned is called the Drug-Free Communities  Support Program. What does this do? This supports community anti-drug  coalitions all around the country. Often, people ask me: What is the  solution to this problem? Why are we in the situation we are in? I turn  to prevention and education because, if you think about it, once you  get into that funnel of addiction, it is very costly and very  difficult.   Wouldn't it be better if we had better programs out there? Frankly,  we did back in the 1980s and even the 1990s--to tell young people and  to tell others why it is such a mistake to get into this drug issue,  why they must do everything they can to avoid, in the case of heroin  and prescription drugs and other opioids, taking these painkillers,  these prescription drugs that are addictive, to the point that you  become addicted, which is so often where the heroin addiction and the  overdoses start.   Four out of five heroin addicts in the country started with  prescription drugs, they say. Getting that information out there, that  awareness, is incredibly important. That is what this Drug-Free  Communities Program is about.   I got involved in this program early on through a personal  experience. I was a first-year Member of the House of Representatives  23 years ago. A woman whose son had died of an overdose came to see me.  She came to see me because she wanted to talk about her experience and  what were we going to do about it.   At the time, Bill Clinton was President. I went to an event where  both President Clinton and I were given a gold ID bracelet by a young  man. The young man's name was Jeffrey Gardner. I put Jeffrey Gardner's  ID bracelet on, and then I prepared for my meeting with this mother,  who was obviously very upset.   She was there with her younger son. She came to my office. I was  prepared for her. My staff had done all the research, and we knew there  was about $15 billion a year being spent on drug interdiction,  interdicting drugs coming from other countries, incarcerations and  prosecutions, and the eradication of drugs overseas in places like  Colombia, where a lot of cocaine was being grown at that time. So I  told her that. I said: Your tax dollars are being used well to fight  this battle. This is what is happening with your dollars.   She looked at me and said: How does that help me? She said: I went to  my church. I went to my school to get them to help, to mobilize people,  to provide more prevention and education resources, to get the word  out. They were in denial. They said: This does not happen here.   She said: I went to my neighbors and tried to get a community meeting  together, and people did not show up.   She said: How does interdicting drugs help me? How does the work on  eradication overseas help me?   I did more research and looked into it further and talked to people  around the country who were experts on this and found out where there  was this community-of-support network, bringing in all sectors of the  community. It really made a difference to reduce drug abuse.   So we started this program. This program, the Drug-Free Communities  Act, has to be made up of all sectors of the community. We are talking  about the religious community, faith leaders--very important--but also  teachers, police officers, parents, doctors, other community leaders  who come together with this intense focus on education and prevention.   The program we put together has real accountability. You know, I am a  Republican. I believe in accountability. I want to be sure tax dollars  are being used wisely. To receive funding under this program,  coalitions are required to be in existence for 6 months before they can  even apply--get on their feet, be sure they are working. It is the only  Federal drug abuse prevention program that requires that, by the way.   The coalition is required to go through a year-long training academy  to ensure they have the skills necessary to effectively reduce drug  rates, and they have to have data to show that their efforts are  actually working. There have to be performance measures in place. In  these coalitions, there are surveys done in schools to see what the  results are.   These coalitions are made up of people who are on the front lines.  They know their communities better than anybody else does. That is why  they are more effective than anybody else. They know how to reach  people in that setting, know how to respond quickly when problems  begin.   In communities with these coalitions, use of alcohol, tobacco,  prescription drugs, marijuana, and cocaine by our young people have  declined: alcohol, 32-percent decline; tobacco, 38-percent decline;  other drugs, including prescription drugs, 21-percent decline. So these  things work.   I must say, I have seen it firsthand because, before drafting the  legislation, I started my own coalition called the Coalition for a  Drug-Free Greater Cincinnati. Twenty-three years ago, we started this  coalition, and we did it with, again, all members of the community.    In my case, I reached out to the first lady, Hope Taft of our State;  also to a religious leader in our community, Damon Lynch, Jr., one of  the most respected community leaders and at that time head of the  Baptist Ministers Conference; and the former CEO of Procter & Gamble,  John Petter, so we brought in the business community as well.   We established this coalition not thinking that we were going to end  up applying for Federal grant money because there was no Federal grant  program then, but that we would focus on how to ensure we could  actually make a difference. We set up a survey that went to two-thirds  of the schools in our community and asked questions about drug use, so  we would know if our efforts were working or not working, as the case  might be, and how to target our efforts toward parents and teachers. We  spent a lot of time in the faith community, but also with coaches and  athletic directors.   This program is still going. It is called Prevention First. I chaired  it for 9 years. I was on the board of the coalition again before I ran  for the Senate. I know it works because I have seen it. We have gotten  good results. The coalition tells me that since 2000, alcohol use among  young people they worked with in Cincinnati has gone down 46 percent;  tobacco use, 61 percent; marijuana use, 22 percent.   Since 2012, which is when we started focusing on the prescription  drug issue, there has been a decline by 29 percent in the use of  prescription drugs by our young people. So, I think, this program,  which by the way, cost about 90 million bucks last year--as someone who  was a distinguished military officer told me recently: That is about  what we charge to keep the lights on in part of the Pentagon every day,  not that I am not for more and smarter defense spending; I am, but $90  million is  [[Page S2835]]  what we are talking about for this program during the time of the worst  drug crisis in the history of our country.   I just think this impact, which I have seen, really works. It means  less crime, less strain on our healthcare system, more productivity in  school, more productivity at work, more people who can pass a drug test  and go to work. That benefits all of us, and it saves taxpayer dollars.   The success we had in this coalition, again, led me to the  legislation. A Democratic Representative from Michigan, Sandy Levin,  and I introduced the legislation, bipartisan in the House.   Here in the Senate, the leaders who were the leaders of this  legislation are still here and continue to support it; that is, Senator  Chuck Grassley and Senator Patrick Leahy--again a bipartisan group. The  bill, the Drug-Free Communities Act, is, again, based on these lead  documents from the administration, one of the programs they have  proposed defunding altogether.   I am hopeful that this legislation, the Drug-Free Communities Act,  which has really worked--it has provided funding that has spawned over  2,000 community coalitions around the country. Today, it currently  mobilizes 9,000 community volunteers all around the country. I am  hopeful that we will not be defunding this program but, instead,  focusing more on the issues of prevention and education. That is going  to be the long-term solution to this drug problem. Yes, we have to get  treatment to those who need it, but if we are not working on prevention  and awareness and education, the issues of drug addiction and drug  abuse are going to continue to get worse, in my view.   I am a former Budget Director. I understand it is a tough job to look  at all the different competing priorities when you are trying to save  taxpayer dollars. I get that. But I also get that we don't want to take  a program like this that is actually working, that has all of these  accountability measures in place to be sure that taxpayer dollars are  being spent right, and then get rid of it at a time that we have this  growing crisis in our country.   When I first got involved in this issue 22 years ago, I became  convinced pretty quickly that one reason the drug issue had raised its  ugly head in the 1990s is that we took our eye off the ball. I think in  the 1980s, under the leadership of President Reagan and First Lady  Nancy Reagan and Bill Bennett, who did an awesome job as drug czar, we  made real progress, particularly on the issue of cocaine.   I think there was sort of a sense that we had solved that problem,  and it was time to focus on other things. So we took our eye off the  ball. That is why you saw, in the 1990s when the Drug-Free Communities  Act legislation was necessary, there was a big increase in drug use,  particularly among our young people. So I was always worried that we  might do that again, that when there was a reduction in drug use, we  might say: Well, that problem is behind us; let's move onto the next  one.   The problem was never behind us, sadly. It is like the tide. It just  keeps coming in, so you have to keep your focus on it. But I will tell  you, I never expected that at a time when we would have a substantial  increase in drug use, in crime, in overdoses, in deaths--which is what  we have experienced in this country over the past few years--that we  would cut these programs. I just did not imagine it. So I am concerned  about it. We can't take our eye off the ball, particularly at a time  like this. We have to be sure that we are supporting these programs  that work.   Let me show you a chart that tells you where we are today. This is  the number of drug overdose deaths in our great country from 1999 to  2015, the most recent year for which we have data. Look at this line  here. This is opioid painkillers, this is fentanyl, and this is heroin.  You see this incredible increase. Sadly, I will tell you that in 2016  and 2017, it keeps going up.   This year, we have had more opioid overdose deaths over the first few  months than we had in the same period last year. In fact, here is one  example. In Cleveland, OH, in the last 10 months, we have had more  overdose deaths from fentanyl than we had in the previous 10 years. So  it is sad that it is not getting better; it is getting worse.   Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of accidental death in the  United States, surpassing car accidents. This is, again, a troubling  chart, but we need to look at it. We hear a lot about homicides, and  gun homicides, in particular. We hear about car crashes. Here is an  example of HIV/AIDS in 1995, a time that was the height of the HIV/AIDS  crisis, when all of us reacted appropriately.   Here we are in drug overdoses in 2015--far worse than any of these.  So between prescription painkillers, heroin, and synthetic forms of  heroin, drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in  the United States of America.   According to CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  more Americans died from drug overdoses in 2015, again, than died in  the AIDS epidemic in 1995. A recent story in the New York Times said  there are more than four times as many people dying every day from this  epidemic than were dying at the peak of the crack epidemic.   Another way to look at it, sadly, is that more people died in the  last 3 years than died in the Vietnam War. Those are tough things to  compare, but the point is, this is not a time for us to be gutting  these programs. Fortunately, we have these programs in place to help.  Let's use them to try to encourage more prevention and more education.   Here is a chart that just shows where heroin and fentanyl are. Again,  from 1999 to 2015, this is heroin, this is fentanyl. Look at the rise  of this over the last few years. That is what we are dealing with. That  is the reality. That is what is happening in the communities and in our  streets.    You might ask yourself, why do we want to cut this back at this  point? My understanding is that some have argued we don't need the  program. They said this program is duplicative because we have other  programs now, including great legislation passed last year that I  mentioned earlier called the 21st Century Cures Act. In fact, the  author of that legislation just joined us on the floor, Senator  Alexander of Tennessee.   They have said the Drug-Free Communities Act may be a duplication of  that CURES Program. That is an entirely different program--again, $90  million a year. CURES is $500 million a year needed right now.   I was a strong supporter of the CURES Act, and I again thank my  colleague for working with some of us who have been focused on this  issue, as he has, to get that legislation passed on a bipartisan basis.   The 21st Century CURES Act provides $500 million, but it provides  that funding over this year and next, over 2 years. It is a temporary  increase in funding to deal with the real crisis. This will help fill  the gaps, but it does not ensure that $1 of that money goes toward this  evidence-based prevention we talked about today.   Second, these programs have distinct goals. The CURES grants can be  used however a State wants, and that is appropriate. In Ohio, I know  Governor Kasich and the State legislature are focused on using it in a  smart way, focused mostly on treatment which is badly needed. As I  noted, 8 out of 10 people who are addicted and need treatment are not  getting the treatment they need. We need more treatment facilities in  some communities where the treatment is not available.   The Drug-Free Communities Act is specifically focused on this  prevention through education at the community level. Funding goes  directly to these coalitions I talked about and their focus is on  prevention. It is not duplication. One is a prevention program focused  on the community level, and one is an open-ended grant to the States.  There is no other Federal program that funds evidenced-based prevention  at the community level and has these measures except this one.   The accountability measures we talked about are important, and that  distinguishes it from CURES or anything else. We require that  communities provide matching funds, a one-to-one match. So if a dollar  of Federal tax dollars goes out, it has to be matched by a dollar of  non-Federal tax dollars just to get the funding.   We put a cap on administrative expenses of 8 percent to ensure that  we maximize the amount of funding going into these programs. If you  want funding in your coalition, you have to keep  [[Page S2836]]  your funding below 8 percent. That ensures that a maximum amount of  funding goes into these programs. We specifically included strict  accountability measures to ensure the highest level of support in  solving the substance abuse crisis every community faces. These  programs are effective. They use taxpayer dollars well, and cutting  them doesn't make sense.   One of the reasons I believe President Trump was elected was that he  had the courage and foresight to talk about this issue on the campaign  trail. He talked about addiction, whether he was in New Hampshire,  Ohio, or other States where we have a high level of heroin,  prescription drug, and fentanyl abuse and addiction. He spoke with a  passion about this and the toll it has on our citizens and devastation  to our communities. I think that was one reason he was elected. He  focused on how we would stop this epidemic. This proposal apparently  put forward by Members of his administration runs counter to what he  talked about during the campaign.   Earlier today, my original House cosponsor of the Drug-Free Community  Act, Congressman Sandy Levin, and I sent a letter to the Office of  Management and Budget Director, Mick Mulvaney, encouraging him not to  pursue this course of action.   More importantly, more than 219 nonpartisan public health groups-- experts like the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Public  Health Association, the Northern Ohio Recovery Association, the  Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America, and other groups sent a  letter to the White House expressing their support for the work of the  Office of National Drug Control Policy.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                        May 8, 2017.      Re Revise OMB's proposed budget slashing drug control funding       Mr. Reed Cordish,      Senior Adviser to the President,      The White House.        Dear Mr. Cordish: We are thankful to the Trump       Administration for prioritizing the reduction of drug use,       drug trafficking, and its consequences. We represent former       and current federal, state, and local officials, hundreds of       community-based organizations, and tens of thousands of       people working in drug prevention, drug treatment, drug       treatment courts, mental health, recovery, medicine, law       enforcement, and millions of individuals in recovery from       alcohol and drug use disorders. Like the Administration, we       believe drugs are a serious issue.        In light of the Administration's prioritization, we write       in strong support of the Office of National Drug Control       Policy (ONDCP) and the critically important Drug Free       Communities (DFC) program, which provides funding directly to       communities to prevent drug use. DFC-funded coalitions are       proven to effectively reduce alcohol, tobacco, marijuana and       prescription drug misuse among middle and high school-aged       children. The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA)       program, which coordinates federal, state, and local law       enforcement, streamlines efforts to dismantle drug       trafficking organizations and brings drug traffickers to       justice.        As we have written before, ONDCP brings essential expertise       to the table on complex drug issues, expertise that would       otherwise be missing or dispersed across multiple agencies.       ONDCP holds all federal, state, and local agencies       accountable for achieving specific goals to reduce drug       trafficking, use, and other consequences.        At a time when drugs now kill more people than firearms or       car crashes, it is more important than ever for ONDCP to       remain a strong voice in the White House and a visible       presence nationally. As plans are finalized for the       Administration's proposed FY 2018 budget, we once again ask       the Administration to maintain a strong commitment to ONDCP       by proposing the highest level of funding possible for the       agency and its programs given the importance of ONDCP's       mission and the current opioid crisis.

Mr. President, these groups know that the proposed cuts  would undermine our anti-drug efforts at a time when we need them more  than ever. So I ask my colleagues to join me in urging the OMB Director  and the folks in the White House who are making these decisions not to  take this course of action but rather to support our proven community  anti-drug coalition, to support ONDCP in doing the important work at a  time of a growing epidemic. We have never needed these programs more  than we do right now.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield back my time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.
