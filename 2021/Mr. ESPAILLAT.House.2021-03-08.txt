 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the life and  memory of Ariel Gibbs whom we lost 5 years ago.   Ariel was a beloved neighbor and friend to so many members of our  East Harlem community. She loved working with seniors and children and  helping improve the lives of those around her. She was a direct care  worker at United Cerebral Palsy and often volunteered at after-school  programs in her community.   Ariel will continue to be remembered as a strong, wise leader and a  dedicated friend and daughter, as well as a loving mother. Her two  energetic and inquisitive sons, now 6 and 7 years old, as well as her  many friends and family members--including her dynamic dad, Eddie  Gibbs, a leader in East Harlem--will always hold her in their hearts.                            ____________________
