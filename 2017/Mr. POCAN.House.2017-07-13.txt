 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about a vital tool for  ensuring workers are able to secure good-paying, family-supporting  jobs, and that is apprenticeships.   I grew up in Kenosha, Wisconsin, a working class town with a very  large skilled trade presence. I understand what good, middle class jobs  look like, and the impact they can have on a community. A good middle  class paycheck ensures people can afford a mortgage, have healthcare  for their families, take a family vacation, and send their kids to  college if they want to; and that is what we need right now are more  higher-paying jobs.   But not everyone goes to a traditional 4-year college or university,  nor does every job require this type of degree. That is why, for many,  apprenticeships are the key to family-supporting wages.   Apprenticeship programs have proven very effective at helping prepare  workers for careers in highly skilled professions. This bill would  increase the number of highly skilled workers in the United States and  strengthen apprenticeship programs as an effective earn-and-learn model  for students, workers, and employers.                                time  1330    It is a win-win for workers and businesses. The LEARNS Act supports  closer connections between registered apprenticeship programs,  employers, and others offering good-paying jobs.   But there is a problem. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle  like to talk about their support of apprenticeships. I hear the  Secretary of Labor talk about them. I even hear the President talk  about them. But that is all it is: talk.   As a new member of the Appropriations Committee, I was shocked to see  that Republicans' newly released Labor-HHS funding proposal entirely  eliminates Department of Labor apprenticeship grants. Again, that  appropriations proposal cuts $95 million from apprenticeship funding,  every singer dollar in the program. There is not a penny left to  connect workers and businesses with apprenticeships.   You can't have it both ways. If you support apprenticeships and job  training for workers, then you should support funding for job training  and apprenticeship programs. It is pretty simple.   If Republicans are serious about job creation, about training workers  for a 21st century economy, and they actually want to do more than talk  about jobs and apprenticeships, then we should move forward to defeat  the previous question in order the bring forward the LEARNS Act.   Walk the walk, Mr. Speaker. Talk is cheap. The American people  deserve action. I urge all of my colleagues to defeat the previous  question.
