 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my coanchor, my  distinguished colleague Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee for her  tremendous leadership and for anchoring this Special Order hour, and,  of course, our chairwoman, Joyce Beatty, for her tremendous leadership  in leading the Congressional Black Caucus, which represents more than  17 million Black constituents across this great country. We represent  not only Black Americans, but all Americans, diverse Americans. And  what those Americans have been telling me in my district back home in  Nevada's Fourth District, it is time for us to build back better and to  do it in a more equitable and inclusive way.   Tonight, we are here to bring attention to the fact that we are  standing at a crossroads of history. With the bipartisan infrastructure  deal and the Build Back Better Act, Congress has the opportunity to  finally rebuild our economy to deliver huge tax cuts to the middle  class and to lower the cost of living for families on everything from  childcare to healthcare.   The question is: Will our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  work with us to deliver these important investments on behalf of the  American people? Now, we have seen transformative legislation like this  before when Congress worked to rebuild the American society in the wake  of the Great Depression, but never, and I mean never, have people of  color benefited like they could under the Build Back Better Act.   I think it is our majority whip,  Jim Clyburn, who has talked about  the history of these other measures and how they actually left entire  communities out. They left women out. They left communities of color  out, and we are still dealing with the systemic issues of being left  out of those policies for far too long.   So I want to again thank our leadership because it wasn't just this  bill and the drafting of this bill and, yes, President Biden wrote this  bill, he wrote it with the support of his team at the White House, but  with a whole lot of good input from colleagues over here in the  Capitol, including here in the Congressional Black Caucus.                                time  2015    I know that there are colleagues of mine who have been working on key  elements of this bill for a very long time. I know that they, like  myself, are ready to act on behalf of the American people.   So I look forward to having a little bit of a colloquy with my  colleague from Wisconsin. I believe that it is so important, Mr.  Speaker, that we talk about what is in this bill. For far too long,  people have been focused about a top-line number, about the process,  about the personalities here on Capitol Hill and whether certain  factions are with the bill or working on the bill. With all due  respect, I want to talk about policy and the policy that affects  people, the people in my district, in Nevada's Fourth District, and the  people all across this country.   Why? Because the Build Back Better Act will cut childcare costs. For  families that are eligible under this bill, they won't pay more than 7  percent of their household income to cover childcare, something that  women and communities of color desperately need as we talk about the  workforce shortage and the inequities that are in our workforce.   What sense does it make when someone who has to work--I will give you  an example--Ms. Rosetta, who is a constituent of mine, is a home care  worker. I had a roundtable with her and some other home care workers.  She shared with me that when she started her job several years ago, she  got paid $9.50 an hour. Today, she makes just over $10 an hour. Think  about that.   For several years, this woman, who is a home care worker, who goes  into elderly citizens' homes to take care of them, to make sure that  they are fed, that they are bathed, that literally she changes their  diapers, she is their companion, she hasn't been given a raise of more  than 50 cents over the course of several years. That is unconscionable.   Under the Build Back Better Act, we are actually investing in home  care workers, not only to help make that profession what it should be,  an honorable one that pays them what they are worth, but also equips  them with the support that they need for their own families. Why is it  okay for them to take care of other people's families and then not even  have the resources and the means to take care of their own?   It also gives every child a head start with universal pre-K for 3-  and 4-year-olds. Mr. Speaker, we have talked a lot about how we help  young people get the start they need in life, and we know that by  investing in their early success, it improves academic skill  attainment, allowing them to read at an early age. Reading is essential  to every other subject that they have to learn. It will ensure that  they improve their graduation rates, which improves their life chances  of success.   To my colleagues on the other side, when you say that we are spending  too much in this package, are we spending too much for that home care  worker, for Rosetta, and so many other people like her? Are we spending  too much to give working families the support they need to be able to  afford childcare? Are we spending too much so that every child in our  country has a good start through universal prekindergarten? These are  but just a few of the benefits.   Now, before I go on and I yield to my colleague here, I want to talk  about one other important element. We have spent a lot of time on the  Build Back Better Act, but I am also for the bipartisan infrastructure  deal. Why? Yes, it is going to create millions of good-paying, union  jobs. Yeah, I have no problem saying ``union'' here in this body,  because it is the unions that helped build the middle class. If we are  going to build this country back better, we need to do it with unions  at the center of it.   Not only does it do that, it expands broadband access, providing  broadband connectivity in our households in rural communities and in  urban areas.   My district covers 52,000 square miles. I have parts of Las Vegas and  North Las Vegas that need broadband, but I have six rural communities  throughout Nevada, many of them that do not have adequate broadband. In  fact, it is a broadband desert throughout certain parts of my rural  communities. They need the investment.   It also makes the largest Federal investment in public transit in  history. Mr. Speaker, maybe more Members of Congress should have to  ride the bus, and they would understand the investments that are in  this bipartisan infrastructure bill.   Yet, the minority leader on the other side is literally trying to  whip votes against this bipartisan infrastructure bill, a bill that 19  Senate Republicans voted for, along with every Democrat. Now, it is our  turn to vote for it, and they won't work with us to deliver the largest  investment in public transit in history?   You have constituents that rely on public transit. That is the only  way some veterans can get to their doctors' appointments. Seniors,  college students, working people. This has direct implications on the  climate crisis as well. When people have to stand outside for hours in  order to catch a bus, that affects their exposure to everything from  heat to snow in Wisconsin. We don't have that in Vegas.   Finally, it will remove lead from the water our children and other  vulnerable populations drink. These are just three of the very  important provisions that are in the bipartisan infrastructure deal.  [[Page H6060]]    I am ready to vote for these bills, Mr. Speaker. I wish we could  schedule the vote tomorrow, because these are investments that people  in Nevada's Fourth District are depending on. They sent me to Congress  to solve problems and to make their lives better. These two bills do  that, and they do it in very significant and meaningful ways. In fact,  it is probably the largest investment in people in a generation, and we  have a chance to do it. It is the Congressional Black Caucus, among  others, that are leading.   I want to yield to my colleague, Congresswoman Moore. Let me ask you,  because I know as a member of the Ways and Means Committee, you have  been a champion on the racial equity. You have been a champion for the  poor, particularly women, women of color, who have been  disproportionately affected by this pandemic and its recession on our  economy. So what is it in this bill that makes you so excited to vote  for it, and how will other communities benefit, beyond just some of the  things that I have touched on?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, my colleague from Wisconsin makes a very  valid point.   I heard you over the weekend on one of the news outlets making the  same point. Both of these bills are economic packages. I really resent,  in fact, some of the inferences that have been made during this debate  that somehow providing economic support for people to benefit and to  fully participate in our economy is somehow an entitlement program.   The child tax credit, for example. You talked about the earned income  tax credit. I will talk about the child tax credit. This is a tax  program. It is not an entitlement program. Just like we give tax cuts  to the very wealthy and the big corporations--that is what the  Republicans did when they were in the majority. They spent the majority  of their time trying to figure out how to provide 83 percent of the  benefits to the top 1 percent and a tax cut that some of the businesses  did not even ask for, as much as they got.   Now, Democrats are in charge, and what have we done? We started with  the American Rescue Plan. In that, we provided a tax cut for middle- class families, the child tax credit, which actually has already lifted  about 50 percent of children out of poverty, higher rates for Black,  Latino, and Native American children out of poverty.   Now, there was a debate a couple of weeks ago that we now need to put  a work requirement, means test, and we need to change the threshold to  make people with lower incomes eligible and those with higher incomes-- like $90,000 is enough to not receive a tax credit. I am glad that  President Biden rejected those ideas. But it was the Congressional  Black Caucus that stood up and said no, because this is an economic  package, and we need provide economic supports to families.   The other part that you so ably noted is what are some of the  barriers that women face in the workforce. You talked about this in our  committee: childcare, healthcare, transportation. These are the basics  that people need, particularly women. Who was the hardest hit during  this pandemic and recession? Women, particularly women of color, Black  women, Latinas, and Native American women. So if we are going to build  back better, we need to do it in a way that is intentional in a way of  helping them and making sure that they're supported.                                time  2030    I just want to share one story. Keeonn, who is a constituent of mine,  is a young father in my district. He wrote to me about how he is using  that child tax credit, which is a tax cut, and the advance payment that  we provided, that $300 a month. You know what he is using that money  for? To buy healthy food for his daughter.    And he said it may be only $300, but in the end, it is  help that we are most grateful for. That is what this is about.   When the Republicans gave the tax cut to the very wealthy, some of  those corporations just went back and bought more stocks for  themselves, made themselves wealthier, gave their CEOs bigger bonuses,  didn't pay their workers more in wages, didn't expand healthcare,  didn't provide childcare, didn't make their workers feel valued. And  now because of that, many workers today are having a hard time.   But yet Democrats, through the Congressional Black Caucus, are  standing up, and we are pushing back, and that is what the Build Back  Better Act and the bipartisan infrastructure bill is all about. I  yield.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I want to laud her and the members of the Congressional Black Caucus  for all of the tremendous work on behalf of our families, on behalf of  children, on behalf of communities.   I want to just point out one additional thing that Ms. Jackson Lee  has worked on as the chair of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and  Homeland Security in the Judiciary Committee and for her tremendous  leadership on this. In her capacity on the Judiciary Committee, last  year the United States saw the highest increase in gun homicides since  national recordkeeping began. That was in 2020. And, sadly, we are  still on track to see that number continue to increase this year.   This violence, Mr. Speaker, falls disproportionately on young Black  men. Even though we make up only 6 percent of the U.S. population, we  account for about 50 percent of gun homicide victims. Now, those  statistics aren't just numbers. They are lives. And they are lives that  every one of us should be held to account for.   For me, as a Black man, raising three children with my wife--two sons  and a daughter--it hits me very directly because this is what we worry  about every single day when our children leave our homes, because these  are our friends, they are our children.   I am proud, Mr. Speaker, that the Congressional Black Caucus made  this issue a priority, and we went to President Biden and to Vice  President Harris, and we talked to them about the need to stop the  onslaught of deaths. And he listened. He listened, and he included $5  billion of funding and a bill that I am proud to have sponsored, along  with my colleagues, the Break the Cycle of Violence Act, which funds  community-based violence intervention programs to save lives.   Now, this is proven to work. These are community-based programs and  partnerships with faith-based, community-based organizations to provide  mental health and wellness, job training and placement, and  intervention programs so that when we pass the Build Back Better Act,  it will include $5 billion of funding over 8 years and an additional  amount of funding specifically for workforce development and placement.   For months now we have negotiated in good faith. We have worked with  our colleagues. We have listened. Now it is time for us to move  forward. No more delays. No more excuses about process, no more  focusing on personalities here in Washington. Let's focus on the people  and the policy that will benefit them and their lives.   Four years ago, when the Republicans were in control of the White  House, the House, and the Senate, they used their majority to pass tax  cuts for the wealthiest 1 percent and the biggest corporations in our  country. Today, Democrats are in the majority, and our priority is to  deliver for the people.   I am proud to work with my colleagues in the Congressional Black  Caucus and the House Democrats to deliver this historic package. We are  [[Page H6062]]  going to get it done. I yield back to the gentlewoman from Texas.
