 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor  Dorothy Williams Moore on the occasion of her 100th birthday.   Dorothy was born in Hamptonville, North Carolina. She graduated from  Catawba College, class of 1942, majoring in home economics. On March  20, 1946, she married Thomas Moore and moved to Charlotte. Dorothy and  Thomas had four children: Luther, Louanna, Neil, and Cynthia.   Dorothy has proudly served as a mother, homemaker, and substitute  teacher. She also taught Sunday school.   Thomas passed away in 1986, after nearly 40 years of marriage.   Dorothy still lives in Charlotte. She has five grandchildren and  eight great-grandchildren. A double cancer survivor, she loves music  and sang in her church's choir until the onset of COVID-19. She also  enjoys sweets, especially chocolate ice cream.   It is an honor to pay tribute to Dorothy on her 100th birthday. She  has led an amazing life, and her family is overjoyed to celebrate with  her.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman  for yielding.   I rise in support of my legislation, the 504 Credit Risk Management  Improvement Act of 2021.   As you may remember, this exact bill passed unanimously last  December, and I hope the commonsense measure can pass overwhelmingly  again.   For those who do not know about the 504 program, this was one of the  first programs established at the Small Business Administration and has  been a key tool for economic development.   To receive financing, 504 loan recipients must create jobs or meet  public policy goals, like aiding rural development or revitalizing a  business district.   In its economic development role, the 504 program has provided access  to capital and helped build communities across the country for over six  decades.   To ensure the program's continued success and viability for years to  come, I partnered with Representative Angie Craig to craft a bill that  provides the SBA with the tools necessary to maintain the long-term  health of the 504 program.   This bill codifies the SBA's oversight responsibilities for the 504  program and provides the Office of Credit Risk Management with full  control of the review process for certified development companies,  known as CDCs, that deliver this program.   The legislation also establishes a formal process of communication  between the Office of Credit Risk Management and CDCs to facilitate  reviews to make sure the SBA is providing timely feedback to CDCs.   Additionally, this legislation requires the SBA to provide clear  direction to certified development companies as they navigate  environmental rules and regulations.   Finally, this bill will help ensure that the program continues to  operate on the fees built into the program.   SBA programs, including the 504 program, have been at the forefront  of economic aid to businesses struggling as a result of the COVID-19  pandemic. The SBA core lending programs will continue to play a key  role in business recovery.   I am proud to do my part to ensure the 504 program continues to be a  lifeline to businesses and communities today and into the future.   I thank Chairwoman Velazquez and Ranking Member Luetkemeyer for their  leadership. I thank my colleague, Ms. Craig, for her partnership on  this important bill. I also thank Mrs. Young Kim, Ms. Davids, Ms.  Tenney, and Mr. Cohen for their support of this bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
