 Mr. President, it is my honor to recognize Canal  Coffee from Kinder, LA, as the Small Business of the Day for the 2018  National Small Business Week. Small businesses like minority and  veteran-owned Canal Coffee exemplify the pursuit of the American dream.   Canal Coffee is owned and operated by Priscilla Mayfield and Rodrick  James. James, affectionately known back home as Coffee Man, was born in  Bossier City, LA. After serving in the U.S. Army for 8 years, James  attended the Culinary School of America and worked as the executive  chef at Coushatta Casino Resort. In the fall of 2016, the duo opened  the original Canal Coffee on the corner of 4th Avenue and 9th Street in  Kinder, LA. Since then, they have opened two more locations in Oberlin  and Shreveport, with a third location coming soon. The goal is to open  a total of 25 Canal Coffee shops in the next 5 years. James says his  recipe for success is to ``stay in front of God and work hard.''   Canal Coffee should not only be admired for their business success,  but also commended for giving back to the local community. As a part of  their Community Strong campaign, Canal Coffee donates a portion of  their high school football game concession sales to schools in Allen  Parish. They also extend the shop's closing time to midnight so that  the kids have a safe place to socialize after games.   I would like to extend my sincerest congratulations to Canal Coffee  on being recognized during the 2018 National Small Business Week. You  make Louisiana proud, and I look forward to watching your continued  growth and success.                            ____________________
