 Mr. Speaker, today, as we solemnly mark the 11th  anniversary of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School and  remember the 26 beautiful lives murdered in a senseless act of  preventable violence, I ask my colleagues in this body to remember your  commitment to the people we serve.   I ask that we work together to make our schools and our communities  safe to ensure tragedies like Sandy Hook Elementary School are a thing  of the past.   I am committed to honoring the memory of my constituents with action.  Today, I remain committed to working toward an assault weapons ban. I  remain committed to working toward universal background checks. I  remain committed to working toward legislation like Ethan's Law, which  will provide for safe storage of firearms.   I remain committed to implementing the provisions of the Bipartisan  Safer Communities Act. I ask my colleagues to join with me so that no  child, no family, and no community ever has to endure this again.  [[Page H6967]]    I also ask that you pray for my community on this 11th anniversary of  the shooting at Sandy Hook, for the families, for the people who live  there, for the town of Newtown, who will forever be bound by their  grief.                            ____________________
