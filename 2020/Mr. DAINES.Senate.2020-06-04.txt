 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing Layla Eichler of Jefferson County for her passion for  helping others build better lives.   Layla Eichler is a treatment coordinator for the First Judicial  District Treatment Court. Layla travels all across Montana to work with  judges and their staff to create positive life changes for those who  are suffering from substance dependency and substance abuse.   Layla has been a passionate leader of her team since 2015, providing  activities, resources, and kindness for participants in her program.  Most importantly, she dedicates her time building a community for those  impacted by the vicious cycle of addiction. Layla sacrifices her  personal time and money to create activities for participants to enjoy  and try something new. For example, every week she hikes a new location  with the participants.   Since December of 2019, the number of graduates through her program  has reached close to 40. The number of drug-free babies born has  increased from 11 to 13. Four GEDs have been obtained. Seven have  enrolled in college or graduated.   The lives Layla has touched have been made better by her unrelenting  dedication to see her participants succeed.   It is my honor to recognize Layla for her selfless efforts to support  her fellow Montanans to build better lives for themselves, their  families, and their communities.                            ____________________
