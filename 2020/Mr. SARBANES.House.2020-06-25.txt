 Mr. Speaker, for too long, we have not had the courage  as a Nation to say, ``Black lives matter.'' Well, now it is a new day.  Anguished and outraged by the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna  Taylor, George Floyd, and so many others whose families have been left  grieving, we are finally beginning to speak truth and take action.   These killings have left us despondent and deeply angry that America  cannot rid itself of the disease of racism and violence, and the  police, and prosecutors, too, often inflict pain on the very  communities they are charged with serving. But we are also determined-- determined not to let this moment pass without an uncompromising demand  for justice on behalf of the victims' families and on behalf of a  Nation in search of its soul.   For the sake of our future, we must overcome this legacy of violence  and ensure that the civil and human rights of every person in our  country are protected.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support the George Floyd Justice in  Policing Act of 2020.                            ____________________
