 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 8296 because  Republicans care about women and babies.   My colleagues across the aisle are unfortunately, once again,  attempting to push their abortion on demand agenda, which most  Americans find appalling.   This bill is beyond extreme. It permits abortions on demand for any-- any reason, up until the moment of birth.   Eighty percent of Americans say that abortion should be illegal in  the third trimester, and for good reason. The methods used in late-term  abortions to end the life of the preborn baby are truly reprehensible.                                time  1045    The bill before us today almost completely undermines the numerous  pro-life laws that States have enacted since the U.S. Supreme Court  overturned Roe v. Wade by imposing a national standard for abortion on  demand.   As a mother and grandmother, I can tell you that preborn babies are  unquestionably human lives, and they are lives worth defending.   I find it ironic that the party that tells us to follow the science  denies basic science that says life begins at conception, that the  first signs of a heartbeat can be detected after just 22 days, and that  preborn babies can feel pain as early as 12 weeks inside the womb.   Passing this legislation would be a stain on Congress. Women deserve  better than this, and so do their preborn babies. Preborn babies are  truly the most vulnerable and defenseless amongst us. We were elected  to defend Americans' rights, and yet this Congress seeks to deny  vulnerable persons', babies, the most basic right, the right to life.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 8297.   I heard my Democrat colleagues passionately state that women will not  be stopped and that we should support freedom. Yet, sadly, these same  people fail to realize that their own radical abortion legislation  will, indeed, stop women's rights because their radical agenda stops a  future woman's right and freedom forever by ending her life.   If this bill were to become law, healthcare professionals would be  seen as obstructing victims' access to abortion if they delay the  abortion to report this case of child abuse. That is not protecting  women and girls.   To make this bill even worse, this legislation eliminates medical  supervision requirements for chemical abortion pills. The FDA deems  these pills as high-risk drugs that can cause intense pain, excessive  bleeding, infections, and, in some cases, death. This means a woman or  a little girl could literally bleed out without a doctor even knowing  or being there to help.   Abortion is not healthcare. This is a lie from the abortion industry  that has, time and time again, placed its agenda over the health and  safety of women and girls.   Healthcare is meant to help patients. Yet, a successful abortion  results in the death of a baby 100 percent of the time, except, of  course, for those born alive, which my Democrat colleagues don't even  want to save them.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this legislation.
