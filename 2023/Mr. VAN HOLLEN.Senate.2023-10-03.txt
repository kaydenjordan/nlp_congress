 Mr. President, I rise today to spotlight the  courageous spirit of Dylan Cronkhite, a 15-year-old in dire need of a  kidney transplant. Dylan's journey began at just 19 months old when his  mother, Leslie Cronkhite, rushed him to the hospital, sensing that  something was gravely wrong. There, they received the devastating news  that Dylan required a lifesaving operation to receive a kidney  transplant.   Dylan's life was saved by the selfless act of his uncle, who became a  living kidney donor. But today, Dylan confronts another formidable  challenge as his transplanted kidney faces failure, like most young  transplant recipients, compromising his health.   Living donors play a pivotal role in saving lives, offering a glimmer  of hope to those desperately in need of an organ donation.  Nevertheless, I remain hopeful that there are individuals who are  willing and able to step up for the greater good, just as Dylan's  family has. I commend the remarkable efforts of individuals like Philip  Piety and his congregation in Silver Spring. Their initiative to  organize an organ donation forum is an honorable step towards raising  awareness about the dire need for organ donors. Encouraging people to  select organ donor status on their driver's licenses can make a  substantial difference in the lives of those like Dylan, who are  fervently seeking a second chance at life.   Dylan's story serves as an urgent reminder that there are actionable  ways we can support one another through even the most challenging  times. Today, I ask my colleagues to assist in raising awareness of the  importance of organ donation so we can ensure that more individuals  like Dylan receive the lifesaving organ transplants they so desperately  need.                            ____________________
