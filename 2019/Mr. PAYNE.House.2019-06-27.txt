 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 3:30 p.m. tomorrow.    Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to commend the Hillside  Recreational Basketball All-Star teams for their incredible successes  this past season.   These young athletes and their coaches traveled all over the great  State of New Jersey to compete in the New Jersey Basketball Association  League.   The sixth and seventh grade athletes trained hard with their  dedicated coaches which resulted in both teams winning 14 games. The  teams then went on to win an additional four games during their  championships. The seventh grade team maintained their 2-year champion  streak.   These successes were accomplished thanks to each member's commitment  to teamwork that allowed them to reach the height of their potential.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to say congratulations to the Hillside  Basketball All-Stars.                            ____________________
