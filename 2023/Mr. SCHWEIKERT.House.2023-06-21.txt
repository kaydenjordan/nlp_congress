 Mr. Speaker, I am going to try to focus more on  discretionary, just so people understand. The vast majority of our  spending is on autopilot, but a lot of us have no understanding of how  much the wheels have come off just this year, and this is so important  to start the process.   I am going to start with a board, and please understand, if this were  May 2022--you remember how long ago that was? Like a year. We expected  the U.S. deficit for this year to be $980 billion. Okay.   So where are we at today? One year later, we are functionally pushing  $1.18 trillion. We functionally have doubled the borrowing this year.   What happened? Healthcare costs went up dramatically. Interest is up  dramatically. Tax receipts are down.   What happens if some of the protections we have for the next couple  of years are off? Remember, that $1.8 trillion that we are projected to  borrow in this fiscal year, we weren't supposed to hit that for almost  8 more years.   The wheels are coming off, and if you are on the left and you care  about this program or that program, understand, there is no money. You  should help us go at every dollar here.   So we get into this game of saying, oh, but that is discretionary,  discretionary is fairly flat. It really is just not true. It is a lot  flatter than Medicare, Social Security, all of those. But those are  earned benefits that are about our aging population.   We need to walk through a sense of reality, and you are going to get  the punch line here in a moment.   This is just sort of the breakdown for this year's borrowing, this  year's spending and discretionary and what the 2018 baseline is. You  will notice the growth in spending.   Here is the punch line. We were only supposed to have borrowing of  about $1.8 trillion this year.                                time  2100    Let me rephrase that. We were supposed to have spending equal to only  about $1.8 trillion for both defense and nondefense. Do you remember  the borrowing number? It is about $1.8 trillion.   Every dime of defense and what you think of as government is living  on borrowed money this year. You got to understand, when you get the  folks saying, well, let's just cut this program or that program. You  got to cut every dime of defense and what you think of as government,  whether that be the FBI, foreign aid, the park service, our salaries,  Congress, the White House. It is all on borrowed money now.   Here is the other thing we need to make part of our discussion: We  can't play this game of we are going to talk about discretionary and we  are only going to use the last 2 years as our baseline. We had a big  plus-up, substantially during COVID. So let's actually use a true  linear line. Let's go back to 1990, adjust the math for inflation.   Discretionary is up 154 percent. If you go from 1990 and do  inflation, all that growth of inflation, but now we are at 154 percent  growth. Defense is only up 35 percent since 1990 if you adjust for  inflation.   The wheels are coming off, Mr. Speaker. I am terrified because, at  this rate, if some of the predictions are true a decade from now, just  the interest on U.S. sovereign debt, if we stay at these interest  rates, could be approaching $2 trillion a year, more than all  discretionary, defense, nondefense included. That is the future we are  handing to America right now. It is time for great discipline.    The number has actually been going up fairly  dramatically. In the first 7 months just interest carry, just because  the increase in interest, went up $108 billion.    Actually, if 400, I think, was the baseline number,  with the higher interest rates and the amount of borrowing, you could  be approaching 600.    There are also other things going on. People don't  realize, it is not just the $2 trillion of excess spending that has to  be borrowed, how much of the debt has to be refinanced all the time.   You actually have, let's say, $26 trillion of publicly borrowed debt.  There is something called a weighted daily average. Half of that has to  be refinanced functionally every 5 years. Basically that means every  year you are bringing $2 trillion and plus you are bringing a few  trillion additional to market, and now those new issued bonds are at  the new much higher interest rates.    Interest is killing us.    Congressman Buck, one of the best ways to think about  this--the budget window we are working on in functionally about 9  budget years, interest is going to be more than all of defense. That is  already baked into the cake.
