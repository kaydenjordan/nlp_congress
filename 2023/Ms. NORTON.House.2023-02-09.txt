 Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose this profoundly  undemocratic, paternalistic resolution.   The House of Representatives, in which nearly 700,000 District of  Columbia residents have no voting representation, is attempting to  nullify legislation enacted by D.C.'s local legislature, whose members  are elected by D.C. residents.   By scheduling this vote, I can only conclude that the Republican  leadership believes that D.C. residents, a majority of whom are Black  and Brown, are either unworthy or incapable of governing themselves.   The dictionary defines democracy as ``a government in which the  supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them directly or  indirectly through a system of representation usually involving  periodically held free elections.'' D.C.'s lack of voting  representation in Congress and Congress' plenary authority over D.C.  are the antithesis of democracy.   I remind House Republicans that they once professed support for local  control of local affairs. Their fiscal year 2016 budget said this:  ``America is a diverse Nation. Our cities, States, and local  communities are best equipped and naturally inclined to develop  solutions that will serve their populations, but far too often local  leaders are limited by numerous Federal dictates.''   The legislative history and merits of the legislation enacted by the  District of Columbia that are the subject of this resolution are  irrelevant to the consideration of this resolution, since there is  never justification for Congress nullifying legislation enacted by the  District, but I would like to set the record straight.   The Revised Criminal Code Act comprehensively revises D.C.'s criminal  code, which has not been done since it was created in 1901. Everyone in  the D.C. legal system agrees that such a revision is long overdue. The  bill is the product of over a decade of work by D.C. to create a  modern, comprehensive, systematic criminal code. A majority of States,  both red and blue, have adopted such a code.   In 2016, D.C. enacted legislation establishing an independent agency,  the Criminal Code Reform Commission, to recommend a new criminal code.  The Commission, which consisted of nonpartisan experts, drafted the  Revised Criminal Code Act over nearly 5 years in a fully public  process. The voting members of the Commission's advisory group,  including the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, unanimously  approved transmitting the bill to the D.C. Council and the Mayor.   The D.C. Council held three hearings on this bill. The council, as  required by Congress, passed the bill on two separate occasions by  votes of 12-0 and 13-0. The Mayor vetoed the bill. The council overrode  the veto by a vote of 12-1. The provisions of the bill do not take  effect until October 1, 2025, at the earliest.   I say to every Member of Congress: Keep your hands off D.C.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``no.''    Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot about crime in D.C., so  I think it is fair to ask: How do the Revised Criminal Code Act  penalties compare to the penalties in the States, the States  represented in this House? I will cite a few examples from Kentucky,  Chairman Comer's home State.   The Revised Criminal Code Act has a higher mandatory minimum penalty  for murder one than Kentucky.   The Revised Criminal Code Act has a higher maximum penalty for  involuntary manslaughter and unarmed robbery than Kentucky.   How about armed and unarmed carjacking? The Revised Criminal Code Act  has specific armed and unarmed carjacking crimes. Kentucky does not.   The Revised Criminal Code Act maximum penalty for armed carjacking is  higher than for first degree robbery in Kentucky. The Revised Criminal  Code Act maximum penalty for unarmed carjacking is higher than for  unarmed robbery in Kentucky.  [[Page H789]]    How about felony murder? The Revised Criminal Code Act has a maximum  sentence of 20 years with a maximum of 30 years for aggravating  factors. Kentucky abolished felony murder.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.  [[Page H790]]    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from more than 100  groups led by D.C. Vote calling on Congress to keep its hands off of  D.C.                                                   February 7, 2023.      Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer,      Washington, DC.      Minority Leader Mitch McConnell,      Washington, DC.      House Speaker Kevin McCarthy,      Washington, DC.      Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressional Leadership:     Congress Should Stay Out of the District of Columbia's Local Affairs         We, the undersigned organizations, representing millions of       Americans from across the country, are concerned about the       numerous measures that have been introduced that will       unjustly undermine critical local decisions made by the       people of the District of Columbia and their elected       leadership. These local laws were enacted to address       important local concerns, most notably criminal justice       reform, reproductive freedom, democracy and equal treatment       under the law. Efforts by members of Congress to impose       legislative ``riders'' or pass disapproval resolutions usurp       the prerogative of the District of Columbia's elected mayor       and council and the residents they represent.        We also urge Congress to refrain from taking action that       could threaten the District's Local Budget Autonomy Act. The       Act allows the District to spend local tax dollars based on       its local budget at the beginning of the new fiscal year. The       DC Superior Court has ruled the Act is valid, and the DC       Council and mayor are proceeding with the District's local       budget in accordance with the law.        We understand that some in Congress are still seeking to       use the legislative process to impose policy riders upon the       people of the District. The undersigned organizations       advocate on diverse issues and are united in our opposition       to the inclusion of any legislative vehicle that overrides,       limits or otherwise usurps locally elected decision-making by       the District of Columbia.        Already, in just the first month of the new Congress,       legislators have promised or introduced measures that takes       away the fundamental right to self-governance from the people       of Washington, DC.        Congressional interference in these local matters is unfair       and intolerable.        Right now, Americans are debating important issues in       communities throughout this country. But what is not up for       debate is who gets to decide these questions. DC's locally-      elected leadership should decide what is best for the people       of the District of Columbia.        The Mayor of the District of Columbia and the DC Council       were elected by DC residents to represent their interests.       Congress does not impose its views on any other local       jurisdiction, and Americans in DC have no vote in the       Congress to cast against this egregious and increasingly       relentless attack on their local democracy. We expect       Congress to be consistent by letting District residents       manage their own affairs without interference or meddling.        We urge you to respect local autonomy and oppose any       efforts that seek to force Congress' views upon DC residents.

Moreover, the views expressed herein have been       neither approved nor endorsed by the D.C. Bar, its Board of       Governors, or its general membership.     Mr. Speaker, I would like to cite examples of increased  maximum penalties in D.C. You can't call D.C. soft on crime.   For example, nonconsensual sexual conduct, which is the most commonly  charged sex event, current maximum, 6 months. New maximum, 2 years.   Attempted murder, current maximum, 5 years. New maximum, 23.5 years.   Attempted sexual assault, current maximum, 5 years. New maximum, 15  years.   Threats to do bodily harm, current maximum, 6 months. New maximum, 2  years.   Possession of a machine gun, sawed-off gun, or ghost gun, current  maximum, 1 year. New maximum, 4 years.   It increases the maximum penalties for misdemeanor and felony assault  on a police officer.   I would like to cite examples of new crimes. Negligent homicide,  maximum penalty is 4 years. The current law does not criminalize  negligently causing the death of another, except by operating a  vehicle.   Reckless endangerment with a firearm. The maximum penalty is 2 years  for firing a gun in public, even if the gun is not aimed at anyone or  any property.   I urge the Members to look at how the D.C. Council has enhanced  penalties, not reduced them, making this city safer for everyone.
