 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 906, I call up  the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 88) providing for congressional  disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule  submitted by the Department of Education relating to ``Improving Income  Driven Repayment for the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program  and the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program'', and ask for its  immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the joint resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the resolution under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 88, a Congressional  Review Act resolution authored by Representative McClain of Michigan,  that would bar the Biden administration from spending hundreds of  billions of dollars by executive fiat.   On June 30 of this year, mere hours after the Supreme Court  decapitated the administration's previous student loan scheme, the  Department of Education unveiled its so-called Savings on a Valuable  Education (SAVE) plan. Despite its deceptive name, this is without  question the most expensive regulation in our Nation's history.   Mr. Speaker, how bad will the damage be? The Congressional Budget  Office estimates this new IDR program will actually cost over $260  billion over the next 10 years, over $100 billion more than what the  Department was telling the American people.  [[Page H6721]]                                     time  0915    But wait. There is more. Outside experts estimate the cost to be as  much as $559 billion.   Clearly, this is not a repayment plan, and Democrats have not been  shy about their intentions for reshaping postsecondary education.   Indeed, Democrats couldn't get their socialist free college fantasy  through Congress, so they are attempting to shove it down the throats  of Americans through the loan program by executive fiat.   Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans are grasping their wallets at this  news--and rightfully so. They have already been pummeled by inflation  for months on end, and now they are staring down an avalanche of debt  this country cannot afford that will surely bury them if Congress  doesn't put an end to this madness.   H.J. Res. 88 offers us the opportunity to send a clear signal to this  administration that we will no longer tolerate a dictator in chief.   Here is the simple truth: Money cannot be printed out of thin air  without consequences. We should pass H.J. Res. 88 and put an end to  this reckless use of taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. McClain).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   I think Mrs. McBath just made my argument for me. She said the  American people are tired of being asked to give more, more, more.   Well, in her district, she has almost 300,000 people without a  bachelor's degree, and the cost per person for what the Biden  administration is doing is $3,768.   In Representative Scott's district, 355,000 have no bachelor's  degree. They are being forced to cough up $3,768 for people who don't  want to pay their bills.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Good).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Williams).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Pfluger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the Biden administration knows that its so-called SAVE  Plan is illegal, yet it has no problem putting its foot on the gas  pedal.   As my colleague has admitted, this is helping them pay their way  through college, which is what we have been saying. This is a radical  plan by the Biden administration to pay for college expenses.   Let's make one thing perfectly clear: The so-called SAVE Plan is the  administration's game of ruling by executive decree and pinning the tab  on the taxpayer. The Biden administration is transferring debt from  those who willingly took it out to those who didn't have a chance to go  to college. This is unfair.   America's student loan system is broken, and this reckless,  inflationary, and illegal expansion of executive authority will all but  ensure it is doomed beyond repair.   This plan isn't about helping borrowers, and it sure isn't protecting  taxpayers. It is about an upcoming election and an administration dead  set on using the executive pen to reshape our country. That is the  stone-cold truth of this matter.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.J. Res. 88,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
