 Mr. Speaker, last Friday, many of us attended the funeral  for our colleague, Elijah Cummings. His story and the service were  inspirational. On that same day, this article concerning the  deteriorating conditions of the Mexican border appeared in The Texas  Tribune about the consequences of the Trump administration's Migrant  Protection Protocols, or MPP.   The article describes America's inhumanity unfolding in Matamoros,  Mexico, a border town in which I, as a child, spent much of my time and  in which my ancestors are buried. It is a story about America's  cruelty, for which the President of the United States is directly  responsible.   As I thought about what I could do about this situation, I couldn't  help but ask myself: What would Elijah do?   By creating obstacle after obstacle, the Trump administration does  everything within its power to prevent asylum claimants from having  their rightful day in court, whether they are entitled to stay or not.   Its latest obstruction is the Migrant Protection Protocols, which are  anything but protection. The MPP forces asylum claimants to wait in  dangerous Mexican border towns as their claims are processed, and they  have proven to be nothing more than a weapon used to destroy America's  longstanding reputation as the world's greatest melting pot. It is a  blatant violation of the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution.   Our Nation's asylum laws guarantee the right to live in the United  States while claims are adjudicated. Over 1,500 people now live in  squalor in Matamoros, Mexico. They have no running water and a marginal  number of toilets for all of them. They are housed in tents and forced  to bathe naked out in the Rio Grande River. Their daily subsistence  depends on the goodness of the volunteers from the Rio Grande Valley  and across this Nation who cross into Mexico every day to provide a  simple meal. The conditions are worse than those that I have seen in  Syrian refugee camps.   This is not the way America is supposed to work.   The administration claims that by creating secret, sham, tent courts  along the border that it is processing asylum claims. This is nothing  more than a glaring effort to obliterate due process. In these so- called courts constitutional protections vanish, and civil liberties  disappear.   The administration's policy is severely restricting and imposing  barriers on the very fundamental bedrock of our legal system--the  attorney-client relationship. Lawyers representing these asylum  claimants are reporting that the MPP policy is making something as  simple as the opportunity to meet with their client an impossibility.  As of this August, less than 2 percent of those in MPP court even had  lawyers representing them. The forcible removal of claimants to another  country while they await adjudication is a judicial charade, represents  a total abdication of the principles of fairness that are the  foundations of our justice system, and makes a mockery of our  Constitution.   Not only are asylum claimants being denied their rights, the public  and the press are consistently denied access to these proceedings.   What is there to hide?   The presence of attorneys, advocates, the press, and the public at  these hearings preserves our democracy. The president of the National  Association of Immigration Judges states as follows:         Normal immigration court is open to the public. In civil       proceedings in America, one of the fundamental tenets of our       justice system is that there has to be accountability to the       public. We do not do stuff behind closed doors. That is not       what America is about. And yet, with each immigration policy       decision the last 3 years, we are moving closer and closer to       a model that does not resemble anything in the American       judicial system; it is more like what you might see in China       or Russia.    In our system of criminal jurisprudence, a person may be guilty, or  they may not be. But with regard to jurisprudence, a party may be  culpable or not culpable. But one thing everyone gets is the  opportunity to be heard.  [[Page H8600]]    So we have a choice. We can turn a blind eye to the horror that is  this administration's asylum policy, or we can answer our colleague,  Elijah's, call to create a system that stands for justice. Let's tear  down the Migrant Protection Protocols. Let's hire the judges so that we  can efficiently and fairly adjudicate asylum claims. Let the asylum  claimant live in dignity and give them back their right to be in this  country while they wait for their cases to be heard.   If asylum is denied after a fair and just adjudication, let the  claimant leave this country knowing that the United States system of  government gave them a fair shake.   If, on the other hand, a claimant is given refugee status, let's  rally behind them. Let's show them what America is really like. Let's  help them achieve the American dream. I think that is what Elijah  Cummings would do.                            ____________________
