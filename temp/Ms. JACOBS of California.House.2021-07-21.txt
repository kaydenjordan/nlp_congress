 Madam Speaker, today marks 200 days of this  Congress; 200 days of House Democrats working to build back better.   Madam Speaker, our constituents want us to meet this moment.   That is why we have passed historic legislation to strengthen our  democracy, ensure equal pay, guarantee the rights of LGBTQ-plus  Americans, advance racial justice, prioritize gun safety and more.   We started this Congress by passing the American Rescue Plan, a  historic investment in workers and families that included the expanded  and improved child tax credit, one of the most important antipoverty  measures of this generation.   Last week, I met with parents in Chula Vista who had tears in their  eyes talking about what a difference the new child tax credit would  make for their families.   They talked about not only being able to pay for rent and childcare  and school supplies, but also for the first time being able to start  saving for their kids to go to college.   Madam Speaker, that is worth celebrating, and it is worth protecting.   Let's build on the progress we have made, make permanent the expanded  child tax credit, and make sure American families truly can build back  better.                            ____________________
