 Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell and to  express my gratitude to Senator Luther Strange as he leaves the U.S.  Senate. During his too-brief tenure here, he established an admirable  reputation for hard work, dedication to his State of Alabama and our  Nation, and a commitment to principles.   Senator Strange was appointed to the Senate last February to fill the  vacancy created when Senator Jeff Sessions became Attorney General of  the United States. From the start, it was clear that Senator Strange's  pride in his home State was matched only by his humility at being  selected to represent the State he loves.   Building on the reputation he earned as attorney general for Alabama,  Senator Strange established himself here as a determined advocate for  the rule of law and defender of our Constitution. From preserving the  Senate traditions that foster full and open debate to supporting our  veterans and strengthening our national security and our economy,  Senator Strange has worked on a number of important initiatives.   Senator Strange has met the obligations of his office with energy and  dedication, and it has been an honor to serve with him in the U.S.  Senate. I wish him and Melissa all the best in the years to come and  look forward to many more contributions and accomplishments from this  distinguished American.    Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague  Senator Angus King in sponsoring this resolution to designate December  16, 2017, as Wreaths Across America Day. Since its inception, the  Wreaths Across America project has become an annual tradition of  donating, transporting, and placing Maine balsam fir remembrance  wreaths on the graves of our fallen heroes buried at Arlington National  Cemetery, as well as at veterans cemeteries and memorials in every  State and overseas. In the program's 26 years, more than 4.5 million  wreaths have been placed in honor of those who have served our country.   The origin of Wreaths Across America is an inspiring example of that  generosity and gratitude. During the Christmas season in 1992, Morrill  and Karen Worcester took time during their busiest season to donate and  deliver wreaths from their company in Harrington, ME, to Arlington  National Cemetery to honor the heroes who lie at rest there. At first,  a small group of volunteers laid the wreaths with little notice. In  recent years, however, the Arlington Wreath Project has grown to become  a national phenomenon. The people of Maine are proud that this  important and well-deserved tradition began in our State.   This year, on December 16, thousands of volunteers in Arlington,  throughout our Nation, and overseas will carry out the mission of  Wreaths Across America to ``Remember, Honor, Teach.'' This will  conclude a weeklong procession between Maine and Virginia, with stops  along the way to pause and remember the men and women who have died to  preserve our freedoms, spread the message about the importance of  honoring those who serve, and remind the people of the United States  about the sacrifices made by our veterans and their families. This  procession helps to ensure that those sacrifices are never forgotten.   The Patriot Guard Riders, along with other dedicated escort groups,  will accompany tractor-trailers filled with donated wreaths from Maine  to Arlington National Cemetery. America's trucking industry has long  supported Wreaths Across America by providing drivers, equipment, fuel,  and related services to assist in the transportation of wreaths across  the country to more than 1,200 locations.   Wreaths Across America not only honors our departed heroes but also  imparts the important message to veterans who are still with us that we  honor their service. It tells our men and women in uniform today that  we are grateful for their courage and devotion to duty. It tells the  families of those serving our country that they are in our thoughts and  prayers. And it tells the families of the fallen that we share their  grief.   Throughout human history, the evergreen wreath has been offered as a  tribute to heroes. On December 16, 2017, we will again offer this  enduring symbol of valor and sacrifice as part of our never-ending  obligation to thank those who wore the uniform of our country. In this  season of giving, we will pay tribute to those who have given us the  most precious gift of all--our freedom.                            ____________________
