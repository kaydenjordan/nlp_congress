 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  commendable actions of the group known as All American Beef Battalion,  which provided an immeasurable service to our veterans, active  servicemembers, and their families at Fort Carson in Colorado Springs,  CO, on Veterans Day.   Bill Broadie, a veteran who was injured during the Vietnam war, was  dismayed to find on his return home that anti-war protesters were not  just opposed to the conflict, but actively directed their ire at troops  returning from the war. After the events of September 11, 2001,  Broadie--now a cattleman in Kansas--wanted to provide a service that  showed the troops about to deploy into war that their service would not  go unappreciated. In 2008, the All American Beef Battalion was born.   Broadie utilized his cowboy instincts to come up with an innovative  way to show the appreciation he and so many American men and women feel  toward these brave servicemembers: a ribeye steak dinner for the  servicemembers and their loved ones. With that purpose, the volunteers  at the All American Beef Battalion have served over 400,000 people  across 26 States, including my home State of Colorado, where they have  hosted these dinners at least 10 times.   On November 10, 2019, they served 150 veterans and their families at  the Fraternal Order of Eagles No. 143 in Colorado Springs, CO. This  provided a wonderful way for these men and women to celebrate our  Nation's 101st Veterans Day and, as a special treat for the former U.S.  Marines present there, the 244th birthday of the U.S. Marine Corps.   Our country's military servicemembers, both veterans and Active Duty,  sacrifice so much in defense of our freedoms. I am so pleased that the  All American Beef Battalion has found a unique way to show these brave  men and women how much we appreciate their service.                            ____________________
