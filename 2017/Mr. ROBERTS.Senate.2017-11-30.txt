 Mr. President, if I have time at the end of my remarks,  I would like to yield to the distinguished Senator from Hawaii. I will  try to be prompt.   Soon, this Senate will take a historic vote that will impact every  American. These votes do not come very often. The last was decades ago.  I think we all understand--or at least most of us understand--how  critical tax reform is. All of us in the Senate, on both sides of the  aisle, are familiar with the burdens and the complexity and the lack of  competitiveness associated with our current tax system.   It is abundantly clear that this complexity and our antiquated  corporate tax system acts as a brake on our economy. It is equally  clear that in recent years our economic growth rate--our gross domestic  product--has been stuck at a historic low level of 1.9 percent or less.   There are many opinions as to why our economy has been so stagnant,  causing American job loss, unemployment, and more reliance on  government programs. I want to underscore what the people of Kansas  have told me repeatedly as to why, at least in part, this has happened.  Small business owners, manufacturers, our community bankers, other  lending institutions, individual workers laid off or workers hanging on  paycheck to paycheck, and virtually everybody in rural America-- farmers, ranchers, and growers--at every townhall meeting have told me  that the No. 1 issue of concern is the crushing weight of Federal  regulation.   That was summed up by one Western Kansas rancher who said: ``Pat, I  feel ruled, not governed.''   But we are unwinding right now this regulatory overkill. Today we are  making government a partner, not a regulatory adversary. How on Earth  did we reach this sad state of affairs? Well, there are many factors-- administrative policies that seem to mimic or compare to the European  Union monetary policy, government agendas, and central control. But  with this tax bill that can change, and it will change if only we  recognize and take this important opportunity--an opportunity that many  Members in this body have never had to truly make a difference. This  time we can.   Can America get back to a place to make history and, once again, to  experience the power of the American dream?   I am confident that we can. We have before us now a comprehensive  plan to address these issues, cleaning up and modernizing the Tax Code  to help generate more growth in our economy. The bill before the Senate  does exactly that, providing meaningful tax relief for families, small  businesses, farmers, ranchers, and growers. I am especially pleased  with the rates and bracket structure the legislation would put into  place on the individual side.   We have done a good job pushing these rate reductions down to lower  and middle-income families. This would provide a net tax cut for  families in Kansas of about $2,500 and over 10,000 new jobs.   As many have pointed out today, we accomplish this by reducing  individual tax rates, raising the standard deduction, and increasing  the child credits in the Tax Code.   Let's be clear, these are consensus, bipartisan ideas and proposals  that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have, in the  past, at least--now not now, because of the legislative standoff we  have been going through--regularly proposed and supported.   Let me also comment on concerns raised by some of my colleagues that  we simply cannot afford this bill and that it will worsen the country's  financial condition.   In putting this bill together, we have used very modest economic  growth estimates, below the historic post-World War II norm of 3  percent. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office is currently  projecting 1.9 percent growth over the next 10 years, and we learned  today that the Joint Committee on Taxation says the Senate bill will  create only modest economic growth.   Now, notwithstanding the fact that I have never seen a CBO or Joint  Taxation Committee projection that has been really accurate, I think  these estimates are far too low. It is hard to believe. It is simply  unacceptable.   I refuse to accept that we cannot return to a more robust economic  growth. I think we will achieve better growth rates, and observe that  we are well on our way. Recent economic activity bears this out.   The economy is now growing at a solid pace with low unemployment and  low inflation. Real GDP growth during the first two quarters of the  year averaged 2.1 percent at an annual rate, and since January, the  unemployment rate fell 0.6 percentage points to 4.2 percent in  September. That is the lowest rate in about 16 years. Overall growth is  poised to average about 3 percent over the second half of this year--3  percent in the second half of this year.   While these are positive trends, my colleagues, we can do more. We  need even stronger growth. Stronger growth leads to higher living  standards, less dependence on governmental support, and a lower need  for spending on entitlement and other programs.   How do we get there? We have a tax bill--a tax bill to maximize  growth, to create jobs, and to increase wages. This is not what we have  just heard from many on the other side--trickle-down economics or any  other name that they want to call this. This is commonsense economics,  which I have yet to see be refuted by any mainstream economist.   Increase the supply of capital in the economy, and you expand the  productivity of the economy. This result is more business investment,  leading to worker productivity gains--workers who can then earn more,  increase their after-tax income, and, in the end, raise their living  standards.   I want to turn to an essential sector of our national economy-- agriculture, those who are responsible for feeding America in a  troubled and hungry world. I am very pleased that the bill reflects the  importance of production agriculture to our economy. It is important to  keep in mind that few other sectors of the economy face the multiple  uncertainties of production agriculture. We are talking about weather,  storms, fires, volatility in our global commodity prices, trade  disputes, and transportation issues, and the list goes on.   When we pass this bill, the agriculture industry will have a number  of provisions in the Tax Code that recognize the uncertainty and the  volatile nature of the income and expense associated with agriculture  operations.   These provisions--and we are talking about 34, 35 of them at last  count--include accounting rules that allow farmers to manage their  income and expenses.   For example, in the year when our commodity prices are low--and, yes,  this year they are low--they can account for costs in a way that keeps  them in operation.   There are also specific inventory rules to help manage costs  associated with the livestock and dairy operations and to handle items  needed for other basic operations, such as fertilizer and also crop  treatments. There are unique rules for timber operations.   Now, if you want to get down into specifics and just how far we drill  down to be of help to agriculture, even baby chickens have their own  inventory rule--which, by the way, differs from the rules for ostriches  and emus. I would imagine nobody would even think of drilling down to  that extend.   There are rules set for how to handle damaged stocks and livestock  disasters. They are certainly important as of today. I can tell you  that these disaster rules provided a critical boost to ranchers in my  State, enabling them to begin to recover from the devastating prairie  fires in Western Kansas earlier this year.   Turning to the new provisions in the bill, we have developed it with  agriculture in mind. I would be remiss here not to mention the strong  input and advice I have received on these matters from Senator  Grassley, Senator Thune, Senator Scott, and my other colleagues who  also share a strong interest in the agriculture economy.   The bill, for example, liberalizes the depreciation rules for  agriculture operations, giving farmers and ranchers 5-  [[Page S7525]]  year property depreciation, and permitting full expensing of plant and  equipment purchases.   The bill would greatly improve the ability of the agricultural  community to use the cash method of accounting, which provides  complexity in managing cash flow, which is essential to providing  certainty in operations.   There are significant provisions in the legislation that establish a  new income tax rate for passthrough organizations. This is a very  important issue for the agricultural community. The majority of farms  and ranchers are set up as passthroughs, and most of the income earned  by farmers flow through these structures.   The bill also includes new rules for farmer cooperatives, which are a  very important part of production agriculture. We work very hard to  ensure that the benefits of cooperative farming are held whole in this  tax reform plan.   The bill also doubles the exemptions for the estate and gift taxes up  to $22 million per couple. I know this sounds like a lot to some of my  colleagues, but for landowning, cash-constrained farmers, they can hit  this exemption amount quickly, especially in my State of Kansas. Even  when they do not, many farmers and ranchers spend thousands of dollars  a year on lawyers and accountants' fees to plan for the best way to  pass their life's work on to their children--something very special in  rural and smalltown America.   While I will continue to press for a permanent repeal of the death  tax, for now, let's modify it so we reduce its damaging reach.   Finally, and above all, the legislation will provide farmers and  ranchers with certainty during a very difficult time that we are going  through, certainty that they will be not taxed out of business on a  down year, certainty that they will have cash available to fund their  own operations, certainty that their hard-earned income, farm, or ranch  will not have to be sold off just because someone has died, certainty  that the Federal Government recognizes their irreplaceable role in  meeting the challenges of a very fractured and hungry world.   I am very pleased, to say the least, that the Senate bill keeps the  ag tax provisions but will also help our farmers by creating a much  more pro-growth tax system, lowering their tax burden and simplifying  the tax provisions relating to the ag sector.   We have an opportunity to experience a renaissance in our American  economy. It seems to me that for too long we have had a sort of copycat  kind of economic policy based on the European Union. We are talking  about a lot of government control. We are talking about more taxes. We  are talking about a lot of things that simply have enabled us to tread  water.   I know we are in a difficult time in the Senate with regard to  partisan differences. It reminds me a little bit of a country western  song that obviously my staff would hope that I would not mention, but  it was: ``The bridge washed out, I can't swim, and my baby's on the  other side.''   Well, the bridge is not washed out, and the tax bill is on the other  side, along with an American renaissance that will make America enjoy  even more economic growth and get us back to that historic 3-percent  growth rate and even more. That bridge is open.   I urge my colleagues to consider it as we go forward in this debate.  Hopefully, we have the votes. Then, if we have the votes--and I think  we do--hopefully, some of my colleagues across the aisle will join us.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I want to honor the life and  work of a man whose inventions--most notably, the large round hay  baler--literally changed the landscape of America. Wesley Fisher  Buchele, a native Kansan and professor emeritus of agricultural  engineering at Iowa State University, died September 13, 2017, at a  hospice in Ames, IA. He was age 97.   Wes and his twin brother Luther were born in a Kansas farmhouse near  Cedar Vale, KS, on March 18, 1920, to Charles and Bessie (Fisher)  Buchele. Wesley and Luther were the youngest of seven Buchele brothers.   Growing up on a Kansas farm in the 1920s and 1930s was hard work.  Economic depression in rural America started early in the 1920s and  worsened when the Great Depression hit the entire country in 1929. When  Wes was 11, his father, Charles Buchele, died, leaving Wes's mother and  the Buchele brothers to run the family farm. Wes and Luther and several  other brothers were still in school.   The Bucheles ran a raw milk farm. Among other jobs, Wes delivered  fresh milk early in the morning on his way to school, which sometimes  made him late to school. When the principal found out why Wes was late,  he essentially gave Wes permission to be late if needed, saying that  Wes had made more money for his family that morning than the principal  would make all week.   All the brothers worked to fill their father's shoes, driven by the  fear of losing the family farm because of a $5,000 mortgage, roughly  $60,000 in today's money. They succeeded. At the close of the  Depression, the Buchele farm was the only one in their valley stil1 in  the same family's hands as at the beginning of the Depression.   At age 15, Wes was running a four-man threshing crew, when ``it was  105 deg.F in the shade--and there was no shade!'' The Buchele brothers  bought a used tractor and ran it 24 hours a day, doing contract field  work. One night, Wes pulled a night shift on that tractor, and while  plowing, he woke up as the tractor powered through a fence.   The experiences of the sweaty, dirty, grueling work of threshing  grain and baling hay led him to a lifelong interest in making the lives  of farmers easier and safer.   After graduating from Cedar Vale High School, Wes enrolled at Kansas  State College where he earned bachelor of Science degree in  agricultural engineering. While at Kansas State, Wes met Mary Jagger.  They were married at Mary's hometown of Minneapolis, KS, on June 12,  1945.   At K-State, Wes enlisted in the Reserve Officers Training Corps,  ROTC. As second lieutenant in the U.S. Army, Wes was on a troop ship  sailing toward Japan for the anticipated invasion when Japan announced  its surrender after atomic bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and  Nagasaki. Wes was part of the demilitarizing force on the island of  Hokkaido and the northern part of the island of Honshu, Japan. After  World War II, Wes served in the Army Reserve for 20 years, retiring as  a major.   After leaving Active Army Duty, Wes worked as an engineer for several  years for John Deere in Waterloo, IA. He then left John Deere to do  graduate work at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, where he  earned his master's degree agricultural and mechanical engineering. He  and Mary then moved to Ames, IA, where he earned his Ph.D. in  agricultural engineering and soil physics at Iowa State University.   After earning his Ph.D., Wes taught at Michigan State University in  East Lansing, MI, before returning to Iowa State University in 1963 to  join its faculty.   As noted by his son, Steven Buchele, after the move back to Ames,  ``Dad never worked another day of his life. For Dad, it was all fun and  interesting and ISU encouraged his imagination and he loved teaching  and inventing things. It wasn't work, and he earned the name `Wild  Wes.' ''   He also earned the name ``Blood and Guts Buchele'' for how he  championed the cause of farm machinery safety. In class, he showed  hundreds of slides of people who had lost arms or legs, hands or feet  to a PTO shaft or a grain auger or what a farmer looked like after  being sprayed with anhydrous ammonia. One student said that he never  looked at farming the same way after seeing Wes's slides.   At Iowa State, Wes's creativity blossomed. He published hundreds of  technical articles, aided greatly by the able editing of his wife,  Mary. He was awarded 23 patents, the two most notable being the large  round baler and the axial-flow threshing cylinder for combines. Almost  all combines sold today are rotary combines that employ a variation of  the axial-flow threshing cylinder.   Wes also designed blade guards for rotary lawn mowers, a tandem  tractor--a precursor to the four-wheel drive tractor--and devices for  harvesting crops like strawberries, alfalfa, and marigolds. He  developed a ridge-till farming system that, in addition to saving  farmers time and fuel, also helped the environment by conserving  topsoil and soil moisture. It was a precursor to today's ``No-till  farming.''   Wes loved teaching and mentoring the hundreds of graduate students  who came from all over the world specifically to study with him. Upon  graduation, they then went into industry or back to their home  countries, helping further improve agricultural practices throughout  the world.   Wes published three books: ``The Grain Harvesters'' with Graeme  Quick, in 1978; ``Just Call Us Luck'' with twin brother, Luther, about  their childhood in Kansas, in 2008; and ``Who Really Invented the  Cotton Gin'' with William D. Mayfield in 2016. He also wrote many other  unpublished books, including a volume two to the Grain Harvesters, and  hundreds of short stories.   Leading up to and after retirement in 1989, Mary and Wes traveled the  world, teaching in China before and after Tiananmen Square, in Ghana,  Australia, Tanzania, Nigeria, and the Philippines.   After the death of his wife, Mary, in 2000, Wes wou1d visit, his four  children and their spouses--Rod and his wife, Mary Lou, Marybeth,  Sheron and her husband, Curtis, and Steven and his wife, Suzanne, his  eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren, staying for 6 weeks  to 2 months, depending on ``the list.'' ``When Dad arrived, he would  ask for `the list,' a list of things that needed fixing around the  house, promising to stay only as long as there were things to do on  that list. Then he would move on to the next child's family--and a new  list,'' said Steve Buchele.   On Labor Day 2017, Wes decided to mow the backyard of the home in  Ames he shared with his daughter, Marybeth. As he used a rope to lower  the lawn mower down a slope to finish mowing,  [[Page S7559]]  he had a major stroke. Nine days later, he died, after hundreds of  friends and family came to hospice to say good-bye.   Wes Buchele lived a long, full, productive life with energy and  verve. He had, indeed, fulfilled his calling to help make the lives of  farmers easier and safer, and our country and our world are better for  that.                            ____________________
