 Mr. Speaker, I had prepared a speech today to talk about  my support for H.R. 22 and the protection of our Strategic Petroleum  Reserves.   But after hearing my colleagues on the left, it is very simple. They  don't care about unleashing American energy, us getting to energy  dominance, to ensuring that we have the global currency.   They care about defending the Chinese and the CCP. That is why they  have continued to try and prevent us from being able to sell our  strategic petroleum reserves from China.   That is why they tried to stop us from putting together a  subcommittee that would have been a select subcommittee to go after the  CCP and their malign activities.   Mr. Speaker, it is very clear. They do not want to go to an America- first agenda. They do not want to protect America. They do not want to  unleash American energy for the American people to get our costs under  control.   They want to continue to protect the communist China party and the  Chinese themselves.   I rise in protection, not just in support of H.R. 22, but of the  American people and the American workers.
