 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation by  Representative Bilirakis, the RANSOMWARE Act.   H.R. 4551 amends the U.S. SAFE WEB Act, a tool the Federal Trade  Commission uses to protect consumers with an international dimension,  which includes increasing cooperation with foreign law enforcement.   This bill quite simply requires the FTC to report on cross-border  complaints they receive involving ransomware or other cybersecurity- related incidents committed by our foreign adversaries, China, Russia,  North Korea and Iran.   I am sure we all have stories from our districts. For example, a  researcher recently located a host in Georgia that could possibly be  connected to a Russian host with exploitation tools that are connected  to ransomware.   With the increase in these attacks, I am glad to see this legislation  under consideration today, which will help Congress, the Federal Trade  Commission, and other law enforcement entities better understand these  attacks and learn how to better combat them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), a member of  the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of H.R. 3962, the Securing and  Enabling Commerce Using Remote and Electronic Notarization Act of 2022.   Historically, notarization has required a person to appear before a  notary public. However, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic,  such in-person appointments were paused, causing States to permit  remote online notarizations so as to ensure commerce would not come to  a halt when so many other things were.   The passage of H.R. 3962, which establishes nationwide standards and  technical requirements for remote online notarization, showcases the  benefits that technology can have to reduce the barriers on commerce in  America and provide an easier way of life for our constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Dean and Armstrong for their  work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3962, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Armstrong), the  Republican sponsor of this bill.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, in closing, I encourage my  colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of H.R. 8454, the Medical  Marijuana and Cannabidiol Research Expansion Act. This bill is a  revised version of H.R. 5657, Medical Marijuana Research Act, which was  led by Representatives Harris and Blumenauer, and overwhelmingly passed  the House in April.   The text of H.R. 8454 that we are considering today is largely  similar to H.R. 5657, but it is consensus language that was agreed to  through bipartisan negotiations with the Senate. I am pleased we were  able to get the language to a good place.   Marijuana is a schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled  Substances Act. Research on these substances must be conducted in  accordance with the Controlled Substances Act and requires the Drug  Enforcement Administration approve research protocol.   If a researcher desires to make changes to an approved project, the  researcher must submit a request to do so, which is then reviewed and  must be approved by both the DEA and the FDA.   In addition to the extensive regulatory hurdles that researchers  face, the actual supply of research-grade marijuana is relatively  limited. The supply is subject to the single convention on narcotic  drugs, which imposes certain obligations related to governmental  oversight of its cultivation.   While the DEA and the National Institute on Drug Abuse have taken  some steps to increase the number of domestic manufacturers of  research-grade marijuana, more could be done in this space. The Medical  Marijuana Research Expansion Act improves the Federal research  landscape by streamlining both the research and manufacturing  registration processes.   This is critical to better understand the potential benefits and  possible risks associated with marijuana use, as researchers must be  able to study actual products that are currently used by consumers for  both medical and recreational use. These data are long overdue, as  policy decisions have far outpaced the science.   States that have fully legalized marijuana have done so in a relative  information vacuum with less understanding of what it is and what it  does than virtually any nutritional supplement currently on the market,  and with far less information than they have on legal substances that  are easily abused, such as alcohol or tobacco.   Until we make it easier to conduct the research, making fully  informed policy decisions will remain challenging. Even rescheduling  the substance administratively will necessitate robust data on  potential medical use.   Recent evaluations conducted separately by the FDA and the National  Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have both illustrated  the challenges of meeting the required standard of evidence for  demonstrating effective medical use. Both studies concluded that lack  of research was a significant factor in denying rescheduling petitions  in the past.   If Congress does not act, we will continue to have limited ability to  study these products in clinical trial settings. This commonsense  solution will better our understanding of marijuana through legal,  Federally sanctioned and scientifically valid research on this  substance.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Blumenauer and Harris, along  with Chairman Pallone, for working together on this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Harris), one of the leaders  on this important subject.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Griffith).    Mr. Speaker, I would encourage my colleagues  to support this legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for  H.R. 623, the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act 2.0.   This bill, which is supported by a large bipartisan group of  cosponsors, including my Energy and Commerce Committee colleagues  Bilirakis, Mullin, and McKinley, would reauthorize the Gabriella Miller  Kids First Pediatric Cancer Research Initiative at the National  Institutes of Health.   Cancer remains the leading cause of death from disease among  children. According to the National Cancer Institute, an estimated  10,500 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed among children from birth  to 14 years, and over 1,000 children are expected to die from the  disease.   Children are not just little adults, and childhood cancer is not  always treated like adult cancers. That is why it remains important to  continue to support a robust pediatric oncology portfolio at the  National Institutes of Health.   This legislation further prioritizes pediatric research and  complements existing research activities of the National Institutes of  Health.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this reauthorization honoring  the courage and life of Gabriella Miller, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on  this legislation.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the  Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport's achievement in being voted  the best domestic airport by Travel & Leisure magazine.   Since its first flight took off in 1918, the Savannah Airport has  served the American people and our military in connecting them to the  rest of the country. Today, this airport serves 11 different airlines  with 37 nonstop destinations all across the U.S.   ``A lovely jewel of an airport'' and ``a very nice surprise'' were  just a few things visitors and residents had to say about the Savannah/ Hilton Head International Airport.   From local favorites like Leopold's Ice Cream to easily navigated  terminals, you can expect to receive Georgia hospitality with every  connecting flight.   Every day, I am more and more proud of the district that I represent.  We can't stop winning.   Congratulations to the staff, TSA workers, and everyone else involved  at Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport on this tremendous  achievement.

That's how much more--per month--Georgians are spending on everyday  goods due to Biden's inflation crisis.   That's gas. Groceries. Retirement. That's money people need to live  their lives.   Instead, they're using it to subsidize Biden's far-left agenda.   And unlike the President, the American people can't just change the  definition of a word and watch their problems go away.   Regardless of what the White House's latest blog says, we are headed  towards a recession. In fact, we may already be in one.   The single mom trying to feed her family and the trucker paying more  for diesel are feeling the sting of this Administration's policies  daily.   Recession isn't just a word to them--it's a lived reality that leads  to lost income, jobs, opportunities, and even hope.   Where the White House sees the so-called ``strength'' of the economy,  my constituents see weakness.   That weakness is emblematic of a failed President who is willing to  look us in the eye and say that we are not in a recession, that the  $4.30 you're paying for gas is a gift.   He's wrong.   Washington Democrats' one-party rule is robbing Americans blind.   We know how to fix this! Unleash American energy independence, rein  in the runaway spending, and pass a budget, which was supposed to  happen months ago, so that the American people know what their elected  officials value and how their tax dollars are being spent.   It's time to put the American people first.                            ____________________
