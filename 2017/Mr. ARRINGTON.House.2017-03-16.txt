 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and  legacy of Louise Hopkins Underwood, a west Texas icon who passed away  Tuesday, March 7, at the age of 97.   Mrs. Underwood was known as a charismatic woman with a sharp sense of  humor. A woman loved by all, she was gracious, she was generous, and  she was inspirational.   Mrs. Underwood was the mother of six and a pioneer in her quest to  promote a passion for the arts and a stronger sense of community on the  south plains.   Our region, which has a rich history better known for farming and  ranching, is now also known for the arts, thanks to Mrs. Underwood.   Ecclesiastes 7:1 says:         A good name is better than fine perfume, and the day of       death better than the day of birth.    Thank you, Mrs. Underwood. Thank you for your fragrant life and for  leaving a legacy of a brighter, more colorful west Texas.   God bless the Underwood family.                            ____________________
