 Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 1, S.  11.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to take up the  American Rescue Plan today, I want to remind everyone why we are here.  This country is in the midst of a once-in-a-century crisis--not once in  a decade, not once in every 50 years--once in a century.   It is a crisis that is still very much with us, and it is deadly-- deadly--serious. It has claimed more than 515,000 precious lives across  every part of the Nation.   For the better part of the calendar year, businesses have had to  close their doors and entire industries teetered on the brink of  collapse. The economy has lost 10 million jobs since this time last  year. Millions of Americans are thousands of dollars behind on the rent  and  [[Page S1038]]  on the utilities. Folks are facing eviction. American families have had  their water shut off, their heat shut off in the depth of winter, and  the power cut during their kids' first days of virtual kindergarten.   Even as the vaccine is quickly making its way into Americans' arms  now that President Biden has taken the helm, tens of thousands of  Americans continue to get sick every week, and we are racing against  the clock to defeat the pandemic and to save American lives.   Now, Congress has come together on several occasions to pass  emergency relief in this time of extraordinary crisis. In each case, we  saw our economy recover, briefly, before worrying trends took hold  again, showing the depth of the economic crisis. It is not going to be  quick and easy to get out of.   After the CARES bill passed, our economy stabilized before dipping  deeply again in the summer. After we passed another emergency bill in  December, the January numbers looked positive before once again  slipping in recent weeks. Trusted economists--Treasury Secretary Yellen  and Federal Chair Powell, both cautious, careful people--are telling  us, plain as day, that the economy is not yet ready to stand on its  own; that our recovery is deeply uncertain; that the risk of doing  little is far greater than doing too much.   We have also arrived at this moment, about to take up the American  Rescue Plan, because we remember what happened the last time our  country faced a significant economic downturn. Congress was too limited  and constrained in its response to the financial crisis in 2008 and  2009, and, as a result, the country suffered a long, slow, painful  recovery--a lost decade for many American families, creating anger,  pessimism, a sourness in the land that discombobulated our politics.   We are not going to make those same mistakes again. We are not going  to condemn millions of working Americans to another lost decade of  tepid recovery. We are not going to abdicate our responsibility to help  the American people just because we have started to see the first hint  that things aren't as bad as during the very worst days of the  pandemic.   Our mission--our mission--is to crush the virus now, get our country  back to normal, lay the foundation for our economy to come roaring  back--roaring back.   That is what the American Rescue Plan is designed to do, and the  entire country has gotten behind it. Hundreds of the Nation's top  business leaders support the plan. More than 400 mayors and local  leaders from both parties--Democrat and Republican--support the plan.  The American people support the plan, including a clear majority of  Democrats, Independents, Republicans.   It seems the only group that opposes the bill are Republicans here in  Washington, and it is confounding. When Donald Trump was President,  they were willing to vote for a total of over $3 trillion in aid. Now  that President Biden is President and the economy is in the same  pickle, generally speaking, they don't want to vote for a nickel. I  wonder why. I wonder why.   And I have to say, a few of my Republican colleagues are going to  some pretty ridiculous lengths to showcase their opposition to a bill  The Economist has called ``one of the most popular bills in decades,''  a bill supported by a majority--a majority--of Republican voters, not  Republican Senators, but voters.   Yesterday, the Republican Senator from Wisconsin--the same Senator  who last summer proudly declared he would oppose even a dime more in  COVID relief, the same Senator who spent a Senate hearing on Capitol  security reading conspiracy theories into the Record and saying that  January 6 wasn't an armed insurrection--decided to make himself the  face of the Republican opposition to the bill by vowing to force the  reading of the Senate amendment to the American Rescue Plan, in full,  before we can proceed with the bill.   We all know this will merely delay the inevitable. It will accomplish  little more than a few sore throats for the Senate clerks who work very  hard, day in and day out, to help the Senate function. And I want to  thank our clerks profoundly for the work they do every day, including  the arduous task ahead of them.   Still, we are delighted that the Senator from Wisconsin wants to give  the American people another opportunity to hear what is in the American  Rescue Plan. We Democrats want America to hear what is in the plan. And  if the Senator from Wisconsin wants the clerks to read it, let  everybody listen because it has overwhelming support. We want them to  hear about the direct checks they will get, as promised, to help them  keep up with the cost of groceries, medicine, and the rent; about  funding to expand testing and support the vaccine; about the resources  for schools to reopen quickly and as safely as possible; about the  money to keep firefighters, teachers, busdrivers, and first responders  on the job; about the dollars to provide rental assistance to keep  Americans in their homes; about the help for the hardest hit small  businesses to hang on until brighter days return.   Oh, yes, when the clerks read, the American people will get another  chance to hear about the tax breaks for low-income workers and  assistance for American families struggling with childcare--two  measures that help make the American Rescue Plan one of the single  largest anti-poverty bills in recent history.   And then, once the American people have heard all over again about  the provisions that make this bill so popular, about the support that  is going to lift the country out of the crisis, provide millions of  vaccines in people's arms, and set it on a path to strong recovery, the  Senate is going to move forward with the bill.   No matter how long it takes, the Senate is going to stay in session  to finish the bill this week. The American people deserve nothing less.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in a moment, I will move to proceed to  the Senate's substitute amendment to the American Rescue Plan. This  legislation will keep America's families, businesses, and workers  afloat and hasten the day when our country can return to normal and our  economy can come roaring back.   The United States is facing a once-in-a-century crisis that has  sapped millions of jobs from our economy, left millions of Americans  struggling to make ends meet, and stolen more than half a million  American lives. The time is now to move forward with big, bold, strong  relief for the American people; to send checks as promised to American  workers and families; to help reopen schools as quickly and safely as  possible; to help the hardest hit small businesses hang on; to help  families stay in their homes, care for their children, and put food on  the table; to keep firefighters, teachers, and busdrivers on the job;  and to crush the virus with testing and vaccines once and for all.   We are not going to repeat the mistakes of the past. We are not going  to be timid in the face of a great challenge. We are not going to delay  when urgent action is called for. We are not going to quit before the  race is won. We are going to sprint through the finish line.   It is time to move forward with this legislation, which will be one  of the largest single anti-poverty bills in recent history. It is time  to lift this country out of crisis and set it on a path to a strong and  swift recovery. It is time to tell the American people that help is on  the way.                              Motion to Proceed     Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 10,  H.R. 1319.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the motion.
