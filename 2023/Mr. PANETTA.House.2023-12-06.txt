 Mr. Speaker, I honor the life and highlight the memory  of Glen Schaller--a teacher, organizer, labor leader, political and  policy strategist, and a friend of many in California's 19th  Congressional District.   After high school, Glen traveled the country. He found his way to  Santa Cruz, fell in love with that special place, and he felt it  necessary to make it his home. He studied at Cabrillo College and UCSC  and worked in early childhood education for 26 years.   Glen found that he loved helping vulnerable people as a teacher, as  an activist, and as an ally for the LGBTQ community for which he was  named Ally of the Year and Grand Marshal of the annual Pride parade.   Glen also played a key role in the local Democratic Central Committee  and was a political coordinator for the Central Coast Labor Council.   In that position, I can tell you he made sure that local public  servants truly understood what it takes to fight for workers and  working families.   Another admirable quality of Glen was that he just didn't focus on  politics, but also on policy. He was a director of a local workforce  development board, and he fought to prevent closure of local public  schools.   Mr. Speaker, I say to his son, Devon, please know that your father  impacted so many people in so many ways. By finding Santa Cruz, Glen  found his purpose in fighting for equality so that everybody has the  same foundation for opportunity and success on the central coast of  California.                            ____________________
