 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Con. Res. 83.   Our single greatest responsibility is the safety and security of the  American people; and as the elected representatives of the American  people, it is our solemn duty to ensure that our country only engages  in armed conflict that is necessary and that, when we do, there are  clear objectives and a strategy for achieving those objectives.   The Trump administration has presented neither evidence that military  action is necessary nor a clear outline of their goals and a strategy  with respect to Iran.   Any decision to put American troops in harm's way should be debated  openly and honestly so that the American people have a say in their  future. Nothing in this resolution prevents the administration from  seeking authorization for future actions, but it does guarantee, as the  Constitution requires, that the American people, through their elected  representatives, have a voice in that decision.   I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.
