 Mr. Chairman, this legislation is a bright light of  bipartisanship that is sorely needed by communities like mine in Hawaii  and those in Florida as well.   There is nothing more necessary and basic to life than water.  Strengthening and upgrading our water infrastructure is critical to  protecting the health, safety, and welfare of communities all across  the country. Those like mine, who are surrounded by water, and those in  our coastal communities are acutely aware of the dire need for  investment.   For example, for us in Hawaii, we rely on our ports for the vast  majority of the basic needs and supplies that we have to ship in for  our residents. We have also experienced historic floods in Hawaii  recently, like other States, exposing the urgent need for investment in  water infrastructure.   Just one example, risk experts in Hawaii have warned that the Ala Wai  watershed's high vulnerability to devastating flooding could result in  financial devastation to the tune of over $1.1 billion, damaging more  than 3,000 structures, and speaks to the fact that the area is home to  over 150,000 residents and over 80,000 visitors every day.   This bipartisan legislation will secure critical funding for flood  risk management both on the Ala Wai Canal, other places in Hawaii, and  across the country, helping to provide that necessary safety and  security for our residents.   This is a critical piece of bipartisan legislation that deserves the  support of Congress. Let's take this opportunity to better the lives of  our constituents and residents across the country by strengthening our  national infrastructure and ensuring clean and safe drinking water for  all.
