 Mr. Speaker, I have seen this bill every step of the way  over the short month we have considered it. I was there for the 26-hour  meeting we had at the Energy and Commerce Committee. We didn't have an  analysis from the Congressional Budget Office then either. If you want  to accuse us of not wanting to know the facts, that is something that  is very basic to know. We would like to have that here. Here we are  again on the floor without that analysis.   Through all of that time, the sad thing is that we have not heard one  real argument for how this bill would make health care more affordable  and accessible for families in my district in San Diego or anywhere in  the country.   Now, the healthcare system isn't perfect. There are problems with  some insurance markets because they are not providing the choice they  should. So let's fix them. But that is not what we are doing. What we  are doing is we are on the cusp of passing a bill that is opposed by  doctors, nurses, hospitals, patients, seniors, and just about everybody  because it would make the problems in our healthcare system worse, not  better.   This is a bill that, if it were to become law, would rip health  insurance coverage away from at least 24 million Americans. That is the  Congressional Budget Office. That is not fake news. That is the truth.   The bill would leave many Americans with preexisting conditions with  premiums they can't afford or without any coverage at all.   Today's votes take us one step closer to a system where families go  bankrupt over an unexpected illness and our emergency rooms are filled  with mothers once again seeking basic care for their children.   I refuse to accept that is the best we can do for the American  people, and I am voting ``no.''
