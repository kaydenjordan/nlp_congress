 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee  on Rules, I call up House Resolution 772 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 772         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 5377) to       amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the       limitation on deduction of State and local taxes, and for       other purposes. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. The amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on Ways and Means now       printed in the bill shall be considered as adopted. The bill,       as amended, shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill,       as amended, and on any further amendment thereto, to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means;       and (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate  only, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma  (Mr. Cole), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Wednesday, the Rules  Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 772, providing for  consideration of H.R. 5377, the Restoring Tax Fairness for States and  Localities Act, under a closed rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by  the chair and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and  Means.   Mr. Speaker, SALT has been in law since the 16th Amendment was passed  in 1913 with few minor adjustments, that is, until 2017, when  Republicans passed the tax scam law.   In 2017, the Republicans gave away almost $2 trillion in tax cuts to  corporations and the wealthy. They paid for this tax scam on the backs  of hardworking American families. Thirty-six million middle-class  families saw their taxes increase.   The average American deducted $12,500 in State and local taxes, or  SALT, from their Federal taxes before 2017. However, the Republican tax  bill capped SALT deductions at $10,000, therefore, not fully covering  what the average American deducts in State and local taxes. This cap  means that Americans are paying taxes twice on the same dollar earned.   Our tax system is based on the principle of federalism and  acknowledges that the Federal Government should not do everything.   State and local taxes provide funds for critical infrastructure and  services, such as ensuring quality schools for our kids, fixing our  roads, and supporting our local law enforcement.   Local governments know how to meet the unique needs of their  communities, and the implementation of a SALT deduction cap threatens  the ability of our local governments to provide these critical  services.   The SALT deduction is not a Democratic or Republican issue. Taxpayers  across the country in both red and blue States benefit from the  deduction.   Midwestern States like Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin are known for  their State and local tax contributions. In fact, Wisconsin ranks among  the top five States in the country, higher than California, for the  average proportion of a resident's income tax that goes toward State  and local taxes.   Whether from California, Wisconsin, or New Jersey, getting rid of the  SALT cap will benefit Americans across the country.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I am supporting H.R. 5377, the Restoring Tax  Fairness for States and Localities Act. This legislation will raise the  SALT cap for 2019 to $20,000 for married couples.   Under the Republican tax bill, the SALT cap is set at $10,000 for a  household regardless if that household consists of an individual or two  people filing jointly.   Mr. Speaker, I don't think taxpayers should be punished for being  married.   This legislation will completely repeal the SALT cap for 2020 and  2021, ensuring that Americans are not taxed double on their hard-earned  money.   Included in H.R. 5377 are investments in our teachers and law  enforcement officers. I have heard from southern Californian teachers  who are working two or three jobs to make ends meet, but they still buy  supplies for their students: notebooks, chalk, pencils, markers,  whatever they need.   Across the country, nearly all teachers report buying school supplies  for their students with their own money, spending almost $500 on  average.   Currently, the tax credit for out-of-pocket expenses for educators is  $250. This legislation will double the tax credit to $500, matching  what is actually spent, what teachers spend for their students.   It also creates a new tax deduction for law enforcement officers,  firefighters, paramedics, and EMTs related to expenses for uniforms and  for tuition fees for professional development training. As a former 911  dispatcher, I can testify to the importance of having well-trained  first responders.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5377 is about restoring fair tax policies for the  middle class that have been suffering under the Republican tax bill,  and I am proud to stand here in support of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, school districts across America are struggling to  recruit and hire teachers. In the Fourth District of Oklahoma, for  example, there are 8,680 teachers who currently receive the education  expense deduction. This legislation doubles the above-the-line  deduction for educators' out-of-pocket expenses to $500.   Mr. Speaker, I can imagine that these teachers would greatly  appreciate being able to claim up to $500 out-of-pocket for the school  supplies that they buy for their students.   I want to tell a story from Debra Deskin. Debra is a teacher in  Oklahoma, and she has been a faithful public servant for 15 years. She  teaches gifted students. She says: ``I literally had to choose whether  to purchase items for my classroom and students or pay bills. Honestly,  the bills get put on the back burner.''   These are the type of public servants who this bill is tasked to  support to ensure that they are not having to choose between paying  their bills or buying supplies for their students.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the fact is that Republicans are funding their tax scam  bill on the backs of hardworking Americans. The fact is that there is a  race to the bottom under their cheating, gerrymandering ways.   So, now, the Democrats are in charge in the House. We will continue  to work to uphold and bring up our hardworking families.   In Arizona's Eighth Congressional District, there are 9,330 teachers  claiming this tax expense deduction. They should know the Democrats  stand with them to ensure that they are able to pay their bills,  because no one should have to live in poverty because they are standing  up for a future generation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Maryland  (Mr. Brown).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Levin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to correct, for the record, about the 2017  Republican tax scam.   We have heard today, during this debate, that these tax cuts boosted  our economy, and that simply isn't the case.   I include in the Record an article from Forbes titled: ``The 2017 Tax  Cuts Didn't Work, the Data Prove It.''                        [From Forbes, May 30, 2019]              The 2017 Tax Cuts Didn't Work, The Data Prove It                           (By Christian Weller)         The independent, non-partisan Congressional Research       Service just released a report showing that the 2017 tax cuts       for the richest Americans and corporations did not work. This       confirms what anybody who has been looking at the data       already knew. Investment did not boom and workers will not       see the promised bump in pay. Instead, the federal government       incurred massive deficits while wealth inequality increased       to its highest level in three decades.        Republicans in Congress and President Trump touted the       benefits of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 as game changing.       Showering the richest Americans and corporations even more       money was supposed to lead to more business investments.       These investments, the argument went, would translate into       more productivity growth. Workers would then supposedly see       an additional $4,000 per year in wages. And faster economic       growth and higher wages would result in more tax revenue,       thus paying mainly for itself.        These were empty promises. Businesses did not use the       windfall of new cash to invest in new machines, technology,       office parks and manufacturing plants. Without an       acceleration in business investment, though, American workers       will not see the bumps in pay promised over the longer term.       The richest Americans instead got even richer while       corporations used a lot of the new money to keep shareholders       happy. Federal budget deficits quickly ballooned because       there was no faster growth and more revenue to offset the       hundreds of billions lost each year to the predictably       wasteful tax cuts.        The core of the argument in favor of the tax cuts was that       they would result in more investment. The main measure is       business investment that goes beyond replacing obsolete       equipment and buildings--so-called net non-residential fixed       investment. As share of gross domestic product (GDP), net       investment reached a low of 2.8% in the first quarter of 2016       (see figure below). It grew afterwards until the tax cuts       were passed in late 2017 and eventually levelled off rather       than accelerating in mid-2018. Consequently, net investment       as share of GDP stayed below its levels in 2014. The tax cuts       did not accelerate investment as promised by supply-side       advocates.        But maybe the tax cuts boosted growth in other ways? In       theory, the tax cuts could have created some additional       demand that resulted in people spending more money, which       would then have led businesses to also increase its spending.       To capture this, an economic measure needs to strip out parts       of the economy from GDP that are not affected  [[Page H12218]]       by tax cuts. These parts include inventory investment--      material that is produced but sits on shelves--government       consumption on salaries and supplies, and net exports--the       difference between exports and imports. The resulting key       measure are so-called private domestic final purchases       (PDFP).        The tax cuts did not lead to faster private activity. PDFP       increased by 3.3% from December 2016 to December 2017, before       Congress passed the tax cuts. Afterwards, year-over-year       growth remained at or below that level, actually declining       since September 2018. This deceleration is yet another clear       indictment of the tax cuts' ineffectiveness.        But didn't GDP growth accelerate? Not only does GDP growth       capture parts of the economy that clearly were not affected       by the tax cuts, the data also show no acceleration there,       either. GDP growth started to get faster from low of 1.3% in       June 2016 and continued to gain strength through 2018 (see       Figure above). But year-over-year growth in 2018 stayed below       the levels shown in early 2015.        The money from the tax cuts obviously went somewhere, just       not to investments or workers' wages. Corporations just       decided to use their additional cash to keep their       shareholders happy. Non-financial corporations used most of       their after-tax profits since the tax cuts went into effect       to buy back their own shares and pay out dividends. When a       firm buys back its own shares, the remaining shares become       more valuable and the company's stock price goes up,       increasing the wealth of shareholders, mainly people who are       already very wealthy. CEOs in particular gained from buybacks       since their compensation typically depends on the price of a       company's stock. In 2018, corporations spent about two-thirds       of their after-tax profits on buying back their own shares       and paying out dividends, according to Fed data. By the       fourth quarter of 2018, corporations spent 107. 7% of after-      tax profits on dividends and share repurchases.        This was good news for the wealthiest few. The top one       percent of wealthiest households owned a record high share of       all wealth by the middle of 2018 (see figure below).        At the same time, federal budget deficits rapidly jumped.       After falling precipitously in the immediate aftermath of the       Great Recession, the deficits quickly grew again in 2018 (see       figure below). The increase in deficits was driven heavily by       a sharp drop in corporate tax revenue--not surprisingly,       given the massive corporate tax cuts in the legislation.        did not accelerate, but wealth inequality grew. The       American tax payers are now getting stuck with the bill,       while they did not see many benefits from this trillion       dollar boondoggle.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record  another article, and this one is from CNBC, titled: ``Trump Tax Cuts  Did Little to Boost Economic Growth in 2018, Study Says.''                         [From CNBC, May 29, 2019]   Trump Tax Cuts Did Little To Boost Economic Growth In 2018, Study Says                               (By Jeff Cox)         An in-depth look by the nonpartisan Congressional Research       Service indicated that not only did the rollbacks in business       and personal rates have little macro impact, but they also       delivered the most benefits to corporations and the rich,       with little boost to wages.        In all, GDP rose 2.9% for the full calendar year, the best       performance since the financial crisis. But that came in an       economy already poised to move higher, economists Jane       Gravelle and Donald Marples wrote.        ``On the whole, the growth effects [from the cuts] tend to       show a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the       economy,'' the report said. ``Although examining the growth       rates cannot indicate the effects of the tax cut on GDP, it       does tend to rule out very large effects in the near term.''        Trump had touted the cuts as a key step toward generating       GDP growth of at least 3%. The legislation, passed in late       2017, slashed corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, reduced       the number of brackets, lowered rates for many individual       payers, and doubled the standard deduction in an effort to       make most income tax-exempt for the lowest earners.        Employment continued to boom in 2018 and average hourly       earnings have in recent months passed 3% on a year-over-year       basis for the first time since the recovery began in 2009.       However, the economists said wage gains could not be tracked       to the tax cuts.        ``This growth is smaller than overall growth in labor       compensation and indicates that ordinary workers had very       little growth in wage rates,'' the economists wrote.        The study indicated that the tax changes contributed only       marginally to the overall economic economic gains--maybe 0.3%       of a ``feedback effect.'' The economists say that for the tax       cuts to pay for themselves, as Trump has promised, GDP would       have to rise by 6.7%.        ``The initial effect of a demand side is likely to be       reflected in increased consumption and the data indicate       little growth in consumption in 2018,'' the report said.       ``Much of the tax cut was directed at businesses and higher-      income individuals who are less likely to spend. Fiscal       stimulus is limited in an economy that is at or near full       employment.''        At the same time, tax receipts from 2018 indicate that       corporations got an even bigger break than expected.        While the Congressional Budget Office had forecast a $94       billion break that still would have generated $243 billion in       corporate revenues, the actual total was $205 billion, or 16%       lower than projected.        The effective tax for corporations, or the level they pay       after taxes, was 17.2% in the year before the tax breaks took       hold and plunged to 8.8% for 2018. Individuals, meanwhile,       saw a drop from 9.6% as a percentage of personal income in       2017 to 9.2% last year.        Bonuses from those companies also didn't amount to much       when averaged across all workers, with the $4.4 billion paid       coming to just $28 per employee in the U.S.        Companies also received incentives to repatriate profits       held overseas, and they did so to the tune of $664 billion.       While companies bought back about $1 trillion of their own       shares, ``the evidence does not suggest a surge in investment       from abroad in 2018,'' the report said.        The White House did not immediately respond to a request       for comment.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from  New York an additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 additional minute  to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close also.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to start by clarifying a misconception that all  of these taxes are forced upon taxpayers. This last election cycle  local voters voted to tax themselves to pay for affordable housing for  our growing homeless population, to pay for improved roads, and to pay  for better water quality. So they should not be punished for filling  the gap where the Federal Government has failed to do so. This bill is  paid for by raising taxes for households making over $400,000, back to  the levels before Republicans passed their tax scam bill.   California pays $13 billion more in Federal taxes than it received  from the Federal Government according to a 2016 IRS report. Tennessee  is the third most dependent State on Federal resources. So to argue  here that we should punish the people for wanting to help provide for  your constituents because you failed to do that is outrageous. Oklahoma  received $7.5 billion in Federal funding in 2016. This bill is not  about subsidizing those who already have too much. This bill is about  stopping the double taxation on the same dollar.   Mr. Speaker, we are here to try to give the middle-class families a  break and undo the damage caused by the Republican tax scam. As we look  forward to the new year, I want to take a minute to reflect on the work  Democrats in Congress have done during this 116th Congress.   Whereas, the Republican tax law provided seven drug companies $34  billion in tax cuts in 1 year alone, last week, Democrats passed H.R. 3  to help seniors and American families afford their prescription drugs.   Whereas, last January the President caused the longest government  shutdown in history by pushing to irresponsibly use taxpayer dollars  for an unnecessary border wall, Democrats have fought for comprehensive  funding bills that invest in our infrastructure, healthcare, national  security, and to increase the Federal minimum wage.   Whereas, the Republican tax scam led to America's 400 wealthiest  people paying a much lower tax rate than the working class, Democrats  are here today because we believe in the middle class.   Repealing the cap on the State and local tax deductions will benefit  taxpayers across our Nation. I have heard my colleagues claim that this  bill is for the wealthy.  [[Page H12220]]    Mr. Speaker, do my colleagues remember voting on the largest tax  giveaway to the rich and corporations in American history?   Obviously, they don't. But I am here to remind them that the biggest  beneficiaries of the tax law that they passed were billionaires. The  Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that wealthy taxpayers making $1  million or higher received a tax cut of $37 billion in 2019.   Mr. Speaker, while the Republican tax scam was a bill for the  megarich, H.R. 5377 is legislation for constituents like mine, working- class Americans. The cap on SALT deductions is bad for my constituents.   The average Californian pays over $18,000 in State and local taxes,  which is almost double over the SALT cap, again, to help improve the  quality of life of the fifth largest economy in the world, which no  other State can claim. As a result, 1 million Californians will pay $12  billion more in taxes into the SALT cap.   In 2016 my constituents deducted almost $700 million in State and  local taxes from their Federal taxes.   It is time to give them a break and give them back the deductions  that they once had. No one should have to pay taxes twice on the same  dollar.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote for the rule and  passage of H.R. 5377, Restoring Tax Fairness for States and Localities  Act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and a ``yes'' vote on  the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 772         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 750) expressing the sense of the House of       Representatives that individual choice in health insurance       should be protected. The resolution shall be considered as       read. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on       the resolution and preamble to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of House Resolution 750.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of  my time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
