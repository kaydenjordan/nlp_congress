 Mr. Speaker, my constituent, Tanner Lee  Jameson, was just 13 when he died from cardiac arrest during a  basketball game. His school had an automated external defibrillator, or  AED, in a nearby office, but it was inaccessible when Tanner needed it  most.   Since Tanner's passing, his mother, and my constituent, Rhonda  Harrill, who is in the gallery today with her husband, has been a  passionate advocate for increased AED access.   Early this year, I introduced the AEDs resolution, H. Res. 35, which  would encourage schools to have AEDs and to provide annual AED  training.   In 1998, I introduced, and Congress passed, the Aviation Medical  Assistance Act, the law that requires, among other things, passenger  airplanes and airports to have AEDs and flight crews to receive  additional first aid and AED training.   Today, I am pleased to participate in this year's AED Hunt on the  Hill, sponsored by my friend, Dr. Phil Roe, and hosted by the  Children's Cardiomyopathy Foundation.   Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to remember Tanner Jameson's life, and I  urge my colleagues to cosponsor H. Res. 35 to hopefully help save lives  in the future.
