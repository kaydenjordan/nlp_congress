 Mr. Speaker, just over a week ago, I spoke on the House  floor in support of a bipartisan debt ceiling framework proposed by the  Problem Solvers Caucus.   Unfortunately, rather than taking up this framework, or one that can  actually get signed into law, the majority advanced a partisan  framework that will leave working families, seniors, and veterans  behind.   According to the Joint Economic Committee, this partisan proposal  could slash education funding for 143,000 students, cut funding for  44,000 veterans, jeopardize 17,000 families living below the poverty  level, threaten housing access for 35,000, roll back investments in the  Triangle's new, innovative technologies that support good-paying jobs.  That is just in North Carolina's 13th Congressional District alone.   I support fiscal responsibility, but this proposal is anything but  responsible.   Mr. Speaker, I implore my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  come to the table in good faith because the stakes are too high. Let's  have a reasonable and responsible conversation to avoid defaulting on  the debt.                            ____________________
