 To suggest that any subject of an       investigation, much less the President with obligations to       the institution of the presidency, is abusing power and       interfering with an investigation by making legitimate legal       claims, using due process and asserting constitutional       rights, is beyond serious consideration.    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. That was exactly correct then and it is exactly  correct now.   More important than simply the principle that asserting rights can't  be considered obstruction, when the rights the President has asserted  are based on executive privilege, when they are constitutionally  grounded principles that are essential for the separation of powers and  for protecting the institution of the Office of the Presidency, to call  that obstruction is to turn the Constitution on its head. Defending the  separation of powers cannot be deemed an impeachable offense without  destroying the Constitution. Accepting that approach would do permanent  damage to the separation of powers and would allow the House of  Representatives to turn any disagreement with the Executive over  informational demands into a supposed basis for removing the President  from office. It would effectively create for us the very parliamentary  system that the Framers sought to avoid because, by making any demand  for information and goading the Executive to a refusal and treating  that, then, as impeachable, the House would effectively be able to  function with a no-confidence vote power. That is not the Framers'  design. The legislative and executive branches frequently clash on  questions of constitutional interpretation, including about  congressional demands for information. These conflicts have happened  since the founding.   In 1796, George Washington, our first President, resisted demands  from Congress for information about the negotiation of the Jay Treaty,  and there have been conflicts between the Executive and the Congress in  virtually every administration since then about congressional demands  for information.   The Founding Fathers expected the branches to have these conflicts.  James Madison pointed out that ``the legislative, executive, and  judicial departments . . . must, in the exercise of its functions, be  guided by the text of the Constitution according to its own  interpretation of it.'' It was recognized that there would be friction.   Similarly in Federalist 51, Madison pointed out that ``the great  security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the  same department consists in giving to those who administer each  department the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to  resist encroachment of the others.'' This is checks and balances, this  friction, this clashing between the branches. It is not evidence of an  impeachable offense. It is the separation of powers in its practical  operation. It is part of the constitutional design.   Now, the proper and historically accepted way that these  disagreements have been resolved is through the constitutionally  mandated accommodations process. Courts have explained that the  branches are required to engage in an accommodation process to resolve  disagreements where there is a clash over a demand for information. As  the DC Circuit has explained, when Congress asks for information from  the executive branch that triggers ``an implicit constitutional mandate  to seek optimal accommodation . . . of the needs of the conflicting  branches,'' the goal is to accommodate the needs of both branches to  reach a compromise.   If that accommodation process fails, Congress has other tools at its  disposal to address the disagreement. The House traditionally has  proceeded to contempt--to vote on a contempt resolution. In recent  times, the House has taken the position that it may sue in the courts  to determine the validity of its subpoenas and secure an injunction to  enforce them.   The House managers have pointed out that the Trump administration,  when sued in the McGahn case, has taken the view that those cases are  not justiciable in article III courts. That is correct. That is the  view of the Trump administration; that was the view of the Obama  administration. So there is that resistance in the court cases to the  jurisdiction of the courts to address those. But the House managers are  missing the point when they identify that position that the  administration has taken because the House cannot claim that they have  a mechanism for going to court--they are in court right now asserting  that mechanism in the McGahn case and simultaneously saying that, well,  they don't have to bother with that mechanism; they can jump to  impeachment.   Impeachment under the Constitution is the thermonuclear weapon of  interbranch friction, and where there is something like a rifle or a  bazooka at the House's disposal to address some friction with the  executive branch, that is the next step. It is incrementalism in the  Constitution--not jumping straight to impeachment--that is the  solution.   If the House could jump straight to impeachment, that would alter the  relationship between the branches. It would suggest that the House  could make itself superior over the Executive to dangle the threat of  impeachment over any demand for information made to the Executive.   That is contrary to the Framers' plan. Madison explained that where  the executive and legislative branches come into conflict, in  Federalist No. 49, ``[neither] of them, it is evident, can pretend to  exclusive or superior right of settling the batteries between their  respective powers.'' But that is exactly what the House managers have  asserted in this case. They have said that the House becomes supreme.  There is no need for them to go to court. The Executive must be wrong.  Any resistance to their subpoena is obstruction. If you claim that our  subpoena is invalid, we don't have to do anything to address that  concern; we will just impeach you because resistance is obstruction of  Congress.   The House put it this way in their report to the Judiciary Committee.  They effectively said that the House is the judge of its own powers,  because what they said was ``the Constitution gives the House the final  word.'' That is on page 154 of the House Judiciary Committee report.   What that is essentially saying--they point to the fact that article  I, section 2, gives the House ``the sole Power of Impeachment,'' and  they claim because it has the sole power of impeachment, the courts  have no role; the House is the final word; it is the judge of its own  powers. But that is contrary to constitutional design. There is no  power that is unchecked in the Constitution. The sole power of  impeachment given to the House simply means that power is given solely  to the House, not anywhere else.  [[Page S594]]    The Constitution does not say that the power of impeachment is the  paramount power that makes all other constitutional rights and  privileges and prerogatives of the other branches fall away.   The Framers recognized that there could be partisan impeachments and  there could be impeachments for the wrong reasons, and they did not  strip the executive branch of any of its needs for protecting its own  sphere of authority and its own prerogatives under the Constitution.  Those principles of executive privilege and those immunities still  survive, even in the context of impeachment.   The power of impeachment is not like the House can simply flip a  switch and say now we are in impeachment, and they have constitutional  kryptonite that makes the powers of the executive eliminated. So when  there are these conflicts, even in the context of impeachment inquiry,  the executive can continue to assert its privileges and prerogatives  under the Constitution, and, indeed, it must in order to protect the  institutional interests of the Office of the Presidency and to preserve  the proper balance between the branches under the Constitution.   Professor Turley, rightly, pointed out that by claiming Congress can  demand any testimony or documents and impeach any President who dares  to go to the courts, House Democrats were advancing a position that was  ``entirely untenable and abusive of impeachment.'' Other scholars  agree.   In the Clinton impeachment, Professor Susan Low Bloch testified that  ``impeaching a President for invoking lawful privileges is a dangerous  and ominous precedent.'' It would achieve exactly the result that  Gouverneur Morris, one of the Framers, warned against at the  Constitutional Convention. He explained that ``when we make him  [referring to the President] amenable to Justice however we should take  care to provide some mode that will not make him dependent on the  Legislature.''   That is exactly what this Article of Impeachment would do. It would  make the President dependent on the legislation because any demand for  information, be it by Congress, could be used as a threat of  impeachment to enforce compliance by the executive. The very theory  that the House Democrats have asserted is that there can be no  assertions of privileges and no constitutionally based prerogatives of  the Executive to stand in the way.   If that theory were true, virtually every President could have been  impeached. Virtually every President has asserted, at one time or  another, these constitutional prerogatives. President Obama famously,  in the Fast and Furious investigation, refused to turn over documents  that led to his Attorney General being held in contempt, but that  didn't lead to impeachment. It could be a long list. Professor Turley  testified there could be a very long list of Presidents who would have  to be distinguished if the principles being asserted now in this case  were applied to all past Presidents in history.   Now, House Democrats have given a few different justifications for  this approach, but I submit none can be reconciled with the  Constitution. They say that if we cannot impeach the President for this  obstruction, then the President is above the law. Not so. I think I  pointed out that the President is staying within the law, asserting the  law, and relying on the legal advice from the Department of Justice to  make his arguments based on long-recognized constitutional principles,  and, indeed, is making the fundamental point, with respect to the  subpoenas, that it is Congress that is not above the law. It is the  House. The House has to follow the law as well. It has to issue valid  subpoenas. And if the law isn't followed, those subpoenas are null and  void, and the Executive doesn't have to comply with them.   The House Democrats say that they shouldn't go to the courts because  the courts have no role in impeachment. I think I pointed out that the  House Democrats can't say that they have the--just because of the  provision of the sole power of impeachment, that it is a paramount  power, and that no other branch plays any role in providing a check on  how the power is exercised. And in addition, the House Democrats have  gone to court.   In the McGahn case that they are litigating right now, they have  asserted that is part of the impeachment inquiry. The Trump  administration has explained that it was not validly part of the  impeachment inquiry, but that is the ground on which they are  litigating under.   They say that they have no time for the courts. I think what that  really means is they have no time for the rule of law in the way that  they are pursuing the inquiry. The other day, one of the House managers  actually said on the floor of the Senate that they had to get it  moving. They couldn't wait for litigation. They had to impeach the  President before the election. That is not a valid reason to not pursue  litigation in the courts.   I think it is relevant to bear in mind what sort of delay are we  talking about? In the McGahn case that the House managers referred to a  number of times--which they have pointed out, they presented as being  very long and drawn out--they issued a subpoena in April, but they did  not file a lawsuit until August. By November--November 25--they had a  decision from the district court, and it was argued on appeal in the DC  Circuit on January 3. For litigation, that is pretty fast, and it can  go faster.   In the Nixon case, during Watergate, the special prosecutor issued a  subpoena on April 18, 1974. On May 20--so in less than a month--the  district court denied a motion to quash the subpoena. On May 31, the  Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, granting cert before judgment in  the Court of Appeals, and on July 24, the Supreme Court issued the  decision. That is lightning fast.   So when there is urgency to the case, when there is a reason for it,  there can be expedition in the courts, and a decision can be had in a  timely manner.   In the one case that actually arose from these impeachment  proceedings, it was the House that derailed the case. This was the case  involving Deputy National Security Advisor Charlie Kupperman, because  when he received a subpoena, he went to court and asked the court for a  declaratory judgment explaining what his obligations were: Should he  take the directive from the President that he was immune and not go or  should he obey the subpoena? Now, in that case, he filed suit on  October 25. The court, within a few days, set an expedited briefing  schedule, but the House withdrew the subpoena on November 5, just 11  days later, in order to moot the case.   So I think litigation is a viable avenue, along with the  accommodation process, as a first step. Then, if the House believes it  can go to court and wants to litigate the jurisdiction and litigate the  validity of its subpoenas, that is also available to them, but  impeachment as the first step doesn't make any sense.   I should point out, in part, when the House managers say they didn't  have time to litigate, they didn't have time to go to the courts, but  they now come to this Chamber and say this Chamber should issue some  more subpoenas, this Chamber should get some witnesses that we didn't  bother to fight about, what do you think will happen then? That there  will not be similar assertions of privilege and immunity? That there  wouldn't be litigation about that?   Again, this goes back to the point that I made. If you put your  imprimatur on a process that was broken and say, yes, that was a great  way to run things, this was a great package to bring here, and we will  clean up the mess and issue subpoenas and try to do all the work that  wasn't done, then that becomes the new normal, and that doesn't make  sense for this body.   A proper way to have things handled is to have the House--if it wants  to bring an impeachment here ready for trial--do the investigation. The  information it wants to get, if there is going to be resistance, that  has to be resolved, and it has to be ready to proceed, not transfer the  responsibility to this Chamber to do the work that hasn't been done.   They also assert that President Trump's assertion of these privileges  is somehow different because it is unprecedented, and it is  categorical. Well, it is unprecedented, perhaps, in the sense that  there was a broad statement that a lot of subpoenas wouldn't be  complied with, but that is because it was unprecedented for the House  to begin  [[Page S595]]  these proceedings without voting to authorize the committee to issue  the subpoenas. That was the first unprecedented step. That is what had  never happened before in history. So, of course, the response to that  would be, in some sense, unprecedented. The President simply pointed  out that without that vote, there were no valid subpoenas.   There have also been categorical refusals in the past. President  Truman, when the House Committee on Un-American Activities, in 1948,  issued subpoenas to his administration, issued a directive to the  entire executive branch that any subpoena or demand or request for  information, reports, or files in the nature described in those  subpoenas shall be respectfully declined on the basis of this  directive, and he referred also to inquiries of the Office of the  President for such response as the President may determine to be in the  public interest. The Truman administration responded to none of them.   A last point on the House Democrats' claim that privileges simply  disappear because this is impeachment power of the House. They have  referred a number of times to United States v. Nixon, the Supreme Court  decision, suggesting that that somehow determines that when you are in  an impeachment inquiry, executive privilege falls away. That is not  true. In fact, United States v. Nixon was not even actually addressing  a congressional subpoena. It was a subpoena from the special  prosecutor, and even in that context, the Court did not state that  executive privilege simply disappears. Instead, the Court said: ``It is  necessary to resolve these competing interests''--they are the  interests of the judicial branch in administering a criminal  prosecution in a case where the evidence was needed--``these competing  interests in a manner that preserves the essential functions of each  branch.''   And it even held out the possibility that in the field of foreign  relations and national security, there might be something approaching  an absolute executive privilege. That is exactly the field we are in,  in this case--foreign relations and national security matters.   Another thing you have heard is that President Clinton voluntarily  cooperated with the investigation that led to his impeachment--produced  tens of thousands of documents. That is not really accurate. That was  only after long litigation again and again about assertions of  privilege. He asserted numerous privileges. The House Judiciary  Committee then explained ``during the Lewinsky investigation, President  Clinton abused his power through repeated privilege assertions of  executive privilege by at least five of his aides.''   Unlike the House in this case, Independent Counsel Starr first  negotiated with the White House and then litigated those claims and got  them resolved. Ultimately, the House managers argued that all of the  problems with their obstruction theory should be brushed aside and the  President's assertions of immunities and defenses have to be treated as  something nefarious because, as Mr. Nadler said: Only guilty people try  to hide the evidence. That is what he said from last Tuesday night. And  Mr. Schiff, similarly, in discussing the assertion of the executive  branch's constitutional rights, said: ``The innocent do not act this  way.''   Really? Is that the principle in the United States of America that if  you assert legal privileges or rights, that means you are guilty? If  the innocent don't assert their rights, that the President can't defend  the constitutional prerogatives of his office?   That doesn't make any sense. At bottom, the second Article of  Impeachment comes down to a dispute over a legal issue relating to  constitutional limits on the ability of the House to compel information  from the Executive. No matter how House Democrats try to dress up their  charges, a difference of legal opinion does not rise to the level of  impeachment.   Until now, the House has repeatedly rejected attempts to impeach the  President based on legal disputes over assertions of privilege. As  Judge Starr pointed out, in the Clinton proceedings, the House  Judiciary Committee concluded that the President had improperly  exercised executive privilege, yet still concluded that it did not have  the ability to second-guess the rationale behind the President or what  was in his mind asserting executive privilege, and it could not treat  that as an impeachable offense. It rejected an Article of Impeachment  based on Clinton's assertions of privilege.   And as the House Democrat's own witness, Professor Gerhardt, has  explained, in 1843, President Tyler similarly was investigated for  potential impeachment--his attempts to protect and assert what he  regarded as the prerogatives of his office as he resisted demands for  information from Congress. Professor Gerhardt explained Tyler's attempt  to protect and assert what he regarded as the prerogatives of his  office were the function of his constitutional and policy judgments,  and they could not be used by Congress to impeach him. President  Trump's resistance to congressional subpoenas was no less a function of  his constitutional and policy judgment, and it provides no basis to  impeach him.    I would like to close with a final thought. One of the greatest  issues--and perhaps the greatest issue--for your consideration in this  case is how the precedent set in this case will affect the future.   The Framers recognized that there would be partisan and illegitimate  impeachments. In Federalist No. 65, Hamilton expressly warned about  impeachments that reflected what he called ``the persecution of an  intemperate or designing majority in the House of Representatives.''  That is exactly what this case presents.   Justice Story recognized that the Senate provides the proper tribunal  for trying impeachments because it was believed by the Framers to have  a greater sense of obligation to the future, to future generations, not  to be swayed by the passions of the moment.   One of the essential questions here is, Will the Chamber adopt a  standard for impeachment--a diluted standard--that fundamentally  disrupts, damages, and alters the separation of powers in our  constitutional structure of government? Because that is what both the  first article--for reasons that Judge Starr and Professor Dershowitz  have covered--and the second article, the obstruction charge, would do.   I will close with a quotation from one of the Republican Senators who  crossed the aisle and voted against convicting President Andrew Johnson  during his impeachment trial. It was Lyman Trumbull who I think  explained the great principle that applies here. He said:         ``Once [we] set the example of impeaching a President for       what, when the excitement of the hour shall have subsided       will be regarded as insufficient causes, no future President       will be safe . . . and what then becomes of the checks and       balances of the constitution, so carefully devised and so       vital to its perpetuity? They are all gone.    Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   I will yield to Mr. Sekulow.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, House  managers, Mr. Philbin just concluded on the importance of executive  privilege.   Professor Turley, who testified before the House, said we have three  branches of government, not two. If you impeach a President, if you  make a high crime and misdemeanor out of going to court, it is an abuse  of power. It is your abuse of power.   With regard to executive privilege, it was Mr. Nadler who called it  ``executive privilege and other nonsense.''   When Attorney General Holder refused to comply with subpoenas,  President Obama invoked executive privilege, arguing ``compelled  disclosure would be inconsistent with the separation of powers  established in the Constitution''--``executive privilege and other  nonsense.''   Manager Schiff wrote that the White House assertion of executive  privilege was backed by decades of precedent that has been recognized  and has recognized the need for the President and his senior advisers  to receive candid advice and information from their top aides-- ``executive privilege and other nonsense.''   We talked about this the other night. The nonsense is to treat the  separation of powers and constitutional privileges as if they are  asbestos in the ceiling tiles. You can't touch them. That is not the  way the Constitution is designed.   We are going to now turn our attention to a separate topic. It is one  that  [[Page S596]]  has been discussed a lot on the floor here and will be discussed now.   Presenting for the President is the former attorney general for the  State of Florida, Pam Bondi. She is also a career prosecutor. She has  handled countless cases. She is going to discuss an issue that the  House managers have put pretty much at the center of their case, and  that is the issue of corruption in Ukraine, particularly with regard to  a company known as Burisma.   Mr. Chief Justice, I yield my time to former Attorney General Pam  Bondi.   Ms. Counsel BONDI. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, Members of the  Senate, when the House managers gave you their presentation, when they  submitted their brief, they repeatedly referenced Hunter Biden and  Burisma.   They spoke to you for over 21 hours, and they referenced Biden or  Burisma over 400 times. And when they gave these presentations, they  said there was nothing--nothing--to see. It was a sham. This is  fiction.   In their trial memorandum, the House managers described this as  baseless. Why did they say that? Why did they invoke Biden or Burisma  over 400 times? The reason they needed to do that is because they are  here saying that the President must be impeached and removed from  office for raising a concern, and that is why we have to talk about  this today.   They say sham. They say baseless. They say this because if it is OK  for someone to say, ``hey, you know what, maybe there is something here  worth raising,'' then, their case crumbles. They have to prove beyond a  reasonable doubt that there is no basis to raise this concern, but that  is not what public records show.   Here are just a few of the public sources that flagged questions  surrounding this very same issue. The United Kingdom's Serious Fraud  Office, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, Hunter Biden's  former business associate, ABC White House reporter, ABC's Good Morning  America, the Washington Post, the New York Times, Ukrainian law  enforcement, and the Obama State Department itself--they all raised  this issue.   We would prefer not to be talking about this. We would prefer not to  be discussing this. But the House managers have placed this squarely at  issue. So we must address it.   Let's look at the facts. In early 2014, Joe Biden, our Vice President  of the United States, led the U.S. foreign policy in Ukraine with the  goal of rooting out corruption. According to an annual study published  by Transparency International, during this time, Ukraine was one of the  most corrupt countries in the entire world.   There is a natural gas company in Ukraine called Burisma. Burisma has  been owned by an oligarch named Mykola Zlochevsky. Here is what  happened very shortly after Vice President Biden was made U.S. point  man for Ukraine. His son Hunter Biden ends up on the board of Burisma,  working for and paid by the oligarch Zlochevsky.   In February 2014, in the wake of anti-corruption uprising by the  people of Ukraine, Zlochevsky flees the country, flees Ukraine.  Zlochevsky, the oligarch, is well-known.   George Kent, the very first witness that the Democrats called during  their public hearings, testified that Zlochevsky stood out for his  self-dealings, even among other oligarchs. House managers didn't tell  you that.    Ambassador Kurt Volker explained that Burisma had ``a very bad  reputation as a company for corruption and money laundering.'' House  managers didn't tell you that.   Burisma was so corrupt that George Kent said he intervened to prevent  USAID from cosponsoring an event with Burisma. Do you know what this  event was? It was a child's contest, and the prize was a camera. They  were so bad--Burisma--that our country wouldn't even cosponsor a  children's event with Burisma.   In March 2014, the United Kingdom's Serious Fraud Office opened a  money laundering investigation into the oligarch, Zlochevsky, and the  company Burisma. The very next month, April 2014, according to a public  report, Hunter Biden quietly joins the board of Burisma.   Remember, early 2014 was when Vice President Biden began leading  Ukraine policy.   Here is how Hunter Biden came to join Burisma's board in 2014. He was  brought on the board by Devon Archer, his business partner. Devon  Archer was college roommates with Chris Heinz, the stepson of Secretary  of State John Kerry. All three men--Hunter Biden, Devon Archer, and  Chris Heinz--had all started an investment firm together.   Public records show that on April 16, 2014, Devon Archer meets with  Vice President Biden at the White House. Just 2 days later, on April  18, 2014, Hunter Biden quietly joins Burisma. That is according to  public reporting.   Remember, this is just 1 month after the United Kingdom's Serious  Fraud Office opened a money laundering case into Burisma, and Hunter  Biden joins their board.   And not only 10 days after Hunter Biden joins the board, British  authorities seized $23 million in British bank accounts connected to  the oligarch Zlochevsky, the owner of Burisma. Did Hunter Biden leave  the board then? No.   The British authorities also announced that they had started a  criminal investigation into potential money laundering. Did Hunter  Biden leave the board? No.   What happened was, then--and only then--did the company chose to  announce that Hunter Biden had joined the board after the assets of  Burisma and its oligarch owner, Zlochevsky, were frozen and a criminal  investigation had begun. Hunter Biden's decision to join Burisma raised  flags almost immediately.   One article from May 2014 stated that, ``the appointment of Joe  Biden's son to the board of the Ukrainian gas firm Burisma has raised  eyebrows the world over.''   Even an outlet with bias for Democrats pointed out Hunter Biden's  activities created a conflict of interest for Joe Biden. The article  stated: ``The move raises questions about a potential conflict of  interest for Joe Biden.''   Even Chris Heinz, Hunter Biden's own business partner, had grave  concerns. He thought that working with Burisma was unacceptable. This  is Chris Heinz. He was worried about the corruption, the geopolitical  risk, and how bad it would look. So he wisely distances himself from  Hunter Biden and Devon Archer's appointments to Burisma.   He didn't simply call his stepfather, the Secretary of State, and  say: I have a problem with this. He didn't tell his friends: Hey, guys,  I am not getting on the board. I want nothing to do with this.   He went so far as to send an email to senior State Department  officials about this issue. This is Chris Heinz. He wrote:         Apparently, Devon and Hunter have joined the board of       Burisma, and a press release went out today. I can't speak       [to] why they decided to, but there is no investment by our       firm in their company.    What did Hunter Biden do? He stayed on the board. What did Chris  Heinz do? He subsequently stopped doing business with his college  roommate Devon Archer and his friend Hunter Biden. Chris Heinz'  spokesperson said the lack of judgment in this matter was a major  catalyst for Mr. Heinz ending his business relationship with Mr. Archer  and Mr. Biden.   Now, the media also noticed. The same day, an ABC News reporter asked  Obama White House Press Secretary Jay Carney about it. Here is what  happened.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Jon KARL. Hunter Biden has now taken a position with the       largest oil and gas company--holding company in Ukraine. Is       there any concern about at least the appearance of a conflict       there--the Vice President's son--        Jay CARNEY. I would refer you to the Vice President's       Office. I saw those reports. You know, Hunter Biden and other       members of the Biden family are obviously private citizens,       and where they work does not reflect an endorsement by the       administration or by the Vice President or President. But I       would refer you to the Vice President's Office.    Ms. Counsel BONDI. The next day, the Washington Post ran a story  about it. It said: ``The appointment of the Vice President's son to a  Ukrainian oil board looks nepotistic at best, nefarious at worst.''  Again, ``The appointment of the Vice President's son to a Ukrainian oil  board looks nepotistic at best, nefarious at worst.''   And the media didn't stop asking questions here. It kept going. Here  is ABC.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Vice President BIDEN. You have to fight the cancer of       corruption.  [[Page S597]]         LLAMAS. But then something strange happened. Just three       weeks later a Ukrainian natural gas company, Burisma, accused       of corruption appoints Hunter Biden, seen here in their       promotional videos, to their board of directors, paying his       firm more than a million dollars a year.    Ms. Counsel BONDI. Here is more from ABC, continued on.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         LLAMAS. And Ukraine wasn't the only country where Hunter       Biden's business and his father's diplomacy as Vice President       intersected. It also happened in China. This video shows       Chinese diplomats greeting Vice President Biden as he arrived       in Beijing in December of 2013. Right by his side, his son       Hunter. Less than 2 weeks later, Hunter's firm had new       business, creating an investment fund in China involving the       government-controlled Bank of China, with reports they hoped       to raise $1.5 billion.    Ms. Counsel BONDI. In fact, every witness who was asked about Hunter  Biden's involvement with Burisma agreed there was a potential  appearance of a conflict of interest. Multiple House Democratic  witnesses, including those from the Department of State, the National  Security Council, and others, unanimously testified there was a  potential appearance of a conflict of interest. These were their  witnesses.   How much money did Hunter Biden get for being on the board? Well, if  we start looking at these bank records, according to reports, between  April 2014 and October 2015, Burisma paid more than $3.1 million to  Devon Archer and Hunter Biden. That is over the course of a year and a  half. How do we know this? Some of Devon Archer's bank records were  disclosed during an unrelated Federal criminal case having nothing to  do with Hunter Biden. These bank records show 17 months that Burisma  wired two payments of $83,333--not just for 1 month, for 2 months, for  3 months, but for 17 months. According to Reuters, sources report that  of the two payments of $83,333 each, one was for Hunter Biden and one,  Devon Archer.   Hunter Biden was paid significantly more than board members for major  U.S. Fortune 100 companies such as Goldman Sachs, Comcast, and  Citigroup. The typical board member of these Fortune 100 companies, we  know, are the titans of their industry. They are highly qualified, and  as such, they are well compensated. Even so, Hunter Biden was paid  significantly more. This is how well he was compensated: Hunter Biden  was paid over $83,000 a month, while the average American family of  four, during that time, each year made less than $54,000. That is  according to the U.S. Census Bureau during that time.   This is what has been reported about his work on the board. The  Washington Post said: ``What specific duties Hunter Biden carried out  for Burisma are not fully known.'' The New Yorker reported: ``Once or  twice a year, he attended Burisma board meetings and energy forums that  took place in Europe.''   When speaking with ABC News about his qualifications to be on  Burisma's board, Hunter Biden didn't point to any of the usual  qualifications of a board member. Hunter Biden had no experience in  natural gas, no experience in the energy sector, and no experience with  Ukrainian regulatory affairs. As far as we know, he doesn't speak  Ukrainian. So naturally the media has asked questions about his board  membership. Why was Hunter Biden on this board?   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Amy ROBACH. If your last name wasn't Biden, do you think       you would've been asked to be on the board of Burisma?        Mr. Hunter BIDEN. I don't know. I don't know. Probably not.    Ms. Counsel BONDI. So let's go back and talk about his time on the  board.   Remember, he joined Burisma's board in April 2014, while the United  Kingdom had an open money laundering case against Burisma and its  owner, the oligarch Zlochevsky. On August 20, 2014, 4 months later, the  Ukrainian prosecutor general's office initiates a money laundering  investigation into the same oligarch, Zlochevsky. This is one of 15  investigations into Burisma and Zlochevsky, according to a recent  public statement made by the current prosecutor general.   On January 16, 2015, prosecutors put Zlochevsky, the owner of  Burisma, on whose board Hunter Biden sat, on the country's wanted list  for fraud--while Hunter Biden is on the board.   Then a British court orders that Zlochevsky's $23 million in assets  be unfrozen. Why was the money unfrozen? Deputy Assistant Secretary  Kent testified to it.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         KENT. Somebody in the General Prosecutor's Office of       Ukraine shut the case, issued a letter to his lawyer, and       that money went poof.        CASTOR. So essentially paid a bribe to make the case go       away.        KENT. That is our strong assumption, yes, sir.    Ms. Counsel BONDI. He also testified that the Ukrainian prosecutor  general's office actions led to the unfreezing of the assets.   After George Kent's confirmation, that prosecutor was out. Viktor  Shokin becomes prosecutor general. This is the prosecutor you will hear  about later, the one Vice President Biden has publicly said he  wanted out of office.    In addition to flagging questions about previous prosecutors'  actions, George Kent also specifically voiced other concerns--this time  to the Vice President's Office--about Hunter Biden. In February 2015,  he raised concerns about Hunter Biden to Vice President Biden's Office.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         KENT. In a briefing call with the National Security staff       in the Office of the Vice President in February 2015, I       raised my concern that Hunter Biden's status as a board       member could create the perception of a conflict of interest.    Ms. Counsel BONDI. But House managers didn't tell you that.   This is all while Hunter Biden sat on Burisma's board. Did Hunter  Biden stop working for Burisma? No. Did Vice President Biden stop  leading the Obama administration's foreign policy efforts in Ukraine?  No. In the meantime, Vice President Biden is still at the forefront of  the U.S.-Ukraine policy. He pledges a billion-dollar loan guarantee to  Ukraine contingent on its progress in rooting out corruption.   Around the same time as the $1 billion announcement, other people  raised the issue of a conflict. As the Obama administration special  envoy for energy policy told the New Yorker, he raised Hunter Biden's  participation on the board of Burisma directly with the Vice President  himself. This is a special envoy to President Obama.   The media had questions too. On December 8, 2015, the New York Times  publishes an article that Prosecutor General Shokin was investigating  Burisma and its owner, Zlochevsky. Here is their quote: ``The  credibility of the vice president's anticorruption message may have  been undermined by the association of his son, Hunter Biden,'' with  Burisma and its owner, Zlochevsky.   And it wasn't just one reporter who asked questions about the line  between Burisma and the Obama administration. As we learned recently  through reporting on FOX News, on January 19, 2016, there was a meeting  between Obama administration officials and Ukrainian prosecutors.   Ken Vogel, journalist for the New York Times, asked the State  Department about this meeting. He wanted more information about the  meeting ``where U.S. support for prosecutions of Burisma Holdings in  the United Kingdom and Ukraine were discussed.'' But the story never  ran.   Around the time of the reported story--January 2016--a meeting  between the Obama administration and Ukrainian officials took place,  and a Ukrainian press report, as translated, says: The U.S. Department  of State made it clear to the Ukrainian authorities that it was linking  the $1 billion in loan guarantees to the dismissal of Prosecutor  General Viktor Shokin.   Now, we all know the Obama administration, from the words of Vice  President Biden himself--he advocated for the prosecutor general's  dismissal.   There was ongoing investigation into the oligarch Zlochevsky, the  owner of Burisma, at the time. We know this because on February 2,  2016, the Ukrainian prosecutor general obtained a renewal of a court  order to seize the Ukrainian oligarch's assets. A Kyiv Post article  published on February 4, 2015, says the oligarch Zlochevsky is  ``suspected of committing a criminal offense of illicit enrichment.''   Over the next few weeks, the Vice President had multiple calls with  Ukraine's President Poroshenko.   Days after the last call, on February 24, 2016, a DC consultant  reached out to  [[Page S598]]  the State Department to request a meeting to discuss Burisma. We know  what she said because the email was released under the Freedom of  Information Act. The consultant explicitly invoked Hunter Biden's name  as a board member.   In an email summarizing the call, the State Department official says  that the consultant noted that two high-profile citizens are affiliated  with the company, including Hunter Biden as a board member. She added  that the consultant would like to talk with Under Secretary of State  Novelli about getting a better understanding of how the United States  came to the determination that the country is corrupt.   To be clear, this email documents that the U.S. Government had  determined Burisma to be corrupt, and the consultant was seeking a  meeting with an extremely senior State Department official to discuss  the U.S. Government's position. Her pitch for the meeting specifically  used Hunter Biden's name, and according to the email, the meeting was  set for a few days later.   Later that month, on March 29, 2016, the Ukrainian Parliament finally  votes to fire the prosecutor general. This is the prosecutor general  investigating the oligarch, owner of Burisma, on whose board Hunter  Biden sat.   Two days after the prosecutor general is voted out, Vice President  Biden announces that the United States will provide $335 million in  security assistance to Ukraine. He soon announces that the United  States will provide $1 billion in loan guarantees to Ukraine.   Let's talk about one of the Democrats' central witnesses: Ambassador  Yovanovich. In May 2016, Ambassador Yovanovitch was nominated to be  Ambassador to Ukraine. Here is what happened when she was preparing for  her Senate confirmation hearing.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Representative RATCLIFFE. Congresswoman Stefanik had asked       you how the Obama-Biden State Department had prepared you to       answer questions about Burisma and Hunter Biden specifically.       Do you recall that?        Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. Yes.        Representative RATCLIFFE. Out of thousands of companies in       the Ukraine, the only one that you recall the Obama-Biden       State Department preparing you to answer questions about was       the one where the Vice President's son was on the board, is       that fair?        Ambassador YOVANOVITCH. Yes.    Ms. Counsel BONDI. So she is being prepared to come before all of  you--all of you--and talk about world issues, going to be in charge of  the Ukraine, and what did they feel the only company--the company--that  it was important to brief her on in case she got a question? Burisma.   Ambassador Yovanovich was confirmed July 2016 as the Obama  administration was coming to a close. In September 2016, a Ukrainian  court cancels the oligarch Zlochevsky's arrest warrant for lack of  progress in the case.   In mid-January 2017, Burisma announces that all legal proceedings  against it and Zlochevsky have been closed. Both of these things  happened while Hunter Biden sat on the board of Burisma. Around this  time, Vice President Biden leaves office.   Years later now, former Vice President Biden publicly details what we  know happened: his threat to withhold more than $1 billion in loan  guarantees unless Shokin was fired.   Here is the Vice President.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Vice President BIDEN. I said I'm not--we are not going to       give you the billion dollars. They said: You have no       authority. You're not the President. The President said--I       said: Call him. I said: I'm telling you, you are not getting       the billion dollars. I said: You are not getting the billion.       I'm going to be leaving here in, I think it was about 6       hours. I looked at them and said: I'm leaving in six hours.       If the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money.       Well, son of a bitch. (Laughter.) He got fired. And they put       in place someone who was solid at the time.    Ms. Counsel BONDI. What he didn't say on the video--according to the  New York Times, this was the prosecutor investigating Burisma, Shokin.   What he also didn't say on the video was that his son was being paid  significant amounts by the oligarch owner of Burisma to sit on that  board.   Only then does Hunter Biden leave the board. He stays on the board  until April 2019. In November 2019, Hunter Biden signs an affidavit  saying he ``has been unemployed'' and has no other ``monthly income  since May 2019.''   This was in November of 2019, so we know, from after April 2019 to  May 2019 through November 2019, he was unemployed, by his own  statement--April 2019 to November 2019.   Despite his resignation from the board, the media continued to raise  the issue relating to a potential conflict of interest.   On July 22, 2019, the Washington Post wrote that fired Prosecutor  General Shokin ``believes his ouster was because of his interest in the  company,'' referring to Burisma. The Post further wrote that ``had he  remained in his post, he would have questioned Hunter Biden.   On July 25, 2019, 3 days later, President Trump speaks with President  Zelensky. He said:         The other thing, There's a lot of talk about Biden's son,       that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want       to find out about that so whatever you can do with the       Attorney General would be great. Biden went around bragging       that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it .       . . It looks horrible to me.    The House managers talked about the Bidens and Burisma 400 times, but  they never gave you the full picture. But here are those who did: The  United Kingdom's Serious Fraud Unit; Deputy Assistant Secretary of  State George Kent; Chris Heinz, the ABC White House reporter; ABC  ``Good Morning America''; the Washington Post; the New York Times;  Ukrainian law enforcement; and the Obama State Department itself. They  all thought there was cause to raise the issue about the Bidens and  Burisma.   The House managers might say, without evidence, that everything we  just have said has been debunked, that the evidence points entirely and  unequivocally in the other direction. That is a distraction.   You have heard from the House managers. They do not believe that  there was any concern to raise here, that all of this was baseless. And  all we are saying is that there was a basis to talk about this, to  raise this issue, and that is enough.   I yield my time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Sekulow.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Majority Leader McConnell,  Democratic Leader Schumer, House managers, Members of the Senate, this  will be our last presentation before dinner.   The next lawyer representing the President is Eric Herschmann. He is  a partner in the Kasowitz firm, the law firm which has been  representing the President for over two decades. He is a former  prosecutor and trial lawyer, and he ran a natural gas company in the  United States.   He is going to discuss additional evidence the House managers ignored  or misstated and how other Presidents might have measured up under this  new impeachment standard.   Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, I  am Eric Herschmann. I have the honor and privilege of representing the  President of the United States in these proceedings. I have been  carefully listening to and reviewing the House managers' case. That  case pretty much boils down to one straightforward contention--that the  President abused his power to promote his own personal interests and  not our country's interests.   The House managers say that the President did not take the steps that  they allege for the benefit of our country but only for his own  personal benefit. If that is wrong, if what the President had wanted  would have benefited our country, then the managers have not met their  burden, and these Articles of Impeachment must be rejected. As we will  see, the House managers do not come close to meeting the burden.   Last week, Manager Schiff said that the investigations President  Trump supposedly asked President Zelensky about on the July 25 call  could not have been in the country's interest because he said they were  ``discredited entirely.'' The House managers say that the  investigations had been debunked; they were sham investigations. Now we  have the question: Were they really?   The House managers in the over 21 hours of the repetitive  presentation never found the time to support those conclusory  statements. Was it, in fact, true that any investigation had been  debunked? The House managers do not  [[Page S599]]  identify for you who supposedly conducted any investigations, who  supposedly did the debunking, who discredited it. Where and when were  any such investigations conducted? When were the results published? And  much more is left unanswered.   Attorney General Bondi went through for you some of what we know  about Burisma in its millions of dollars in payments to Vice President  Biden's son and his son's business partner.   There is no question that any rational person would like to  understand what happened. I am going to go through some additional  evidence, which was easily available to the House managers but which  they never sought or considered.   Based on what Attorney General Bondi told you in this additional  evidence, you can judge for yourself whether the conduct was suspect.  As you know, one of the issues concerned Hunter Biden's involvement  with the Ukrainian natural gas company, which paid him millions of  dollars while his father was Vice President and was in charge of the  Ukrainian portfolio during the prior administration. I will get to  those supposedly discredited allegations identified by the House  managers in a few minutes.   The other issue was what Manager Schiff called ``the baseless  conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, interfered in the 2016  election.''   Manager Schiff said that President Trump wanted to ``erase from  history his previous political misconduct.'' But there was no previous  political misconduct. If any theory has actually been discredited, it  is the theory that President Trump colluded with Russia in 2016. It was  that theory that was discredited, and discredited entirely, by Mr.  Mueller's massive investigation--the same investigation the Democrats  demanded since President Trump took office; the same investigation they  knew, they were absolutely sure, would expose such collusion; the same  investigation, which, after 22 months of exhaustive work at a cost to  the taxpayers of $32 million, found no conspiracy and no evidence of  Russian collusion with the Trump campaign.   As we will see, the Democrats are as wrong now about the Articles of  Impeachment as they were in 2016 about the Russian collusion.   As to the other incident President Trump mentioned--the one  concerning the Ukrainian gas company Burisma--I actually think this is  something that is undisputed, that Ukraine had a particularly bad  corruption problem. It was so corrupt that dealing with corruption and  solving the corruption was a priority for our U.S. foreign policy. Here  is how one knowledgeable observer of Ukraine put it in 2015:         It's not enough to set up a new anti-corruption bureau and       establish a special prosecutor fighting corruption. The       Office of the General Prosecutor desperately needs reform.       The judiciary should be overhauled. The energy sector needs       to be competitive, ruled by market principles--not sweetheart       deals. It's not enough to push through laws to increase       transparency with regard to official sources of income.       Senior elected officials have to remove all conflicts between       their business interests and their government       responsibilities.    As Attorney General Bondi said, here are the facts we do know about  Hunter Biden's involvement with Ukraine. Burisma, a Ukrainian natural  gas company, paid Hunter Biden millions of dollars to serve on its  board of directors. He did not have any relevant expertise or  experience. He had no expertise or experience in the natural gas  industry. He had no known expertise in corporate governance nor any  expertise in Ukrainian law. He doesn't, so far as we know, speak  Ukrainian. So why--why--did Burisma want Hunter Biden on its board? Why  did they want to pay him millions of dollars? Well, he did have one  qualification. He was the son of the Vice President of the United  States. He was the son of the man in charge of the Ukrainian portfolio  for the prior administration. And we are to believe there is nothing to  see here, that for anyone to investigate or inquire about this would be  a sham--nothing to see here.   But tellingly, Hunter Biden's attorney, on October 13, 2019, issued a  statement on his behalf. He indicated that in April 2014, Hunter was  asked to join the board of Burisma, then states Hunter stepped off  Burisma's board in April 2019.   Now listen to the commitment that Hunter Biden is supposedly willing  to make to all of us. Hunter makes the following commitment: Under a  Biden administration, Hunter will readily comply with any and all  guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue to address  purported conflicts of interest or the appearance of such conflicts,  including any restrictions related to overseas business interests.   That statement almost tells us all we need to know. That is the rule  that should have been in place in 2014 because there already was an  Obama-Biden administration. What changed? What changed?   Remember a couple of minutes ago when I quoted an expert on Ukraine,  the one who said that Ukraine must clean up its energy sector, the one  who said that Ukraine's senior elected officials have to remove all  conflicts between their business interests and their government  responsibilities? You know who said that about Ukraine? Vice President  Joe Biden in December of 2015.   Vice President Biden went to Ukraine approximately 12 to 13 times. He  spoke with legislators, business people, and officials. He was  purportedly fighting corruption in Ukraine. He was urging Ukraine to  investigate and uproot corruption.   One thing he apparently did not do, however, was to tell his son not  to trade on his family connections. He did not tell his son to  especially stay away from the energy sector in the very corruption- ridden country Vice President Biden was responsible for.   And Manager Schiff says: Move along; there is nothing to see here.  What are the House managers afraid of finding out? In an interview with  ABC in October of last year, Hunter Biden said he was on the board of  Burisma to focus on principles of corporate governance and  transparency.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Mr. Hunter BIDEN. Bottom line is that I know I was       completely qualified to be on the board, to head up the       corporate governance and transparency committee on the board.       And that's all that I focused on.    Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. But when asked how much money Burisma was  paying him, he responded he doesn't want to ``open his kimono'' and  disclose how much. He does refer to public reports about how much he  was being paid, but as we now know, he was being paid far more than  what was in the public record.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
