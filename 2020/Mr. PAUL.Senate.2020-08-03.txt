 Mr. President, Col. Ronald Dudley Ray, USMC, served as the  Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Guard/Reserve) during the Reagan  administration and was a highly decorated Vietnam veteran who was an  adviser to the South Vietnamese Marine Corps during the Tet Offensive  and other campaigns. He was awarded two Silver Stars, a Bronze Star  with combat V, and a Purple Heart. His gallantry under fire was  exceeded only by his tenacious advocacy for his fellow veterans. He  entered law school at the University of Louisville, where he graduated  at the top of his class. Throughout his civilian career, he used his  talent and professional skills to encourage, organize, and recognize  veterans from the Vietnam era. He personally championed the Kentucky  Vietnam Veterans' Memorial in Frankfort, and led the way in raising $1  million for its design and construction. A great student of American  history, he amassed a collection of over 10,000 books on the subject,  and he shared his vast knowledge by writing and speaking about the  history of the country he loved and served with such distinction.  Colonel Ray, who passed away July 6, 2020, leaves a unique legacy of  personal service to our Nation and dedication to its veterans that is  worthy of this special distinction.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  interns in my office be granted floor privileges until August 8, 2020:  Rachel Carpenter, Brett Abbott, Rachel Altman, Daniel Rankin, Maddie  Martin, Jacob Lambert, Noah Vehafric, Jackson Berryman, and Duke  Garschina.
