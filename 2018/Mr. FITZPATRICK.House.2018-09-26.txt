 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a nonprofit  organization in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that actively seeks to  improve the lives of disadvantaged youth in our community.   The R.J. Leonard Foundation, based in Doylestown, was founded in 2008  to assist adolescents who transition out of the foster care system once  they turn 18. Oftentimes, many of these young people lack the resources  they need to live self-sufficient lives once they have aged out of the  system.   That is where the R.J. Leonard Foundation comes in, awarding young  adults fellowships that provide individualized grants to further their  education or career. These grants assist not only with books and  tuition costs, but also provide transportation support and social and  cultural enrichment opportunities. To provide stability and  encouragement, each fellow is matched with a mentor who provides  support and guidance.   I am proud of the work that the R.J. Leonard Foundation does for our  community, and thank them for their 10 years of service to our  community. I also commend founder Jo Leonard and executive director  Caitlin Deppeler for their outstanding leadership.                            Recognizing Tom Buzby     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an individual  in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, whose decades of service to our  community were recently honored with a meaningful tribute.   Tom Buzby, who served the people of Hilltown Township for 46\1/2\  years, most recently as director of public works, retired earlier this  year. Whether plowing the roads in winter or mowing the grass in the  summer, Tom spent his career improving and beautifying our community's  infrastructure and recreational facilities.   Tom's over four decades on the job touched countless families in  Bucks County. To show their appreciation, township officials recently  named the baseball field at Civil Park the Thomas A. Buzby Baseball  Field. This worthy dedication was officially unveiled on September 12.   I would like to extend my gratitude to Tom for his years of service  to Hilltown Township and our entire community. I also want to recognize  township supervisor Ken Bennington and township manager Lorraine Leslie  for their work as well. I wish Tom all the best in his retirement and  his successor, Thomas Hess, success in his new role.                         Recognizing Jeanne Lakawitz     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an individual  in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who has dedicated her career to the  safety and well-being of our community's children.   Pennsbury School District Transportation Director Charlie Williams  recently named Jeanne Lakawitz as the Pennsbury 2018 School Bus Driver  of the Year. For the past 14 years, Jeanne has transported students to  area schools, including Pennsbury High School, Penn Wood Middle School,  William Penn Middle School, and Quarry Hill Elementary School. During  this time, she cultivated strong and inspirational relationships with  her students and their families. Jeanne says she treats all children on  her bus as if they are her own, a statement that I think puts into  context her dedication to the job.   Her job driving does not stop with Pennsbury. In the summer, she also  transports summer campers who participate in programs at the Lower  Bucks Family YMCA, assisting our community's families.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Jeanne on this much deserved recognition.  I also thank Charlie Williams for his dedication to transportation  safety in our community in Bucks County                            ____________________
