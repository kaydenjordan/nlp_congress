 Mr. Speaker, I stand in support of my amendment  demanding action in response to the Havana syndrome incidents affecting  Americans around the world.   The recent string of mysterious attacks on U.S. diplomats and  personnel, often called Havana syndrome, is a serious threat to our  national security.  [[Page H4146]]  Having spoken directly with individuals impacted, I know these attacks  are having lasting and detrimental impacts on the health of our  Nation's public servants.   I stand here today to call for a robust, interagency response, one  that reflects the severity and urgency of the situation.   The State Department must play an active role in this response, share  relevant information with Congress, particularly the House Foreign  Affairs Committee, and make sure all affected personnel receive prompt  and appropriate care. It is our duty to ensure our public servants get  the care and answers they deserve.   As a former Federal employee, I intend to keep pressing the  administration to better protect our diplomats and Federal employees  serving at home and abroad.   I know firsthand their commitment to their missions, their devotion  to our country, and the promises we have made to them.   I urge my colleagues to join me in this cause.
