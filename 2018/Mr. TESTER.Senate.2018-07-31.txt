 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and legacy  of a brave American, Eugene Joseph Earley.   Eugene's story begins in 1884 in Watertown, MN, where he was born to  Bernard and Cordelia Earley. He was one of 16 children. He grew up on  his parents' farm, learning independence, grit, and an ability to fend  for himself.   From his parents' farm, he left to homestead and log the nearby  forests in the Black River Country of Northern Koochiching County, MN.  There, his determination was tested by the hot summers and long, brutal  winters. Through the many challenges he faced, Eugene persevered.   After the United States entered World War I, Eugene enlisted as a  private in the U.S. Army 23rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Division. It  wasn't long before he was deployed to France as a part of the American  Expeditionary Forces led by General John Pershing.   Under Pershing's command, Eugene prepared for battle. On September  12, 1918, in Saint-Mihiel, France, Eugene and his comrades contributed  to a major turning point. The American offensive caught the Germans  unaware and in the process of retreating. The courage and determination  of the American forces solidified the stature of U.S. military might in  the eyes of our European allies and enemies.   During the second day of fighting, Eugene endured a shrapnel wound  that would prove fatal. He died on the field of combat in northeast  France, less than 2 months before the end of the war. Eugene was just  24 years old. He is buried in the Saint-Mihiel American Cemetery in  Thiaucourt, France, alongside 4,153 of his fellow fallen comrades.   Back in Minnesota, Eugene's family honored his memory and mourned his  death for the rest of their lives. In the years after his death,  Eugene's mother established a local American Legion Post in his name.  Watertown American Legion Post 121 still honors the memory and the name  of Eugene Earley today.   Earlier this year, Eugene's grand-nephew Jim Bruggeman and his  daughters Megan and Molly traveled to France to visit his grave.  Through their hard work, Eugene was awarded with the Purple Heart Medal  in the centennial year of his death. His life and brave service will  live on through this honor and the memory that his loved ones hold  dear.   To Eugene Joseph Earley, on behalf of myself, Montana, and a grateful  nation, I extend our deepest thanks for Eugene's service, sacrifice,  and valor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the bold and  groundbreaking service of Dolores ``Dee'' Nelson.   When Dee was only 20 years old, she longed to serve her country in  World War II, just like her brothers. She joined the Women's Army Air  Corps but, to her disappointment, was placed in an office job. That  wasn't what Dee had in mind, and she told her superiors that that was  not what she signed up for.   Because of Dee's boldness, she began to get special assignments and,  before long, was promoted to special operator. She passionately tackled  every challenge and task brought before her. Her service took her to  the newly opened Pentagon in Washington, DC, where she helped with  preparations for the Allied landing at Normandy. For this mission, she  was personally sworn to secrecy by President Roosevelt. Decades later,  Dee still feels the sacrifice of the Allied lives that were lost on the  beaches of Normandy.   At every step of her career in the Women's Army Air Corps, Dee faced  discrimination and disapproval from the men she worked alongside. Men  would stand in front of her in line-ups when their superiors would walk  by. Her superiors refused to put any of her special assignments or  accomplishments into her record. After helping plan some of the most  pivotal moments of the war, her military record unfairly downplayed her  contributions to our Nation.   After her military service, she used her GI Bill benefits to get a  college education. At school, she met her husband, Donald, a fellow  veteran of the U.S. Navy. She continued to buck tradition by traveling  and working alongside her husband. As Donald continued his career in  the military, Dee continued to serve her country in civil service.   Dee's passion and intelligence has taken her far in life. From  working in a shipyard in Long Beach, to teaching children on the windy  Aleutian Islands, Dee found joy and fulfillment in serving other  people.   Dee is a miraculous woman who has not received enough recognition and  appreciation for her service to our Nation in World War II. She didn't  let anyone get in the way of her desire to serve, and our Nation is  better off today because of her strength and determination. Women like  Dee paved the way for generations of Montana and American women to take  up the call to arms and serve our Nation.   I stand here today to say thank you to Dolores Nelson for her  service, strength, and sacrifice, on behalf of myself, Montana, and a  grateful nation.                            ____________________
