 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 795 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 795         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order without intervention of any point of order to       consider in the House the resolution (H. Res. 789) censuring       Representative Paul Gosar. The amendment to the resolution       printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying       this resolution shall be considered as adopted. The       resolution, as amended, shall be considered as read. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       resolution and preamble, as amended, to adoption without       intervening motion or demand for division of the question       except one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Ethics or their respective designees.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), who  is the distinguished ranking member of the Rules Committee, pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration  of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 795, providing for consideration of  H. Res. 789, Censuring Representative Paul Gosar, under a closed rule.  The rule self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairman Deutch and  provides 1 hour of general debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ethics or their  respective designees.                                time  1230    Madam Speaker, in any other Congress, the actions of Representative  Paul Gosar might be easier to dismiss. After all, every single minute  of every single day, 5,000 minutes of content are uploaded onto  YouTube.   So my colleagues across the aisle or the public might ask, who cares  about one YouTube video post by Representative Gosar? He is just one of  many Americans posting his fantasies online, even if his involve a  violent scene in which he attacks and murders people that he has  labeled as enemies of the American people, a colleague in Congress, and  the President of the United States.   But it is just an anime video, so it is not a big deal, right?   Actually, it is a big deal. And here is why: People listen to Paul  Gosar. He is an elected official; and that gives him credibility,  whether justified or not. So while there are indeed 5,000 minutes of  content uploaded every single minute of every single day, Mr. Gosar's  video got real attention, just as he intended.   American citizens stopped what they were doing to watch something  that a Member of the U.S. Congress had fashioned. He posted it on his  official Congressional social media, where he has hundreds of thousands  of followers, and where the video was viewed over 3 million times.   And what he posted was violence; fantasized violence. A wish made in  a very specific way.   As I said, in any other decade, or any other Congress, this public  endorsement of violence by a Member of Congress might have been excused  as a lapse in judgment, or even possibly a bad joke.   But this Congress knows what happens when members of the radical  right get stirred up by their leaders.   Just a few months ago, this Congress had to hide in safe rooms under  the protection of police and soldiers, or barricade ourselves in our  offices because our place of work was overwhelmed by armed citizens who  wanted to hang some of us.  [[Page H6330]]    This Congress has seen threats against Members of Congress more than  double, forcing Members to pay for additional security for their homes,  offices, and families; rethink how to engage with constituents; and  even wear bulletproof vests to public events.   So when a Member of this Congress fantasizes in public about  beheading another Member of Congress, it is not fantasy to think that  there are Americans out there who will take such a video as a call to  action.   A recent poll reported that 85 percent of Americans get their news  from Facebook, while only 13 percent of Americans get their news from  print. Are we really to believe that during this moment in time, that  among that 85 percent, there are no Americans who will see this video  and indulge in fantasies of their own?   Every single day Members of this body receive death threats. I have  gotten them. We all have. Our staffs and families have to deal with  abusive and violent phone calls, emails, letters, and social media  posts. And these threats are particularly numerous and violent for  Members who are women of color.   So every day we have to deal with the threat that somewhere out there  is a radicalized American who has been taught to hate us, to regard us  as evil, to fantasize, and even mobilize using that same social media,  to eliminate us, taught by conspiracy theorists and far-right  extremists; or by a fellow Member of Congress.   That is not imagination; that is fact.   In any other context, and especially in any other workplace, someone  posting a video of himself killing a coworker would not be acceptable,  and an employee who did that would almost certainly be fired.   In any other context, and especially in a school, a student using  school resources to post a video of himself beheading a classmate and  attacking a school official would not be acceptable, and that student  would face disciplinary charges, if not criminal charges, and would  likely be referred for a mental health evaluation.   But for the privileges traditionally afforded to Members of Congress,  in any other context, someone posting a video of himself killing a  Member of Congress and attacking the President of the United States  would almost certainly be reported to the Secret Service and U.S.  Capitol Police.   We must condemn this celebration of political violence because, in  addition to upholding the honor and integrity of the U.S. Congress,  every Member of this body deserves to come to work and feel safe. That  is true for any worker in any part of this country.   It is unacceptable that our colleague would have to sit across from  someone who has threatened her life in such a vivid way, and it is  unacceptable for this body to let that action go unpunished.   This is the House of Representatives of the United States Congress.  We are all elected to be the leaders of this great country, and with  that role comes immense responsibilities. People look up to us, they  take our lead.   So when a Member posts a video of himself killing his colleague, that  is obviously going to have an impact on the way people approach their  politics.   So we cannot dismiss Representative Gosar's violent fantasies as a  joke because, in this decade, in this America, someone is going to take  him seriously. He is a public figure and, as we vividly saw on January  6, the words and actions of public figures can readily act as a spark  to the tinder of radical extremism. And God help us all when that  happens.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I would have to agree with my learned colleague that these are  unusual actions, but these are also unusual times. Every time we have  seen a new low in conduct from our colleagues across the aisle, we get  crickets or excuses from the Republican Party. Indeed, it took 9 days  before the minority leader publicly spoke about this threat; and his  silence spoke volumes, both to the American people and those who were  paying attention to Mr. Gosar's post.    Instead, we have heard multiple reports that our colleagues are  considering punishing their colleagues who voted for the bipartisan  infrastructure package. I think that speaks volumes about where their  priorities lie.   We will continue to see Members emboldened by the lack of  accountability engaging in evermore outrageous conduct, placing both  the integrity of Congress and the safety of its Members at risk.   While Mr. Gosar has since taken down his post, he has not apologized.  In fact, he said publicly on TV that he does not apologize. He has  doubled down on his decision to post the video saying, the cartoon  exposes the threats to America. It doesn't make a threat to anyone.   I would have to disagree with his assessment.   As to the claim that there hasn't been enough of a process, that this  should have gone to the Ethics Committee; I will remind my colleagues  that we heard in the Rules Committee last night that the majority  requested an emergency meeting of the Ethics Committee, which the  minority denied.   And this isn't a case where there are facts to discover. The actions  of Representative Gosar were not hidden for an investigatory body to  discover. His misconduct was paid for and produced with public  resources and posted on an official public Twitter account, where it  got more than 3 million views before it was taken down.   There is no dispute about whether Representative Gosar posted the  reprehensible video depicting the murder of one of his colleagues on  his official channels. And the Republican Conference has had 2 weeks to  decide to take action and hold him accountable. Instead, they are  debating whether to punish their colleagues for voting for  infrastructure for the American people.   So we have said that--it actually just strikes me as odd that our  colleagues would argue that this forms a harmful precedent, and that  the threat of violence or murder in the future might be cause to  censure and strip members of their committees. If that is the case,  then sign me up because I do think that is reprehensible and deserves  censure.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York  (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the distinguished chairwoman of the  Committee on Oversight and Reform.                                time  1245     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, like the distinguished gentleman from  Oklahoma, I, too, long for the times when the norms of civilized  conduct in this House were observed. When, perhaps, our colleagues  across the aisle can return to those norms, then motions and  resolutions like the one we are considering today will not be  necessary.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey  (Mr. Payne).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished chairman of the Rules  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close if the gentleman  is prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a November 9 Insider article  entitled: ``GOP Lawmakers Want to Punish the 13 Republicans Who Voted  for Biden's Infrastructure Bill By Kicking Them Off Congressional  Committees, Report Says.''                      [From the Insider, Nov. 9, 2021]   GOP Lawmakers Want To Punish the 13 Republicans Who Voted for Biden's     Infrastructure Bill by Kicking Them Off Congressional Committees,                                Report Says                              (By Tom Porter)         Republican leaders in the US House of Representatives are       expecting a bid to punish the 13 Republicans who voted for       President Joe Biden's $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill by       stripping them of committee assignments, according to a       report.        Punchbowl News reported that some Republican lawmakers were       determined to take action against the 13, several of whom are       ranking members or senior Republicans on House committees or       subcommittees.        The report did not detail what level of support the move       might have as of Tuesday morning.        Under House rules, a party's steering committee has the       power to recommend that a lawmaker be removed from committee       assignments, which is then subject to a vote by the caucus       and the full House.        It is a punishment that has historically been reserved for       lawmakers who have been accused of crimes, or been involved       with extremism.        The support of the 13 Republicans was ultimately vital for       the infrastructure bill passing into law last week, with six       Democrats voting against it amid a monthslong dispute in the       party over a connected bill that is being stalled in the       Senate. The infrastructure bill was passed by the Senate in a       bipartisan vote in June.        The move to take action against the 13 Republicans who       supported the infrastructure bill highlights the fury of some       GOP lawmakers against party colleagues for backing Biden's       legislation.        Several hard line loyalists to former President Donald       Trump on the far right of the GOP House caucus, including       Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene and Matt Gaetz, have been       publicly critical of the 13 lawmakers. Trump himself has also       criticized them.        ``Here are the `Republicans' that just voted to help Biden       screw America,'' Greene tweeted last week, branding them       ``traitors, and sharing pictures and phone numbers of them.        In an Monday CNN interview, Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan--      one of the 13 Republicans who voted for the infrastructure       bill--played a threatening message he'd received after the       vote.        ``I'll tell you it's a terrible way--we have seen civility       really downslide here. I'm concerned about my staff. They are       taking these calls,'' he said.        There has long been tensions in the GOP between centrists       and Trump loyalists. In May, Rep. Liz Cheney was removed from       her leadership role in the House GOP over her criticism of       Trump and his baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election.     Madam Speaker, as I indicated, there are some in the  Republican Conference who want to kick 13 Republicans off their  committees for voting for an infrastructure bill that will benefit  their constituents, but when a Member of Congress publicly celebrates a  video depicting the murder of a colleague, silence.   It is disgraceful that Congress is the one place in the United States  where a video calling for the murder of a Member of Congress is not  universally condemned, and it is a sad thing for this institution.   Madam Speaker, we are here to address the conduct of a Member of  Congress who disseminated and celebrated a video that portrays him  murdering another Member of Congress and attacking the President of the  United States.   The evidence speaks for itself. There is nothing more to review.  Nothing to investigate. No questions to answer or facts to find.   We have all seen the video. We have heard Mr. Gosar's response, and  we have seen the lack of response from the Republican Party leadership  to condemn Representative Gosar's celebration of violence to make clear  that such actions are unacceptable, and that political violence is  unacceptable in the United States of America.  [[Page H6335]]    In the absence of meaningful action by his own party, it is up to  Members of the House of Representatives and the country as a whole to  decide whether such actions deserve consequences.   Today, we ask ourselves, is this behavior acceptable to you? Is it  acceptable to the American people? The way we vote today says a lot,  not only about the integrity of the Members who are entrusted with the  privilege of representing this great country, but also the direction in  which we are headed.   I am grateful to the few Republican colleagues who have the integrity  and the guts, quite frankly, to condemn Mr. Gosar's actions. But, once  again, Republican leadership lacks the courage to properly manage the  actions of their conference, and so Congress must act.   Rejecting political violence should not be a partisan effort. How far  has the party of Lincoln fallen that it would excuse this conduct? We  must say that political violence is not acceptable in the United States  of America.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the rule and  underlying resolution.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:         Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the       following:        That immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       resolution (H. Res. 796), amending the Rules of the House of       Representatives to prohibit the consideration of a resolution       proposing to remove a Member from a standing committee unless       the resolution is offered by, or with the concurrence of, the       Leader of the party of the Member that is the subject of the       resolution. The resolution shall be considered as read. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       resolution to adoption without intervening motion or demand       for division of the question except one hour of debate       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Rules. Clause 1(c) of       rule XIX shall not apply to the consideration of House       Resolution 796.                                H. Res. 796         Resolved,       SECTION 1. REMOVAL OF A MEMBER FROM A STANDING COMMITTEE.         Clause 5(a)(1) of rule X of the Rules of the House of       Representatives is amended to read as follows:        ``(1)(A) The standing committees specified in clause 1       shall be elected by the House within seven calendar days       after the commencement of each Congress, from nominations       submitted by the respective party caucus or conference. A       resolution proposing to change the composition of a standing       committee shall be privileged if offered by direction of the       party caucus or conference concerned.        ``(B) A resolution proposing to remove a Member from a       standing committee shall not be in order unless offered by,       or with the concurrence of, the Leader of the party of the       Member that is the subject of the resolution.        ``(C) The Committee on Rules may not report a rule or order       that waives the application of subdivision (B).''.     Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
