 Madam President, today I am honored to congratulate my  friend and colleague, Senator Johnny Isakson on his retirement from the  U.S. Senate after 15 years of dedicated service. Senator Isakson served  the State of Georgia and the entire Nation with integrity, inspiring  future generations through his public service. He has led a remarkable  career, and he will be truly missed in the Senate. I am proud to know  Johnny, and I wish him and his wife, Dianne, all the best in his  retirement.
