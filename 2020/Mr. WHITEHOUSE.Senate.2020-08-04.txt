 Mr. President, I had the chance to at least hear the  end of Senator Capito's speech. I thank her for the work she has done  on the opioid issue that she was talking about. It is one of the very  productive areas of bipartisanship going all the way back to CARA with  Senator Portman and myself. I know West Virginia, like Rhode Island,  had a terrible situation. I appreciate very much her comments.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am here today for a different topic.  I am here for the 269th time with my increasingly battered ``Time to  Wake Up'' poster to try to alert this Chamber to the threat of climate  change--something, obviously, Louisiana knows very well--and to the  forces that are blocking action on climate.   In these climate speeches, I have talked often about the insidious  encroachment on American Government of special interest power, which is  what is behind all this climate denial and obstruction.   It didn't happen on its own. The fossil fuel industry's political  forces used the cover of anonymous funding--what we call dark money-- and they used phony front groups and clever propaganda to accomplish  their aims.   In effect, these fossil fuel political forces have run a covert  operation against our own government. We observe the disturbances; we  hear the rustling in the leaves; we see strange sites, but many of us  haven't connected the dots. Those who are familiar with some of the  elements may not put the whole story together. Some are so accustomed  to this sinister behavior that they think it is normal. Some folks are  like a city dweller in the jungle, needing a field biologist to  identify the behaviors going on around them.   Let me give you this field biologist's overview. We understand pretty  well the crew of bad actors lurking behind climate denial. Democrats in  the Senate have repeatedly called out and reported on this web of  denial funded by the fossil fuel industry. Investigative journalists  like Jane Mayer and scholars like Naomi Oreskes have dug into this  scheme. There is actually a robust academic subspecialty that analyzes  this web of denial as a novel socioeconomic and political phenomenon.   The covert special interest machinery behind that effort is not just  dedicated to opposing climate legislation. Another covert operation it  runs is chronicled in our recent Senate Democrats' report here that  examines the bad actors behind the special interest Court capture  operation. This operation has crept forward over years, even decades.  The Republican Party is more the tool of this effort than its  principal. Big donors are behind it. The goal here is to fashion for  the donors a Supreme Court that will not just rule for but reset  society's ground rules to favor the big donors behind the scheme.   On yet another front, there has been recent public reporting  revealing the bad actors rushing to stand up a new and improved  Republican voter suppression apparatus as they start to panic about the  November election.   Earlier this year, longtime partisan court fixer Leonard Leo stepped  down from his formal role as executive vice president of the Court  capture command center at the Federalist Society. At the same time, a  mysterious new project called the Honest Elections Project began voter  suppression work in swing States like Florida, Nevada, Wisconsin, and  Michigan. It ran ads accusing Democrats of cheating with mail-in  ballots; it sent threatening letters to election officials challenging  voter rolls; and it filed legal proceedings--lots of legal  proceedings--arguing for more voting restrictions ahead of November.   But in their hurry, they did a weak job of covering their tracks.  Reporters quickly uncovered that the Honest Elections Project is a  rebrand of the Judicial Education Project--a key cog in that same  Leonard Leo's machine.   As the Guardian reporters who broke the story observed, ``By having a  hand in both voting litigation and the judges on the Federal bench,  [Leo's] network could create a system where conservative donors have an  avenue to both oppose voting rights and appoint judges who would back  at that effort.''   Last, we pretty well know who funds the massive and often anonymous  political operation that props up the Republican Party. Take 2016, for  instance, when the fossil fuel billionaire Koch brothers' political  operation spent $2 million on ads targeting viable Democratic  candidates in just two Senate races--Ohio and Wisconsin   Over a year before the election, they were already at work bombing  those candidates. They didn't use their names. They hid behind phony  front groups. It took years to dig this out, but that is what happened.   The anonymously funded U.S. Chamber of Commerce spent nearly $40  million in 2016 and 2018 supporting Republican House and Senate  candidates.   Dark waves of untraceable dark money pour everywhere into Republican  elections. From slips and leaks and investigative reporting, we can see  enough overlap across these four efforts to state the general  proposition: It is the same crew.   If you look at it as a covert operation run by special interests  against their own country, it has at least these four programs, but it  has one set of interests behind it: They run the climate denial covert  op. They run the Court capture covert op. They rushed out the voter  suppression op. And, with their money, they captured the Republican  Party to use as their front.   If this operation were not covert, if it were obvious, if the press  and the public could readily connect the dots, it wouldn't work. People  would know it was fossil fuel polluter money. They  [[Page S4718]]  would get the joke. That is why it has to be a covert operation, and  that means it needs dark money--anonymous, untraceable funds.   A virulent little galaxy of 501(c)(4) groups, shell corporations,  donor trusts, and other screening tools has been crafted to anonymize  the donors and hide the connections. Why? Because the blood pumping  through this beast that gives it life is dark money. If we expose that  secret blood flow, the whole beast shrivels up: no dark money, no  covert operations.   That is why efforts to expose the dark money donors provoke such  hysterical reactions from the front groups and from their operatives  and from their mouthpieces like the Wall Street Journal editorial page.   I have experienced these hysterical reactions over and over. Indeed,  there was one in the news today. This speech might provoke even  another.   But at the end of the day, as Americans, I believe we share the  proposition that nothing could be more corrupting than large flows of  anonymous money in politics. That sort of money doesn't even have to be  spent to be corrupting. The mere threat of a political attack can do  the job, and the donor saves the money. Or it could be a private  promise of unlimited support.   Once a political weapon is permissible, private threats and promises  to use or withhold that weapon are inevitable, and they are inevitably  corrupting.   But don't think the prospect of corruption daunts the schemers. A  political regime that allows their corruption and helps cover up their  covert operations is precisely what the dark money donors want.   Why else would we do nothing about climate change when it is so  obvious? Why else would we ignore every respectable scientist in the  field? Why else ignore warnings of financial meltdown looming from  bankers and economists across the country, even across the world? Why  else ignore the fires that are burning up Siberia, for Pete's sake,  and, closer to home, the flood warnings along our coasts and the  droughts and the floods and the storms across our States?   When astronomers see celestial bodies behave inexplicably, they look  for the dark star, the black hole that influences the behavior of the  visible bodies. Dark money is the dark star, the evil star influencing  Congress's behavior--or I should say misbehavior--on climate change.   So a preview of coming attractions here: The dark-money-funded race  to capture the Court is also a race by the schemers to establish a new  constitutional doctrine protecting their dark money schemes. Such a  doctrine is already being grown in the dark-money-funded ideological  hothouses, a theory that dark money anonymity is protected by the First  Amendment rights of association and petition--a theory giving powerful  interests the constitutional right to run covert operations against  their own government, leaving regular citizens beguiled or bewildered.   That theory may seem ludicrous, and, indeed, this notion got only the  one vote from Justice Thomas in Citizens United, but remember that  Thomas is the dark money crowd's leading indicator on the Court.   Don't scoff. This argument is now popping up all over the corporate  rightwing. Twice so far I have had corporate entities from whom I  requested information about their dark money dealings ``plead the  First'' in response to my questions.   The game is on, whether we realize it or not, and one of the stakes  in the game is climate action. We cannot be idle about this. Groups  that run covert operations against our own country are not to be  trusted with that country's welfare.   What a foul convergence it would be if the dark money schemers used  dark money to fund a Court capture operation that delivered a Court- created doctrine hatched in dark money hothouses, protecting that dark  money from disclosure for eternity, permanently etching into our  Constitution this pathway of corruption.   As I have said over and over, take away the corrupting dark money  weaponry from the fossil fuel industry, and we solve climate change. We  have lost a decade to Citizens United, the decision that gave this  industry the weaponry to kill climate bipartisanship. It is a decade we  and our children will rue having lost.   Let's lose no more time. Let's, once and for all, root out the  corrupting dark money machinery, expose its nefarious and crooked  covert operations, shut it down, and start running a real democracy  around here again.   If we can't do this now, then let's pray for an election that lets us  do it soon.   I yield the floor.
