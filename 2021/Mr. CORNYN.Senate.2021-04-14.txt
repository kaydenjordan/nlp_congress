 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the new power dynamic in Washington has  brought about a frenzy of proposed institutional changes by our friends  across the aisle.   The American people elected a Democratic President, that is true;  they reduced the Democratic majority in the House; and elected a 50-50  Senate. In all of Congress, there are seven more Democrats than  Republicans. That is all--7 out of 535 Members.   Despite these tight margins, our friends on the other side have tried  to characterize this new power dynamic as a mandate, and they have  floated a tsunami of rule changes to go along with it. First came the  push to eliminate the filibuster.   Just a few years ago, the idea of such a radical change terrified our  Democratic colleagues. We certainly didn't do it when we were in a  position to do it, notwithstanding the encouragement of President  Trump.   When Republicans held control of the Senate, the House, and the White  House, as our Democratic colleagues do now, our friends on the other  side of the aisle feared the filibuster would come tumbling down. They  were so concerned, in fact, that 33 of our colleagues signed on to a  letter insisting that the filibuster be preserved. Leader McConnell  agreed. He never wavered to pressure from anyone, even the President,  to eliminate the filibuster. He has been around this Chamber and this  Senate a long time, and he knows that what goes around comes around.   As the leader correctly noted, Democrats didn't just spend the last 4  years supporting the filibuster, they took every advantage of the  opportunity for  [[Page S1916]]  the minority to stop legislation they disagreed with. They spent 4  years using it.   Our Democratic colleagues employed the filibuster to kill quite a  number of Republican bills on pandemic relief, government funding, pro- life legislation, police reform, and the list goes on and on.   Despite the fact our friends on the other side of the aisle  consistently praised and utilized the filibuster in recent years, now,  after the election of 2020, they seem to have reversed course. Since  the political tides have changed, so, too, have the views of many  Senate Democrats.   In recent months, one of our colleagues referred to the filibuster as  making a mockery of American democracy.   I happen to remember at John Lewis's funeral--the great civil rights  icon--even former President Obama called it a ``relic of Jim Crow,''  arguably giving permission to Democrats to call the filibuster a racist  obstacle to making progress in the country.   Another Senator said that the filibuster had deep roots in racism,  even though last summer Democrats used this tool to block an anti- lynching bill.   The entire debate has ballooned beyond reason, and the past few  months have been a game of ``will they or won't they'' when it comes to  eliminating the filibuster.   You know, the filibuster has very sound origins. It forces us to do  what I think the American people would want us to do anyway, and that  is to work together. It forces us to do that. And building consensus is  hard, as we all know.   Well, we now have confirmation that our Democratic colleagues do not  have the votes. Last week, Senator Manchin of West Virginia took to the  pages of the Washington Post and said he will not support eliminating  or weakening the filibuster. He has been here long enough to know that  what you can do in the majority will have consequences when you are in  the minority, as you eventually will be if you are here long enough.   I was appreciative of what Senator Manchin said in those pages. I am  sure it wasn't easy. I am sure there is a lot of pressure on him to be  expedient, to jam things through on a partisan basis, and I appreciate  his willingness to stand up.   I agree with the Senator from Arizona, who said: We don't have a rule  problem. We have a people problem. We have a behavior problem.   We need to restore bipartisan cooperation. There is no chance that  will happen if everything in the Senate is jammed through along party  lines.   The filibuster is designed to protect our country from the continual  change of who is in the majority and who is in the minority and to  provide the American people a chance to plan their lives. If anything  that can be done in one election can be undone in the next election,  that is an invitation to chaos.   Unfortunately, the list of proposed institutional changes doesn't end  with the filibuster. Over the last few years, our friends on the other  side of the aisle have also set their sights on the Supreme Court.   We all remember the day a sitting Member of this body threatened two  Supreme Court Justices by name. As the Justices were debating a case,  the current majority leader said, on the steps of the Supreme Court:         You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price.    Well, I think he realized the error in making that statement because  he then followed up with--well, this isn't the point where he realized  the error because he doubled down on it. He said:         You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these       awful decisions.    Well, we know this wasn't an isolated incident. It is true that the  majority leader tried to walk back his words later after he realized  how intemperate and inappropriate they were when directed at two  sitting members of the U.S. Supreme Court.   We don't have to remember too far in the past to know how the words  we speak here in Congress and as public officials--the impact they can  have on other people's minds and perceptions, especially those who are  not particularly stable in the first place.   Well, several of our Democratic colleagues filed an amicus brief in  which they threatened the Supreme Court with retribution unless they  got the outcome that they wanted.   Thank goodness our Founders designed the Federal Government with  three separate but equal branches. Through this system of checks and  balances, they sought to prevent any one branch of government from  forcing its will on the other two. Standing up on the steps of the  Supreme Court and issuing threats to the Justices that they must do  what you want or else is certainly not consistent with the Founders'  vision.   Let me be clear. An independent judiciary is the crown jewel of our  Constitution and our constitutional Republic--an independent judiciary.  In the words of Supreme Court Justice John Roberts, ``We should  celebrate our strong and independent judiciary as a source of national  unity and stability.'' But now, even this hallowed institution is being  attacked by our Democratic colleagues unless they get the result they  want. They are trying to intimidate the members of the Supreme Court.   Then there is the most recent discussion--threat, really--about  packing the Supreme Court with additional members. The push to pack the  Supreme Court has been a mainstay of the far left for years, but it has  now made its way into the Biden administration.   Previously, throughout his campaign, President Biden refused to weigh  in on this topic. He knew how explosive this was, this threat to pack  the Court, to make it a political body, to eliminate its role as an  independent judiciary. Well, he refused to weigh in on it during the  campaign, and I have no doubt this was an important strategic decision.  He realized how offensive that would be to the voters he hoped would  vote for him in 2020. A poll last fall found that less than one-third  of Americans support increasing the number of Justices on the Supreme  Court.   The President previously said he is ``not a fan of court packing.''  In fact, he called it a ``bonehead idea.'' He referred to President  Roosevelt's proposal to pack the Court as a ``terrible, terrible  mistake.'' But now President Biden has appeared to have embraced this  ``bonehead idea'' and this ``terrible, terrible mistake'' that he  condemned previously.   The first step was last week when he created a Commission to examine  adding members to the Supreme Court of the United States above the  current nine. This decision and announcement came despite the fact that  Justices on both sides appointed by Presidents on both sides of the  aisle have affirmed the integrity of the Supreme Court with just nine  members.   Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was an icon for the liberals on the  Court and many people in America, said: ``Nine seems to be a good  number.''   Just last week, Justice Breyer said that the Court's authority  depends on ``a trust that the court is guided by legal principle, not  politics.'' He said that these types of changes would erode the trust  that the American people must have in the highest Court in the land.   The American people simply won't have faith in an independent  judiciary if one side is adding names to the roster so that they can  game the outcome. They need to get involved in the legislative process  if they want to make policy, not try to make politics through the  judiciary, through the Supreme Court.   So I would urge President Biden to heed his own words that he  delivered with such conviction during his time on the Judiciary  Committee when he said that President Roosevelt's decision ``put in  question for an entire decade the independence of the most significant  body . . . in this country.''   Well, unfortunately, the power grab doesn't stop there. The single  biggest legislative goal of our friends on the other side of the aisle  is an attempted takeover of State election laws. That is in spite of  the fact that article I of the Constitution explicitly gives the States  the power to regulate the ``times, places, and manner of holding  elections.'' Yet this massive bill creates a one-size-fits-all mandate  that every State must follow. It preempts State law, but I doubt it  would ultimately be held up as constitutional because of the explicit  guarantee that the States will regulate the time, manner, and place of  holding elections.    But there are also other changes that our Democratic colleagues-- where they  [[Page S1917]]  seek to reap the benefit of a politicized Supreme Court and Federal  Agencies.   In this instance, the Federal Election Commission has six members,  three from each party--intentionally designed to be a tie vote if they  vote along party lines, to protect the Commission from partisan  politics.   We have learned that a fair and balanced Commission, which has been  the standard for many years, isn't the gold standard for Democrats when  they are in control of Congress and the White House. The election  takeover bill introduced by our Democratic colleagues would remove one  of the seats held by a Republican member of the Commission and turn the  FEC into a partisan body. No more equal representation. No more  consensus building. Why bother with that if you can steamroll an agenda  with no opposition?   Then there is the taxpayer funding of political campaigns. Instead of  candidates working to gain the support, the vote, the activism and  contributions from their preferred candidate, our Democratic colleagues  want the taxpayer to pay for those campaigns. And it is not even a  dollar-for-dollar match. The American taxpayer would pay $6 dollars for  every $1 dollar that was donated to a candidate. That means if someone  donates 200 bucks to their preferred candidate, the Federal Government  would match that with up to $1,200. Those are taxpayer dollars. That is  money coming out of your pocket whether you support that candidate's  policies or not.   On top of that, there are campaign vouchers proposed which would  provide eligible voters with a $25 voucher to donate to the campaign of  their choosing. I would rather this funding support the people and  organizations that really need it: crime victims, unaccompanied  children on our border, domestic violence, shelters. There are far more  urgent needs for this money than our Democratic colleagues' campaign  account.   Of course, this effort comes at a time when the House Democrats are  already trying to overturn the results of an Iowa congressional  election in order to boost their own numbers.   This confluence of institutional changes isn't about repairing a  broken system; it is revolutionary. It is a revolution. You can't win  every case before the Supreme Court? Well, just add some more liberal  Justices. You can't build support for legislation? Well, eliminate the  filibuster and the need to build consensus and to work together on a  bipartisan basis. You can't win an election? Overturn the results and  secure government funding or taxpayer funding for your candidates. And  to cement these changes for a generation, better throw in a complete  partisan takeover of our election laws.   Our Democratic friends are taking the saying ``If you can't win the  game, change the rules'' to a whole new level. This has been branded by  propaganda, really, as a way to fix the system. Well, the system is not  broken, and to the extent it needs reforms, it can be reformed at the  State level, where the Constitution provides the authority for the  States to run their elections.   Well, I think it is important for the American people to understand  exactly what is going on here. You can't understand what is going on  here by just reading social media or watching cable news shows that  reinforce your own bias. Unfortunately, our news these days seems to be  like ships passing in the night, and people pick the channel that  reaffirms their previous bias and doesn't challenge people with ideas  that perhaps they are not familiar with or don't agree with, which is  the way we ought to be dealing with each other. It is OK to disagree,  but we ought to engage each other in a civil and respectful manner and  to work those out in the crucible of our democracy known as the  Congress.   I yield the floor.
