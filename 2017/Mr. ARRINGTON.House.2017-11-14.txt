 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support 76 years of celebrating  God's Word during National Bible Week. No other book has sold more  copies or changed more lives than the Bible.   Abraham Lincoln said: ``In regard for this great book, I have this to  say, `It is the best gift God has given to man. All that the good  Savior gave to the world was communicated through this book.' ''   May we always remember the impact the Bible has had on this country  and on our democracy. May we govern according to its timeless precepts  and principles, and may God bless these United States of America.                            ____________________
