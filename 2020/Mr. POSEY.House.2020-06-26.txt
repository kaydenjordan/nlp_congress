 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   ``We want America back.'' Those were just a few of the lyrics of a  song written by a group named The Steeles in 1996. Some of the lyrics  said:       Something is wrong with America.      This Nation is like a runaway train,      Headed down the wrong track.    And it concludes, in part, with:       I love America. But I do not love what she has become.    Circumstances seemed pretty despairing back then, but they pale in  comparison to what we are seeing going on across our country today,  perpetrated by Marxists, anarchists, and those malcontents who are  funding them.   Today, the miscreants are using George Floyd's death to neuter the  ability of the police to enforce the law. So far, they have been  successful in getting the police out of the way.   Without law enforcement, their mobs are free to move in, smash  businesses, injure people, and cause chaos. Those aren't peaceful  protesters, and they are not peaceful protests.   Their outcry for justice makes sympathetic, or perhaps even cowardly,  corporations and stupid movie stars send money to them. Now they are  tearing down the statues, intimidating the public and politicians into  accepting their farfetched demands, and giving them even more power.   Circumstances are advantageous for them right now because we are in  the midst of a pandemic so they have a freer rein of the streets.   Who could have ever imagined sanctuary cities where America's rule of  law is ruefully ignored by government officials?    Who would have ever imagined some elected officials would allow  domestic terrorists or wannabe revolutionaries to commandeer a complete  takeover and rule of both public and private property and have dominion  over other unwilling citizens of the United States in so-called  autonomous zones.   Give me a break.   Then, the lawbreakers have the audacity to demand our police be  defunded or reimagined, whatever the heck that means. It sounds insane.   It is really a campaign to drive our duly-elected President Donald  Trump from office. Anyone who stands in their way they think should be  destroyed.   We can expect it to get worse and worse until November 3, when they  hope to put an end to the prosperity created by the President. You have  to suffer from the world's worst case of Potomac fever, or beltway  brain drain, to think they are fooling anybody.   Meanwhile, the leadership and majority in this Chamber have been  silent. I have not heard a single word, syllable, or letter uttered by  them in opposition to the miscreants. It is past time for them to  condemn their activities, and it is time for law enforcement across  this Nation in every State, in every county, in every city, in every  little burgh, community, and the rural areas in-between to put an end  to this lawlessness.   If you don't start acting soon, there wouldn't be anything left to  tear down. I would like to take a bunch of these wannabe  revolutionaries to South or Central America for a few days to see how  their game would end if they were successful in having it their way.                                time  1800    If you have ever traveled throughout those socialist countries there,  it is a very eye-opening experience. The State Department, and even  their own officials, warn you, don't wear any jewelry; don't carry much  cash, because there is a good chance you are going to get robbed. And  if you are approached by a robber, hand over everything, hold back  nothing, because they would just as soon shoot you and kill you as not  shoot you and kill you.   There is a lot of lawlessness, and they don't fear justice. They  don't fear the police. They are going to take, and you are going to  give, or you are going to die. And you know what the State Department  and the local officials tell you next? If you get robbed, don't call  the police. It is not like in our country where, if there is a problem,  you call the police. There, they tell you not to call the police  because they are all corrupt and they will shake you down for anything  the robbers missed.   One common denominator of the countries that I visited, which was  Brazil, French Guiana, Suriname, and Trinidad, was a common denominator  that every single house that I saw, large or small, urban or suburban,  no matter how far out you went into the country, every single house  that was more than a cardboard box had bars on every window and most of  the doors. Why? Because that is what lawlessness brings.   They truly go to bed every night in those socialist countries with  the expectation that if they did not have bars, they wouldn't wake up  in the morning; or if they did, every possession that they had that was  worth anything would be gone.   Very little police, high crime, high unemployment, bars on all the  windows. Is that what we really want for our future?   We have been blessed to live in the land of opportunity, the most  free and prosperous nation in the history of the world. Many, many,  many people have risked their lives and the lives of their wives, their  grandparents, their parents, their children, family members to come  here. This place is really that good that people would risk their life  just to come here, a chance at coming here. We cannot stand back and  let it be destroyed. We want America back.
