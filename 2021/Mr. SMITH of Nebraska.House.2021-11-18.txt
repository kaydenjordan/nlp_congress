 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition. It seems  the majority has seen everything that the American people are angry  about and are doubling down instead of addressing the very problems  that need to be addressed.   Americans are angry about the proposed million-dollar payments to  folks who want to come to our country illegally. This bill makes that  worse.   Americans are angry they can't get the IRS to answer the telephone.  This bill spends $45 billion to further weaponize the IRS.   Americans are angry that store shelves are empty and prices are  rising because of worker shortages. This bill makes it worse.   Americans can't get necessities like cars. In my district, newly  manufactured farm equipment sits unfinished and undelivered because of  chip shortages. This bill makes it worse.   Our economy is hurting. We need to get the American people back to  work. This bill is only going to make life harder and more expensive  for the very people who some are claiming to try to help.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.
