 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about  Social Security and its importance to the American people.   Mr. Speaker, everybody is alarmed by the fact that we have been  dealing with a global pandemic. That global pandemic, commonly referred  to as COVID, has taken close to a million lives in the United States of  America. Over 700,000 of those lives are individuals over the age of  65.   The COVID pandemic has also turned the economy upside down and has  led to a period of inflation. And during that period, the group that is  impacted the most as well are seniors in America. It is people that are  on fixed incomes that need our help directly.   There are more than 10,000 baby boomers a day who become eligible for  Social Security. And for about 40 percent of senior beneficiaries,  Social Security provides the majority of their income. And for one in  six Americans, it provides more than 90 percent of their income. And  yet, shamefully, the United States Congress has not taken action on  this in more than 50 years.   Today, and every day, you can hear Members come to the floor and talk  about their concern for our constituents; most notably, the elderly and  even more poignantly, the veterans. More veterans rely on Social  Security disability than they do on the VA. And yet, Congress has not  addressed this issue in more than 50 years. The last time Congress  addressed this issue, milk was 72 cents a gallon. Everybody knows that  those prices have become so high today that it causes seniors to have  to put food back on the grocery shelves because they can't afford it.  This is especially true for people of color.   Mr. Speaker, I commend our former leader, John Lewis, who pointed out  and said that Social Security is the next Civil Rights Movement because  of the discrimination that is taking place within Social Security. And  because also, people have come to rely on it because it is a guarantee.   We don't have to go back to 1929 and the great crash. We only have to  go back as far as 2008 and 2009 to look at what happened in that  recession and find out that people's 401(k) became a 101(k). And yet,  during that same time period, Social Security never missed a payment-- not a pension payment, not a spousal payment, not a dependent coverage  payment, and not a disability payment.    This is not something the President can do by executive order, nor is  it anything that the Supreme Court is going to adjudicate. This is the  responsibility of the United States Congress, and help is on the way.  People are going to have an opportunity to vote on Social Security  2100, bringing Social Security into this century and then also  rectifying the discrimination that has taken place.   Recent polls show this: That 64 percent of Black adults say securing  Social Security should be the top priority for the President and  Congress to address this year. Martin Luther King had a better way of  saying it. He called it the ``fierce urgency of now.''   In the midst of this pandemic, remember this, my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle: These are your brothers and sisters. These are your  parents. These are your aunts and uncles. These are your co-workers.  These are people you worship with.   Over 5 million Americans get below-poverty level checks from Social  Security. Why? Because Congress hasn't taken on its responsibility and  stepped up to the plate and done what is expected of them.   I commend  Jim Clyburn, our leader here, who has come out strongly in  favor of making sure that we address this inequality.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, what a great honor for me to  be here today and pay tribute to the fighting Hornets of East Hartford  High. The girls' team has won the State championship in the State of  Connecticut for the first time in the school's history.   Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, Maureen Rodgers ushered in modern-day  girls' basketball at then-Penney High School. The crown today is that  these young women demonstrated that vision and brought home the State  championship to East Hartford, Connecticut.                            ____________________
