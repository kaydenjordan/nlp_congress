 Madam President, I have spoken at length about the  serious impact the Democrats' impeachment obsession has had on months'  worth of important legislative priorities. For months, the Republicans  have been calling for bipartisan solutions to the NDAA, to the  appropriations process, and more, but only in the last couple of days,  here in mid-December, have our Democratic colleagues gotten  sufficiently serious about these must-pass bills.   In the meantime, while we have waited on the House Democrats to act,  the Senate has made good use of our floor time to complete the American  people's business with respect to nominations. Last week alone, the  Senate confirmed two executive branch nominations and put eight  impressive jurists in seats on Federal district courts.   This week, we have considered yet another slate of the President's  well-qualified nominees. The Senate will consider today John Sullivan,  of Maryland, to serve as Ambassador to the Russian Federation, Stephen  Hahn, of Texas, to serve as Commissioner at the Food and Drug  Administration, and Aurelia Skipwith, of Indiana, to be Director of the  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.   Already this week, we have confirmed two more outstanding jurists to  the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit--Patrick Bumatay, of  California, and Lawrence VanDyke, of Nevada. Mr. Bumatay is a graduate  of Yale and Harvard Law School. He clerked for the Eastern District of  New York and the Tenth Circuit, practiced in the private sector, and  served in a variety of roles with the Department of Justice. Mr.  VanDyke graduated from Montana State University and Harvard Law School.  His career has included a clerkship with the DC Circuit, time as a  State solicitor general, and service as Deputy Assistant Attorney  General at the Department of Justice. Both of these jurists are well  qualified, and both have widespread respect from legal peers. Now they  are the 49th and 50th circuit judges to have been nominated by  President Trump and confirmed by the Senate in the last 3 years.   As I have said before, these kinds of milestones are emphatically not  partisan achievements. It is not one party or the other that benefits  when our  [[Page S7000]]  Federal courts consist of men and women who understand that a judge's  job is to follow the law, not to make the law. The entire country  benefits from that. Our constitutional system benefits from that as  well. If a judge's applying our laws and our Constitution as they are  written strikes anybody as a threat to one's particular agenda, it is  the agenda that needs to change, not the judiciary the Framers  intended.   On another matter, as I said, the Democrats' fixation with  impeachment has pushed critical governing priorities right into the  eleventh hour. Just yesterday, after months of delays and hostage- taking, the House Democrats finally approved an NDAA conference report.  Next week, the Senate will pass it and send this overdue legislation to  President Trump. Yet, of course, we need to follow up Defense  authorization with Defense appropriations so that we actually supply  the funding our servicemembers need to carry out their missions and our  commanders need to plan for the future.   It is not just defense funding that has been hampered by the  Democrats' impeachment obsession and reluctance to do anything  bipartisan. All Federal funding has been jeopardized by the House's  procrastination. That includes critical domestic programs with  implications for every one of our colleagues and all of our  constituents. Even today, at this late date, the Democratic leadership  is continuing to delay a bipartisan agreement on appropriations. Even  now, at the eleventh hour, the Democratic leadership is still  threatening to potentially tank the whole process and force another  continuing resolution.   Look, the story is the same as it has been for months--partisan  policy demands, poison pills. It is exactly the playbook the Speaker of  the House and the Democratic leader had explicitly promised months ago,  in writing, they would not use in order to sabotage appropriations.   Let me say that again. Last summer, the Speaker of the House and the  Senate Democratic leader explicitly promised in writing that they would  not use poison pills or changes to Presidential transfer authorities to  sabotage the appropriations process. Yet, even in mid-December, they  are still using those tactics to jeopardize all of our progress.   It doesn't have to end this way. I know earnest discussions are still  underway as our colleagues in both Chambers work to fix this. I urge  the Democratic leadership to let the committees do their work, to let  the Congress do its work, and to let us pass legislation on a  bipartisan basis next week.   On a related matter, while we hold out hope for a breakthrough in  appropriations, we also know there has been one major casualty of  Speaker Pelosi's impeachment obsession--Congress's ability to pass the  President's USMCA this year.   It was more than a year ago that President Trump first signed the  draft agreement with the leaders of Canada and Mexico--more than 12  months ago. That is how long the House Democrats have dragged their  heels on the USMCA and have kept 176,000 new American jobs on ice. Now,  at the eleventh hour, Speaker Pelosi has finally realized it would be  too cynical and too nakedly partisan to allow her conference's  impeachment obsession to kill the USMCA entirely.   So after a year of obstruction, she finally gave in to Republican  pressure and struck a notional deal with the White House. But actions  have consequences. That entire calendar year that House Democrats  wasted has consequences. The Speaker's action was so belated that the  administration is still--still--in the process of writing the actual  bill. We don't have a bill yet. Once a bill is produced, the House has  to take it up first, and then, under trade promotion authority that  exists to protect the deals Presidents negotiate, after House passage,  the bill spends up to 15 session days in the Senate Finance Committee.  After that, there are up to 15 session days for the Senate to vote on  the floor.   So, unfortunately, the Speaker's 12 months of delay have made it  literally impossible for the Senate to take up the agreement this year.  And if House Democrats send us impeachment articles, those have to come  first in January, so the USMCA will get pushed back yet again.   Like I said, actions have consequences. There is just no way the  Senate can make up for 12 months of House Democratic delays in just a  couple of days. Governing is a question of priorities. Speaker Pelosi  failed to make this trade deal a priority for the entire year, and we  are now bound by the time requirements of TPA to protect the agreement  here in the Senate.   On one final matter, speaking of priorities, listen to what the House  Democrats are prioritizing. Listen to what they are doing today while  all of this crucial legislation goes unfinished: more Judiciary  Committee hearings on impeaching the President and on the floor, a vote  on yet another far-left messaging bill with literally no chance of  becoming law.   They are spending floor time on their socialist scheme to micromanage  Americans' prescription drugs and put the Federal Government in charge  of the medicines so many people rely on. The Speaker wants to take us  down the road of nationalizing an entire industry and imposing  Washington's stifling influence on the life sciences sector that  produces lifesaving cures--never mind the fact that this far-left  messaging bill has zero chance of passing the Senate and that President  Trump has already threatened to veto it.   We know by now that political performance art takes precedence over  bipartisan legislation where this Democratic House has been concerned.  I hope these stunts--stunts--come to an end soon. I hope the House  finds time to finish negotiating the things we actually have to pass-- the funding of the government. I hope we can do that in good faith. I  hope our Democratic colleagues join Republicans at the table, and let's  get the American people's business that must be done accomplished.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the  Senate the conference report accompanying S. 1790.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum  called be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I send to the desk a resolution  authorizing representation by the Senate Legal Counsel and ask for its  immediate consideration.   Mr. President, this resolution concerns a civil action pending in New  Jersey Federal court against Senator Schumer and various private  entities. The plaintiff previously brought a lawsuit arising out of the  revocation of his medical license by the New Jersey State Board of  Medical Examiners, and that lawsuit was dismissed. In this lawsuit,  plaintiff asserts a conspiracy among Senator Schumer and two large  insurance companies, a bank, a law firm, and a media company, to  obstruct and undermine plaintiff's previous lawsuit by having the  Senator use his influence over the presiding judge to dismiss the case.  Plaintiff's claims against Senator Schumer are subject to dismissal for  failure to State a claim and on jurisdictional grounds. This resolution  would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent Senator Schumer  in order to seek dismissal of the claims against him.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have 5 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate.
