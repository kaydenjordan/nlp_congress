 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for  yielding today.   Today, the issue is rules reform. Let's answer some commonly asked  questions about agency rules.   Question number one: What is a rule? To be clear, rules were made by  unelected, unrecallable, unaccountable bureaucrats.   Question number two: Why do agencies write rules? It has been said on  the floor, and even by an expert commentator on C-SPAN, that Congress  created agencies to write rules. Wrong. Congress created agencies to  implement laws passed by elected people, not create new laws outside of  their delegated authority.   Question number three: Most people back home think Congress makes all  the Federal laws. Is that true? Wrong. For every law elected  representatives make, unelected, unrecallable, unaccountable  bureaucrats can make 1,000 or more new rules enforceable as laws. Last  time I checked, there were 170-some volumes of Federal code that were  actually passed by elected representatives. The laws known as rules  made by unelected, unrecallable, unaccountable bureaucrats could fill  this Chamber.                                time  2015    Question number four: Can an American citizen end up in court or in  prison for violating a rule made by an unelected, unrecallable,  unaccountable bureaucrat? The answer is yes. It is estimated that if a  citizen is called into Federal court, it is 100 to 1,000 times more  likely to be a result of violating a rule made by an unelected person  than a law.   Question number five: Are there any further restrictions on  unelected, unrecallable, unaccountable bureaucrats' ability to write  rules enforceable as laws that can end up putting American citizens in  court or in prison? Yes. Currently, unelected, unrecallable,  unaccountable bureaucrats who write a rule with an impact of over $100  million, as you heard earlier, have to write a cost-benefit analysis.   Question number six: Does that mean that they can write a rule with  an impact of less than $100 million without doing one? Sure. It seems  like it is okay to write rules as enforceable as laws that negatively  affect Americans if the cost is estimated to be only $99,999,999.   Question number seven: Do agencies always perform cost-benefit  analyses as required if the proposed rule has a $100 million or greater  impact? The answer is no. Some unelected, unrecallable, unaccountable  bureaucrats, unfortunately, are also arrogant, petulant, and defiant.  One study revealed one rule had an $80 billion negative impact, but the  agency had refused to do the required study saying, you, meaning  Congress, can't make me, and we couldn't.   Not all Federal rules writers are guilty of bad behavior, for sure.  We have many employees who add great value to the process, but we must  establish needed guidelines for those who exceed and abuse legislative  intent and authority.   I could go on for hours, but my time is limited, so I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation to regain authority for  lawmaking back from unelected, unaccountable, unrecallable bureaucrats  by supporting this much-needed legislation reform.   Before I yield, I would like to say that I collected Federal  Registers for the last 4 years of the last administration. Instead of  throwing them in the trash like most people do because we can't act on  them, I started building a stack in the corner. My office became a  tourist attraction. I had people from almost every State come into my  office and want to have their picture taken before the stack of rules  implemented by unelectable, unrecallable, unaccountable bureaucrats.   How big do you think that stack got to be after 4 years? A lot of  people say probably over my head. Actually, it was seven stacks over 10  feet high, over 70 linear feet of rules, longer than the entire amount  of laws passed in this country since its founding.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman again for yielding.
