 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2  because it is a critical investment in our roads, bridges, schools, and  other vital infrastructure. Not only that, this plan ensures we build a  clean energy economy that will address the climate crisis and make our  communities healthier and safer.   Amendments Nos. 37 and 71, which we are debating today, are two of my  bills that prioritize investments in environmental justice communities.  These are the communities that are overburdened with pollution and are  being hit the hardest with impacts of both the climate crisis and  COVID-19.   The Climate Action Planning for Ports Act creates a competitive grant  program at EPA that will incentivize ports to implement climate action  plans, reduce their air pollution, and engage the communities to reduce  the cumulative impacts of the pollution from the nearby port.   EPA is uniquely equipped to manage a grant program like this and will  complement the Ports Initiative that already exists at the agency. Most  importantly, though, this program provides flexibility for ports and  port authorities while requiring strong emissions targets and near-port  community engagement.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the  passage of these amendments and H.R. 2.
