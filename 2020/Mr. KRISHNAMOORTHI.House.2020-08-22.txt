 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New  York for her leadership.   Madam Speaker, I rise as a proud cosponsor of H.R. 8015, the  Delivering for America Act.   Madam Speaker, the USPS is under attack. In the last month,  Postmaster General DeJoy has made irreversible changes causing mail  delivery backlogs as long as 3 weeks. But don't just take my word for  it; 1,612 constituents of mine have contacted us about delayed mail.   Denise Winchar contacted us saying: I run a small business and rely  on the  [[Page H4289]]  post office to receive payment for my clients. Without payment, I have  no income. Any delay in getting paid is a big hardship for me. In the  past month, I have had to wait several weeks for payment.   Take Vanesa Deben's word for it. She says: My insurance forces us to  get our prescription delivered by mail, I have diabetes and I need to  take my meds or risk health problems. The USPS is a service that we all  pay for with our taxes and as a paying customer we need to demand that  we get our service back now.   The Delivering for America Act includes three important provisions,  Madam Speaker.   It reverses the dangerous operational changes implemented by  Postmaster DeJoy.   It includes $25 billion in relief to the USPS.   It requires the USPS to treat all official election mail as first- class mail.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.
