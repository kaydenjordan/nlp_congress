 Mr. Speaker, today, over 68 million women participate  in elections. This would not be possible without the brave and  brilliant suffragettes who never gave up the fight for equal rights.   Tomorrow, we celebrate the 100th anniversary of House passage of an  Amendment to the United States Constitution guaranteeing women the  right to vote. This historic centennial offers an unparalleled  opportunity to commemorate this victorious milestone of the women's  suffrage movement.   A vibrant democracy requires that all voices are heard, and when all  voices are heard, we have a stronger and better America.   These women fought to be heard and to make our Nation a better place,  and, for that, we are forever grateful.                            ____________________
