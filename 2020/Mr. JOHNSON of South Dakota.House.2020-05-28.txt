 Mr. Speaker, last I knew, 20 million  American had not received their stimulus checks.   In the 3 months since the CARES Act, I have been patient; South  Dakotans have been patient as they wait for help some of them truly  need.   Mr. Speaker, my patience has run low, especially since Americans are  also waiting months for their tax returns.   Ben, from Marshall County, filed his in February. He is $400 short on  rent. He has been counting on his tax return. It is his money. But the  IRS has not returned his phone calls, and they have not returned the  phone calls or emails of congressional offices.   Workers in hospitals and in factories and in packing plants and in  banks are working overtime to meet the needs of this Nation. I do not  see that same  [[Page H2326]]  dedication from the leadership of the IRS, and it is past time, Mr.  Speaker, for them to get it together.                            ____________________
