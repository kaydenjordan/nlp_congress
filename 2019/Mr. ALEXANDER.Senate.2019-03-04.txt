 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, on Thursday, I suggested that  President Trump has sufficient congressional authority to spend the  $5.7 billion he asked for in his January 6 letter to the Senate  Appropriations Committee chairman to build 234 miles of border wall  without resort to a dangerous national emergency precedent that could  upset the constitutional separation of powers that goes to the heart of  our freedom.   I believe the President has clear authority to transfer up to $4  billion among accounts within the over $600 billion defense budget in  order to counter drug activities and to block drug smuggling corridors  across international borders.   On February 15, the President said that he plans to use $2.5 billion  of this same transfer authority to build the 234 miles of wall along  the southern border that he asked for in his January 6 letter. If he  increases the transfer from $2.5 billion to $3.7 billion, along with  the other existing funding authority that he has, he will have the full  $5.7 billion that he said he needed.   William E. Nelson, of New York University School of Law--one of  America's foremost scholars of legal history--wrote an excellent op-ed  last week that explained why it is so important that the President and  the Congress should not, in Professor Nelson's words, ``invert the  entire constitutional order where Congress appropriates and the  President spends.''   I ask unanimous consent that Professor Nelson's article be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  The Conversation: Trump vs. Congress: The Emergency Declaration Should                          Not Be Resolved in Court    (Oped by: William E. Nelson, New York University February 28, 2019)         President Donald Trump's emergency declaration to build a       border wall has provoked a constitutional confrontation with       Congress.        Here is the background for understanding what's at stake--      beginning more than two centuries ago.        A major problem for the framers at the Constitutional       Convention in 1787 was how to create a presidency powerful       enough to protect the nation, yet constrained enough to       prevent a president from becoming a dictator.        Ultimately, the president was given power to enforce the       law, conduct foreign relations and command the armed forces.       Congress retained most other key powers, including the power       of the purse and the power to declare war.        The framers knew they could not predict all that the future       would bring. So they left the precise boundaries between       presidential and congressional power unclear. This       imprecision in our checks and balances has served the nation       well for 230 years because it provides the flexibility to       govern while preventing tyranny.        As scholars of constitutional law and history, we believe       that President Trump's assertion of a national emergency to       build a wall along the Mexican border and the lawsuits filed       in response together threaten the very imprecision that has       helped maintain constitutional checks and balances for more       than two centuries.  [[Page S1614]]         To best maintain that balance, this confrontation should be       resolved in the political realm, not in the courts.                            The National Emergency         But the lawsuits over the emergency declaration will       probably reach the Supreme Court, and the court might well       hold Trump's emergency declaration unconstitutional.        That would set a precedent that would unduly limit national       emergency power that some future president may need.        Alternatively, the court could decide the lawsuits in       Trump's favor. That would invert the entire constitutional       order, where Congress appropriates and the president spends.       It would undercut the checks and balances provided by the       framers and lead to an incredibly powerful presidency.        Either result the court reaches would set a bad precedent.        Congress can avert this problem.        The 1976 National Emergencies Act gives Congress power to       invalidate a president's declaration of emergency by a       resolution passed by simple majorities of both houses.        The House voted 245-182 on Tuesday to overturn President       Trump's national emergency declaration. Democrats were joined       by more than a dozen Republicans in the vote. The Senate will       now take up the measure, though a vote has not been       scheduled.        White House adviser Stephen Miller has already suggested       that Trump would veto any such resolution.        ``He's going to protect his national emergency declaration.       Guaranteed,'' Miller said on Fox News. Both the House and the       Senate would then need two-thirds majorities to override his       veto.        We believe that for Congress to protect the constitutional       order, its members must muster the necessary two-thirds       majority.                                 To the court         If Congress does not override the president's veto, the       lawsuits will probably go to the Supreme Court. The court's       decision has strong potential to do harm to the historic       constitutional balance.        That balance was upheld by the Supreme Court in a crucial       decision more than 50 years ago.        On April 9, 1952, President Truman declared a national       emergency. In the midst of the Korean War, he seized the       country's steel mills on the eve of a nationwide strike       because steel was necessary to make weapons. weapons. The       steel companies immediately brought a lawsuit against the       seizure in federal court.        Recognizing the importance of the issue, the Supreme Court       heard arguments on May 12, and handed down its decision on       June 2.        The court, in Youngstown Company v. Sawyer, rejected the       president's claim by a 6-3 majority.        Justice Robert Jackson wrote an opinion proclaiming a       general approach to the balance of powers between Congress       and the president, rather than a fixed rule.        Jackson declared that ``when the President acts pursuant to       an express or implied authorization of Congress, his       authority is at its maximum.''        The president's power, Jackson wrote, is in a ``zone of       twilight'' when Congress has not spoken. When ``the President       takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied       will of Congress, his power is at its lowest ebb.''                          President Against Congress         President Trump is acting contrary to Congress's will by       appropriating money Congress has refused to appropriate. He       signed a carefully constructed compromise budget bill passed       by more than veto-proof two-thirds majorities in both houses.       He accepted the U.S. $1.375 billion that the bill gave him       for a border wall.        He then broke the deal by declaring a national emergency to       allocate an additional $6.7 billion to pay for border wall       construction.        In two important cases, the Supreme Court has broadly       prohibited Congress from giving any of its appropriations       authority or responsibility to the president--even       voluntarily.        Congress's adoption of a joint resolution seeking to       invalidate Trump's emergency declaration--an explicit       statement of congressional will--would provide conclusive       evidence that would only strengthen the argument that the       president is acting contrary to Congress's will.                    Preserving the Constitutional Balance         If the case gets to the Supreme Court, the president's       lawyers might argue that for Congress to decisively oppose an       emergency declaration of the president, lawmakers must       override his veto by a two-thirds vote.        Imposing such a veto override requirement, however, would       eliminate the court's role. That's because a presidential       declaration of emergency is immediately invalid if Congress       overrides a presidential veto.        Two-thirds overrides are historically unlikely by Congress.       And requiring a two-thirds vote would give a president who       declares a national emergency virtually unlimited power to       appropriate money to his or her heart's content--perhaps       hundreds of billions of dollars to address, for example,       climate change by subsidizing construction of wind farms.        Requiring Congress to override a presidential veto that       protects a presidential appropriation would turn the       appropriations power and the Constitution's checks and       balances inside out.        Congress has already spoken through passing the spending       bill and will be considering a resolution to invalidate the       president's declaration of emergency.        Such a resolution, even if vetoed by the president, places       President Trump's declaration in Justice Jackson's category       where presidential power ``is at its lowest ebb.''        It also preserves the historic flexibility by allowing the       court's decision to give deference to the votes of Congress       in cases of claimed emergencies.        This story has been updated to reflect the House vote on       Feb. 26, 2019, on the resolution to overturn President       Trump's national emergency declaration.     I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I honor Col. Ian Bryan of  the Tennessee Air National Guard for his outstanding service to our  country and congratulate him on his retirement from the U.S. Air Force.  Colonel Bryan has worked closely with me, the Appropriations Committee,  and across Capitol Hill to inform and advise Congress so that we may  ensure a strong and ready National Guard. He has also helped the  Pentagon work more productively with Congress, promoting a strong  national defense.   Colonel Bryan has distinguished himself through his professional  character and dedication to serving this Nation in the military for  over 25 years. He has done so selflessly. He has quietly, but  tenaciously advocated for the Chief of the National Guard Bureau's  priorities to make the National Guard a ready, capable force for  operations both in the homeland and overseas.   As the Chief of the programs division in the National Guard Bureau  Office of Legislative Liaison from April 2017 to February 2019, Colonel  Bryan performed his duties deftly. His strategic-level thinking and  foresight contributed to the completion of numerous high-level  engagements between the National Guard and Congress. He was vital in  the establishment of the first ever National Guard liaison office in  the Senate, greatly increasing the communication between the National  Guard and Congress.   Colonel Bryan is a 1990 graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy, with  masters from The Ohio State University, and a law degree from the  University of Virginia. He has served as a KC-135 Pilot, professor at  the School of Advanced Air and Space Studies, air team leader in the  National Guard Bureau, Office of Legislative Liaison, and as a division  chief at the Air National Guard Readiness Center.   After serving in his latest role for the past 2 years, Colonel Bryan  will retire at the end of the month. Ian, his supportive wife Emily,  and their two children have sacrificed much as a family in service to  our Nation. I join my colleagues today in congratulating Colonel Bryan  on his well-earned retirement and in expressing our gratitude for his  selfless service.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I honor one of my  constituents, CAPT Jon ``JR'' Rodgers of the U.S. Navy, who is retiring  in June after three decades of dedicated service to our great Nation.  JR has spent the last 2 years of his career serving the U.S. Congress  as the Navy's Deputy Chief of Legislative Affairs. In this role, JR  maintained oversight of the Navy team that provides Members and  committees of Congress with information concerning the programs of the  Department of the Navy.   JR's Tennessee roots run deep. The son of an air traffic control  chief, he began life in Humbolt, TN, married his beautiful wife Sherry  Masters from Celina, TN, and plans to return to our great State once  his naval service has ended.   This patriot's naval career began by enlisting as a nuclear trained  electronics technician until receiving an NROTC scholarship to Cornell  University. He graduated with a bachelor's of science degree in  agriculture engineering technologies and received his commission as a  surface warfare officer in 1990. JR continued his education by  attending the National Defense University, graduating with honors from  the Industrial College of the Armed Forces with a masters of science  degree in national resource strategy. He also attended the Naval War  College in Newport, RI, with a masters of arts in national security  strategy.   His sea duty assignments include tours on the USS England, CG 22, and  the USS Bonhomme Richard, LHD 6, as a plank owner, where he received  the Surface Navy Association's Arleigh Burke award for Operational  Excellence. He also served as executive officer aboard the USS  Cleveland, LPD 7, during Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom  as part of Amphibious Task Force West.   More recently, JR commanded the mighty USS Makin Island, LHD 8, the  first Navy ship with hybrid electric propulsion, where he completed a  successful deployment to 5th and 7th Fleet. He also commanded USS  Ponce, AFSB 15, as the Navy's first dedicated afloat forward staging  base permanently deployed to Fifth Fleet.   JR's overseas experience is just as impressive. He served as the U.S.  European Command J3 chief of staff and branch head for the crisis  action group during Operations Odyssey Dawn and Unified Protector. He  commanded Maritime Expeditionary Security Squadron Six, where he led  over 600 Active and Reserve sailors on worldwide security missions that  included the USNS Comfort Theater Security Cooperation missions  throughout South America. He served as commander Task Unit Northern  Arabian Gulf on the Iraq Al Basrah, ABOT, and Khor al-Amaya, KAAOT, oil  terminals point defense mission, Panama and Suez Canal Embarked  Security Team transits, and Operation Vigilant Mariner in Rota, Spain.   I want to thank JR for his almost 30 years of loyal service to this  Nation. He has made a lasting and significant contribution to the U.S.  Navy and our Nation. I wish him, his wife, and their daughter all the  best as they begin this new chapter in their live.                            ____________________
