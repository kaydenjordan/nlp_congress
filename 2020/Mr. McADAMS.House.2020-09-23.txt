 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the VA High  Altitude and Suicide Research Act. I introduced this bipartisan bill to  combat a very serious threat to our veteran population.   After serving and protecting our country, our veterans return home  only to face new threats. Studies show that veteran suicide is one-and- a-half times higher than nonveteran suicides.   We must do everything we can to understand why our Nation's heroes  are taking their own lives, and we must do more to prevent more tragic  deaths.   In talking with suicide prevention experts in my home State of Utah,  I am told that we need to better understand the possible connection  between high altitude and suicide. That is what my bill does.   The VA High Altitude and Suicide Research Act compels the VA to study  the link between veteran suicide and high altitude. It also requires  the VA to establish effective treatment plans that respond to the  threats and to save lives.   As a nation, we have a responsibility to prevent future tragedies and  provide these servicemembers with the care that they so desperately  deserve.   I thank the House for taking up this important legislation, and I  urge adoption.               Support for a Sustainable, Clean Energy Economy     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of two of  my bills included in the Clean Economy and Jobs Innovation Act. This  legislative package takes bold and important steps toward a  sustainable, clean energy economy. It is not only good for our health  and for our environment, but it is good for our economy.   I am particularly pleased to see my legislation included in the  package, the Solar Energy Research and Development Act. This bill  authorizes solar energy research, development, and deployment within  the Department of Energy.   Utah is a national leader in solar technology and is projected to  produce over 1,000 megawatts of solar power in the next 5 years. My  bill addresses the very serious threat of climate change, while  supporting clean energy jobs.   I am also pleased to see my air quality bill included. The Background  Ozone Research Study Act directs the EPA and the National Academies of  Science to study the sources of background ozone pollution and to  provide actionable steps for cleaning our air.   Mr. Speaker, this bill supports our clean energy economy and  addresses our very serious need to address the climate crisis.                   In Support of the FAITH in Congress Act     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the FAITH in Congress  Act. This bipartisan legislation, introduced by my colleague Stephanie  Murphy, seeks to restore trust and faith in Congress as an institution.   As I travel throughout my district and talk with Utahns, there is a  common theme that I hear from people of all political walks. That is  that our political system is broken, and we need to change the way  Washington does business. So this bill takes commonsense, concrete  steps to restore that faith through five central pillars:   No automatic pay increases for Members of Congress, which I have  fought against since I was first sworn in;   No budget, no pay;   No first-class Member travel at taxpayer expense;   A lifetime ban on lobbying by former Members of Congress; and   Prioritizing bipartisan bills over partisan bills.   That is it. Five simple steps that we should all be able to rally  behind.   Mr. Speaker, this is common sense, and I urge the House to take up  and pass this legislation without delay.                            ____________________
