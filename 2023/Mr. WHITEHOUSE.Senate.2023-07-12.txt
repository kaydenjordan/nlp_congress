 Mr. President, I always consider it good fortune when  I come to deliver remarks on the Senate floor and get to follow Senator  Sullivan's Alaskan of the Week speeches.   His discussion of his constituent Elverda reminds me of a very, very  dear person in my life, Florence Kerins Murray, born just a little bit  ahead of Elverda--1916--but like Elverda, served in the U.S. military.  She was a WAC--Women's Army Corps--lieutenant colonel and then broke,  essentially, every glass ceiling you could break in Rhode Island  politics and in the Rhode Island judiciary, becoming a very respected  Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice.   So I will take the liberty of joining my colleague Senator Sullivan  in wishing his constituent a happy birthday, but I also wanted to share  the memory of a very dear Rhode Islander who I think would have gotten  along very well--I would like to be a witness, a fly on the wall, to  the conversation between Florence and Elverda.    Mr. President, I rise this evening, now for the 22nd  time, to keep unmasking the far-right scheme to capture and control our  Supreme Court. This scheme is funded by creepy rightwing billionaires  who stay out of the limelight and let others--namely, Leonard Leo and  his crew--operate their scheme.   How are they benefiting from the scheme? It is hard to track which  rightwing billionaires are involved--and that is by design--but thanks  to intrepid reporting from ProPublica and others, we are learning more  all the time. And every day it becomes harder for the billionaire- friendly Justices and their political allies to pretend, with a  straight face, that all is kosher at the Court.    I have previously described the noxious cocktail of this court  capture scheme: creepy rightwing billionaires, phony front groups,  amenable Justices, large sums of money, and secrecy. I don't know  whether they take that shaken or stirred, but those seem to be the  common ingredients.   To chill that Court-capture cocktail, we can add one more ingredient:  Alaskan glacier ice. But I will get back to that later.   First, let's review the origin story of Justice Samuel Alito. It  begins with the bipartisan Senate rejection of Judge Robert Bork, which  infuriated Bork's far-right backers. On the Court were Justices Souter  and Stevens--both Republican appointees--but they wouldn't help the  billionaires, so the angry chant went out from the far right: No more  Souters. No more Stevenses.   Then President George W. Bush got an appointment and nominated his  [[Page S2353]]  friend and trusted White House counsel, Harriet Miers. A Republican  President nominates a personal friend and rock-ribbed conservative  Republican--a woman to replace Sandra Day O'Connor. And the attack on  her comes from the right. The far-right billionaires won't have it. And  their operative--the aforementioned Leonard Leo--oversaw the project of  taking her down. And in her place came the ever-so-reliably  billionaire-friendly Sam Alito.   This switch--Miers for Alito--gave Leo immense cred with the  billionaires, who have since made him a very rich man and helped him  launch his armada of front groups, of which this array is just a  selection. These three groups are the groups from which he takes  revenue for himself and through which he manages these two groups, a  coordinated 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4). That is sort of the latest and  greatest technique in dark money political manipulation, a conjoined  501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4)--usually, common offices, common staff, common  funders, common mail drop, all of that.   Around this common core are what are called fictitious names. That is  the name for it under Virginia law. So 85 Fund is also the Judicial  Education Project under a fictitious name. It is also the Honest  Elections Project under a fictitious name. It is also the Free to Learn  under a fictitious name. Concord Fund is also Judicial Crisis Network  under a fictitious name, Honest Elections Project Action under a  fictitious name, and Free to Learn Action under a fictitious name. That  is quite a lot of confusion, and it is designed to be confusing.   Scroll on to 2021. By that time, I had been calling out obvious  issues at the Supreme Court: published articles, delivered speeches,  wrote law reviews, even wrote a book. Alito, speaking at the University  of Notre Dame, bemoaned what he said were ``unprecedented efforts to  intimidate the Court.'' He went on to say that the media was suggesting  that ``a dangerous cabal is deciding important issues in a novel,  secretive, improper way in the middle of the night, hidden from public  view.'' That, of course, referred to the sudden surge under Trump in  the Court's use of its ``shadow docket'' to quickly change the law  without hearing full public arguments. Alito's speech then was  considered a pretty extraordinary airing of grievance by a Supreme  Court Justice.   In response, I wrote an op-ed explaining that Justice Alito had  participated in a pattern of decisions, among them the shadow docket  ruling leaving in place--pre-Dobbs--Texas's ``bounty-hunter'' anti- abortion law--a pattern of big wins for big rightwing donors with  little regard for fact or precedent.   I argued that Americans' perception that the Court lacks independence  and the resulting drop in approval isn't some leftwing figment. The  evidence showed a clear pattern: When big rightwing donor interests  came before the Court, the Federalist Society Justices on the Court  would regularly trample precedent and contort the facts and the law to  deliver the donors' political victories--not a figment, a pattern.   Then, of course, came the Dobbs case, which actually took away a  constitutional right from women. For five decades, women had the right  to choose when to have children. That constitutional right appeared  safely protected in Supreme Court precedent.   Then, from a list mysteriously prepared by Leonard Leo and the  Federalist Society, President Trump appointed three Justices to the  Court. Now, I say ``mysteriously'' because the Federalist Society,  evidently, never had any formal proceedings to develop any list, but it  offered no correction when Trump kept calling it his Federalist Society  list.   Well, the next thing you know, that constitutional right was taken  away by Justices who, in their confirmation hearings, had told the  American public and the Senate Judiciary Committee that Roe was settled  law--settled, that is, until they had the votes to unsettle it and make  up their own.   As Justice Elena Kagan observed: If there is a new member of a court  and all of a sudden everything is up for grabs, all of a sudden very  fundamental principles of law are being overthrown, are being replaced,  then people have a right to say: What's going on there? That doesn't  seem very lawlike. And she was right.   Years after he had assured us Roe was settled law, it was Justice  Alito who wrote the decision in Dobbs. Alito's draft opinion infamously  leaked well ahead of the decision, causing rampant speculation about  who leaked the opinion and why.   Chief Justice Roberts directed the Marshal to investigate,  interviewing clerks and Court staff and even searching employees'  personal phone records. But with the Justices, the Marshal undertook  some other, also mysterious, iterative process, and the investigation  proved inconclusive.   Curiously, days before the opinion leaked, the Wall Street Journal  editorial page had predicted the Dobbs decision, raising the suggestion  that someone had a source in the Court. The editorial correctly  predicted what Alito knew: that Alito would write the decision for the  majority so long as Chief Justice Roberts couldn't pull another Justice  to join a more moderate, middle-ground decision.   Then, this past April, Justice Alito was featured in a highly  sympathetic interview on the Wall Street Journal editorial page. Alito  spoke about his opinion's leak and said:         I personally have a pretty good idea who is responsible,       but that's different from the level of proof that is needed       to name somebody.    Any major newspaper would have put an exclusive interview with a  Supreme Court Justice on the front page, but it would then have been  subject to fact-checking. This opinion piece looked like an article,  but it appeared in the Journal's notoriously fast-and-loose-with-the- facts opinion section under a double byline. One was a Wall Street  Journal editorial staffer, and the other was David Rivkin, a rightwing  lawyer who represented the States challenging the EPA's Clean Power  Plan before the Supreme Court.   A quick detour about the Wall Street Journal editorial page's ties to  the rightwing ecosystem: Rightwing bizarro-land likes to ape the  legitimate world. In the legitimate world, there is a Pulitzer Prize,  so rightwing bizarro-land has its own Bradley Prize, which--guess  what--has provided hefty prize money to several Wall Street Journal  editorial page writers, a million dollars cash in all.   This editorial piece quotes Alito saying:         We are being hammered daily, and I think quite unfairly in       a lot of instances. And nobody, practically nobody, is       defending us.    In the piece, Justice Alito declined to talk about the Clarence  Thomas ethics problems reported by ProPublica: extravagant vacations  worth as much as $500,000, paid for by rightwing billionaire megadonor  Harlan Crow and not disclosed.   That report was later followed by an additional ProPublica story  detailing the billionaire's purchase of properties from Justice Thomas  and his family members, also not properly disclosed, and payments for  years of tuition for the Justice's grandnephew whom the Thomases were  raising, also not disclosed.   Justice Alito's silence on the Thomas bombshell became all the more  notable when, 2 months later, ProPublica published another bombshell-- this one about Justice Alito--same cocktail ingredients. In this case,  a rightwing billionaire, an amenable Justice, undisclosed private jet  travel, an exotic vacation--all very expensive, all secret. Justice  Alito's private jet travel to this all-expenses-paid Alaskan fishing  vacation was paid for by a hedge fund billionaire, Paul Singer, who  contributed over $80 million to Republican political organizations and  whose Elliott Management group is one of the largest donors to the  National Republican Senatorial Committee. This is a politically  involved rightwing billionaire.   Later, the billionaire's firm had business before the Court and, in  that case, won billions of dollars--no disclosure by Alito, no recusal.  Charles Geyh, an Indiana University law professor and leading expert on  recusals, had this to say:         If you were good friends, what were you doing ruling on his       case? And if you weren't good friends, what were you doing       accepting this?    But wait. There is more. The tab for Alito's stay at the salmon lodge  in Alaska was covered by a different billionaire. If you are keeping  score, we are now up to three billionaires. This one is named Robert  Arkley, and he  [[Page S2354]]  funded the launch of Leonard Leo's advocacy group the Judicial Crisis  Network, also heavily engaged in rightwing political influence focused  on the Court.   Leo, the operative behind the current rightwing Supreme Court  supermajority, not only organized Alito's trip, he gallivanted off to  Alaska with the Justice and the billionaires.   By my count, after yet another story about Justice Thomas, we are now  up to six rightwing billionaires attending to the care and feeding of  two Justices: Thomas and Alito. And there are all sorts of links among  them and with the ubiquitous Leonard Leo. So many Justices, so many  billionaires, so many gifts.   But there is even more. Alito was not the first Justice to stay at  this particular lodge. Justice Scalia also took a private jet to the  lodge, courtesy of billionaire Arkley, and also did not disclose the  gift. In one memorable bit of color from that ProPublica story, Scalia  was described as mixing martinis made with ice chipped off of a  glacier.   There. You thought I had forgotten that, but I didn't.   The evening before the Alito billionaire travel story ran, the Wall  Street Journal comes back into the picture again. Alito tried to  preempt ProPublica's reporting by taking to the Wall Street Journal  editorial page. In the op-ed, Alito argued that he didn't need to  disclose the private jet travel under Federal law because the private  jet should be considered a ``facility'' and that his seat on the  private jet would have otherwise been empty so it was free and there  was no gift.   I won't go into how laughable these arguments are. That is a separate  case. What is important is that these arguments were printed on the  Wall Street Journal editorial page without investigation or comment by  the page, taken at face value.   Oh, and, by the way, the cost of that charter--the private jet travel  would have cost over $100,000 each way.   In that Wall Street Journal editorial page piece from the spring,  Alito had said about the Court's collapsing approval:         Well, yeah, what do you expect when you're--day in and day       out--``They're illegitimate. They're engaging in all sorts of       unethical conduct. They're doing this, they're doing that''?    Justice Alito's complaining has it completely backward. The problem  is not that Americans are pointing out the ethical lapses at the  Supreme Court. The problem is the ethical lapses at the Supreme Court.  The Roberts Court Justices' behavior is crashing public trust in the  institution--and justifiably--first, with preposterous judicial  behavior that no other judge would indulge; second, with outrageous  violations of quite clear rules and procedures judges are supposed to  follow about reporting those gifts; third, with preposterous excuses  for the bad behavior and the reporting violations; and fourth, with no  process to ever even try to get to the truth to establish the facts.   It is a mess.   Ideally, the Justices would start fixing that mess on their own. The  Court and the Judicial Conference, which Roberts chairs, have the  ability to fix this, but so far, they won't. I suspect there is a lot  more to be found out about this mess, and they don't want those further  disclosures so they would just as soon pull a rug over the whole thing,  but that won't work.   Congress also has the ability to write ethics rules for the Justices.  Remember, Congress created the judges' financial disclosure  requirements in the Ethics in Government Act. And Congress created the  judicial recusal law, which the Justices are also required to follow.  And Congress created the Judicial Conference, which administers  financial disclosure and code of conduct matters. Clearly, the article  I legislative branch can legislate in this area. Clearly, we can  oversee Agencies that we have created and laws that we have passed, and  indeed we have for decades.   In the coming days, the Senate Judiciary Committee will mark up my  Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act. This is a very  important step forward in this process, and I thank Chairman Durbin for  his leadership. This bill would put basic ethics guardrails and  transparency measures in place to help ensure the American people that  they can get a fair shot at the Supreme Court, even if they don't have  a private jet.   Today, in the Court that dark money built, the honor system has  flagrantly failed. We need to legislate; we need to investigate; and we  need to fix this mess for the American people.   To be continued, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
