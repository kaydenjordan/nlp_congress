But I just appreciate so much having had the opportunity to work with  Senator Portman.   I know that, as he pointed out, staff not only here in the Chamber,  around the Capitol, his personal staff--all people who have made  profound contributions to that incredible record of accomplishments  that he just talked about. That doesn't happen. Anybody who works here  for very long realizes the incredible contributions that staff make to  getting things done around here. And so I express my appreciation, as  he did, to all of them for all you did to make Senator Portman's time  here so productive.   And it is great to see his wife Jane, daughter Sally here as well,  who are all part of this partnership and this team that all of us know  are so critical to being able to make a difference here in the Senate  and the many sometimes sacrifices, contributions that they make on a  day-in and day-out basis.   But Rob is someone I have gotten to break bread with a lot of times  during our years together here in the Senate, and we have become really  good friends, and I am going to miss having him here, as I said.   Rob has spent a lot of years in public service serving this country-- 12 years in the House of Representatives, where I first got acquainted  with him; U.S.  [[Page S7056]]  Trade Representative; Director of Office of Management and Budget; and,  finally, 12 years here in the U.S. Senate.   I have served with him on the Senate Finance Committee for nearly 10  years, and his going, I will tell you, is a huge loss. He played an  indispensable role in the historic tax reform legislation we passed in  2017, particularly with the transition to a modernized international  tax system. Our outdated international tax rules had left America's  global businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the global economy.  And one of our priorities, when it came time to pass tax reform, was  ensuring that American businesses could compete on a level playing  field with their foreign counterparts.   Between his time in Congress and as Director of OMB and the U.S.  Trade Representative's Office, Rob has a wealth of knowledge when it  comes to American economic competitiveness and in the international tax  system, and he quickly became the lead on that aspect of tax reform-- and not just on that, but on so many aspects on that very complicated  piece of legislation.   Our final legislation brought the United States international tax  system into the 21st century by replacing our outdated worldwide system  with a modernized territorial tax system so that American businesses  are not operating at a disadvantage next to their foreign competitors,  and we saw an almost immediate positive effect for American businesses,  which, of course, means that we saw positive results for American  workers. And that is really, in large part, thanks to Rob.   It is an important legacy, and it joins Rob's long list of  achievements in public service, some of which, he mentioned, from  restraining unfunded mandates on States and securing resources for  addiction prevention and treatment, to advancing a pro-world trade  agenda good for American workers and businesses alike.   He has also been a strong voice for American leadership and values on  the global stage, especially, as he mentioned, as a cofounder of the  Senate Ukraine Caucus.   It is sad to see Rob leaving the Senate, but he spent a lifetime  helping to build up our country, and I know his contributions won't end  here.   I am also happy that he will have more time to spend with his family  and with his wife Jane. Jane is terrific. Like me, Rob married up, and  I know Rob is looking forward to having more time to spend together.    I also know Rob is planning to get more involved in the family  business, the Golden Lamb Inn and Restaurant in Lebanon, OH, which has  played host to at least a dozen U.S. Presidents over the years.   And, as I said, while Rob's time in the Senate may be coming to a  close, I know that he fully intends to continue doing what he has been  doing throughout his career, and that is working to make our country a  better and more prosperous place.   Rob, congratulations on your years here in the Senate. I hope you get  some very well-deserved rest in the coming months, and I, like everyone  else here, look forward to seeing your next chapter.
