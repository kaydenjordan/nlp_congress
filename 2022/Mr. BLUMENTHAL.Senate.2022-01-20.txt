 Mr. President.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my  colleague and friend from Utah and I agree on a couple of points. Yes,  President Biden did rescind the global gag rule, which this proposal  would not only reestablish but make permanent and expand, disastrously,  and yes, women and children should not be political footballs, nor  should this issue be one. Unfortunately, that is the objective of this  proposal.   It is difficult to exaggerate the breadth of this proposed  legislation or the breadth of harm that the global gag rule does. In  fact, it prohibits foreign organizations receiving U.S. assistance from  providing legal abortion services or referrals or even information-- information--on abortion services even when those activities are funded  without any connection to U.S. Government money. It egregiously blocks  organizations receiving U.S. funds from advocating for abortion  legislation--mere advocacy--stifling their ability to champion their  patients, even if that advocacy is not funded in any way by U.S.  taxpayers.    This legislation would not only codify this dangerous policy but  expand it even beyond what was implemented under previous  administrations--expanding it, not just codifying it.   Thankfully, President Biden has rescinded this policy. It was an  important effort to restore U.S. leadership abroad, promoting  healthcare access in places it is needed most. It was a critical step  toward what is now needed--permanent prohibition of the global gag  rule, not codification of its expansion.   Let's be very clear. The global gag rule does nothing to protect the  health of people around the world. It blocks healthcare access, it  stifles local advocacy efforts, and it undermines reproductive rights  worldwide, putting in jeopardy the people who need those services most.  It impedes access to a range of health services, including  contraception, HIV prevention and treatment, and maternal and child  care, because it cuts off funding for many of the most experienced  healthcare providers.   Some proponents of this dangerous policy seem to claim it will reduce  abortions or it is intended to do so, but studies have shown that, in  fact, it does just the opposite. The global gag rule actually increases  rates of abortion--many of them unsafe--because it reduces access to  contraceptives and it increases the number of unintended pregnancies.   In short, we should be joining other countries in addressing global  goals like creating an AIDS-free generation, ending preventable  maternal and child deaths, and achieving universal access to sexual and  reproductive healthcare, not putting unnecessary restrictions on U.S.  funds that cause fear and impede access to healthcare. Unfortunately,  that is what the global gag rule and this legislation do, impeding  countries' efforts to improve global health, advance human rights, and  achieve gender equality.   I oppose the Lee bill. I urge my colleagues to come together and  work, instead, to promote global health. Therefore, I object.    Mr. President, just to be clear, I understand my  colleague's point, but I think I have highlighted and I want to  emphasize again the limited purposes for which our taxpayer dollars are  used and the advocacy, the healthcare, the contraception, HIV screening  and treatment--world health--that would be prevented by this  legislation.   I think that is an unintended consequence. Maybe, it is unintended  that it is gargantuan in its potential impact, and, therefore, I  continue my objection.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 1 request for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                          COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY    The Committee on the Judiciary is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Thursday, January 20, 2022, at 9 a.m., to  conduct an executive business meeting.                            ____________________
