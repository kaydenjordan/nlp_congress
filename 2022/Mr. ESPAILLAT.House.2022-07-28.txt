 Madam Speaker, today I seek recognition and rise to  address the growing barriers to homeownership and skyrocketing rents.   Families that have lived in the city of New York for generations are  being pushed out. These families have significant ties to the community  and contribute to the cultural exchange that New York City is known  for.   Homeownership is one of the best ways to gain equity and build  generational wealth. Yet, there are millions of Americans who aren't  able to buy into the housing market.   As a member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, and  Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies, I am proud to have  worked with my colleagues to draft a bill that would address this  issue.   But we must do more. The bill provides a total of $62.7 billion for  HUD which includes funding to protect housing assistance for more than  4.8 million individuals. It also expands housing choice vouchers to  more than 140,000 low-income individuals and families at risk of  homelessness.   We must continue to enact policies that ensure all residents can live  without being burdened by housing costs.                            ____________________
