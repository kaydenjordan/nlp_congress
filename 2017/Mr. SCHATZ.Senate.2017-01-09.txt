 Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from  Connecticut for his leadership on this and so many other issues on  behalf of the people of his home State.   Before I get into prevention as a policy issue, I just want to  reiterate a process point.   Here we are in the world's greatest deliberative body--the world's  greatest deliberative body--and there really are so many talented  individuals who come from county counsels, who come from State  assemblies, who come from State senates, who come from the U.S. House,  and find themselves in the U.S. Senate, the world's greatest  deliberative body. And here we are debating one of the biggest public  policy issues over the last decade, arguably over the last generation.  Here we are.   I am thinking about my early days in the Hawaii legislature and what  we would do. If we wanted to move a bill along but we weren't sure  exactly what to do, we would flaw the effective date because we knew  the language didn't work yet, but we wanted to take it to conference  committee. We didn't want it to be enacted into law, but we wanted it  to move through the process. So what we would do is we would flaw the  effective date. We would say ``Effective year 2100,'' so that even if  it were accidentally enacted into law, it wouldn't have the force of  law.   Yet once in a while, a staffer or a member would make a clerical  error and actually enact something with a delayed effective date into  law, and they were humiliated. This was a mistake. This was a clerical  error, and this showed that it was amateur hour. This showed that  somebody didn't know what they were doing. This showed that somebody  wasn't a very serious legislator.   Yet here we are in the Nation's legislature, here we are in the  world's greatest deliberative body, and we are doing that on purpose.  We are doing that right away. We are doing this with the Affordable  Care Act after 7 years of blasting this law because they know they  can't repeal the parts that are popular. So what they are going to do  is eviscerate the revenue attached to the bill and leave themselves, as  one of my colleagues said, in a ``box canyon'' so the only thing they  can do is shovel money to insurance companies--borrowed money--to  maintain the benefit because they don't want to deal with the political  ramifications of what they had done to their constituents on  preexisting conditions, on coverage for people up to the age of 26, on  prevention.   This is the most unserious effort I have seen in this legislative  body. This is absolutely unserious. And whatever your political  persuasion is, you should ask every Member of the Senate to stand up  and be counted and say what they want to do about health care in the  United States.   The answer can no longer be because it is an article of faith that  because the Affordable Care Act has ``Obama'' in its name--it is  ObamaCare--it must be bad, and it must be repealed root and branch.  That is no longer acceptable.   This President is only President for another 10 days, and we have an  obligation to our constituents to say what we are going to do about  this law. We all know that we should get a regular check-up from our  doctor, eat fruits and vegetables, and exercise as much as possible, as  difficult as it is for all of us at times. Why do we do this? Any  doctor will tell you that it is better to stay healthy and prevent  disease than to get sick. It is not just common sense. It is not only  less painful for people, but it is less costly to prevent illness than  to treat it.    The same is true for public health. If we can prevent drunk driving  or the spread of diseases such as Zika, we could save lives and save  the public money. That is why Senator Cassidy and I introduced the  Public Health Emergency Response and Accountability Act last Congress.  Our bill, on a bipartisan basis, recognized, basically, that we should  be able to respond quickly to public health threats before they spread  and harm more Americans and cost more money.   That is what the ACA does through its Prevention and Public Health  Fund. The fund serves a very important dual purpose, investing Federal  dollars in effective programs that prevent disease and also it saves  money.   It is a simple concept. We should stop diseases from developing or  spreading before they start. This sounds like common sense to almost  everybody, but here is the problem. In the partisan battle around the  ACA, even a really good idea within the Affordable Care Act must be bad  because it is part of ObamaCare. This is insane.   This is the Prevention and Public Health Fund that provides money to  the Centers for Disease Control. The CDC did an incredible job with the  U.S. Public Health Service, with the U.S. military in addressing the  Ebola crisis. The CDC did an incredible job, again, with the National  Institutes of Health and others in addressing the potential Zika  crisis, which looks to have abated. The CDC does incredibly important  work in tobacco prevention and cessation, and this Prevention and  Public Health Fund has gotten 1.8 million individual smokers to call  and try to quit smoking. That is hundreds of thousands of lives saved,  not just in blue or purple States but all across the country. This  Prevention and Public Health Fund helps our elderly to avoid falls. It  helps our elderly to avoid falls. I know there are people of goodwill  on both sides of the aisle. I know that we are all responsive to our  senior citizens in our individual communities, and I know that this is  a smart and humane use of public health money. If we can prevent an  elderly citizen from falling in their own home or falling on the way to  a bus stop or to church or to a family member's home, that is money  well spent, not just morally but fiscally.   This is my great regret when it comes to the Affordable Care Act and  the debate that is happening. The only time I hear a serious-minded,  good-faith debate between a Republican and a Democrat in the Senate  when it comes to the Affordable Care Act is in private, because if you  look at this side of the Chamber, there is only one Member of the  Republican caucus who is here. We are not having the world's greatest  deliberative body deliberate over the Affordable Care Act. We have an  empty Chamber, full of Republicans who are absolutely bound and  determined to walk off this cliff and take 22 million Americans with  them.   Public health prevention works. Public health prevention is fiscally  prudent, and it is the humane thing to do. That is just one of the many  attributes  [[Page S151]]  of the Affordable Care Act that ought to be preserved.   If there is to be a good faith conversation about how to improve upon  the Affordable Care Act, we are all ears. I can guarantee you that  there are 48 of us who want to have that conversation, but do not put  the whole country into this box canyon. Excuse me for mixing my  metaphors. Do not take the whole country off this cliff because it is  going to be very, very difficult for us to make good policy after that.   With that, I yield the floor to the senior Senator from  Massachusetts.    Mr. President, I want to thank the junior Senator from  Connecticut for his leadership on ACA. Since we arrived in the Senate  together, he has been stalwart, not just on the many benefits of ACA  but specifically on mental health and the benefits and the  destigmatization of mental health care in the context of ACA.   It wasn't so long ago that people wouldn't step up and say: I need  help. I need mental health care. But now I think it is broadly accepted  on both sides of the aisle, partly because of Chris Murphy's  leadership, that mental health is health and that just as if you tweak  your shoulder or need something with your lungs or have a crick in your  neck, if you have some mental health issues, you need to get them taken  care of.   The plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act with no replacement  reminds me of a car I used to have. It was an OK car. I remember I  bought it in 2006. It was a 2005, but it was new--one of those in the  back of the lot. I got it for $2,500 less than MSRP. It was a station  wagon. It was ugly. It was purple, and I just sort of rode it into the  ground. I kept driving it. I didn't take great care of it. I have  gotten better about taking care of my cars. At the time I just rode it  and rode it. The AC busted, and I didn't fix it. There was a fender  bender, and I didn't fix that. The car was OK. It needed some TLC, but  it got me around. What if I had taken this car to Jiffy Lube in  Honolulu just to get a little tuneup and left it, and then I came back  an hour later and it had been dismantled? That is what the Republicans  are doing with the Affordable Care Act. Instead of fixing what is wrong  and keeping what is working, they are going to destroy the American  health care system.   I try very hard not to be too apocryphal with my language. I try very  hard not to be too nasty and too partisan on this floor, but this is  factual. They are going to destroy the American health care system.  That is what repeal and replace is all about. They are going to remove  a law from the books and come up with something terrific in a few  months or a few years, but they are also going to keep the stuff you  like.   Here is the first thing that everybody across the country needs to  know about this process. It is not on the level. There is no way around  it. This is just not on the level. Anybody who has spent any time  thinking about health care policy knows that covering people with  preexisting conditions like cancer, mental illness, and diabetes is a  popular thing to do. It is the right thing to do. People also know that  the only way to do that is to create a risk pool that includes healthy  people. If you are going to insure folks, you can't just be paying out  for the expensive cases; you also have to be bringing in revenue and  not paying out, so you need young people in the risk pool. You need  professionals in the risk pool. You need nonsick people in the risk  pool. That is how this all works. Everybody understands that.   Everybody who is working on this in good faith understands that you  need to create a risk pool in order to cover more people. So they know  that if they eliminate the individual mandate, they eliminate the  benefit, but they are stuck with a promise they made to repeal this law  totally, root and branch--not to improve upon the law.   Just remember that it was an article of faith that we couldn't make  even the most modest improvements to this law at any point in the last  6 or 7 years; that if you did so, you ran afoul of Republican  orthodoxy. It is not that they wanted to fix the law. It is that they  had told everybody it was so bad--partly because it was ObamaCare--that  there was nothing good in it; there was nothing worth preserving about  the Affordable Care Act.   Now they are into repeal and replace. They are stuck with the promise  they made to repeal this law totally, and they know people are about to  be very, very angry because President Obama is the President only for  another 10 days, and people are not going to accept the premise that we  are going to rip health care out from under you, but don't you hate  health care because it is called ObamaCare? That is an argument that  may have worked 3, 4, or 5 years ago, but with a new President-elect  and a new Congress, we have an obligation to have a better strategy  than that.   Republicans do not have a replacement plan. If they had one, they  would be adopting it shortly. It has been 7 years. It has been 7 years,  and we haven't seen any legislative language--none. They have no plan  at all for American health care other than to cause immediate harm and  to try to blame it on the law that they are repealing.   There are only a few ways this could end up. I will give you a couple  of them. First there could be the equivalent of a health care cliff,  which is similar to what we have done with our fiscal situation where  they have to periodically shovel money at the problem  [[Page S178]]  and bail out the insurance companies. What will happen is they are  basically eviscerating the revenue that provides the subsidies for  individuals, but they are going to realize: Hey, these subsidies are  quite popular, but we just eliminated the revenue. We don't want to  increase taxes so let's borrow money and keep shoveling money at the  insurance companies or they may make minor reforms in the ACA and call  it a replacement. That would be great. I do not see that they are on  this path right now or they are really going to repeal the law and take  health care coverage away from millions of Americans. This is  completely irresponsible.    So what happens when they repeal ACA? Twenty-two million people will  have their health care coverage ripped away from them, more than 22  million men, women, and children. For those of you who still have  coverage, I want you to know that this impacts you too. If you have a  preexisting condition as common as diabetes or high blood pressure or  mental health issues or cancer or Crohn's disease or Lupus or in a lot  of instances pregnancy is a preexisting condition, you are not going to  be able to keep your coverage.   If you are a woman, you are likely going to lose access to preventive  health care services like birth control. If you live in a rural area-- everybody in rural America should understand this.   There is this thought that there are rural States and nonrural  States. Every State is both a rural State and a nonrural State. I know  the Presiding Officer has an urban area and plenty of rural areas. I  have one of the densest cities in the United States, and then I have  far-flung, very small towns that are old plantations. Everybody in the  Senate represents rural America in some form or fashion.   If you live in a rural area, chances are that your local hospital  will lose millions of dollars in funding, which will force many rural  hospitals to turn away patients and close their doors. This is not an  exaggeration. I encourage every Republican Member of the Senate, Member  of the House, citizen out there to ask their health care leaders in  rural hospitals what is about to happen. They are in a panic.   Let's be totally clear about what this means. You lose rural hospital  money and you lose rural hospitals. For a lot of small towns, from  Hawaii to the Dakotas, to the Carolinas, and everywhere in between, the  rural hospital is the economic center of the community. It is often by  far the largest employer. I want you to understand, if a rural  community loses its rural hospital, a lot of the working-age folks  leave. They move to a more urban area.   What happens is, the elderly citizens also have to leave because if  you need access to emergency services but you are nowhere near any of  that care, you are going to have to go too. So there is not a single  thing we can do in the Congress that would harm rural communities  quicker than what is being done this week by the Republicans.   I want to be really clear about how much harm is about to be done to  rural communities, not just rural health care providers, not just  nurses and doctors and technicians and admins and janitors and  everybody who works at those rural hospitals.   That is important because in a lot of instances, that is the economic  driver of a small town. It is also about, people start to make choices  with their own life and with their own planning, especially as they get  older, and they think to themselves: How do I stay close to health  care? If that rural hospital goes away, that rural town goes away.   We have seen it in Hawaii. That is why we fight for Molokai Community  Hospital. That is why we fight for Lanai Community Hospital. That is  why we fight for Waianae Coast Comprehensive Treatment Center. That is  why everybody fights so hard for their community rural hospitals-- because it is the center of a community, not just economically, but  without it, you basically have no community.   All of this will cause the entire insurance market to unravel,  raising costs for everyone. This means families are going to pay more  for prescription drugs, pay more on their premiums, and pay more for  out-of-pocket costs.   So if the Republicans are still unfazed by the health impacts of the  repeal I just outlined, and have been outlining for the last 4 or 5  hours, over the last 3 or 4 days, there is another reason to be  extremely cautious about what is about to happen. As we know, the  vehicle for this is a budget resolution, right? They are trying to  characterize this as, no, it is not a budget resolution.   The only reason they are doing it as a budget vehicle is so they can  do reconciliation. What does that mean? That means they only need 51  votes, where otherwise they would need 60 votes, but this is a budget.  If it were not a budget, they would not be subject to the 51-vote  threshold. This is the Federal budget. This Federal budget increases  the deficit by trillions of dollars.   This Federal budget increases the deficit by trillions of dollars-- not trillions of dollars at a flat line with the previous Federal  budget, this is trillions of dollars more than last year's Federal  budget.   So if you are a fiscal hawk, gosh, you must be swallowing hard over  the next couple of days. This must be a bitter pill to swallow because  on the one hand, boy, do you hate ObamaCare. On the other hand, boy, do  you hate running up the national deficit--not the debt, deficit--by  trillions of dollars. This is insane. This deficit--what we are doing  to the debt and deficit in the next 2 or 3 days makes everything that  we have done in the last 3 or 4 years pale in comparison.   If you are a fiscal hawk, I cannot see how you get to yes on this.  You cannot vote to increase the national debt by trillions of dollars  and then still call yourself a fiscal hawk. So we have a choice in  front of us. Do we build on the progress of the Affordable Care Act or  do we strip millions of Americans of their health care coverage, leave  those with preexisting conditions out in the cold, and raise the  national debt?   We know ACA has its flaws. No one ever said it was perfect. Let us be  clear. Every major piece of legislation, every signature piece of  legislation that this body has ever passed has been flawed in some way.  What do we do when we are a functioning world's greatest deliberative  body? We iterate it. We work on a bipartisan basis to fix it. That is  what we should do.   The benefits of ACA are undeniable. That is what we should be  debating, improvements to the ACA, not an implosion. So let's keep our  eye on the ball and remember what our common goal is: giving every  American the opportunity to get quality, affordable health care they  deserve.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sasse). The Senator from New Jersey.    That is the first time the Senate has ever ended with  that one.                            ____________________
