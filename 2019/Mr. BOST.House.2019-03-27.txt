 Mr. Speaker, this week we celebrate Public Schools Week. It  serves as a reminder that every child deserves access to quality  education that helps them reach their full potential.   Public schools are where our students become citizens. They learn to  think critically, solve problems, and build relationships. They grow to  contribute to our society, our economy, and our communities, and it all  starts with the men and women who want to make a difference.   I want to thank our teachers and educators and professionals who work  in these fields, and I want to include Ms. Lucy Gamby, who was my sixth  grade teacher, and thank her for the influence that she had in my life.  I am sure every one of us has someone like that that is that special  teacher.                           World Down Syndrome Day     Mr. Speaker, on March 21, we celebrated Down Syndrome Day.   Many people don't know this, but they do know I have 11  grandchildren. My sixth grandchild and third grandson is Stanley.  Stanley has Down's, and Stanley is an amazing, fun child, wonderful.   You know, it is kind of our job as grandparents to make sure that  each grandchild believes that they are the favorite, and I do my best  to do that, but today I want to recognize Stanley because I want to  make sure that people understand that the people and the families that  are involved and have Down syndrome children or grandchildren, that we  live and we work to make sure that they can achieve to the highest  level that they can in life. So this day I want to say, ``Stanley, I  love you.''   We want to recognize all of our children who have Down's and our  adults who have Down's and encourage them to be the best that they can  be.                            ____________________
