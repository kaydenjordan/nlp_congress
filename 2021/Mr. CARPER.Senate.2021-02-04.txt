 Mr. President, unfortunately, I must rise in opposition  to Braun amendment 833 this evening. On its face, this amendment would  prohibit the EPA and the Council on Environmental Quality from issuing  any regulation or guidance that would ban oil and gas fracking.  [[Page S443]]    President Biden has stated repeatedly that he does not support a  blanket ban on fracking. He has said that we should capture the methane  that emanates from fracking, not ban the practice all together.   Let me give you his exact words. This is Joe Biden's words: ``Let me  be clear, and I know this always comes up, we're not going to ban  fracking.''   The amendment, as written, before us appears to go beyond just  prohibiting EPA and the Council on Environmental Quality from issuing  regs to ban oil and gas fracking. The effect here would actually go  beyond that and prevent the Federal Government from regulating  emissions of methane and air toxics that are related to fracking.   I encourage my colleagues to not vote for this hasty and unnecessary  amendment. Methane is 85 times more dangerous than carbon dioxide. We  should be controlling it, not allowing it to go up into the air.                          Vote on Amendment No. 833     Mr. President, I would note an irony here: Native of West  Virginia offering an amendment, objected to by a native of West  Virginia, presided by a native of West Virginia.    The Navigable Waters Protection Rule fails to provide  consistent, clear, and functional categories and exclusions of  jurisdictional water that are asserted by this amendment.   The rule also fails to provide critical headwaters and wetlands from  pollution. That is jeopardizing the source of drinking water for over  100 million Americans. The Trump rule's failure to protect headwaters  and wetlands will ensure the transport of pollution downstream,  contaminating water resources, compromising ecosystem health, and  enforcing downstream communities to spend unavailable funds to upgrade  water treatment facilities.   And, finally, this amendment would have the effects of grading water  quality, thus forcing new burdens on downstream, disadvantaged  communities and forcing cities and towns to find resources long lost to  the battle against COVID to ensure clean drinking water for their  citizens.   Reluctantly, I must urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 655
