 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). Without objection, it is so  ordered.   (The remarks of Ms. Heitkamp and Ms. Murkowski pertaining to the  introduction of S. 1942 are printed in today's Record under  ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')     Tribute to Reverend Dr. Alonzo B. Patterson, Jr., and Mrs. Shirley                                 Patterson     Mr. President, I rise today to discuss and bring  awareness to the obligation that we have to never forget what is  happening to way too many Native American women in this country.   For too long, the disproportionate incidents of violence against  Native American women have gone unnoticed, unreported, or  underreported, and it is time to address this issue head-on. That is  what I intend to do today and in the remaining days of my time in the  Senate, until we actually get a bill passed.   There is no official database or requirement for information  collection regarding the number of missing and murdered Native women.  In most cases, the only records of them are records that have been  provided to us by the families and friends of the victims. It is  critical that Congress push the U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI  to work with Tribal communities to come up with culturally appropriate  protocols for responding to cases of missing and murdered Native women.   I would like to take this time to honor Savanna LaFontaine-Greywind,  whose story has been told on the news in North Dakota and nationally  and who has been on the forefront of my mind since introducing this  bill.   On August 19, Savanna, a 22-year-old member of the Spirit Lake Tribe,  who was 8 months pregnant, went upstairs to her neighbor's apartment in  Fargo, ND, after being invited to try on a dress for alterations. While  she was there, what awaited her in that apartment were truly horrific  acts of violence. Although Savanna's baby daughter survived and is now  safe with her father and grandparents, that was the last time anyone  who loved Savanna saw her alive.   After 8 days of searching for Savanna by the family and the  community, her body was finally found by chance by kayakers in a nearby  river. Her body was wrapped in plastic and duct taped. Her death was an  incredible tragedy and, unfortunately, one that happens way too often  to Native women.   While the news of Savanna's death was heard around the world,  thousands of indigenous women are murdered and disappear each year,  with many of those cases being ignored or forgotten.   Over my decades in public service, I have worked with Tribal  communities on issues that involve violence against Native women. In  response to those talks and to this latest tragedy, today I am  introducing legislation that would help tackle the barriers to bringing  justice for missing and murdered Native women across the country.   My bill, which is named after Savanna, would work to improve Tribal  access to Federal databases for missing persons. It would promote  interjurisdictional collaboration by establishing protocols for  responding to cases of missing and murdered Native Americans, and it  would require the collection of data related to missing and murdered  Native women.   Native women are an inherently vulnerable population whose voices are  still not heard by most people in power. Across rural North Dakota,  women living on reservations face unique challenges when dealing with  violence. Lack of access to emergency services, lack of access to law  enforcement officers, lack of access to an AMBER Alert system, and  confidential victim services that are not provided--these all act as  barriers to women getting the help that they desperately need.   Unfortunately, there is no official database or mandated database  collection on the total number of missing and murdered Native women in  our country. This has added to not knowing what the actual magnitude of  this epidemic really is and has resulted in several Tribal members  sending me stories and handwritten lists of the names of missing and  murdered women that people have gathered just from their collective  memory.   I would like to share some of the stories that I have been so honored  to receive from family members. Telling these stories--and giving me  the ability to tell these stories--is not easy because every time you  tell the story, you relive the story. These tragedies still hurt  deeply. Even years after the murder, they still absolutely relive that  experience. I know they have given me these stories to tell for one  simple reason: because they pray and they hope and they dream that  giving me these stories may change the outcome for some other family.   I am going to start by talking about these wonderful women--these  beautiful women. Up at the far right-hand corner with her beautiful  baby is Stella Marie Trottier-Graves. Stella Marie was born and grew up  in Belcourt, ND, and was a member of the Turtle Mountain Band of  Chippewa. She spent many years traveling the world with her husband,  who served in the U.S. Air Force, and their three children. The family  lived in Florida, Germany, Japan, and Arizona. Everywhere they went,  Stella quickly made friends and proudly shared her Chippewa culture.  She was loved and adored by all who met her for living an adventurous  and fearless life.   In July 2009, Stella and her family moved back to Belcourt, ND, and  she started to attend Turtle Mountain Community College. On September  16, 2010, Stella and her cousin were at the local bar when she decided  to stay behind with other people they knew. According to witnesses,  Stella left with another couple to continue the evening out.   Stella's body was later found in a male Tribal member's pickup in an  open field on the reservation. It wasn't until 13 days later that the  family was officially notified by law enforcement of Stella's death.   Throughout the investigation, there were a lot of rumors and  misinformation, which made it difficult to find the murderer or the  murderers. People who were with Stella the night of her death said that  they were never questioned, and information provided was never followed  up on. No one has ever been charged or convicted for this murder, and  the last hours of Stella's life remain unknown.   Stella was an incredible woman who was loved by all who knew her. Her  family, her children, and her Tribe deserve justice.   Monica Wickre is pictured here with those beautiful earrings and the  red  [[Page S6364]]  shirt. Monica was a 42-year-old mother of three who was born and raised  in Belcourt on the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa reservation and  lived near Aberdeen, SD.   After a night out with friends on April 7, 1993, Monica never  returned home. Her relatives grew concerned when they had not heard  from or seen Monica for several days. Eventually, the family filed a  missing persons report and started to talk to friends and neighbors.  The detective assigned to the case worked closely with the community  and the family and assured them he was working diligently on this case.   In June of that year, a canoeist found Monica's badly decomposed body  in the James River outside Aberdeen. Throughout the next several years,  new detectives were assigned to the case, each having to basically  start over and work with limited notes, interviews, and evidence from  the previous investigators. A couple of times, the police told the  family that they had a suspect or were close to arresting someone for  Monica's murder, but there was never enough information to charge the  suspect. This has resulted in nearly 25 years of heartache for Monica's  family and her friends.   Monica's family wants justice for their daughter, sister, and mother,  and they all want closure. Although the case is no longer active, the  family continues to bring awareness about Monica's case in the hope  that someone will come forward with information that will, in fact,  help solve it.    Monica Lisa Two Eagle is the woman with the dark hair in the floral  print shirt. She was a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe and one of 14  children. She was kind, caring, and athletic. In the winter of 1979,  Phil Two Eagle saw his sister Mona Lisa, who was in her early twenties,  leave the siblings' house and get into a red-and-white pickup with a  couple of men. Mona Lisa never returned.   In the following days, the family and local law enforcement searched  for her on horseback. Taking it upon themselves, they searched for her  on horseback. About 2 weeks after she went missing, Mona Lisa's father  and brother found her frozen in a pasture near their home. She had been  beaten, possibly raped, and left alone in a blizzard. Rumors ran wild  that family and law enforcement tried to solve the crime, but, even to  this day, no one was ever convicted or even charged. The two men who  were last seen with Mona Lisa all those years ago are still running  free, while the family lives every day with the lack of justice.   Lakota Rae Renville, the woman in the black-and-white photo, is the  last victim I want to talk about. I want to thank her family, who are  here today and who have honored me and trusted me with her memory. I  want to help them understand how grateful I am, but I also want them to  know that sharing her story will help raise awareness about the crimes  of missing and murdered indigenous people.   Lakota was a member of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Dakota Bands of North  and South Dakota, who, despite being shy and reserved, had a solid  group of friends who supported her and even helped her excel in school.  After graduation, Lakota spent time taking care of her family,  especially her nieces and nephews.   In 2005 Lakota met a man online and unexpectedly relocated to  Missouri, unbeknownst to her family. With most details still unknown 12  years later, the family is left with more questions than answers. What  they do know is that she was forced into sex trafficking and  manipulated against her will.   In October of 2005, Lakota's family was called and told that her body  was found badly beaten, wrapped in carpet padding and a blanket in an  open gravel pit in Missouri. Local investigators brought in and  subsequently let go dozens of suspects and, to this day, have not  brought her murderer to justice.   Lakota was never given a chance to become a mother or pursue that  bright future that surely lay ahead of her. She was robbed of a life  she had yet to experience, a life that was certain to be filled with  love from her family and deep appreciation from her family.   These are not isolated cases. This goes on every day in America.   I want to make a point of how discouraging it, so many times, when  you see events unfolding where it may be that a young girl goes missing  in a Caribbean island and the world is turned upside down looking for  her or when we hear a story of someone who comes from maybe a more  affluent and wealthy family who goes missing and we turn over every  stone to find them. Yet that is not the story for very many indigenous  women.   When you look at the importance of what we do today, probably the  most important thing we can do is to tell these stories, and from  telling these stories we have an opportunity to really change. We can't  ignore that frequently for Native people, they are not wrong to believe  that they are the forgotten people of this country. Way too often, the  first Americans become the last Americans.   Under the Savanna's Act, the Attorney General, in cooperation with  the Secretary of the Interior, must consult with the Tribes on how to  improve Tribal access to Federal criminal information databases, such  as the National Crime Information Center and the National Missing and  Unidentified Persons System. We need to ensure that Tribal law  enforcement has up-to-date information on missing Native women and  better communication--in fact, essential--with Federal, State, and  local law enforcement agencies and Tribal law enforcement agencies so  cases like the ones you have heard of today don't go unnoticed or  uninvestigated.   Jurisdictional issues are a huge barrier in Indian Country to  responding to and prosecuting crimes committed on Tribal lands.  Standardized protocols must be established in order to give a quicker  response to Native women going missing. The complexity of jurisdiction  on Tribal lands can slow down an investigation, but it is not an  excuse. It can waste crucial time at the beginning of an investigation  or a case, but it is not an excuse. If we do not act rapidly, we know  we lose precious time to prevent homicides and to bring a woman safely  home and help apprehend the perpetrators.   In one case study alone done by the National Institute of Justice, 97  percent of Native women experience violence by a non-Native  perpetrator. This number emphasizes what I have long said, that  historical trauma is a major factor of violence against Native women,  and perpetrators feel that Tribal lands give them a free pass from the  law. This can no longer be tolerated, and jurisdictional issues must be  addressed. It cannot be the excuse for inaction.   Although we don't know the total number of missing and murdered  Native women, it is clear, from all of the stories and from the  statistics that we do have, that the rates at which Native American  women experience violence is intrinsically related to the likelihood of  their going missing, being murdered, and forced into sex trafficking.   Here are just some of the statistics collected by the National  Institute of Justice, the Government Accountability Office, and the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding violence against  Native women. In 2016, 5,712 cases of missing Native women were  reported to the National Crime Information Center, and 125 of those  cases were in my State of Dakota alone. On some reservations, Native  women are murdered at more than 10 times the national average. I want  to repeat that. On some reservations, Native women are murdered at more  than 10 times the national average.   American Indians and Alaskan Natives are two times more likely to  experience rape or sexual assault compared to all other races.   In 2010, we found that the U.S. attorneys declined to prosecute  nearly 52 percent of violent crime that occurred in Indian Country.  Homicide is the third leading cause of death among American Indians and  Alaskan Native women between 10 and 24 years old.   These high rates of violence, including domestic violence, sex  assault, and human trafficking, must stop. We must work together to  combat domestic violence and human trafficking in Indian Country.   Just last week, the Indian Affairs Committee held a hearing to  discuss the lack of services provided for Indian Country regarding the  horrific acts of violence and human trafficking of Native women. Just  yesterday, while questioning one of the officials at the Department of  the Interior about the need to do training in human trafficking at our  casinos, he simply said:  [[Page S6365]]  I thought you were going to ask me about Indian gaming. I quickly said:  I am asking you about Indian gaming because all of this works together.   If we do not work together in every institution of the Federal  Government, in every institution of the State government, and in every  institution of Tribal government, we will never make progress in  providing the security that we have in this building, and the security  that we enjoy as White women will never be realized for women living on  the reservation in Indian Country. We cannot let this continue.   There are countless more stories like Savanna's, Stella's, Mona  Lisa's, Monica's, and Lakota's that we will never know. It is time for  Congress to recognize this epidemic and take action to prevent these  stories and find out just how many stories there really are. It is time  to give voice to these voiceless women. It is time to bring their  perpetrators to justice and give a voice to the families who are  struggling even today--sometimes decades later--to understand how this  can happen in America. They seem to be second-class citizens.   I think that is what we know. I am working with very many of my  colleagues on the other side. This isn't a partisan issue.   I have been joined by my wonderful colleague from the great State of  Alaska. I think the first time we ever met, this was the topic of  conversation: What is the security for Indian children, security for  Indian women, and Alaskan Native women? We knew because both of us have  traveled extensively in our States and spent a lot of time in the  indigenous populations.   When family members ask us why this is happening, we frequently don't  have an answer.   I know that in my State jurisdictional issues provide some barriers  to actually getting this done, but that is an excuse. We need to do  better.   With that, I want to yield the floor to my wonderful colleague from  the great State of Alaska, who once again is joining me and leading her  side of the aisle to bring attention to these issues.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.
