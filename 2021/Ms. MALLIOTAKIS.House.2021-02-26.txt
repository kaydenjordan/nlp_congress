 Madam Speaker, this bill is not tailored to the  specific needs of our Nation or its citizens. I support helping the  unemployed, struggling businesses, and returning money to taxpayers,  but you give $1,400 with one hand and it costs $15,000 per American  household to pay for it.   Congress thinks it knows how to spend hardworking taxpayers' money  better than they do, all while our Nation approaches $30 trillion in  debt and $1 trillion from previous relief remains unspent.   Right now, vaccine production and distribution is a top priority, yet  less than 1 percent of these funds go to it, showing how bloated this  bill is. It spends billions on unrelated projects, from a San Francisco  rail line to family planning; and a whopping $3.5 billion for The  Global Fund, forcing American taxpayers to pick up 88 percent of this  international fund's expenditures, all while our diplomats can't even  get the vaccine.   My amendment would have required States receiving billions to commit  to not raising taxes on their citizens. The CDC said it would cost $25  billion to reopen America's schools safely. Only in this mismanaged  government would things end up costing eight times more than originally  estimated. This is an epic fail.
