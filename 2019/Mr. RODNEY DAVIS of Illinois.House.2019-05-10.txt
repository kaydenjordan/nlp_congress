 Madam Speaker, on Friday, May 10th I  was absent from the House to attend my daughter's college graduation.  Due to my absence, I did not record any votes for the day. Had I been  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 197; ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 198; ``nay'' on rollcall No. 199; ``yea'' on rollcall No.  200; ``yea'' on rollcall No. 201; and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 202                            ____________________
