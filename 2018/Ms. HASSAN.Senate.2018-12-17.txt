 Mr. President, last month, as fires raged across  northern California, a New Hampshire family business stepped up to  help. For their efforts, I am proud to recognize Dr. Bruce Cozzens, his  sons Jeff, Stuart, and Matt; long-time friend John Lenzini, as well as  head brewer Chris Deapo of Schilling Beer Co. as December 2018's  Granite Staters of the Month.   Schilling Beer Co. was founded in 2013 by friends and family who are  deeply committed to their community, and one of their core values as a  business is looking out for others. As CEO Jeff Cozzens put it, ``part  of living this value means that we help others whenever it is within  our power do so.''   As the Camp Fire blazed, Schilling Beer Co. agreed to be part of a  national ``Resilience'' fundraiser spearheaded by Sierra Nevada  Brewing. As part of the initiative, Schilling Beer Co. will join  breweries across the country to help brew the Resilience Butte Country  Proud IPA, of which all of the proceeds will go to relief efforts in  Butte County, CA. Schilling Beer Co. also played an important role by  lending their trademarked name of ``Resilience,'' their American ale  project, to the cause.   In Jeff's words, ``Butte County residents have suffered a tragedy of  unspeakable proportions,'' and the brewery was honored to be able to  play a role in assisting them.   I am extremely grateful for their generosity and efforts to help the  victims of the California wildfires, and I am proud to recognize the  Cozzens and Lenzini families of Schilling Beer Co., as well as head  brewer Chris Deapo, as the December Granite Staters of the  Month.                            ____________________
