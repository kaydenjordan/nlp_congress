 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman very much for this  opportunity to speak on behalf of H.R. 1329, and I salute Congressman  Bost from Illinois and Congresswoman Esty from the great State of  Connecticut for their great work in a bipartisan fashion to help our  heroes.   I think, Mr. Speaker, it was our first Commander in Chief, George  Washington, who said, in effect, that we can never expect our young men  and women to step forward and serve our country in uniform unless and  until we make sure we take care of those who have already returned from  the battlefield.   Now, in the State of Maine, Mr. Speaker, we love our veterans. We  have about 125,000 of our heroes in our State of Maine, more than half  of whom are in the rural part of our State, the Second Congressional  District of Maine, that I am honored to represent.   I think it is a great idea and about time that we make sure that we  come before the American people, Republicans and Democrats together, to  make sure that our veterans receive a cost-of-living adjustment--those  who have been disabled--as a result of their service for our country.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all Republicans and Democrats on this committee  and in this body to please support H.R. 1329. It is the right thing to  do, to give a cost-of-living increase to our veterans.
