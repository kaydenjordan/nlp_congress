 Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3496 makes technical amendments to  update statutory references to certain provisions in title 25, U.S.  Code, and corrects related technical errors.   According to the Office of the Law Revision Counsel, or OLRC for  short, the purpose of editorial reclassification is ``to reorganize  areas of law that have outgrown their original boundaries, or to  eliminate organizational units that are no longer efficient.''   Without altering any statutory language, OLRC relocates and  rearranges provisions to make the organization of titles more logical  and accessible. As a result, statutory references in other titles of  the code must also be updated.   In September of 2016, the OLRC moved provisions from chapter 14 in  title 25 into four new chapters toward the end of title 25. The  reauthorization was necessary because more than 900 sections had  accumulated in this chapter over years of legislating. Another small  number of provisions within chapter 14 were transferred to other  locations within the code.   The text and some provisions in chapters 14 and 19 were omitted in  order to bring the coverage of the code into line with current  classification practices with respect to general and permanent laws.                                time  1700    This is a routine exercise as these bills were prepared by OLRC  pursuant to its responsibility under section 285(b) of title 2, U.S.C.,  and under the Judiciary Committee's responsibility for laws pertaining  to the codification and revisions of the U.S. Code.   No substantive statutory text was repealed or altered and this bill  merely improves the organizational structure of the material in the  U.S. Code.   In the 115th Congress, Representative Issa sponsored a bill, which  the Judiciary Committee ordered reported, making the necessary changes  to cross-references in other titles of the Code affected by this  editorial reclassification.   The Committee similarly favorably reported this bill during the 117th  Congress. H.R. 3496 is an updated version of this legislation, which  the Judiciary Committee passed this Congress by voice.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.
