 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman DeFazio, and I  rise in strong support of the Moving Forward Act. It will make critical  investment in all kinds of infrastructure.   I am delighted that it includes the Transportation Alternatives  Enhancements Act, a piece of legislation which will provide funding for  biking and walking infrastructure--and that is an initiative that I  presented--as well as investments in the Capital Investment Grants,  which will provide funding for the extension of the great Second Avenue  Subway from East Harlem right in to 125th Street in Harlem, a  transportation desert.   Also, I would like to see, in the future, how more funding goes to  New York City. We put more in the coffers and deserve a lot more.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our chairman for also including  housing as infrastructure. We are the landlords. The Federal Government  is the landlord of public housing. That is part of our infrastructure,  and we need funding for that as well as broadband internet services in  rural and urban communities alike.
