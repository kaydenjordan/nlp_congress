 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 70) condemning threats  of violence against historically Black colleges and universities  ("HBCUs'') and reaffirming support for HBCUs and their students, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                              H. Con. Res. 70         Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investigation is       investigating the bomb threats made in January and February       2022 against HBCUs as racially or ethnically motivated       violent extremism and hate crimes;        Whereas a high-quality education is central to economic       prosperity and social well-being in the United States;        Whereas HBCUs provide educational and economic       opportunities for postsecondary students;        Whereas these institutions educate and produce a       significant share of the Nation's Black leaders and       innovators;        Whereas as early as the 19th century, HBCUs were       established in response to discriminatory practices that       excluded Black Americans from pursuing an education in the       United States;        Whereas, on January 5, 2022, at least 8 HBCUs received bomb       threats, including Howard University, Xavier University,       University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, Prairie View A&M       University, North Carolina Central University, Florida       Memorial University, Norfolk State University, and Spelman       College;        Whereas, on January 31, 2022, at least 6 HBCUs received       bomb threats, including Southern University and A&M, Howard       University, Bethune-Cookman University, Albany State       University, Bowie State University, and Delaware State       University;        Whereas, on February 1, 2022, the first day of Black       History Month, at least 18 HBCUs received bomb threats,       including Shorter College, Philander Smith College, Arkansas       Baptist College, the University of the District of Columbia,       Howard University, Edward Waters University, Spelman College,       Fort Valley State University, Kentucky State University,       Xavier University, Coppin State University, Morgan State       University, Jackson State University, Alcorn State       University, Mississippi Valley State University, Rust       College, Tougaloo College, and Harris-Stowe State University;        Whereas HBCUs provide an environment of belonging, safety,       and security for Black students, faculty, and administrators;       and        Whereas these threats against HBCUs disrupt campus       environments, obstruct educational opportunities, increase       anxiety, and instill fear: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring), That Congress--        (1) condemns violence and the threat of violence against       HBCUs, including bomb threats made against several HBCUs on       January 5, 2022, January 31, 2022, and February 1, 2022; and        (2) reaffirms the commitment of the United States Federal       Government to combat violence against HBCU students, faculty,       and staff.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and insert extraneous material on H. Con. Res. 70.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, over the last 5 months, more than 30 of our Nation's  historically Black colleges and universities, including Norfolk State  University and Hampton University in my district, have faced an  alarming series of bomb threats.   These threats of violence against HBCU students, staff, and  communities are deplorable and unacceptable. In response, schools were  forced to cancel classes and lock down campuses and dormitories,  disrupting students' education and depriving them of their sense of  safety.   After some prodding, Members of Congress were briefed by the  Department of Justice and learned that the FBI is investigating these  threats as racially motivated and possibly hate crimes. It should not  go unnoticed that these current threats underscore the very reason  HBCUs were established in the first place; to eliminate barriers to  higher education for Black students by creating safe, affirming, and  high-quality institutions.   Mr. Speaker, we should all agree that every student in this country  deserves to attend a school with a safe and supportive campus.   This resolution not only condemns the recent threats of violence but  also reaffirms our shared commitment to protecting the safety of HBCU  students.   I want to thank Congresswoman Adams for her leadership in crafting  this resolution, and I urge all of my colleagues to send a unified  message that these disgusting threats of violence will not be  tolerated.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader of the United States  House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Mfume).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Missouri (Ms. Bush).  [[Page H1349]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Carter).                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining on  both sides?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams), the chair of the  Bipartisan HBCU Caucus and sponsor of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  time from Members who are present. I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, as many of our colleagues have stated, HBCUs play an  invaluable role in our higher education system and in our communities.   Despite facing chronic underfunding in the past, and  disproportionately suffering from the pandemic, these institutions have  persevered to open the door to higher-quality higher education for  generations of students over the years.   However, we cannot expect these institutions to maintain their legacy  of expanding access to education when their basic safety and security  continue to be threatened.   Each of us has the responsibility to condemn these recent threats of  violence against HBCUs and reaffirm our support for HBCU students,  staff, and communities.   Moving forward, we must also build on the historic relief funding  that Congress has provided for these critical institutions and secure  the resources they need to recover from the pandemic and prepare  students for their success.   I thank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) and, the gentlewoman  from North Carolina (Ms. Adams) for their leadership with the  Bipartisan HBCU Caucus--particularly Ms. Adams--for her extraordinary  leadership over the years with the caucus and her leadership in  sponsoring this resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for this  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.
