 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor John Keene, a Jersey  City resident and chair of the Department of African American and  African Studies at Rutgers-Newark.   Last month, Professor Keene was awarded the $625,000 MacArthur  Foundation Genius Grant. Professor Keene is one of only 25 people to  receive the award this year. He is a groundbreaking author who has  studied, taught, and written about the intersection of race, society,  and the human experience.   Professor Keene's work has inspired his students, and his community,  and myself. I am so proud of Professor Keene and all of Rutgers-Newark  for keeping our city and my district at the top of the academic field.   I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Professor Keene, and I  leave you with his words:         The most important thing is to read as much as you can,       work on your writing, to try to engage in our community with       people who you can share your work with and learn from.                            ____________________
