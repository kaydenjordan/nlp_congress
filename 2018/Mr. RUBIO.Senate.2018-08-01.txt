 Madam President, I am now halfway through my eighth year  in the U.S. Senate, and in my time here, I have never once spoken  against, voted against, or opposed in any way any of the National  Defense Authorization Acts that have come before the Senate. The reason  being, despite whatever flaws one might find on most occasions in any  piece of legislation, the defense of our country is a fundamental  obligation of our Federal Government. It comes before everything else.   State governments run schools and build roads and do all sorts of  activities at the State level. Communities do all sorts of things at  the local level, but nothing is more important than the defense of our  country in terms of a Federal obligation. So I never have opposed a  National Defense Authorization Act, and I supported every single one of  them, despite the fact that it didn't have everything I wanted and  everything I liked, until today.   There is a lot of good in this legislation, and it makes it difficult  to be an opponent of it. For Florida, it authorizes over $200 million  for military construction in the State--the littoral combat ship  facilities at Naval Station Mayport, air traffic control towers at  Whiting Field, F-35 facilities that are important at Eglin Air Force  Base, KC-135 flight simulators at MacDill Air Force Base.   It authorizes the Secretary of the Air Force to build a cyber space  facility at Eglin. It authorizes the conveyance of land for the Air  Force Enlisted Village, which is a nonprofit corporation consisting of  approximately 80 acres next to Eglin for independent living and  apartments.   It authorizes the continued development of the B-21 Bomber--work that  is being done in Melbourne, FL. It fully supports the Joint Gulf Range  Complex, a true treasure for our country, and it is the largest  military range in the continental United States.   As for the country, it also has all sorts of other very important  things: an over 2.6-percent military pay raise. It increases the  Active-Duty workforce by 15,600 personnel, bringing the total to over  1.3 million. It tries to address the pilot shortage. It authorizes  $10.7 billion to buy 77 more F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, $193 million  in research and development funding for new software and improvements  to be incorporated in future years in that program.   It authorizes new missile defense, including $175 million intended to  integrate the THAAD and Patriot Systems batteries in South Korea. It  authorizes $23.7 billion for Navy shipbuilding, an increase of close to  $2 billion over what the President requested. To go on and on, it does  many important things in rebuilding our military strength in this  country, but it failed on one important front, and that is what I  believe to be a very significant and serious threat to the national  security and the future of this country--one that we are only beginning  to wake up to. For the first time since the end of the Cold War, the  United States is engaged in a geopolitical competition with a near-peer  adversary.   Since 1991, there has been no other nation on Earth that can project  power anywhere close to what the United States could do--until now.   Unlike our country, China is a nation with an ancient history, one  that leaves them with a longstanding sense of victimhood but also one  that leads them to believe they have a preordained destiny to, once  again, be the most powerful nation on Earth. This is what they mean  when they constantly use the phrase ``historical determinants.'' In  summary, what they are saying is, they are predestined to be the  world's most powerful country, and, therefore, they believe they are  predestined to surpass the United States geopolitically, economically,  and militarily.   This is not a new ambition, by the way. For two decades, they have  followed a strategy called hiding their power and biding their time,  but all of that changed last year.    In October, at their party congress, their President for life Xi laid  out a vision for China and did it in clear, nationalistic terms. He  said:         Backed by the invincible force of 1.3 billion people, we       have an infinitely vast stage of our era, a historical       heritage of unmatched depth, and incomparable resolve . . .       we have arrived at a new era, where China is now in a leading       position in terms of economic and technological strength,       defense capabilities, and composite national strength . . .       and with a military which can fight and win.    I will state that you see evidence of this belief in their impressive  and massive military buildup and quantum leaps in technological  advances. You see how they are working to destroy the current world  order that was built by America and our allies and now seek to replace  it with one they build and one that will be led by them.   That is how they offer loans--not just to get their companies more  business but to give them leverage and footholds in countries, and they  do so with no questions asked about democracy or human rights. That is  what the Asian Infrastructure Bank is all about. That is the Belt and  Road Initiative.   You also see what they are doing to overtake us economically. Their  state-led economy runs large trade deficits with everyone while at the  same time prohibiting market access to China. You see it in the  widespread force technology transfers and the cyber theft, and it is  working--5G, for example, will dominate most of the industries of the  future, and they are on course to be the world standard on 5G.   By 2020, China Mobile will be the only company in the world that can  build a standalone 5G network. Huawei was the first company to gain  approval to sell 5G stations in the European Union. They are moving  hard to dominate pharma research and genome editing and all sorts of  other leading industries for tomorrow. What is outrageous is how much  of these advances are built, not just on ingenuity and hard work but on  the theft of intellectual property from American companies, oftentimes  through research funded by American taxpayers. They do it through cyber  espionage. They do it through the forced transfer of technology, where  they tell companies who do business in China, not only do you have to  partner with a Chinese company, you have to give them the secrets to  their trade. See how they are now buying up companies, buying off  researchers in American universities and their research.   Now, this is what they are moving toward--to become the most powerful  country in the world. Why is that an issue, despite the fact that we  seek to not be in second place to anyone? Because you can see what kind  of country they will be and what kind of world we will have if they  become the world's most dominant power.   You see it, for example, in the conquest of the South China Sea  through the military harassment of Southeast Asian nations. You see how  they cut tourism to South Korea as leverage over our missile defense  deployments; how they restricted exports of rare-earth minerals to  Japan as leverage over the East China Sea disputes. We saw Filipino  agricultural products rot on the docks during the South China Sea  fights because they wouldn't let it come in.   You see the threats to our businesses to deny them access to Chinese  markets even further if they dare speak in support of President Trump's  301 investigations of Chinese unfair practices.   You see it in a U.S. citizen living in the United States of America-- not in China, not anywhere outside our borders--a U.S. citizen living  in the United States of America was fired by Marriott Hotel because of  a social media post that China complained about. That happened.   You see it most recently by American and United Airlines being forced  to change how they describe Taiwan on their website or they would not  be allowed to continue to fly to China.   The tactics they use over and over again are not sweeping changes; it  is  [[Page S5540]]  typically slow but incremental yet more assertive demands, but over  time these demands end up establishing a new normal. It is very much  like the example of the frog in a boiling pot of water. If you throw  the frog in the boiling pot of water, it jumps out right away, but if  you put it in cold water and slowly boil it, it will boil to death and  not even know it is boiling. That is what China is doing to the United  States and to the world.   There are only two things that China responds to when you confront  them. The first is a committed and sustained escalation across the  entire relationship between us and them, and the other is invoking the  help of our foreign partners. That is why I strongly believe the U.S.  should have worked with the European Union, Canada, Mexico, and Japan  to confront China, not to start a trade war with them as well. I am  happy to see that progress is being made on negotiations with Mexico,  and there has been a pause in the challenges of Europe. Perhaps now is  an opportunity to be able to do that second part of invoking the help  of our foreign partners and confronting these cheating and stealing and  unfair practices.    What about a committed and sustained escalation across the entire  relationship? I would say to you that, by and large, that has been what  this administration has done, and it is having an impact. Just this  morning, the New York Times reports about rare rebukes to President  Xi's leadership inside of China because these disputes are beginning to  have an impact on their economy.   There is one glaring exception, and that is an ill-conceived deal to  grant amnesty to a telephone and telecommunications Chinese company  called ZTE. To have a committed and sustained escalation across the  entire relationship means we can't make threats and back down, and we  can't carve out one part of the relationship for a special  accommodation. Sadly, that is what happened here.   ZTE is a telecommunications company that was caught--not once but  twice--in helping North Korea and Iran to evade U.S. sanctions. As a  result, the Commerce Department imposed a penalty on them that  basically was an equivalent of a business death penalty. It said that  you can no longer buy American microchips. Without that, you can't  function and the company was brought to its knees. I would argue that  sanctions should have been imposed on them even if they didn't help  evade sanctions because of the threat they pose to this country.   If we allow these companies to embed themselves in the  telecommunications infrastructure of the United States, it is a severe  and significant national security threat to this country and one that  grows every single year moving forward. Yet, inexplicably, at some  point, for some reason, a deal was struck that allowed ZTE to survive.  So the argument was, well, we are going to put a really big fine on  ZTE, and we are going to put people on their board to make sure they  are no longer violating sanctions. I will state that if this were only  about sanctions relief, that penalty would be sufficient for me and  should be sufficient for all. If it were Samsung, Nokia or Ericsson or  some other company that had done this, I would say maybe it went too  far.   The problem is, those two measures will do nothing to contain the  threat that ZTE poses to the United States and our national security. A  fine--when they are backed by the Chinese Government, a multibillion- dollar fine is nothing. You can put all the businesspeople you want on  their board. It is not the businesspeople we should be concerned about,  it is the technical people in these companies, the ones who can get ZTE  routers embedded in American telecommunications, create backdoor access  to our universities so they can steal our research, get into our  communications systems so they can intercept our communications in  military affairs and economic affairs. They can conduct cyber  espionage, commercial espionage, and, potentially, denial of our  command and control of our military one day if left unaddressed.   Think about embedding these Trojan horses inside of our  telecommunications systems and networks in America. Any company that  poses that threat should not be allowed to operate, much less remain in  business, and ZTE is one such company.   Even if ZTE tells the Chinese Government we don't want to do this,  they will have no choice or they will cease to exist or their leaders  will be in jail, and somebody new will replace them who will do it.  This is why this is so critical and why in the bill, as passed by the  Senate, we reimposed these penalties, and it was taken out in  conference.   The threat posed by China and by telecommunications companies are so  severe and so significant that it regrettably brings me to the point  where I cannot support a bill I have always supported in my time here.   We need to wake up to the threat that China poses to this country  because we are running out of time to do so.   Madam President, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    I yield time to the Senator from Maryland.    Madam President, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Madam President, I will be brief in closing. I note that  the manager of this needs to get through some things to get to our  vote.   There are three quick points I want to make. The first thing is that  the Chinese have learned how to work our system and how to play us.  They know, for example, that they can just go to American companies, go  to Washington, go to the White House, go to Congress, and tell them how  bad this is for you, and you will get them to change their minds or  they just hire lobbyists, as the Senator from Maryland outlined.   One company involved here was Qualcomm. They are the largest seller  of chips to ZTE. They were involved in saying: Don't do this.  Obviously, they were a customer, they didn't want to lose this  customer. Qualcomm had a deal pending in China to purchase a Dutch  company. I believe the understanding was if you allow ZTE to survive,  not only do you get to keep this company as a customer, but you will  probably help yourself get that deal in China with the Dutch company  purchase.   Guess what. On the day after it was announced that the conference  committee had dropped this provision, Qualcomm announced it was  dropping its pursuit of that deal in China because they couldn't make  headway. The Chinese Government doesn't play. They got ZTE to stay  alive, and they still blocked the deal.   The second point is this issue: They are a cell phone maker, but the  hand-held devices they make are the least problematic part of this.  They make servers and cameras, and these are embedded in our  telecommunications network. That is the way we communicate with each  other on commercial secrets or, potentially, military secrets. If it is  unclassified or sensitive information, all of it is potentially  vulnerable to a company. They don't even need spies anymore. We brought  them into our network and continue to do so, not to mention the role  they play in networks around the world, which brings me to the last  point.   ZTE is a big danger. They are small compared to Huawei, which is a  company even bigger than ZTE that poses an even greater systemic risk.  If we can't even take on ZTE because they lobby and because of American  companies coming here, how are we ever going to take on Huawei or any  other dangers they pose to us?   It is time we open our eyes. We are engaged in a geopolitical  competition, not with some poor agrarian country trying to catch up but  with a global superpower that is quickly nipping at our heels and doing  so unfairly, with the intent of replacing us in the world as its most  powerful country militarily, economically, geopolitically, and  technologically.   The history of America is short in comparison to the great empires of  history and the great countries of history. Some 240-odd years in the  scope of history is but a blink of an eye. History is full of examples  of nations that became complacent and lost their standing and their way  of life.   I am not claiming that ZTE alone will be that, but it is a part of a  broader problem; that is, we have yet to realize what a significant  threat China poses to this country in every realm and every sphere.  Until we do, we are going to continue to be in danger of surrendering  and forfeiting our way of life and our place in the world. If we do  that, the world will be worse off for it. We will have no one to blame  but ourselves for failing to act.   I yield the floor.
