 Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Johnson for  hosting this Special Order on so many important issues that our country  is facing.   I stand for peace, and a lasting one. Side by side, the American and  Israeli people have stood for freedom and democracy in the face of  authoritarian aggression. Side by side, the American and Israeli people  have stood for justice with restraint in the face of reckless violence.  Side by side, the American and Israeli people have stood for peace  through self-defense in the face of terrorism.   President Trump was working with various Islamic nation-states in the  Middle East to adopt the Abraham Accords in order to foster better  diplomatic relations with the nation of Israel. Unfortunately, Joe  Biden has brought this peace process to a screeching halt.   We know Hamas is a terrorist organization, and they are funded by  Iran. The Biden administration continues to negotiate with Iran to get  them back in the Iran deal. Iran is a funder of terrorists, and the  Iran deal would make it easier for them to commit and fund terror. Iran  has provided money to Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist  organizations. These groups' intention is to destroy Israel and the  Jewish state.    The ongoing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians show why America  must act immediately to support Israel, condemn Hamas, and sanction  those who fund terrorism.   My family and I will continue to pray for the peace and safety and  for the people of Israel as they combat terrorism.  [[Page H2597]]
