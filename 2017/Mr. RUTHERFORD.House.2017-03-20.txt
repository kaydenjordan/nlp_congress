 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 1353) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to  require certain additional information to be submitted to Congress  regarding the strategic 5-year technology investment plan of the  Transportation Security Administration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1353         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Transparency in       Technological Acquisitions Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE SUBMITTED TO CONGRESS                     UNDER THE STRATEGIC 5-YEAR TECHNOLOGY                     INVESTMENT PLAN OF THE TRANSPORTATION SECURITY                     ADMINISTRATION.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford) and the gentlewoman from New York (Miss Rice)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include any extraneous material in the Record.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1353, the Transparency in  Technological Acquisitions Act of 2017. I commend the gentlewoman from  New York (Miss Rice) for introducing this very important bill.   Over the course of the last Congress, the Transportation and  Protective Security Subcommittee conducted rigorous oversight of TSA's  technology and equipment acquisition process, and they found it fraught  with waste and inefficiencies. The committee also found that TSA fails  to effectively communicate its procurement needs with the private  sector.   Our government relies upon private sector innovation to develop  security technologies. However, that innovation comes with a price tag,  and we cannot reasonably expect the private sector to spend millions of  dollars in research and development of new emerging technologies  without greater transparency and communication, both with the TSA and  the Department of Homeland Security, as to exactly what their future  needs and technology investments will be in the future.   This bill will provide greater transparency into TSA's acquisition  plan, allowing for industry to better meet emerging needs, and enable  better congressional oversight.   I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. I rise in support of H.R. 1353, the Transparency in  Technological Acquisitions Act of 2017.   Mr. Speaker, last Congress, I served as the ranking member of the  Transportation and Protective Security Subcommittee, and we held  multiple hearings on TSA's acquisition processes.   In the course of conducting oversight and engaging with stakeholders,  we learned that deficiencies in TSA's planning for technology  investments were causing serious issues for technology companies who  produce products to meet the Agency's needs.   Under the Transportation Security Acquisition Reform Act, TSA was  required to develop a 5-year technology investment plan. Stakeholders  widely supported this strategy and welcomed the release of TSA's first  5-year plan in August of 2015, but that support eroded when the budget  request for the same year did not align with the acquisition schedule  in the 5-year plan.   The purpose of the plan was to give businesses the time and certainty  they need to align their resources and planning to meet TSA's  technology needs. Security technology manufacturers looked at the plan  and invested significant resources in the technology that TSA planned  to acquire, but then they saw the budget request and found that TSA had  shifted direction and no longer planned to procure that technology.   That lost investment of time and resources hurts all technology  manufacturers, but it can completely destroy small businesses and  discourage small-business owners from working with the Federal  Government.   My bill, H.R. 1353, will help solve this problem by requiring TSA to  report to Congress on their 5-year plan annually instead of biennially,  and it will require TSA to notify Congress and all relevant  stakeholders of any changes or updates to the plan.   These commonsense steps will help ensure that there is ongoing  engagement between TSA and industry stakeholders so that manufacturers  of all sizes can continue to meet TSA's technological needs and  continue to innovate and address security vulnerabilities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this legislation.   I want to thank Subcommittee Ranking Member Bonnie Watson Coleman,  Congressman Keating, and Subcommittee Chairman John Katko for  [[Page H2213]]  being original cosponsors of this bipartisan legislation.   H.R. 1353 was unanimously approved by the full Committee on Homeland  Security earlier this month. Enacting my bill will ensure that TSA's  technology objectives are more closely aligned with the industry's  stakeholders that produce technologies to help TSA meet those  objectives.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chair for his support, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I first want to congratulate my  colleague, Miss Rice, for what I think is a great bill that is going to  bring some accountability to TSA.   Once again, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House  Committee on Homeland Security I rise in support of H.R. 1353, the  ``Transparency in Technological Acquisitions Act.''   This bipartisan bill requires the Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) to provide more frequent and detailed updates on  its strategy to invest in security technology.   The five-year investment plan includes information such as:   1. Transportation security risks and gaps that could be addressed by  technology   2. Current and expected trends in domestic and international travel   3. Opportunities for public-private partnerships and collaboration  with small and disadvantaged companies, other government agencies,  university centers of excellence and national laboratories   4. Resources required to protect technology from cyber theft,  diversion, sabotage or attack   5. Potential effects on commercial airline passengers.   This bill would require the updates to be submitted annually and to  include information on acquisitions made during the previous fiscal  year.   Requiring TSA to provide annual updates on the acquisition plan and  to notify Congress and industry stakeholders about any changes to the  plan which will provide much-needed clarity, certainty, and  transparency.   In 2015, TSA screened more than 708 million passengers, which is more  than 1.9 million per day.   Of the 2,653 firearms discovered in carry-on bags, 82.8 percent were  loaded.   Houston George Bush Intercontinental Airport ranked 3rd among  airports with the most firearms discovered in 2015.   This last January, Esteban Santiago shot and killed five people  inside Fort Lauderdale airport using a firearm stored in his luggage.   Terrorism and cyberattacks are likely to remain a reality for the  transportation industry for the foreseeable future.   It is absolutely critical that we invest in minimizing transportation  safety security risks to keep our citizens safe.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1353.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Fitzpatrick). The question is on the  motion offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford) that the  House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1353.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1294) to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to provide  for congressional notification regarding major acquisition program  breaches, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials in the Record on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials in the Record on the bill under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1294, the Reducing DHS  Acquisition Cost Growth Act.   The Department of Homeland Security, DHS, spends over $7 billion,  annually, on major acquisition programs. These programs secure our  borders, protect our shores, safeguard our airports, and defend our  cyber networks, among other critical missions. Unfortunately, the  Government Accountability Office has reported that DHS acquisition  management is on its high-risk list, since 2003, of areas most  susceptible to waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement. Recent watchdog  reports have revealed alarming findings regarding DHS' acquisition  efforts.   For example, in just 2016 alone, 8 out of 25 major acquisition  programs experienced cost growth, schedule slips, or both. These  program cost estimates increased by $1.7 billion, and their schedules  slipped by an average of 11 months. Given the enormous threats that are  facing our homeland, it is unacceptable to make our frontline operators  wait for the tools that they need to secure the homeland.   My bill will require much-needed oversight of DHS' acquisition  programs to safeguard tax dollars and hold program managers  accountable. When programs incur significant cost, schedule, or  requirement problems, my bill requires that DHS leadership be informed.  These programs will be required to put a remediation plan in place that  corrects the problem and also analyzes the root causes of why the  problems occurred in the first place.   The Homeland Security Committee in Congress must also be informed of  such significant problems. No longer will the people's representatives  in Congress be kept in the dark. These requirements are similar to  those used in the Department of Defense and will help DHS better  safeguard tax dollars and more effectively secure our homeland.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.   Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1294, the Reducing DHS  Acquisition Cost Growth Act. Since the Department began its operations  in 2002, it has spent tens of billions of dollars to procure goods,  services, and supplies in support of DHS' national security efforts.  The agency's major acquisitions investments, those that cost at least  $300 million, represent a significant portion of such purchasing.   The Department has worked to improve its acquisition programs in  recent years, but DHS still struggles when it comes to major  acquisitions. Take, for example, the SBInet--a southwest border  infrastructure project--that ballooned in cost to about $1 billion  before it was canceled in 2011, after GAO found that it was  ineffective.   More recently, there is the case of the Electronic Immigration  System, an automated immigration benefits processing system. According  to the Department's inspector general, this U.S. citizenship  immigration services program is now on course to be completed 4 years  later than originally estimated and at a cost of $1 billion more than  estimated.   The importance and complexity of DHS' mission demands effective  oversight of the Department's investments, particularly its major  acquisitions. H.R. 1294 seeks to ensure greater congressional oversight  of such acquisition programs by requiring the Department to report to  Congress when cost, schedule, and performance requirements are not met.  Additionally, when such requirements are not met, this bill requires  DHS to provide Congress with an analysis explaining the root cause of  the failures as well as a remediation plan to mitigate the problems.   The Committee on Homeland Security unanimously approved this measure  earlier this month, and similar language was approved by the House in  October 2015 as a part of comprehensive DHS acquisition legislation.  [[Page H2215]]    I commend my colleague from Florida for his work on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, effective oversight of the Department's acquisitions  programs is essential to ensuring optimal program performance. Given  DHS' limited budgetary resources and the gravity of its mission, it is  critically important that DHS get its major acquisitions right.  Enacting this legislation would require a greater level of  accountability from DHS and give Congress a greater level of oversight  to intercede before programs go off the rails.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 1294, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I just urge my colleagues to  support H.R. 1294.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Emmer). The question is on the motion  offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1294.   The question was taken.

(b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this Act shall       apply with respect to a quadrennial homeland security review       conducted after December 31, 2021.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Rutherford) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs.  Watson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1297, the Quadrennial  Homeland Security Review Technical Corrections Act of 2017.   Congress mandated through the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/ 11 Commission Act of 2007 that the Department of Homeland Security  conduct a quadrennial Homeland Security review every 4 years. This  review is intended to outline DHS' vision and strategy to effectively  implement its mission to protect the homeland. Given the threats that  we face from terrorists, it is vital that DHS has a sound strategy to  help keep the American public safe.   Last year, the Government Accountability Office reported on  opportunities for DHS to improve the QHSR process, and the GAO made  four recommendations for executive action. This legislation leverages  GAO's findings to enhance the QHSR and make it better.   Specifically, this legislation requires DHS to conduct a risk  assessment to  [[Page H2216]]  better inform the QHSR, and the bill also mandates that the DHS  maintain a paper trail of communications related to the QHSR. This  should allow Congress and watchdogs to conduct more effective oversight  of DHS.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey for introducing  this legislation, and I urge all Members to join me in supporting this  commonsense legislation.   I reserve the balance of my time.   Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1297.   The Department of Homeland Security's mission is complex and diverse.  Not only is DHS charged with preventing terrorism, but it is the lead  Federal agency for immigration enforcement, emergency management,  cybersecurity, and border, maritime, and transportation security.   Given the breadth of DHS' responsibilities, it is essential that its  limited resources be aligned with its mission to meet the ever-changing  threat landscape. As such, the Quadrennial Homeland Security Review,  which DHS undertakes every 4 years, is a critical tool to ensure that  the Department is positioned to effectively carry out its multifaceted  mission.   To date, DHS has issued two such reviews and is expected to release  its third such review in 2018. My legislation seeks to make refinements  to the law to address weaknesses identified by the Government  Accountability Office in the prior reviews.   Specifically, my bill seeks to ensure more robust consultation with  Homeland Security stakeholders, including State and local governments  and academic institutions.   It also seeks to ensure that DHS undertakes and documents our risk  analysis to inform its policy positions. GAO emphasized that  documentation of the review process, including the risk analysis, is  essential to ensuring the repeatability of the review process.   Last Congress, this House unanimously approved this measure in July  2016; however, the Senate did not act on the bill. Last week the  Committee on Homeland Security, on a bipartisan basis, voted to  favorably report this measure to the House.   My legislation is intended to ensure that the Quadrennial Homeland  Security Review is a driving vision for the Department of Homeland  Security. By enacting this legislation, Congress can guard against it  becoming a paperwork exercise that fails to influence the Department's  policies, programs, and priorities.   Given the criticalness of the DHS mission and the increasingly scarce  availability of resources, it is essential that DHS produce a risk- informed review that takes into account the diverse views of its  Homeland Security partners.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 1297, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate Mrs. Watson  Coleman on a very commonsensical bill here that is really going to help  protect tax dollars and help keep our country safe.   Mr. Speaker, I once again urge all my colleagues to support H.R.  1297, and I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Rutherford) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1297.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________
