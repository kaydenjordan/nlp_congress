 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Coach Pat  McLaughlin, the head football coach at my alma mater, La Salle High  School, for a significant accomplishment.   I played for La Salle back in the day, and my brother, Dave, played  10 years later.   Coach McLaughlin has been nominated for the NFL's Don Shula High  School Coach of the Year award. This prestigious honor recognizes the  best high school football coaches across the country for their  character, integrity, leadership, dedication to the community,  commitment to player protection, and on-field success.   In December, Coach McLaughlin led the La Salle Lancers to their  fourth Ohio Division II football championship in the last 6 years. As  this nomination affirms, he has been a leader both on and off the  field.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Coach McLaughlin, as well as all the La  Salle players and their families and everyone involved in the Lancer  football program. They have all made, and continue to make, the entire  Cincinnati community tremendously proud.   Lancers Roll Deep.                            ____________________
