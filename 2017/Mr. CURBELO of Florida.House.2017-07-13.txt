 Mr. Chair, Naval Air Station Key West  provides key training and support for the nation's military operations  and readiness. The base trains fighter pilots from all branches and is  home to the Joint Interagency Task Force South, which combats illicit  narcotics.   However, most of the land in the Florida Keys lies at elevations 3  feet or less above sea level, making the Naval station extremely  vulnerable to sea-level rise. But this threat is not unique to that  station; many of our bases across the, country and around the globe are  susceptible to the effects of climate change.   Recognition of this threat, and prudent planning for these  contingencies, are vital to our military bases and maintaining the  national security interests of the United States abroad.   I congratulate the gentleman from Rhode Island, and the Committee,  for recognizing this and including language in the underlying bill  asking the Pentagon to report on the vulnerabilities posed by climate  change so we can responsibly identify and implement adaptive measures.  This includes an honest discussion of the realities of our changing  environment.   As co-chair of the Climate Solutions Caucus, I urge all my colleagues  to reject the Perry Amendment.
