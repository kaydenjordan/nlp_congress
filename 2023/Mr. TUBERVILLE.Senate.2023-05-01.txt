 Madam President, today, I want to honor U.S. Army SSG  Taylor Mitchell who tragically lost his life last month in a Blackhawk  training exercise at the young age of 30.   Family members describe Sergeant Mitchell as an ``all-American man''  with a positive outlook, a love of flying, and a desire to serve--all  of which prompted him to enlist in the U.S. Army in 2014. After  completing training at Fort Jackson in South Carolina, he was assigned  to the 2nd Calvary Regiment in Vilseck, Germany, as a healthcare  specialist. Upon meeting requirements to become a flight paramedic, he  joined the 1st Combat Aviation Brigade at Fort Riley, KS, as a flight  paramedic noncommissioned officer. In November 2020, he transitioned to  the 101st Airborne Division of Combat Aviation Brigade, continuing this  role until the time of his death.   He is survived by his wife Hayli Jo; his parents Jay and Darlene;  brothers Garrett, BJ, and Joseph; grandmother Patricia Scoper; and six  nieces and nephews.   Alabama is grateful for Sergeant Mitchell's willingness to serve in  our Nation's military, and we mourn the tragedy of a life taken too  soon. His love of country and devotion to duty are an inspiration. We  will make sure that his legacy is never forgotten.                            ____________________
