 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill (S. 4148) to extend the Chemical Facility  Anti-Terrorism Standards Program of the Department of Homeland  Security, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I join Congressman McAdams in support of this  amendment, which prohibits the Trump administration from conducting a  dangerous and unnecessary explosive nuclear test. You want to see  something dangerous, take a look at his foreign policy.   Mr. Speaker, for over two decades, our Nation's top scientists have  conducted sophisticated tests to ensure the safety and reliability of  our nuclear stockpile without detonating these weapons.   As recently as 3 weeks ago, the NNSA stated that they identify no  technical reason to resume underground explosive nuclear testing. We  should heed their words. They are the experts.   Moreover, conducting an explosive nuclear test encourages our  adversaries, like Russia and China, to do the same. There is no good  reason to risk the restart of a global arms race, especially at a time  when we have the technological advantage.   An entire generation of Cold War patriots and families who worked at  and lived downwind of the Nevada test site have suffered illnesses  linked to radiation exposure. They know what is at risk if we allow  this administration to conduct such a harmful experiment. We shouldn't  do it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
