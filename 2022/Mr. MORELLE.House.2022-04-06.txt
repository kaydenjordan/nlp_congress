 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1033 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 1033         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3807) to       amend the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 to increase       appropriations to the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, and for       other purposes. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. An amendment in the nature of a       substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print       117-39, modified by the amendment printed in the report of       the Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution, shall be       considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Small Business or their respective       designees; and (2) one motion to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  Fischbach), my colleague and friend, pending which I yield myself such  time as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all  time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, this morning the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1033, providing for consideration of  H.R. 3807, the Relief for Restaurants and other Hard Hit Small  Businesses Act of 2022 under a closed rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Small  Business, self-executes a manager's amendment from Chairwoman  Velazquez, and provides one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to adopt the rule and  support critical funding for restaurants and other small businesses  across our Nation.   As we all know, small businesses--especially restaurants--are the  backbone of our local economy. Not only for the revenue they bring in,  but for the many local workers they employ; families that need their  paycheck now more than ever. But sadly, restaurants have been some of  the hardest-hit businesses throughout the COVID-19 crisis, and many  have struggled to keep their doors open.   Many of us have made a promise to support workers, families, and  businesses in their time of need, and that is why we established the  Restaurant Revitalization Fund in the American Rescue Plan, which  provided $28.6 billion in emergency assistance to eligible restaurants,  bars, and qualifying businesses impacted by the COVID crisis.   This program was clearly a success, providing relief to more than  100,000 restaurants and food and beverage businesses across the Nation.  Some recent estimates show the program saved over 900,000 jobs, and 96  percent of recipients said the grant made it more likely they would  stay in business.   However, there is no question that our initial investment was not  enough. The program ran out of funds in just 3 weeks, as the total  funding requested exceeded $72 billion, far more than the $28.6 billion  provided for in the American Rescue Plan.  [[Page H4230]]    This funding gap resulted in 178,000 restaurants who are unable to  secure funding in this program, even though they applied to the program  and met all of the eligibility requirements. Let me say that again,  178,000 restaurants, many of which are in danger of permanent closure  if Congress does not provide them with the relief they need.   The underlying legislation, the Relief for Restaurants and other Hard  Hit Businesses Act, would provide for $42 billion to replenish the  Restaurant Revitalization Fund, giving the Small Business  Administration the funding necessary to close this funding gap and  process the applications of those entities who are deemed eligible in  the initial application period, providing a lifeline for the restaurant  industry that has faced so many challenges over the past 2 years.   In addition to this critical funding, the underlying legislation also  provides $13 billion for a new Hard Hit Industries Award Program, which  will grant much-needed relief to other small businesses across  industries and sectors that were the hardest hit by the pandemic but  were not eligible for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund or Shuttered  Venue Operators Grant program.   This new program would prioritize those eligible small businesses  that experience the heaviest pandemic-related losses, beginning with  those that lost 80 percent of their revenue.   To pay for both the establishment of the new program and the  replenishment of the Restaurant Revitalization Fund, this bill would  use funds reclaimed, seized, or returned to the Federal Government from  bad actors attempting to defraud previous recovery programs.   Back in October 2020, the Small Business Administration Office of the  Inspector General had already identified $78 billion in potentially  fraudulent loans and grants to ineligible entities, and more than 300  individuals have been brought to justice. This legislation also  increases oversight and audit requirements, ensuring that this  additional support goes to the businesses originally intended to  receive assistance.   Mr. Speaker, I have always been an advocate of additional support for  the restaurant and hospitality industry, and many of my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle have demonstrated support for the  Restaurant Revitalization Fund, as well. I hope we continue to see  bipartisan support for this effort on the House floor.   I urge all of my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying  legislation to deliver critical funding for restaurants and small  businesses in communities across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I always appreciate hearing from my colleagues and a distinguished  member of the Rules Committee, Mrs. Fischbach. I do note, however, a  couple of things before I yield some time.   The first is that as it relates to how the bill is funded, as I  indicated, the inspector general himself, that office, indicated there  is $78 billion in fraudulent claims that are being recouped by the  Federal Government. This bill will cost $42 billion for the Restaurant  Revitalization Fund replenishment, another $13 billion, $55 billion.  There is plenty of money in those reclaimed dollars to be able to pay  for this without having to appropriate new dollars. So this actually  should be in line with the principles of some of our more conservative  Members to have claimed dollars that are owed to the United States and  to its taxpayers.   Secondly, as it relates to workforce shortages, and I think we all  know in every industry, and the businesses I talk to back home, are  struggling to find workers. Yet, I note yesterday in the Education and  Labor Committee, of which I am a member, that we didn't get a single  Republican vote for the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act,  WIOA's reauthorization, which will do great things to continue to move  people into the workplace as quickly as possible. Yet, we received no  support for that.   So we are going to continue to work on these issues here in this  Congress. We are going to continue to lead. This majority is going to  continue to look out for small businesses, it is going to continue to  look out for people looking for work, and it is going to continue to  look out for employers who face worker shortages. So we will continue  to support this, and I believe this bill will be a great victory for  the 178,000 restaurants who desperately need our support.  [[Page H4231]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  California (Mr. DeSaulnier), a fellow member of the Rules Committee.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to just reiterate, this is really a simple issue. And there  may be attempts to distract from what is a simple issue, but the Office  of Inspector General indicated that we had $78 billion in fraudulent  claims. That is an estimate. Some estimates range as high as $200  billion.   It seems silly to me that we wouldn't take advantage of those dollars  which are being reclaimed to continue to try to get relief for the  many, many tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of restaurants and  their employees across the country.   And I dare say that when I talk to--I have sat down with many, many  restaurant owners in the last several months who had made application,  and, simply, didn't have the resources in the fund that we had  allocated to get relief, continue to talk to me about this.   So this is really a very, very simple question. I know there are a  lot of complicated, nuanced questions around here in Congress that we  are always dealing with. This is a simple one: Do we want to help these  small businesses, or do we choose not to help them? And I think we  would argue here that they very much deserve and merit this support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina  (Ms. Ross), another distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, frankly, I am a little perplexed. I think when I get  home and talk to my restaurant owners, they are going to say: Why were  you having a conversation about something not related to the restaurant  revitalization act?   I will explain to them that as much as I would like to get into a  conversation about how Putin's aggressive actions in Ukraine have  affected gas prices around the world, as much as I would like to have  the conversation about oil companies that have decided to continue to  reap record profits and not increase supply to meet the demand around  the world, as much as we can talk about all those things, that is not  why we are here today. We should have that conversation in an  appropriate venue.  [[Page H4233]]    This conversation and the venue right now that we are in is to talk  about the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. It is to talk about the  178,000 restaurants owned by Republicans, Democrats, and Independents  all across America in every single district that we have the privilege  of representing.   Every single district has restaurants, and that is what we are here  to talk about: how to get relief into the hands of those individuals  who, for 2 years, have struggled under the most difficult economic  circumstances any of us could ever imagine.   Let's make sure we keep our eye on the ball. Let's continue to focus  on the question in front of the House.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), my friend and distinguished member of the Rules  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to just correct the record as it relates to  the Energy and Commerce Committee. I think, just this morning, the  committee held a hearing with the heads of oil companies, multinational  oil companies, to bring them in to talk about why they refuse to  increase supply, which would bring down the costs.   I didn't do exceptionally well in economics when I was in the State  University of New York, but I do remember the old supply and demand  issue. When demand is high and supply is low, prices rise. We are going  to continue to work and push and urge those companies to increase  supply to meet demand and bring the costs down.   There is not much we can do about what is going on in Ukraine,  although we are desperately trying to help our brothers and sisters  there defend their democracy, which has had an incredible impact on gas  prices.   Let me also remind everyone who is tuning in, who is watching what is  going on, that the issue before the House of Representatives today, the  rule that is being considered, is dealing with the difficulties that  have been faced by restaurants across this country during the pandemic,  which has now lasted for nearly 2 years: the displacement of workers  and the impact that it has had on communities all across this country.  We are striving to achieve a solution here that will be good for  everyone across all 50 States and these small businesses that continue  to be the backbone of our local economies.   Mr. Speaker, I have been very grateful for the leadership of Mr.  Blumenauer, who has led the charge on this issue for some time now. I  think I have probably bothered him dozens of times to ask what we can  continue to do to advance his efforts, and he has continued to provide  leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Blumenauer), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Oregon.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from the State of Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I will say this, that I suspect when,  hopefully, this bill becomes law and we have helped save the 178,000  restaurants around this country that a number of my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle will be taking credit for it. I hope many of  them vote for it despite their unwillingness to really have a  conversation about it today and to talk about extraneous issues.   Before I reserve the balance of my time, I include in the Record a  January 24, 2022, article from CNBC entitled ``National Restaurant  Association asks Congress for more grant money as omicron hits  industry.''                         [From CNBC, Jan. 24, 2022]   National Restaurant Association Asks Congress for More Grant Money as                           Omicron Hits Industry                             (By Amelia Lucas)         The National Restaurant Association is asking Congress to       replenish the Restaurant Revitalization Fund as the Covid       omicron variant hits operators' businesses.        Last year, lawmakers created the $28.6 billion fund to aid       bars and restaurants struggling in the wake of the pandemic.       The grants were designed to make up for a restaurant's full       pandemic losses of up to $5 million for a single location or       $10 million for a business with fewer than 20 locations.       Publicly traded companies were ineligible, but their       franchisees could still apply.        Since the fund was depleted, restaurants have been pushing       for Congress to replenish it. Several lawmakers have       introduced legislation to do so, but the bills haven't gained       traction, and the Biden administration hasn't appeared       interested in supporting the measures.        But the latest surge in Covid-19 cases and its impact on       restaurants could change minds.        The National Restaurant Association's latest survey of       operators found that 88% of restaurants saw indoor dining       demand wane because of the omicron variant. More than three-      quarters of respondents told the trade group that business       conditions are worse now than three months ago. And the       majority of operators said their restaurant is less       profitable now than it was before the pandemic.        ``Alarmingly, the industry still hasn't recreated the more       than 650,000 jobs lost early in the pandemic, a loss 45       percent more than the next closest industry,'' the trade       group's top lobbyist, Sean Kennedy, wrote in a letter to       congressional leadership for both parties.        Kennedy also touted the benefits of the first round of RRF       grants. The trade group estimates that more than 900,000       restaurants jobs were saved by the initial round of funding,       and 96 percent of recipients said the grant made it more       likely they could stay in business. A full replenishment of       the fund would save more than 1.6 million jobs, according to       the trade group's estimates.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, first let me thank my colleague and friend, Mrs.  Fischbach. We spend a lot of time together in the Rules Committee, and  I always appreciate our conversations. While we may not agree on issues  from time to time, I always appreciate her earnestness, and I  appreciate her good work.   I want to thank all of my colleagues for their words in support of  the rule before us today.   As I mentioned earlier, Congress acted last year to provide much- needed relief for restaurants and other small businesses, but we must  do much more. Our economy simply cannot survive without small  businesses, and it is paramount that we redouble our commitment to  ensuring their continued success.   I pledge to always be an ally in that fight, and I know my colleagues  join me in that. I look forward to voting in favor of this effort to  bring much-needed relief to local restaurants and the small business  community.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Fischbach is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 1033         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 6858) to strengthen United States energy security,       encourage domestic production of crude oil, petroleum       products, and natural gas, and for other purposes. All points       of order against consideration of the bill are waived. The       bill shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion       except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled       by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Energy and Commerce; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 6858.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the  previous question, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.
