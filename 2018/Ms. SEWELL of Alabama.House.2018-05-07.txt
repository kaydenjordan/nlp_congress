 Mr. Speaker, I applaud the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Evans) for leading this Special Order hour.   Mr. Speaker, I especially want to acknowledge the Congressional Black  Caucus for always being the ``Conscience of the Congress'' and for  taking on the topic of tonight, which is the social safety net and how  important it is as a lifeline for so many Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out against the efforts to  dismantle our social safety net and the programs that help working  Americans make ends meet.   Our Federal health, antihunger, and poverty programs are the lifeline  for millions of Americans and their families. Every year, our  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP, feeds 9.5 million  families. Social Security keeps over 22 million Americans from falling  into poverty. And Medicare ensures that 44 million men, women, and  children have access to the care they need to stay healthy. These  families are hanging by a thread, and with every cut to our health and  antihunger programs, that thread becomes thinner and thinner.   In Alabama, I have seen the difference that these programs can make  firsthand. I have met working parents who rely on SNAP to put food on  the table for their children. I have met seniors who, after a lifetime  of work, are able to get by only because of their Social Security  check. I have met mothers who could not feed their children if it  weren't for the maternity care that they get through Federal health  programs. For these working parents, seniors, and children, our social  safety net means the difference between a warm home and homelessness.  It means a difference between a hot meal and going to bed hungry.   Last year in Alabama, I met a farmer named Hank, who was able to  afford healthcare for the first time in his life because of the  Affordable Care Act. And after Hank signed up for ObamaCare, tragedy  struck. His hand was caught in a hay baler, requiring immediate  emergency care. But because of the healthcare he received through the  Affordable Care Act, Hank was able to pay for his trip to the emergency  room and, most importantly, his family did not lose that farm.   That is what our social safety net does. It helps people when their  time of need is most. It is a promise that no matter the hardship you  face, we will never let you fall between the cracks. We, America, the  land of plenty. We, Americans, don't let other Americans fall through  the cracks. Whether your family faces a health crisis or layoffs; or  you are caring for a new child, we are not going to let you fall into  poverty.   Giving up on this promise is what I believe the Republican agenda has  done. Giving up on this promise is what makes the Republican attacks on  our social safety net so disturbing. It is a promise that we, as  Americans, make to other Americans, that we will have a social safety  net that will capture people in their most vulnerable time of need.   The tax bill that Congress and the Trump administration passed in  December repealed the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. That  move drove healthcare costs for families and will result in 13 million  more uninsured Americans. It was unnecessary, but it was a step that  this administration took. It was a step that ripped from 13 million  Americans their health insurance.  [[Page H3767]]    Just 2 months after the passage of the tax bill, President Trump  proposed a budget, the President's budget, that would cut $500 billion  from Medicare, $1.4 trillion from Medicaid, and $72 billion from Social  Security disability. If these proposals were signed into law, more  children would have gone hungry, more seniors would have fallen into  poverty, and more Americans would be unable to afford to get sick.    In the Ways and Means Committee this week, Republicans are holding a  hearing to discuss limiting access to Temporary Assistance for Needy  Families, TANF. At the same time, the House is debating reauthorizing a  farm bill that would eliminate food assistance for 400,000 families and  cut school lunches for 265,000 students.   This Congress is not just cutting a hole in our social safety net.  Republicans are selling the net in its entirety in order to pay for the  tax scam bill that they passed in December.   When President Trump and this Congress passed the GOP tax scam bill,  they mortgaged the future of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security to  give massive tax breaks to Wall Street and the richest Americans. They  put our health and antihunger programs into jeopardy and on a chopping  block in exchange for more trickle-down economics.   Mr. Speaker, after decades of stagnant wages, my constituents are no  longer willing to wait for trickle-down economics to trickle down to  them, especially when it means massive cuts to the Federal programs  working families rely on.   Lives are at stake, Mr. Speaker. That is why the Congressional Black  Caucus, led ably tonight by my colleague from Pennsylvania, is  discussing the social safety net and why we will continue to discuss  those programs that are the lifeline of so many Americans.   Why am I here? I am here because I represent Alabama's Seventh  Congressional District, a district which is my home district. I proudly  hail from the Seventh Congressional District. The Seventh Congressional  District is the poorest district in the State of Alabama. The median  income for a family of four is $32,000. But, Mr. Speaker, we are not  asking for a handout, we are asking for a hand up. We need Federal  assistance to make sure that our children don't go hungry, to make sure  that those who work a lifetime have Social Security to live on when  they are old.   It is important that we remember that these social safety net  programs keep Americans afloat and keep working Americans still  working, being able to provide food and nutrition to their children,  being able to buy drugs that are lifesaving for them to continue to  live. It is critically important that we remember that the social  safety net is not just for minorities, it is for all Americans when  they need it--when they need it. It is a promise that America has made  and a promise that the GOP and this administration continues to break.   Lives are on the line. That is why I am calling on this Congress and  this administration to abandon its attacks on the social safety net.  Instead, we should be passing legislation that puts working people  first. I am calling on this Congress to help keep our promise to the  American people that no one will be left behind. As the richest Nation  in the world, keeping that promise is not only within our power, it is  our obligation.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank my colleague, Congressman Evans from  Pennsylvania, and the Congressional Black Caucus for this Special Order  hour and for continuing to remind people that we are Americans and we,  as Americans, don't break our promise. Let's not break our promise when  it comes to Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security; let's not break  our promise when it comes to the nutrition of our students; and let's  not break our promise when it comes to working people who have worked  all their lives for Social Security and need only to live off of it  now.   Mr. Speaker, I again thank the Congressional Black Caucus for its  courage to continue to speak power to truth.    Mr. Speaker, I absolutely will.   As my colleague just said, I think what I want people to remember is  that we, as Americans, do make promises to other Americans. We do it  all of the time.   The promise that I am talking about with social safety net is a  promise that we won't leave other Americans behind. We can't be the  land of plenty and have people struggling each and every day.   In my district, there are parts of my district that have water and  sewer issues, sanitary issues, in 2018. No one in America should not  have a flushing toilet. In my district, there are people who live like  that.   I believe that the promise of America is a promise that we will do  all we can to make sure that no American falls through the cracks.   We have to remember that all of us go through trying times. These  programs are transitional programs. They are there to catch people when  they are falling, to give people the opportunity and the training that  they need to get back on their feet, to give them the opportunity to be  working Americans again, and to give them a dignity to continue to be  able to afford to take care of themselves.   I think that we need to remember that the American Dream comes with  it an obligation, and I believe that that obligation is an American  promise to all Americans that we won't rip social safety net programs  away from them, but, instead, we will thoughtfully provide  opportunities for training. The skills gap is real, and I think it is  really important that we, if we are to address the future of work in  America, acknowledge that we are leaving lots of Americans behind, and  we, as a Federal Government, should take that as a challenge and meet  that challenge to close the skills gap.   In many ways, the skills gap is an opportunity gap as well. In order  to provide people who need opportunities the most, we have to be  willing to step up and provide the resources for them to be able to  retrain and retool.                                time  1945    It is critically important. The dignity of work is something that is  critically important to most Americans, all Americans.   My district has the largest unemployment. When I took office in 2011,  the average unemployment in my 14 counties was near 15 percent. It was  14.7 percent. And while Tuscaloosa is doing great and Birmingham is  doing great, cities like Selma, that I grew up in, had 21 percent  unemployment.   What people needed was an opportunity to get back on their feet. I  dare to think about all the Americans who were helped by having the  Affordable Care Act, by having Medicare and Medicaid, by having the  assistance of the Federal Government to get back on their feet.   I am happy to report that the average unemployment in my 14 counties  is not where we want to be, but we are at 6.3 percent. So it is not at  the 3.9 or so that the national average is, but we are a far cry better  than we were at the 15 percent. So these people are working.   So social service programs were meant to help people get back on  their feet. I just think that people think about the fraud and abuse.   None of us want fraud and abuse when it comes to our programs, but I  can tell you that 70 percent of the folks who receive SNAP in my  district have children under the age of 17.   So when I fight for SNAP, when I fight against the massive cuts that  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to have, I am  fighting for those children to have food to eat. I am fighting for the  millions of seniors who are on food stamps who depend upon it to  provide nutritional assistance.   So I think that that promise is something that we all should not only  honor, but take as a badge of honor here in the Nation's Capital and  fight every day to provide opportunities for all Americans.
