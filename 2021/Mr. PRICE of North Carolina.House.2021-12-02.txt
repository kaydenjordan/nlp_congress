 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this  continuing resolution. But I want to make clear: This is a stopgap  measure, necessitated by Republican refusal to work with Democrats on a  bicameral, bipartisan basis to find a path forward for the balance of  the fiscal year.   Specifically, I can attest to the need for a full-year transportation  T-HUD bill to update our aging transportation infrastructure, to remedy  inequities in housing and transportation, prevent evictions, and make  our infrastructure more resilient to natural disasters and climate  change.   We need to fortify safety as the primary function of the Federal  Aviation Administration, providing full-year funding to strengthen  certification activities, modernize air traffic control, and hire  highly qualified personnel.   We need to fully renew all Section 8 and other housing vouchers for  nearly 5 million low-income and working families to ensure that they  can remain stably housed. We also need to keep pace with the cost of  upgrading our Nation's public housing, which houses more than 2 million  low-income residents.   We also spent months vetting over 1,000 Community Project Funding  requests in a bipartisan manner for well-designed housing,  transportation, and economic development projects that produce direct  community benefits throughout the country. Without completing the  annual appropriations process, none of these investments will be  possible.    Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of this CR today but I also urge my  Republican colleagues to meet Congress' most basic constitutional  responsibility of funding our government and directing investments for  the future by coming to the table. Come to the table. Let's find a  constructive path forward.
