 Mr. President, today I recognize Dallas Humphries,  an intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all the hard work he has  done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota.   Dallas is a graduate of Douglas County High School in Castle Rock,  CO. In August, he will graduate from the University of South Dakota  where he studies political science and criminal justice. Dallas is a  dedicated and diligent worker who has been devoted to getting the most  out of his internship experience and who has been a true asset to the  office.
