 Mr. Speaker, I rise today during National Police  Week to thank and show support for our police officers, particularly  the New York Police Department, and also warn my colleagues of what  happens when politicians think that they know how to do the job in the  street better than our cops do because I have seen it happen in New  York City. I have seen the quality of life deteriorate, I have seen  crime skyrocket, and we must learn from what has happened here to not  make this mistake and adopt those very policies on the Federal level.   This past weekend, we saw three innocent bystanders, one of whom was  a 4-year-old child, shot in broad daylight in the middle of Times  Square. Fortunately, NYPD Officer Alyssa Vogel was there. She sprinted  into action to save these individuals' lives. That is what this mother  was doing Mother's Day weekend, and we thank her for her heroic  efforts.   Sadly, we also lost a police officer, Anastasios Tsakos, who was in  Queens directing traffic in the middle of the night after there was a  car accident, and he was struck and killed by a hit-and-run driver who  was under the influence and operating an unlicensed vehicle.   Sadly, this is what our police officers do each and every day, put  their lives at risk, sometimes giving up their life to protect the rest  of us.   All through the pandemic, we praised them as heroes for working the  front line. COVID was the leading cause of death for our police  officers in 2020. We lost eight NYPD officers, sadly. Also, as we  approach the 20th anniversary of 9/11, let's not forget the sacrifices  of our police officers, not only on that day, but in the days since. We  continue to lose people to 9/11-related illnesses. In the NYPD's case,  they lost seven since January 2020.   Mr. Speaker, in New York City, we have seen policies that have hurt  our law enforcement officers. How did we get here? Well,  decriminalizing quality-of-life crimes, which was something I warned in  2017 that would lead to crimes skyrocketing. The broken windows theory  is real.   Then you add the State legislature's attempts to reform bail, the  rush to close Rikers Island, emptying the jails, putting dangerous  criminals with lengthy rap sheets back onto our streets.   The Governor's Parole Board has released over 16 cop killers and  other murderers and rapists, once again putting people who are  dangerous back on our streets; eliminated the NYPD plainclothes unit,  tying the hands of our police; and then lastly, cutting $1 billion,  one-sixth of the NYPD budget.   As I mentioned, the 4-year-old girl who was shot this weekend, she  was just one of 43 individuals shot in the last week, 169 percent  increase over the same period last year. There were nine murders last  week in New York City, up 350 percent over the same period last year.   But the trend is not just starting now. It is not just the result of  defunding the police. It is the other policies, as I have mentioned.  Homicides in 2020 soared 45 percent, shootings doubled, with 1,868  people shot in 2020, up from 923 in 2019. This is a result of an  abdication of responsibility from my colleagues on the city and State  level.   Now they want to take away the qualified immunity from our police  officers, something that many of you voted to do here for our Federal  law enforcement officers, despite when they already give up their  immunity if they are not operating within the NYPD guidelines, or if  they violate someone's constitutional rights.    There is no question that the demoralization of law enforcement over  the past year has contributed to a sharp rise in departures from the  NYPD, which are up 75 percent compared to 2019, with the lowest number  of NYPD officers in uniform in over a decade, when we have all this  rising crime taking place across our city. It is absolutely  disgraceful, Mr. Speaker, and it must end now.   City and State have a responsibility to keep the public safe. Quite  frankly, if they are not going to do it, if my mayor and my Governor  continue to tie the hands of our police officers and not allow them to  do their job, then we need the Federal Government to step in. Send DOJ,  ATF, FBI, DEA, and the U.S. Marshals, because we have a responsibility  to the citizens of our city and Nation to keep them safe.                            ____________________
