 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank and  congratulate Gail Langworthy, an incredibly kind and dedicated employee  of mine who has served my constituents for 8 years back in the  district.   Gail is moving on to an exciting new phase of her life, and she is  leaving our office to enjoy her retirement.   When Gail isn't working hard for the people of Pennsylvania's 15th  Congressional District, she is an active volunteer for the Breedtown  Cemetery Association in Venango County. She enjoys dancing, visiting  her three grandchildren in Florida, and exploring local trails while  riding bikes with her husband, Jeff.   Gail has also been described as an avid thrift shop and yard sale  junkie. Gail will be missed by our entire team, but I am happy for her  as she begins this new adventure.   Thank you, Gail, for your hard work, dedication, and service, and  enjoy your retirement.                  Recognizing Dave Bailey on His Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Mr. Dave Bailey, who has worked for 31 years for the Office of the  Chief Administrative Officer by supporting Member offices with all  sorts of technology needs.   Dave has been a frequent visitor to our office to help me and my  staff with our computers any time that we had an issue. He also played  a critical role in ensuring our office was ready to telework as we  transitioned our lives online at the start of this pandemic.   Simply put, we would not be able to do our jobs without people like  Dave Bailey.   I am disappointed that I will not be able to share my well wishes  with Dave in person, but I wanted to take this opportunity to thank him  for his three decades of service and for all the help that he has  provided me in my office.   Dave, be well, and enjoy your much-deserved retirement.                                COVID Vaccine     Mr. Speaker, this week, we reached a  truly incredible milestone in the fight against coronavirus.   On Monday, the first COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer was  administered, and today, the FDA is meeting to approve the Moderna  vaccine.   The timeline of vaccine development was made possible by Operation  Warp Speed, and it is truly a modern medical miracle. In the 1930s, at  the University of Pittsburgh, Dr. Jonas Salk began work on a polio  vaccine. It wasn't until 1953, 23 years later, that the vaccine was  successfully tested.   Operation Warp Speed has helped shrink the vaccine timeline and knock  down barriers in delays. To develop a safe, effective vaccine in under  a year is a testament to the incredible scientific progress we have  seen over the years and the refusal of scientists to surrender to this  terrible virus.   The marshaling of the public sector and the private sector together  by President Trump has really resulted in this vaccine that we have all  been desperately waiting on. The vaccine is a critical step in saving  lives, saving jobs, and saving our economy.   I thank President Trump for his leadership in Operation Warp Speed,  and I thank all the incredible scientists, doctors, medical  professionals, and the others who have helped make history.                            ____________________
