 Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment,  which, make no mistake about it, is the Republican Party's backdoor  effort to create a national abortion ban.   I represent El Paso, Texas, which is home to Fort Bliss, one of our  country's premier military installations. I serve on the House Armed  Services Committee, and I am a mother of two.    My colleagues want to ensure that the enlisted women of the United  States military and their family members who live in Republican States  where abortion has been banned are forced to carry a pregnancy to term,  even in the case of rape and incest.   Unlike my Republican colleagues, I trust women, and unlike my  Republican colleagues, I believe women have a place in the United  States military and that it is our job to support them.
