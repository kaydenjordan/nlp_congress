 Mr. Speaker, firstly, the NRA put a bulletin out to urge  people to vote for this. They said: ``We must ensure that antigun  jurisdictions do not harass travelers.''   Mr. Speaker, that is the purpose of this bill from the NRA, that nine  antigun jurisdictions, State legislatures that have restrictive gun  laws, cannot harass travelers, cannot see that their State has the same  laws that their citizens have from people out of State.   When my friends on the other side talk about being concerned about  the Second Amendment and dedicating their lives to it and seeing that  irresponsible people don't get guns, when we tried to bring a no fly,  no buy law, they weren't for it. They talked about due process.   But have they brought a due process bill to the floor for people who  are on the no-fly list?   No.   People who are on Social Security who can't manage their own affairs,  they passed a law that said they should get guns when they couldn't  before. That is not in keeping with what they are saying.   This bill violates States' rights, puts guns in the hands of people  that States don't want them to have. There are seven States that don't  allow people under 21, unless they are in the military, to have a gun  permit. This Federal law would override those seven States.  [[Page H9696]]    Mr. Speaker, this is a bad law. It is the NRA's law. We should have  had amendments considered in committee, but we didn't because the NRA  didn't want them.                                time  1515
