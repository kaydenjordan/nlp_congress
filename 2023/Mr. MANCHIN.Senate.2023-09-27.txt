 Mr. President, let me thank Senator Schumer for working  with us to come to this conclusion and bring all of us together. I  appreciate it very much. I appreciate Senator McConnell for being a  part of this and joining this bipartisan effort and, of course, my dear  friend Senator Mitt Romney, who has been a part of all of these efforts  that we have worked on together and in putting together this small  token of our appreciation for what we have been able to do. I want to  thank Senator Fetterman also. Senator Fetterman and I have had many  conversations, and he has worked with me to find a solution. I  appreciate that very much. It has truly been a team effort.   You know, for 234 years, every Senator who has had the honor of  serving in this distinguished body has assumed that there were some  basic written rules of decorum and conduct and civility, one of which  was a dress code. The presumed dress code was pretty simple. The male  Senators were required to wear a coat, tie, and slacks or other long  pants while on the floor of the Senate to show the respect that we had  for our constituents back home.   Just after a week ago, we learned that there were not, in fact, any  written rules about the Senators as to what they could and could not  wear on the floor. So Senator Romney and I got together, and we thought  maybe it is time that we finally codified something that has been  precedent, a rule, for 234 years. We drafted this simple, two-page  resolution that will put all of that to bed once and for all by just  codifying a longstanding practice into a Senate rule which makes it  very clear for the Sergeant at Arms to be able to enforce.   I want to thank Senator Romney for working, as always, in a  bipartisan way on so many endeavors. This is just as important, maybe,  as any of them we have ever done.   With that, I turn it over and yield to my good friend Senator Romney.
