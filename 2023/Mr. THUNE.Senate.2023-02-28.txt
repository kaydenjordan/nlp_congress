 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, across the street, this morning, oral  arguments are occurring at the Supreme Court in two challenges to the  President's reckless student loan giveaway.   There are two main parts to the President's scheme. There is the  outright forgiveness of $10,000 in Federal student debt and $20,000 for  Pell grant recipients, which is set to cost American taxpayers  somewhere in the neighborhood of half a trillion dollars. Then there is  the President's radical revamp of the income-driven repayment system,  which would bring the total cost of the President's plan to somewhere  close to a trillion dollars.   The President's new income-driven repayment plan has probably  garnered less attention than his plans for student loan forgiveness,  but his new income-driven repayment program is just as problematic  because it sets up a system in which the majority of Federal borrowers  will never--never--fully repay their loans.   One scholar at the Brookings Institution, a left-of-center think  tank, estimates that ``the vast majority'' of college students will be  eligible for the program and that current and future borrowers enrolled  in the program ``[o]n average . . . might only expect to repay  approximately $0.50 for each dollar they borrow''--``repay  approximately $0.50 for each dollar they borrow.''   The Urban Institute, another left-of-center think tank, estimates  that just 22 percent of those with bachelor's degrees enrolled in the  President's new income-driven repayment program would repay their loans  in full. By contrast, the institute notes that under today's IDR  program, we would expect 59 percent of individuals with bachelor's  degrees to repay their loans in full.   The nonpartisan Penn Wharton Budget Model estimates the cost of the  President's new income-driven repayment program at $333 billion to $361  billion--the range--over 10 years. However, Penn Wharton notes, ``These  estimates do not yet include the effects of students increasing their  borrowing.''   ``These estimates do not yet include the effects of students  increasing their borrowing.''   Needless to say, students are likely to increase their borrowing. It  is common sense. In fact, the Brookings Institution notes that  borrowing is likely to become the preferred means of paying  [[Page S512]]  for college under the President's plan. And, of course, as student  borrowing increases, so does the cost to taxpayers because it is  taxpayers who will be footing the bill for all that student loan money  that is never paid back.   Now, both President Biden's outright student loan forgiveness and his  student loan forgiveness masquerading as income-driven repayment are  going to cost the taxpayers a lot of money. There are the direct costs  of the plan that will be paid for by the Federal Government--in other  words, by taxpayers, including those who never went to college and  those who have already paid off their student loans.   There are the indirect costs, like the fact that the President's  student loan giveaway is likely to prolong our current inflation  crisis. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, where President  Biden's own Treasury Secretary once served on the board, has estimated  that the President's plan would ``meaningfully boost inflation''-- ``meaningfully boost inflation.'' Now, you would think that the  President might have learned his lesson after helping to set off the  worst inflation crisis in 40 years with his massive American Rescue  Plan spending spree but apparently not.   It is important to remember that taxpayers are going to be footing  the bill for student loan cancellation for Americans who, if they  graduated from college, enjoy greater long-term earning potential than  many of the Americans who will be helping to shoulder the burden for  their debts. This isn't a government handout for the needy; this is a  government handout that will disproportionally benefit Americans who  are better off.   Of course, the President's student loan giveaway will do nothing-- nothing--to address the root of the problem, and that is soaring  college costs. In fact, it is likely to make things worse. Faced with  the knowledge that many of their students will never have to fully pay  off their loans, colleges will have zero incentive to cut costs, and  students are likely to feel less pressure to choose a more affordable  college option since there is a good chance they will only have to pay  back part of their student loan debt and might even have it forgiven  entirely.   It is not hard to imagine a future Democrat President deciding that  it is politically expedient to imitate President Biden and just cancel  a huge portion of student loan debt outright, especially since college  costs and college debt will continue to soar under the President's  plan.   Whether President Biden has the legal authority to implement the debt  cancellation he proposed is really questionable. He used a law called  the HEROES Act, drafted to give the President authority to provide  student loan relief in times of war or national emergency and  specifically to provide relief to the large number of soldiers deployed  to the Middle East in the wake of September 11. It was not intended to  provide for widespread student loan forgiveness in a time of peace and  low unemployment.   The President himself raised questions about his authority to forgive  student loans in a 2021 townhall meeting. The former Democrat Speaker  of the House stated plainly--plainly--that the President didn't have  this authority. Between bullying from the far left and the prospect of  gaining votes in the 2022 election, the President went ahead anyway.  And now--now--taxpayers will be saddled with close to an additional  trillion dollars in debt on top of the other reckless spending by the  Biden administration and the Democrat Congress.   It is not just Republicans who have raised serious concerns about the  President's student loan plans. So has the Washington Post and at least  one scholar at the left-of-center Brookings Institution and the  nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, where, as I  said earlier, the President's own Treasury Secretary once served. And  the list goes on.   The President's student loan giveaway is yet another disastrous  economic plan coming from the Biden administration, and if it goes into  effect, it will be the American taxpayers who once again will be paying  the price.   I yield the floor.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
