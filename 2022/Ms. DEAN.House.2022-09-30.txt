 Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, as they were leaving football  practice at Roxborough High School in Philadelphia, five teenage boys  were shot. Four survived the horrific shooting, but 14-year-old Nicolas  Elizalde was killed. God bless him.   Earlier that day, I stood with Representative Scanlon, the Giffords  organization, and the community to advocate for gun violence  prevention. One of the advocates in our audience was a grandmother like  me. Only hours later, it was her grandson, Nicolas, who was gunned down  leaving football practice.   I cannot imagine her pain. Nicolas is the 23rd child to be shot and  murdered in Philadelphia this year.   There is a frightening trend of far too many illicit guns ending up  in the hands of teenagers. This must end.   We need serious solutions, not finger-pointing, to address inner-city  gun violence. We cannot simply out-police loose gun laws that  contribute to teenagers getting their hands on guns and murdering one  another.   So, while this may be the final day of our session, I will not stop  working on this issue. I will be sending a letter to ATF requesting an  increased focus on ending the pipeline of guns to our children's hands.                            ____________________
