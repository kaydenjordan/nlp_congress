 Madam Speaker, as a nurse and cofounder of the Black  Maternal Health Caucus, I am fully committed to advancing policies that  reduce maternal health disparities.   Black women are nearly four times more likely than White women and  more than twice as likely as women of other races to die from  preventable pregnancy-related complications.   This is a national crisis.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro and  Ranking Member   Tom Cole for their  [[Page H5028]]  dedication to addressing maternal health in the fiscal year 2020 Labor- HHS appropriations bill, including through the following investments:  $1.58 billion for the National Institute of Child Health and Human  Development, which supports research that investigates the causes and  interventions for maternal health disparities among Black women; $50  million to initiate research on maternal mortality and disparities in  maternal mortality rates; and a $12 million increase in funding for the  CDC Safe Motherhood and Infant Health program's Maternal Mortality  Review Committees, supporting research to comprehensively assess  maternal deaths and identify opportunities for prevention.   This funding is an important step forward toward achieving optimal  birth outcomes for all families.   Madam Speaker, I thank the Appropriations Committee, and hope my  colleagues will continue to support funding for programs that will  improve the outcomes for women and families.                            ____________________
