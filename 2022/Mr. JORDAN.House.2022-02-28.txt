 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, racial discrimination is wrong; it is un-American; and  it is contrary to our ideals. Our Federal civil rights laws recognize  these facts. The laws are clear, and courts have been consistent that  disparate treatment of one individual when compared to another cannot  be based on race, color, or national origin.   A person also cannot use a pretextual reason as cover for taking a  discriminatory action prohibited by our civil rights laws. The Supreme  Court settled that issue in 1973. As early as 1976, Federal courts held  that discrimination on the basis of a hairstyle associated with a  certain race or national origin may, in fact, constitute racial  discrimination.   In other words, under current law, if a person's hairstyle or hair  texture is associated with a person's race or national origin and is  used as a pretext for discrimination, that conduct is unlawful.   These decades of precedent make the bill that we are debating today  unnecessary and duplicative. In fact, the chairman of the committee  just said that 3 minutes ago.   The problem raised by the Democrats is one solved by enforcing our  existing laws, not by making this conduct illegal for a second time.   The Democrats may have recognized this fact if they had held  legislative hearings on this bill this Congress, but they didn't. So,  the Committee on the Judiciary didn't have the opportunity to hear from  experts about the legislation or how it comports with existing law.  That is just one example of the deficient process that brought this  bill to the floor today.   At markup, Republican members of the Committee on the Judiciary  raised multiple concerns about this bill's potential impact. For  example, schools, employers, and other entities covered by Federal  civil rights laws may have race-neutral policies that everyone must  follow. These policies are sometimes necessary to ensure an employee  can adequately and safely do their job, such as a prohibition on  hairstyles that could prevent a firefighter from properly wearing a  respirator or a helmet.   This bill, however, may jeopardize these policies because it creates  a blanket prohibition on adverse treatment because of certain  hairstyles or hair textures.   These concerns and the Democrats' deficient process caused every  Republican Member to oppose this bill at markup. Instead of working to  address these problems, the Democrats are bringing this bill, which was  reported on a party-line vote, to a vote under suspension of the rules.  The Democrats are prioritizing this legislation, a bill to prohibit  conduct already unlawful under our law, for political messaging  reasons.   This bill does not address any of the serious problems our country  currently faces. Think about the crime problem; the 40-year-high  inflation problem; the 2 million illegal immigrants that have come  across our border in 1 year's time alone; and, of course, not to  mention the situation going on in Ukraine as we speak.   Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to oppose this bill, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, what is Congress doing today? What is the people's  House--under the Democrat majority--what is the House of  Representatives up to today? Passing a bill to prohibit conduct that is  already unlawful under the law. Discrimination based on hairstyle is  already unlawful.   That is what the Congress, what the House of Representatives, is  going to pass today. Think about it. That is the priority today when we  have gone in literally 1 year's time from a secure border to complete  chaos. Two million illegal crossings in 1 year on our border. In fact,  we don't really have a border.   We have gone from safe streets to record crime in every major urban  area in 1 year's time. They are focused on a bill to make conduct that  is already unlawful, unlawful again, I guess.   We went from energy independence to the spectacle of the President of  the United States begging OPEC to increase production. We have gone  from stable prices to a 40-year high inflation rate, and Democrats are  focused on this bill.   This past summer we had the debacle that was the exit from  Afghanistan. As we speak, the Ukrainian people are fighting for their  lives, and Democrats are passing a bill to prohibit conduct already  unlawful under Federal law, a bill that says you can't discriminate  based on hairstyle, which is already unlawful.   We have had a year now where Democrats attack every liberty we enjoy  under the First Amendment, every single one. There are still some  locations in America where a full congregation cannot meet on a Sunday  morning. There are some places where you still can't assemble and can't  petition.   The Democrats have kept the Capitol closed to the American people,  their own darn Capitol. How are you supposed to come in and petition  your Member to redress your grievances if you are not even allowed in  your Capitol that your tax dollars pay for? Of course, we know what  they have done to freedom of speech and the attacks there. Their focus  today is on this bill.    Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote. Let's focus on the issues that I  think the vast majority of the American people want us to focus on like  crime, like the 40-year high inflation rate, like the border problem,  and like the fact that we were an energy independent country just a few  months back. Let's focus on those issues.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the bill before us today recalls a dark period in our  Nation's history. Lynching is an especially horrible act of violence.  It was and is as wrong as wrong can be.   Last century, lynchings were a common atrocity committed by the Ku  Klux Klan against the Black community. From the 1880s to the 1960s,  approximately 4,743 individuals were lynched in the United States, of  whom 3,400 victims were African American.   The bill before us today will make lynching a hate crime under the  Federal code. There should be no doubt that our Nation condemns  lynching in the strongest possible terms, which is why I was surprised  that the bill reported out of committee minimized the importance of the  gravity of the crime of lynching. I am pleased, however, that the  majority is bringing this version to the floor rather than the text  reported out of committee.   The bill reported out of committee simply criminalized conspiracies  to commit any type of hate crime no matter how insignificant the  injury. The bill before us today criminalizes a conspiracy if death or  serious bodily injury occurs.   Madam Speaker, I hope we can all stand with one voice and condemn the  atrocity of lynching. I urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would just say that I hope we do have a  unanimous vote and support this good piece of legislation, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
