 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California for  yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 3144, a bill to designate the  United States Postal Service Facility located at 8520 Michigan Avenue  in Whittier, California, as the Jose Ramos Post Office Building.   Jose Guadalupe Ramos was born September 17, 1948, in East Los  Angeles. He enlisted in the Army in 1965, while he was a sophomore at  Garfield High School.   Mr. Ramos served this country in Vietnam as an Army combat medic,  often risking his own life caring for others. Mr. Ramos was wounded in  Vietnam and was awarded the Purple Heart.   Upon returning home, he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress  disorder, yet his passion and commitment to our country and his fellow  servicemembers didn't end.   Many of our veterans at the time found themselves caught in and  confused by the crossfire of the public debate over the war in Vietnam.  At times, some faced sharp criticism and isolation. Mr. Ramos saw this  and decided that he was going to do something about it.   He dedicated his time delivering a message of his experience and  those of his fellow veterans to all those who would listen, traveling  to universities, schools, and prisons to carry this message.   He undertook a grueling cross-country bicycle trek to draw attention  to and advocate for the long overdue ``welcome home'' that Vietnam  veterans never received.                                time  1530    I was honored to work with Mr. Ramos and the Welcome Home Vietnam  Veterans organization that he helped found. At his urging, I used the  resources of my office to advocate for a national Welcome Home Vietnam  Veterans Day. In our years of working together in this cause, I had a  true friend and a partner in that effort. Mr. Ramos' passion inspired  many.  [[Page H8173]]    The memories of what he endured in service to our country remained  with him throughout his life. At times, they presented obstacles.  However, he cherished the time spent with grandchildren, his  participation in religious pilgrimages, and enjoying life's simple  pleasures, like the sunrise and sunset of each passing day.   We lost Jose Ramos in 2017 to pancreatic cancer, a loss not only for  his wife, Sylvia, his children, and grandchildren, his loss also left a  hole in our community in Whittier. Renaming the Whittier Post Office in  his honor is a fitting tribute to Jose Ramos and a very small token of  gratitude from a grateful nation for his service.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
