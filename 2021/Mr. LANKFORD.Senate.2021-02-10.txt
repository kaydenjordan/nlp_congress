 Thank you.   Now, while this was going on, Officer Eugene Goodman responded to the  initial breach. You all may have seen footage of Officer Goodman  previously, but there is more to his heroic story. In this security  footage, you can see Officer Goodman running to respond to the initial  breach.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   Officer Goodman passes Senator Mitt Romney and directs him to turn  around in order to get to safety. On the first floor, just beneath  them, the mob had already started to search for the Senate Chamber.   Officer Goodman made his way down to the first floor, where he  encountered the same insurrectionists we just saw--watched--breach the  Capitol. In this video, we can see the rioters surge toward Officer  Goodman. Recall that the rioters are in red, and Officer Goodman, in  this model, is in blue. Watch Officer Goodman, who backs up the stairs.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         (People chanting: ``USA.'')        Unidentified Speaker. That's my muffin. I paid for that.        Unidentified Speaker. You work for us.        Unidentified Speaker. Where is the meeting at?        Unidentified Speaker. Hey, where do they count the fucking       votes?        Unidentified Speaker. Hey! Hey!        Unidentified Speaker. Do it! Do it!        Unidentified Speaker. Where are they counting the votes?       Where are they counting the votes?        Unidentified Speaker. Right there. Hey.        Unidentified Speaker. These people. These people. These       people. We have no weapons. We have no fucking weapons.        Unidentified Speaker. No, no.        Unidentified Speaker. Motherfucker.    Although they were shouting that they did not have any weapons, we  know from the earlier video that that is not true. The second assailant  through that breach was the one carrying a metal baseball bat. We know  there were other weapons there that day.   Did you hear the other shouts?         We're here for you. He's one person, we're thousands.    And--         Where do they count the votes?    They were coming at the urging of Donald Trump to keep Congress--a  separate branch of government--from certifying the results of a  Presidential election.   As the rioters reached the top of the stairs, they were within 100  feet of where the Vice President was sheltering with his family. And  they were just feet away from one of the doors to this Chamber, where  many of you remained at that time.   I also want to show you a different angle from the security footage  of Officer Goodman's acts. This video is on the second floor of the  Senate wing of the Capitol. The red dot, as you recall, represents the  insurrectionists. The blue dot is Officer Goodman, who led the mob away  from the Chamber, just minutes earlier.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   On the left-hand side of the video, just inside the hallway is the  door to  [[Page S635]]  the Senate Chamber. And watch how Officer Goodman provoked the rioters  and purposefully draws them away from the door to the Senate Chamber  and toward the other officers waiting down the hall.   The rioter seen carrying a baseball bat in this video is the same one  we saw moments ago breaching the window on the first floor.   While all of this was going on, Vice President Pence was still in the  room near the Senate Chamber. It was not until 2:26 that he was  evacuated to a secure location. This next security video shows that  evacuation.   His movements are depicted by the orange dot in our model. The red  and blue dots represent the location where the mob and Officer Goodman  were and where Officer Goodman led the mob away from the Chamber just  moments ago.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   You can see Vice President Pence and his family quickly moved down  the stairs. The Vice President turns around briefly as he is headed  down.   (Video presentation of 1-6-2021.)   As Pence was being evacuated, rioters started to spread throughout  the Capitol. Those inside helped other rioters break in through doors  in several locations around this entire building. And the mob was  looking for Vice President Pence because of his patriotism, because the  Vice President had refused to do what the President demanded and  overturn the election results.   During the assault on the Capitol, extremists reportedly coordinated  online and discussed how they could hunt down the Vice President.   Journalists in the Capitol reported they heard rioters say they were  looking for Pence in order to execute him.   Trump's supporters had erected a gallows on the lawn in front of the  Capitol Building. Another group of rioters chanted: ``Hang Mike  Pence,'' as they stood in the open door of the Capitol Building.   You can hear the security alarm through the door in the background.  And you can hear the mob calling for the death of the Vice President of  the United States.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         (People chanting: ``Hang Mike Pence.'')    This wasn't an isolated area or incident where that was being told,  where that was being said. It was going on everywhere.   Here is another example of the crowd outside yelling: ``Bring out  Pence, bring him out.''         (People chanting: ``Bring him out.'')        (People chanting: ``Bring out Pence.'')    After President Trump had primed his followers for months and  inflamed the rally-goers that morning, it is no wonder that the Vice  President of the United States was the target of their wrath after  Pence refused to overturn the election results.   Listen to this man explain.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Unidentified Speaker. While Congress, cowards, hid in       their--inside, and were escorted away because of fear of the       people. Of course they are cowards. They can't face the       people. They can't do the right thing. Pence lied to us. He       is a total treasonous pig. And his name will be mud forever.       Now the real battle begins. And it looks like the American       people are very pissed. So good luck with that. Peace out.    ``Peace out.''   Several insurrectionists described wha they had planned to do if they  encountered the Vice President or other lawmakers. One of them, Dominic  Pezzola, also known as Spaz, is a member of the Proud Boys, as we  discussed. Pezzola came to the Capitol on January 6 with deadly  intentions. He commandeered a Capitol Police shield, used it to smash a  glass window, entered the Capitol, and paved the way for dozens of  insurrectionists.    As you recall from an earlier video, Pezzola was one of the first  wave of rioters to breach the building. On the left, you can see a  screen shot from the video of the break-in we showed earlier. And on  the right, you can see Pezzola in the mob chase Capitol Police Officer  Eugene Goodman through the building. Pezzola is the man in the center  of the photo with the gray beard.   Pezzola has since been charged with eight Federal crimes for his  conduct related to January 6. According to an FBI Agent's affidavit  submitted to the court, the group that was with him during the sack of  the Capitol confirmed that they were out to murder ``anyone they got  their hands on.''   Here is what the FBI said:         Other members of the group talked about things they had       done that day, and they said that anyone they got their hands       on they would have killed, including Nancy Pelosi.    And, I quote:         [T]hey would have killed [Vice President] Mike Pence if       given the chance.    They were talking about assassinating the Vice President of the  United States. During the course of the attack, the Vice President  never left the Capitol, remained locked down with his family--with his  family--inside the building. Remember that as you think about these  images and the sounds of the attack.   The Vice President, our second in command, was always at the center  of it. Vice President Pence was threatened with death by the  President's supporters because he rejected President Trump's demand  that he overturn the election.   The mob also went after the Speaker of the House, who alongside the  Vice President, was presiding over the joint session of the  certification in the House Chamber.   The chilling evidence shows that on January 6, armed and organized  insurrectionists trained their sights on Speaker Pelosi. They sought  out the Speaker on the floor and in her office, publicly declared their  intent to harm or kill her, ransacked her office, and terrorized her  staff. And they did it because Donald Trump sent them on this mission.   As the insurrectionists got closer, Capitol Police rushed the Speaker  from the House floor at 2:15 p.m., mere minutes after the Capitol was  first breached. They recognized immediately that she was in danger. The  Speaker was not just rushed from the floor; the Capitol Police deemed  the threat so dangerous that they evacuated her entirely from the  Capitol Complex, rushing her to a secure offsite location.   The insurrectionists' intent to murder the Speaker of the House is  well documented in charging documents that are now available. We know  from the rioters themselves that if they had found Speaker Pelosi, they  would have killed her.   I have already discussed Proud Boys member Dominic Pezzola, who has  since been charged with eight Federal crimes for his conduct on January  6. As you will recall, according to the FBI agent's affidavit submitted  to the court, the group he attacked the Capitol with confirmed that  ``anyone they got their hands on they would have killed, including  Nancy Pelosi.''   William Calhoun, a lawyer, from Georgia, also participated in the  insurrection that day. And he, too, has been charged for his actions.  This insurrectionist detailed his criminal activity at the Capitol  online. Calhoun wrote about his involvement on his own Facebook page.   Here is the post. Calhoun stated:         And get this--the first of us who got upstairs kicked in       Nancy Pelosi's door and pushed down the hall towards her       inner sanctum, the mob howling with rage--Crazy Nancy       probably would have been torn into little pieces, but she was       nowhere to be seen.        ``Crazy Nancy''--that is Trump's nickname for the Speaker       of the House. Then he explains that he and his group only       abandoned their claim to the Speaker's office when ``a SWAT       team showed up.''    He writes:         Then a SWAT team showed and we retreated back to the       rotunda and continued our hostile takeover of the Capitol       Building.    ``Retreated,'' ``hostile takeover.'' He is using military terms for  this attack.   The mob continued to look for Nancy Pelosi throughout the time they  occupied the Capitol, including invading her offices.   Watch now how the mob searches for Speaker Pelosi's office, which is  marked in red, and the House Chamber itself.   (Text of video presentation of 1-6-2021.)         Unidentified Speaker. Where are you, Nancy? We are looking       for you?        Unidentified Speaker. Nancy! Oh, Nancy! Nancy! Where are       you, Nancy?    During the siege, the Speaker's staff took cover in her office,  hiding in fear for their lives for hours, as rioters broke in and  ransacked her office.  [[Page S636]]    As the rioters were breaking into the Capitol, her staff retreated  into an interior room. Eight of them gathered in a conference room.  About the same time, Capitol Police announced the Capitol had been  breached, Speaker Pelosi's staff heeded the call to shelter in place.   On our model, you can see the rioters in the Rotunda in red and the  Speaker's office, again, in orange   This is a security video, so there is no sound.   (Video presentation.)   As you can see, the staff moves from their offices through the halls  and then enters a door on the right-hand side. That is the outer door  of a conference room, which also has an inner door that they barricaded  with furniture.   The staff then hid under a conference room table in that inner room.  This is the last staffer going in and then barricading themselves  inside the inner office.   After just 7 minutes of them barricading themselves and the last  staffer entering the door on the right, a group of rioters entered the  hallway outside and, once inside, the rioters have free rein in the  Speaker of the House's offices.   In this security video, pay attention to the door that we saw those  staffers leaning into and going into.   (Video presentation.)   One of the rioters, you can see, is throwing his body against the  door three times until he breaks open that outer door. Luckily, when  faced with the inner door, he moves on. Another rioter later tried  unsuccessfully to break through that inner door. At this point, the mob  had already broken into the Speaker's formal conference room that is in  the back of the hall at the top of the video.   I want to play some audio we have of the Speaker's staff with the  rioters at the door that day. You can hear the terror in their voices  as they describe what is happening to them as they are barricaded in  that conference room. Please listen carefully because the staffer is  whispering into a phone as he hides from the rioters that are outside  the door.   (Text of video presentation.)         Unidentified Speaker. They're in the hall. We need the       Capitol Police to come into the hallway. They're pounding on       doors trying to find her now.    You can hear the pounding in the background as that staffer is  speaking. One of those staffers explained later that they could hear  the mob going through her offices, breaking down the door and yelling:  Where are you, Nancy?   The mob also pillaged and vandalized the Speaker's office and  documented their crimes on social media. They stole objects, desecrated  the office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United  States.   As you can see in these photos, rioters broke down a door. They also  shattered a mirror. At 2:50 p.m., several rioters, including Richard  ``Bigo'' Barnett, entered Speaker Pelosi's office. The world is all now  too familiar with the images from these slides. If you look closely,  however, at the now-infamous pictures of Barnett with his feet on the  desk, you might see something that you didn't notice previously. Here  is a better look. As this photo highlights, he is carrying a stun gun  tucked into his waistband. The FBI identified the device as a 950,000- volt stun gun walking stick. The weapon could have caused serious pain  and incapacitated anyone Barnett had used it against.   Richard Barnett bragged about his actions. He was proud of the way he  desecrated the Speaker of the House's office. He left a note:         WE WILL NOT BACK DOWN.    Here is Barnett in his own words.   (Text of video presentation.)
