 Madam Speaker, 1 month ago today, my  community of Buffalo was targeted by a racist mass shooter. The lasting  toll and trauma of gun violence is evident and perhaps most compelling  through the words of Buffalo students in Ms. O'Rourke's class.   Taniya wrote, ``I want to be able to go to school and earn my  education without the fear of possibly not making it back home because  of the color of my skin.''   NasZair describes feeling vulnerable because he is Black and worries,  ``Will my family be safe when we go to the supermarkets?''   Journey says, ``I am 13 years old. It is unfair for a middle schooler  to regularly think about these things.'' She asks, ``What will you do  and the government do to stop these attacks?''   Brianna pleads, ``I want someone to do something. I want the  government to do their job. Too many mass shootings happened in such a  small amount of time.''   For students and families in Buffalo and other communities forever  changed by mass shootings, now is the time for Congress to do its job  and take action to end gun violence.                            ____________________
