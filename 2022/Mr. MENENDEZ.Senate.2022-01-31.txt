This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of a Major Non-NATO Ally that continues to be an       important strategic partner in the Middle East.        The proposed sale will improve Egypt's capability to meet       current and future threats by providing airlift support for       its forces by moving supplies, equipment, and people, thus       strengthening its capacity in the security and humanitarian       arena. This airlift capability would assist with border       security, the interdiction of known terrorist elements, rapid       reaction to internal security threats, and humanitarian aid.       Egypt also intends to utilize these aircraft for maritime       patrol missions and search and rescue missions in the region.       Egypt, which already operates a mix of legacy C-130s, will       have no difficulty absorbing these aircraft and services into       its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin       Aeronautics Company in Marietta, GA. There are no known       offsets proposed in conjunction with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       assignment of two (2) contracted Field Service       Representatives (FSR) and one (1) Logistic Service       Representative (LSR) for a period of three (3) years. The       FSRs and LSR will have expertise in airframe, avionics/      electrical, propulsion systems, ground maintenance systems,       and logistics support.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            transmittal no. 21-26       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(l) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The C-130J-30 8.1 Super Hercules aircraft, including the       Rolls Royce AE2100D turboprop engines, is a military airlift       aircraft that performs primarily the tactical portion of the       airlift mission. The aircraft is  [[Page S408]]       capable of operating from rough, dirt strips and is the prime       transport for air-dropping troops and equipment into hostile       areas. The C-130J improvements over the C130E include       improved maximum speed, climb time, cruising altitude, and       range. The C-130J has 55 feet of cargo compartment length, an       additional 15 feet over the original ``short'' aircraft.        2. The Rolls Royce AE1200D turboprop engine is a two-stage,       air cooled, vatable speed gas generator turbine, and turbo-      prop engine. Each engine contains a General Electrics (GE)       Dowty R391 composite propeller installed for ground/flight       operations. The engine is capable of inflight (engine core)       wind milling and air starts up to 25,000 feet and airspeeds       between 0.43 Mach and 0.64 Mach.        3. The Embedded Global Positioning System (GPS) Inertial       Navigational System (INS) (GPS/INS) (EGI) with GPS Security       Devices is a highly accurate inertial navigation system has       embedded GPS for blended INS/GPS, free-inertial, and GPS-only       solutions. Classified elements include Selective Availability       Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) for decryption of precision GPS       signals.        4. The Multifunctional Information Distribution System--Low       Volume Terminal Block Upgrade Two (MIDS-LVT BU2) is an       advanced command, control, communications, computing and       intelligence (C4I) system incorporating high-capacity, jam-      resistant, digital communication links for exchange of near       real-time tactical information, including both data and       voice, among air, ground, and sea elements.        5. The AN/APX-119 Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) is a       system that responds to interrogating signals to assist in       identification, location, and terrain avoidance.        6. The AN/AAR-47 Missile Approach Warning System is an       aircraft passive MWS designed for detection of incoming       surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles on transport and       helicopter aircraft. The system detects, identifies, and       displays potential threats. The AN/AAR-47 warns of missile       approach by detecting radiation associated with the rocket       motor and automatically initiates flare ejection.        7. The AN/ALE-47 Countermeasure Dispensing System (CMDS) is       an integrated, threat-adaptive, software-programmable       dispensing system capable of dispensing chaff, flares, and       active radio frequency expendables. The threats countered by       the CMDS include radar-directed anti-aircraft artillery,       radar command-guided missiles, radar homing guided missiles,       and infrared guided missiles. The system is internally       mounted and may be operated as a stand-alone system or may be       integrated with other on-board EW and avionics systems. The       AN/ALE-47 uses threat data received over the aircraft       interfaces to assess the threat situation and to determine a       response. Expendable routines tailored to the immediate       aircraft and threat environment may be dispensed using one of       four operational modes.        8. The AN/ALR-56 Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) continuously       detects and intercepts RF signals in certain frequency ranges       and analyzes and separates threat signals from non-threat       signals. It contributes to full-dimensional protection by       providing individual aircraft probability of survival through       improved aircrew situational awareness of the radar guided       threat environment. The ALR56M is designed to provide       improved performance in a dense signal environment and       improved detection of modem threats signals.        9. The AN/AAQ-22 (STAR SAFIRE 380) is a gyro-stabilized,       multi-spectral Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) system       configured to operate simultaneously in multiple bands       including the visible, near-IR and mid-wave IR bands. The       system consists of an externally-mounted turret sensor unit       and internally-mounted central electronics unit and system       control unit. Images will be displayed in the aircraft real-      time and recorded for subsequent ground analysis.        10. The highest level of classification of defense       articles, components, and services included in this potential       sale is SECRET.        11. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        12. A determination has been made that Egypt can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        13. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Egypt.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.
