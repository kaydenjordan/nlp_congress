The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). The gentleman from Texas  is recognized for 1 hour.    Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), my  friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis), my  friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.                                time  1230     Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule. It  is a fair rule that enables thoughts and ideas from both sides of the  aisle to be considered on the House floor today. It enables us to  proceed with the work that the American people have sent us here to  accomplish. It is of great measure of the work that we are doing today.  We had an extensive and long committee hearing at the Committee on  Rules yesterday with witnesses from both sides of the aisle,  Republicans and Democrats, who felt strongly about the issues and ideas  that were before them and the ideas which will be presented on the  floor of the House of Representatives today, the underpinning of which  are entitled to give the American people a better shot at a better life  not only from a business perspective, economic development, but also  the creation of jobs in the United States of America.   Madam Speaker, I also rise in support of the underlying legislation  contained in this rule. These bipartisan initiatives will enhance  transparency, provide for a check on Federal agencies, and I believe  help create a better process in the Federal Government for the people  we serve, which are the people of this great Nation.   Congress enacted the Administrative Procedure Act in 1946 to ensure  that the public had an opportunity to provide expertise, opinions, and  other comments during the rulemaking process that takes place in the  administration. It was designed to provide guarantees of due process in  administrative procedures for self-governing American citizens who have  to live under these rules that are promulgated by those unelected and  not necessarily known by the American people.   The Administrative Procedure Act, known as the APA, as it is commonly  referred to, was designed to require agencies to keep the public  informed of the information and ideas, procedures, and rules, and to  provide a means for public participation in the rulemaking process that  would take place here in Washington, D.C.   Unfortunately, as is too often the case, Federal bureaucrats over  years and previous administrations have exploited the broad language of  the Administrative Procedure Act to focus the rulemaking process solely  for special interest reasons. Sometimes it is groups, sometimes it is  ideas, and sometimes it is against the voices of the average American  who wishes to participate in this process. This clearly was not the  APA's legislative intent and reflects yet another encroachment on  Congress' Article I powers which are enshrined in the United States  Constitution.   This shift away from the intent of the Administrative Procedure Act,  known as the APA, has meant that most agency deliberations are carried  out without a record or even a public review of those decisions that  are made. Additionally, and possibly more troubling, agencies have  undermined the purpose and the spirit of the notice-and-comment process  by actively campaigning in support of their ideas using government  resources and processes to that advantage.   The clearest example of this abuse can be found recently and  numerously at the Environmental Protection Agency, known as the EPA.  After issuing the waters of the United States notice of proposed  rulemaking, the EPA undertook a public campaign utilizing social media  platforms to solicit support for what was, at the time, a promulgated  rule. Following this abuse, the GAO issued a report finding that the  EPA violated propaganda and anti-lobbying provisions concerning the use  of their fiscal year 2014 and 2015 appropriations.   The Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017 helps ensure transparency in the  rulemaking process by prohibiting Federal agencies from anonymously  issuing statements for propaganda purposes, in other words, an agency  lobbying for itself, its ideas, as opposed to the public comment  period, final rulemaking, and then issues and ideas being discussed  with and by the people of the country. Specifically, H.R. 1004 requires  agencies to make available online information about public  communications on pending regulatory actions.   Further, H.R. 1004 requires that agencies ``expressly disclose that  the Executive agency is the source of the information to the intended  recipients.''   Why is this important?   This is important because too many times information is provided  without the basis of the facts behind it. It is opinion, Mr. Speaker.  When members of the public see information that is provided, a source  should be behind that information.   Further, H.R. 1004 prohibits agencies from ``soliciting support for  or promoting . . . pending agency regulatory action.'' A simple concept  of transparency and, I believe, professionalism that both sides of the  aisle should not only demand, but also welcome from any executive  agency, regardless of who is in the White House. It is in the best  interest of the American public, and transparency and honesty related  to that should be above reproach. Unfortunately, this has also not been  the instance, as there are abuses and overreach by Federal agencies and  unelected bureaucrats.   Presidents of both parties have required a centralized review of  regulations since the 1970s. This has largely been handled by the  Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, or OIRA, as it is  commonly referred to. Every President since President Ronald Reagan has  required a centralized review of regulations at OIRA so that an agency  can do cost-benefit analysis of regulatory actions, which means there  is a centralized process for the administration to look at what they  do.   In 1993, President Bill Clinton put into place Executive Order 12866  to designate OIRA as the repository of expertise concerning regulatory  issues. The executive order limited OIRA's review of regulations to  only significant rules changes, those that have an annual effect on the  economy of $100 million or more. This office is responsible for  reviewing the regulatory actions at both the proposed and final  rulemaking stages. Unfortunately, lately, agencies have blatantly  ignored the principles of the executive order from President Clinton,  Executive Order 12866, and other governing authorities, including those  requiring State, local, and tribal consultation in the rulemaking  process have been ignored.    According to a policy center at George Mason University, agencies  usually satisfy 60 percent or less of the requirements called for in  the regulatory analysis, meaning that certain times we have found the  executive branch did not even follow the well-known processes that are  there to protect the people who they are trying to  [[Page H1405]]  provide services to. Mr. Speaker, we believe that is partially why we  are here today, to clarify and correct these problems.   For example, between 2000 and 2013, 98 percent of the Environmental  Protection Agency's final rules contained no estimated compliance  costs. That means that the agency chose not to follow the process that  is prescribed by the executive order. Additionally, the EPA routinely  justifies its regulatory activities by claiming benefits from matters  unrelated to the underlying legislation. Mr. Speaker, you can well see  why there is consternation not only among people in the United States,  but uncertainty with business that is attempting to follow the well- understood rules and regulations and the processes that go therein only  to find out that our government chooses not to follow the rules and  regulations that they should be following.   H.R. 1009 codifies the requirement for OIRA to conduct a review of  significant regulations to ensure the regulations are consistent with  applicable law and the principles set forth in the executive order. It  also establishes new transparency measures such as requiring increased  disclosure when extending review time, explanations about regulations  that are dropped from the unified agenda, and a redline of changes that  agencies make to regulations while it is under review by OIRA.   OIRA review is important to provide a double check on agencies to  ensure not only compliance with the law, but the well-understood  proposals that are made by agencies and the processes that they expect  to understand in that process. That is why the main tenets of the  underlying legislation have been supported by Presidents in the past,  Members of Congress in the past, and even the judiciary that should  expect that processes and procedures are followed properly.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a note, if I can, and add into the  Record a Statement of Administration Policy that came from one of our  former colleagues, now the Director of the OMB, the Honorable Mick  Mulvaney. Mr. Mulvaney, in his new duties as the Director of the OMB,  provided his first Statement of Administration Policy. It is concerning  exactly the act that we are speaking about. I would like to  congratulate the young Director of the OMB for his ascension to not  only an important role, but helping the United States Congress to  clarify for the American people that which is in their best interest.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                     Statement of Administration Policy   H.R. 998--Searching for and Cutting Regulations that are Unnecessarily                           Burdensome (SCRUB) Act                  (Rep. Smith, R-MO, and three cosponsors)                 H.R. 1004--Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017                 (Rep. Walberg, R-MI, and eight cosponsors)           H.R. 1009--OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act                 (Rep. Mitchell, R-MI, and four cosponsors)         The Administration is committed to reducing regulatory       burden on all Americans. On January 30, 2017, President Trump       signed Executive Order 13771, Reducing Regulation and       Controlling Regulatory Costs, which provides for repeal of       two regulations for every new one issued. This historic step       accelerates the retrospective review process to make common-      sense reforms to regulations across the Federal Government.       Legislation is helpful where it amends agencies' regulatory       processes to ensure they are transparent, and appropriately       balance costs and benefits.        Each of these bills would address different aspects of the       regulatory process. The SCRUB Act, H.R. 998, addresses the       numerous outdated, duplicative, and otherwise unnecessary       regulations that have accumulated throughout government. The       Regulatory Integrity Act of 2017, H.R. 1004, would restrict       the use of agency funds to advocate on behalf of regulations,       and the OIRA Insight, Reform, and Accountability Act, H.R.       1009, would codify specific executive branch regulatory       review procedures.        The Administration supports the SCRUB Act, the Regulatory       Integrity Act, and the OIRA Insight, Reform, and       Accountability Act. The Administration looks forward to       working with the Congress on technical and other amendments       to these bills.        The Administration appreciates the efforts of the Congress       to rationalize the regulatory system and looks forward to       continuing to work together to reform the regulatory process.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the gentleman's thoughtful observations on this rule and  on the bills. I will acknowledge that yesterday at the Rules Committee  there was a vigorous discussion--I thought, professional on both  sides--where there was an idea about the intent of this bill and what  it would, in essence, lay off on the administration, or any  administration, in trying to make sure that they complied with the law.   I will tell you that our Appropriations chairman, as well as the  Appropriations Committee, would be able to deal effectively with this  if they believed they needed more money in order to accomplish these  efforts. But I think that transparency is an important issue, and I  think that our authorizing and appropriating committees will understand  that, as they deal with agencies, a better dialogue, whether it be  Republican or Democrat in office, needs to be able to deal with  Congress, provide us information, provide the American people with  information, and be forthright about the decisions that they are going  to make.   I think that the new Director of the OMB, the Honorable Mick  Mulvaney, responded in his advice back--meaning the statement of  administrative policy that directly took on this issue--that he looked  forward to not only working with Congress on their needs, but also  complying with the spirit of the law. I believe, Mr. Speaker, that what  we are doing today is providing information to a brand-new  administration and saying to a brand-new administration that it is okay  if you have your ideas about those issues that you would wish to take  up, but you have to be forthright about what you are doing. You have to  provide information not only to Congress, but the American people; and  when you propose changes or rules, you have to be honest and forthright  in doing that.   It may be a little bit more money, but this Congress will stand  behind this. And I believe that the new Trump administration, at least  through my conversations with our new President and the head of OMB,  they intend for across the government, across a new administration to  attempt to be forthright and direct about what they are doing and why  we are doing it. Now, more than ever, whether you are a Republican or  Democrat or not--you could be a person back home--you are entitled to  try and clarify and ask information. That is what we are doing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Newhouse), a member of the Rules Committee, who served his State  honorably as their agriculture commissioner.  [[Page H1407]]         Mr. Speaker, as a matter of fact, I do not have  additional speakers. I would wish to not only close myself, but to  present a little bit more information. I would allow the gentleman, if  he were prepared to offer his close, I would do the same.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the debate today has been fair and above board. I want  to congratulate and thank the gentleman from Colorado not only for his  service on the Rules Committee, but his service today in annunciating  not just his party's policies and ideas on this, but also his own, as  he brings a vast business experience not only to Congress and to the  Rules Committee, but to serve the people of his congressional district.   However, with that said, Mr. Speaker, I think that this will be  overwhelming success on a bipartisan basis today, and the reason why  is, because what we are doing is in the best interest of the American  people.   We are doing this because the American people want and need an  opportunity, as they petition their government, to know that they were  heard, for their issues and ideas to be seen. And I would think now  more than ever, especially if it were a prior administration, we would  be accused of trying to jam down their throats something that we saw  that was trying to put an undue burden on another administration. But,  in fact, we are not.   And so the thoughts and ideas today should be--regardless of the  administration, regardless whether you completely agree, or somewhat  disagree,  [[Page H1408]]  we would want that government, that agency to be able to operate with  the confidence of the American people. And that means that they are not  there for their own purposes, or special interests, or for them to skew  facts or information that might be provided to the American people,  but, in fact, were opinions as opposed to something that was reasonably  gained as a result of a scientific fact or information that was based  on facts of the case.   Mr. Speaker, the regulatory state in this country has grown  exponentially and, really, to unprecedented levels. Unelected  bureaucrats have exceeded their authority, they are creating  regulations, they are negatively impacting the marketplace, which  causes a problem for me back home, and Members of Congress back home,  as businesses talk about following rules and regulations rather than  the marketplace, and trying to add employees and to turn the cash  register.   Accordingly, the American Action Forum, when totaling all available  regulatory costs reported by executive agencies, the Obama  administration imposed more than $600 billion in regulatory costs from  2009 to 2014. That is $600 billion worth of regulatory costs imposed on  the American people by unelected bureaucrats that have increasingly  become unaccountable, not only to economic growth, but also to the  American people, and I believe to Congress.   Other studies have produced the same conclusion and it is this: that  runaway regulations have a disastrous effect on the United States  economy, impacting not only job creation, but also the effective  opportunity for the free enterprise system to exist.   Federal agencies should exist to serve the American people. And as  such, they should heed and respect their views and comments, while  staying within the parameters of laws passed by lawmakers or ensuring  the rulemaking process is transparent and free of propaganda.   Mr. Speaker, we appreciate you allowing us time to debate this on  behalf of the American people today. This rule and the underlying  legislation will provide an important check on the regulatory state  that we find exists today in the United States, and to return  transparency, responsiveness, and, I believe, honest dignity to the  American people that we serve, for this overreaching process. I urge my  colleagues to support this rule and the underlying legislation.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 156 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       356) to establish the National Commission on Foreign       Interference in the 2016 Election. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. After       general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment       under the five-minute rule. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall       rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as       may have been adopted. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of       the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution       on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House       shall, immediately after the third daily order of business       under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the       Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 356.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous  question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, this morning the Rules Committee issued  announcements outlining the process for amendments for three measures  likely to be on the floor next week.   An amendment deadline has been set for Monday, March 6, at 3 p.m. for  H.R. 725, the Innocent Party Protection Act. And a deadline has been  set for Tuesday, March 7, at 10 a.m. for H.R. 720, the Lawsuit Abuse  Reduction Act; and H.R. 985, the Fairness in Class Action Litigation  Act.   The text of these measures is available at the Rules Committee  website, and feel free to contact me or my staff with any questions.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.
