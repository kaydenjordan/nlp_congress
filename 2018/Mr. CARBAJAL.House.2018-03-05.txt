 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Shimkus for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago, Pacific Gas and Electric Company announced  its  [[Page H1359]]  decision not to relicense the two nuclear reactors at the Diablo Canyon  Power Plant in San Luis Obispo County. The plant has been a key  economic engine in my district, employing around 1,500 people and  powering more than 1.7 million homes in central and northern  California.   As our community works together to mitigate the economic impacts of  this closure, I am committed to helping secure the central coast's  dominance as a hub for renewable energy development. That is why I am  introducing legislation later this month that creates renewable energy  incentives to offset the loss of jobs and revenue resulting from the  Diablo Canyon closure.   In addition to economic stability, our community also needs certainty  of responsible management and safe storage of nuclear waste after the  plant's closure. The Diablo Canyon Power Plant was built against a  seaside cliff near Avila Beach, where it was discovered that its  reactors are in proximity to earthquake fault lines. Without a long- term solution, Diablo Canyon would become a de facto storage facility  for radioactive nuclear waste and would hinder our ability to repurpose  any of the scenic coastline where the power plant currently sits.   Currently, spent nuclear fuel sits across 39 States in 121  communities, including San Luis Obispo County.                                time  1945    We need a permanent geologic repository to store waste that will last  far beyond our lifetimes. Congress must establish responsible interim  storage solutions, while continuing to work towards establishing a safe  and secure national repository for spent fuel.   H.R. 3053 is a good bipartisan solution to establish a process and  outline next steps for interim and permanent storage solutions. With  the impending decommissioning of Diablo Canyon, it is vital that we act  to find a storage solution. I will continue to work to grow business in  our area, remove spent fuel safely, and keep our communities safe and  thriving as the Diablo Canyon decommissioning moves forward.
