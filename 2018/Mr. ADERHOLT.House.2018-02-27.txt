 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Illinois  (Mr. Hultgren) for arranging this opportunity for us to remember the  life and legacy of Dr. Billy Graham, although I have to say it is not  an easy task to find words that sum up his life, not because Billy  Graham is not worthy, but because words and a few sentences seem  incapable of describing a life that had such a large impact on,  literally, the entire world.   I had the great opportunity to meet Dr. Graham just a few feet from  here several years ago at one of the many Presidential inaugurations he  attended.                                time  1830    While I only had that chance to meet him one time, Billy Graham was  one of those people whom you felt like you knew. His honesty and his  openness in preaching the gospel made him seem like a close, personal  friend.   I have fond memories growing up in my hometown of Haleyville,  Alabama, of being at my grandparents' home, and if a Billy Graham  Crusade was being televised, you can rest assured that we were watching  it around their television, regardless of what was on the other  networks.   He was very clear in how he presented the gospel, that whosoever  believeth in the son would have eternal life.   He will be greatly missed by a world that desperately needs more  people like Billy Graham, but we can take great comfort in knowing that  he has now made it home with his Maker.   Author James Allan Francis, in writing about the impact of Jesus  Christ on the world, wrote this: ``All the armies that ever marched,  all the navies that were ever built; all the parliaments that ever sat  and all the kings that ever reigned, put together, have not affected  the life of man upon this Earth as powerfully as has that one solitary  life.''   That one solitary life, of course, is of Jesus Christ, who brought  salvation to the world through faith in Him and in Him alone.   While no one could ever come close to having an impact on the world  like Christ did, I believe the late Billy Graham was one of those great  messengers, probably the best that we have seen any time in recent  history, and he will long be remembered for the message that he gave  about a personal salvation in Jesus Christ.
