 Madam President, since coming to Washington 2 years  ago, I have learned a lot about the Senate and about how Washington  works. Politics can, at times, be like a game. While we may be on  different teams politically, we should all be focused on winning for  all American people. If there is one thing I know about in my last 40  years as a coach and educator, it is trying to win and how to win.   Fifty years ago, we discovered a winning strategy for all of American  female athletes. It was called title IX, probably one of the most  successful pieces of legislation that has ever come out of this body.  Signed into law in 1972, title IX's 37 words empowered women to win by  leveling the playing field and providing them access to the same  opportunities as young men.   I believe those words are worth repeating today to remind this body  of their importance:         No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex,       be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of,       or be subjected to discrimination under any educational       program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.    Those sometimes on the left argue that allowing males to compete  against females makes sports more inclusive. I don't believe that. The  opposite, to me, is true. Forcing females to compete against males  destroys the level playing field created by law. It would exclude young  women from the safety and fairness that they deserve. Title IX's  success would be undone if this continues to happen, and that success  that title IX is and has been is undeniable.   Since its enactment, participation in female sports has increased by  more than 600 percent. Think about that now. In 50 years, because of  title IX, the participation in women's sports has increased 600  percent, and the number of female college graduates in the United  States increased dramatically from 8 to 40 percent. You don't see  things like that happen. Title IX has afforded many women the  opportunity to receive athletic scholarships and become our engineers,  our doctors, our lawyers, and our leaders, without the burden of having  college debt.   Sadly, title IX is being attacked by activists who care more about  politics than what is best for women and girls. The U.S. Department of  Education is caving--is giving in--to progressive activists and moving  ahead with plans to force schools to allow biological males to share  locker rooms and compete in women's sports. This irrational and  unprecedented move comes despite record numbers of educators, parents,  and athletes who have voiced their concerns about the disastrous impact  that this would have on female athletes of all ages.   The Department of Education, President Biden, and my colleagues on  the left in Congress have ignored those concerns because they care more  about appeasing activists and the progressive left than actually  protecting young women. I just can't understand this. It is shameful.    Beginning next year, coaches will be forced to decide between opening  up locker rooms to biological males or face dire consequences. Allowing  biological males to compete against young women is unfair, it is  unsafe, and it is wrong. We can't look Americans in the eye and  honestly say we support female athletes if we stand by as they are  forced into uncomfortable settings they do not deserve, and we can't  tell young women we want them to succeed if we allow the radical left  to push them to the sidelines of their sports and take away their  future opportunities for scholarships and fair competition. It is not  the American way.   If you visited my hometown of Auburn, AL, on a Friday night over the  past few months, you would see an arena--thousands of people--full of  excited young girls watching the Auburn gymnastics team. Many of them  dream of becoming Olympic gymnasts--gymnasts just like Suni Lee, who is  an Olympic Gold medalist.   Others make the trip to the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa to  see the World Games and to see Montana Fouts on the mound, aspiring to  one day become a star softball pitcher at a higher level.   Our girls and young women should be able to continue to dream and  compete. Taking away their title IX protections by twisting the law  could strip those opportunities for female athletes across our great  country.   Since 2003, biological men have won 28 women's sports titles. Let me  read that again. Since 2003, biological men have won 28 women's sports  titles. We have all heard from athletes like Riley Gaines, the college  swimmer who, this past year, bravely spoke out after being forced to  share a locker room and the awards podium with a swimmer who had the  unfair advantage of swimming in a male body.   Over the weekend, we learned that a judge in Minnesota has ordered  the U.S.A. power lifting teams to allow biological men to compete  against female power lifters.   Where will this end? When will we step up and say enough is enough?  Congress must act to save title IX and make sure competition is safe  and fair for everyone, including girls and women. This is why, last  week, I reintroduced the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act.  This legislation would require institutions to recognize an athlete's  gender solely based on what it is at birth or else be banned from  receiving Federal funding.   You know, it sounds absurd even to me to say, but, sadly, this  legislation is now necessary to preserve title IX for current and  future female athletes. It is really sad.   I am thankful for those colleagues here in the Senate who have joined  me in standing up for women's sports, and I hope that others will join  our efforts in the future.   We have to save title IX. We have to save young girls and women to be  able to participate on the same level, with the same funding and access  to coaches, as men. Millions of young girls and women are looking to us  in this body and to the people across this country, looking to us to  stand up for them and that starts with action to ensure that the  playing field remains level for generations and generations to come.   This Senate must take up this crucial legislation and help every  young woman and young girl in this great country that we live in.  [[Page S648]]    Madam President, I yield the floor.    Madam President, for some veterans, serving  their country meant foregoing their own dreams so that millions of  Americans would have the opportunity to pursue theirs. That is true for  U.S. Marine Cpl Jimmy Sullivan of Foley, a star linebacker at Vigor  High School in Mobile, who always dreamed of playing football for Coach  Paul ``Bear'' Bryant at the University of Alabama.   But when the offer letter came from Coach Bryant, Corporal Sullivan  knew that he could not accept because he saw the many Americans who  were dying in the Vietnam war. So instead of following his dream to  play college football, he dropped out of high school to enlist in the  U.S. Marine Corps at the age of 18.   The two-time Purple Heart recipient recalls several close calls  during his 2 years in Vietnam, but a particular experience stands out  in his mind. One foggy day while transporting deceased  [[Page S654]]  American soldiers, Corporal Sullivan heard a voice repeatedly tell him  to turn around. After looking around, he finally turned to discover an  enemy soldier waiting in the bushes to attack him. Despite receiving  multiple gunshot wounds from the encounter, he still believes that  voice saved his life, making him one of the few from his company who  returned home alive. Through it all, when you ask him about his  military service, his response is ``I wouldn't change ONE thing.''   Not one to be idle, Corporal Sullivan became an operator for Chevron  Oil Company and now works as a security guard for Sidwell Protection  Services. In addition to being a beloved ``Pop,'' Corporal Sullivan is  actively involved in his congregation at Bibleway Assembly of God  Church in Foley, where he serves as a deacon and helps in community  outreach efforts. His grit and courage is an inspiration to us all.   I am proud to recognize Corporal Sullivan as the March Veteran of the  Month.                            ____________________
