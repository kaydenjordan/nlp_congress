 Mr. Speaker, it seems like just yesterday, but it was  50 years ago that my dad and I sat down to watch Super Bowl IV. We  watched on a black-and-white television, and we watched the Chiefs beat  the Vikings 23-7.   We saw Lenny Dawson making long passes to Otis Taylor, one of the  greatest linebacking corps in history dominate the game, and we saw Jan  Stenerud kick three field goals.   This weekend at Super Bowl LIV, the Chiefs Nation will be coming to  Miami, Florida, and I am here on behalf of the Kansas delegation to  wish Coach Andy Reid and our MVP quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, the very  best and that they have the best game of their life.   And as the Chiefs Nation joins the folks in Miami, I want everyone to  stand and join us in rooting the Chiefs Nation on and remember that we  are the land of the free and the home of the Chiefs.                            ____________________
