 Mr. Chairman, my amendment is straightforward and simply  requires the Department of Transportation to provide a cost-benefit  analysis to Congress before moving forward with changes to what is  commonly referred to as the mishandled baggage reporting rule. If DOT  wants to alter a sensible reporting requirement that has been in place  for decades, it should, at the very least, be asked to justify it with  a cost-benefit analysis.
