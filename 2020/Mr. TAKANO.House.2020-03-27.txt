 Mr. Speaker, I thank Majority Leader Hoyer.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 748,  the CARES Act.   571 veterans in the VA's healthcare system have tested positive for  coronavirus. We have already lost nine veterans to this virus. Mr.  Speaker, 120 veterans have been admitted to VA hospitals; 185 VA  employees, including doctors and nurses providing lifesaving healthcare  to veterans with coronavirus, have also been infected.   Because of the lack of widespread testing due to supply chain  challenges like low levels of reagents, shortages of swabs and testing  kits, a dwindling supply of masks to protect healthcare workers,  understaffed VA hospitals without providers to administer the tests,  and a 2- to 7-day lag time for veterans to receive results, we know  that the magnitude of this public health emergency and the number of  veterans sickened by this deadly virus are underreported. It will only  become more severe in the weeks to come.   Providing nearly $20 billion to VA to combat this virus is vital.  This funding will save veterans' lives, protect VA's healthcare  providers and first responders, and give VA the resources it needs to  serve as the Nation's backup healthcare system in communities where  local hospitals are overwhelmed with coronavirus patients.   Mr. Speaker, this relief package provides nearly $16 billion in  funding for VA to provide healthcare to veterans, including the  purchase of essential medical supplies like ventilators. VA will have  the funds to purchase more COVID-19 testing kits, N95 masks, gowns,  face shields, and gloves--personal protective equipment to keep  healthcare providers and staff at the VA hospitals safe.   Healthcare providers and workers caring for veterans in their homes  at VA-run nursing homes, community living centers, and State-veteran  homes will also receive personal protective equipment.   Mr. Speaker, $100 million is allocated for emergency management so VA  first responders have the resources they need to help veterans and  communities during this public health emergency. $590 million is set  aside for veterans most vulnerable to COVID-19: homeless veterans and  elderly veterans in community living centers and assisted living  facilities.   Over $2 billion is provided to support VA's IT systems and strengthen  VA's telework capabilities. Greater telework capacity reduces the risk  of coronavirus transmission in VA's workforce and keeps the Department  running.   Over $600 million is set aside for VA to retrofit its hospitals and  clinics to increase the number of beds and treatment rooms to care for  veterans with COVID-19 and deploy mobile treatment units.   Over $2 billion is appropriated for veterans who need urgent or  emergency care in the community for COVID-19.   Finally, this funding ensures the VA healthcare providers putting  their lives on the line to treat veterans are paid for their overtime  work hours that they work.   Now, this relief package also makes veteran-owned small business  owners eligible for loans to pay their employees and keep their  businesses afloat and prevents veterans from losing their homes due to  foreclosure. It ensures veterans who receive stimulus checks remain  eligible for pension and means-based VA benefits.   This package is far from perfect, but there is so much in this  legislation that is critical to helping veterans and ordinary Americans  survive this pandemic. I expect that there will be more legislation to  ensure that no veterans or Americans are left behind.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues support this package.                                time  1000
