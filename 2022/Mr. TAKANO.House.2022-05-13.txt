 Madam Speaker, I am outraged.   I am outraged because, in 2022, women are still fighting for their  reproductive rights.   I am outraged that women do not have autonomy over their bodies.  Their bodies belong to them, not Supreme Court Justices, not  politicians, and not anyone else.   I am outraged that, despite the fact that the majority of Americans  support legal abortion, the Senate has voted against the bill that  codifies Roe and protects access to abortion.   What these political hacks on the Supreme Court and politicians do  not realize is that striking down Roe v. Wade will not end abortion. It  will simply end safe access to abortion, and women's lives will be at  risk.   If you are not equally enraged, you are not paying attention.                            ____________________
