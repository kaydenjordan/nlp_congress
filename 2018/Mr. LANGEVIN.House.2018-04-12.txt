 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, we absolutely need to address the crisis of our Federal  debt. And we do it by coming together in a bipartisan way, having the  adult conversation, the difficult conversation, addressing both revenue  and spending. This is not rocket science.   A balanced budget amendment would be worthy of consideration if  properly crafted to provide flexibility in times of war, recession, or  national emergency. In fact, I have cosponsored such a resolution.  However, this rigid amendment fails to anticipate these unfortunate but  inevitable contingencies.   Instead, this resolution is a cynical attempt to pay for all the  enormous costs of the Republican tax bill, the one that we recently  passed and the one that was passed under George W. Bush, enacted to the  benefit of special interests and the wealthy--overwhelmingly in their  favor--and to clear the way for wholesale cuts to critical programs for  children and seniors like Medicare and Medicaid.   Mr. Speaker, Congress has all the legislative tools that it needs to  fix the deficit, as we saw during the Clinton years, when they had the  adult conversation, when they did the tough work addressing revenue and  spending in a bipartisan way. Then the Federal Government ran budget  surpluses as far as the eye could see when President Clinton left  office.                                time  1500    Now, we simply need to muster the will to enact responsible fiscal  policies that address both spending and revenue, and the sooner we do  it, the better, but it has to be bipartisan. We have to make the  difficult choices on spending and revenue.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to reject this amendment and work  with me, work with our colleagues across the aisle in a bipartisan way  to enact comprehensive budget solutions that work longterm for all  Americans.
