 Mr. President, I have a motion to commit at the desk.    Mr. President, first, I thank my friend from Indiana,  Senator Donnelly, for his remarks this afternoon and also for his  efforts to help to protect and preserve Medicaid so that hundreds of  thousands of people in our States and across the country can continue  to live in the community.   I want to point out that today is the 27th anniversary of the signing  of the Americans with Disabilities Act. This legislation, known as the  Americans with Disabilities Act, is 27 years old. It is a piece of  legislation that both recognizes and guarantees the rights of people  with disabilities. It is, at its heart, a civil rights bill, one that  promotes and promises liberty and freedom for people with  disabilities--the liberty and freedom that all Americans are promised,  that our founding documents guarantee, and that we in the Senate are  charged with protecting for all citizens.   We should be celebrating the liberty and freedom of people with  disabilities, but instead of having a celebration of the Americans with  Disabilities Act on this anniversary day, the Senate Republican bill-- which, I guess, is basically the House bill that we are on right now-- threatens that freedom and threatens that liberty that was accorded in  the Americans with Disabilities Act with regard to those with  disabilities.   Now, I have heard a lot of speeches on this floor by my Republican  colleagues about freedom and liberty in the context of healthcare--lots  of speeches about both of those words. I would argue that, if you  consider this legislation and the Senate versions of it that came after  the House bill, all of these Republican healthcare bills were really,  simply, about decimating Medicaid, limiting community-based care, and  cutting long-term services and support, which will rob people with  disabilities of their rights that the Americans with Disabilities Act  advanced.  [[Page S4253]]    I think everyone here knows the disabilities story. I will just do a  quick summary.   For centuries, people with disabilities have been placed against  their will in institutions like this one. This is a building in  Pennsylvania. When it was open and operating, it was known as  Pennhurst. There were lots of places like this across the country, not  just in one or two States. These institutions were, in fact, over time,  warehouses, in which people had few, if any, rights. They were told  what time to wake up, what time to go to bed, and when to eat. They  were told they could never leave. That was the basic set of rules they  lived by when they lived in institutions like that. These were places  where choice was unknown and where freedom, liberty, and self- determination were also unknown.   Over the past 50 years, we have made some improvements--slow  improvements--with the voices of people with disabilities leading the  way. Throughout those 50 years, individuals and families have fought  for their freedom and have worked to create laws that protect their  freedom.   For example, the 1973 Rehabilitation Act Amendments and the Americans  with Disabilities Act affirmed and protected the rights of people with  disabilities to have access to all of society. The 1999 Olmstead  Supreme Court decision reaffirmed the right of people with disabilities  to live where they want to live and to be free of the confines of an  institution.   Let's take it from the institution down to the individual--to  individuals like Jensen, who is pictured right here. People like  Jensen, who were once forced to live in nursing homes, now live where  they want to live and pursue their dreams. Yet we know that rights  alone do not equal freedom and liberty for people with disabilities.   Medicaid provides the supports that are necessary to live in the  community and to have that full measure of freedom and that full  measure of choice. Medicaid protects the hard-won rights of people with  disabilities to have real choices. Medicaid home-based and community- based supports mean that people with disabilities can live in their own  apartments, hold jobs, and contribute to their communities. Medicaid  makes it possible to use the talents, skills, and knowledge of people  with disabilities. Medicaid makes their rights a reality.   Do not take my word for it. Just ask the people who were here today  in the Gallery, the people who are outside this Chamber and are walking  the halls of the Senate, walking throughout the buildings, marching,  demonstrating, and greeting people on the streets, with some of them  staying overnight at one place to make their voices heard. Ask the  members of ADAPT. Ask the members of the National Council on  Independent Living. Ask The Arc's 700 affiliates around the country.  Ask the folks from Easterseals, the Association of University Centers  on Disabilities, the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, and on and on and  on--groups across the country that are telling us with one voice: Do  not move forward with cuts to Medicaid as have been proposed in each of  these bills.   These Americans will tell you that their rights are not real without  community supports. This bill will drive people back into those  institutions that I just showed you a picture of.   In the midst of voting on my amendment--which would basically say:  Let's go back to the committee of jurisdiction--in this case, the  Finance Committee--and spend some time to have some hearings, have some  regular order, which some have called for here, and really consider  this issue seriously--I know there will be talk that some will reject  my amendment and will introduce and maybe have a vote on a sense of the  Senate.   There is a time and a place for that kind of measure when the Senate  speaks with one voice on a matter. This is not one of those times. This  is a time when we have to do more than just have a sense of the Senate.  We have to be serious about a particular matter of public policy--in  this case, of making sure that we protect people with disabilities so  that they have all of the rights and all of the promises fulfilled in  the Americans with Disabilities Act and other legislation.   So we are hearing that there might be a sense of the Senate offered  as a side-by-side to the amendment that I will offer. This is totally  inadequate in terms of the serious issue that we are here to talk  about--in this case, protecting people with disabilities. It is a  totally inadequate response to that. The people with disabilities who  are in the Gallery, who are in the reception area, or who are back at  home in congressional districts and States--those folks in each and  every community around the country--want to ensure that the promise  that we made to them in the ADA and in other measures will be kept-- that we will keep our promise. If Medicaid community-based services are  slashed, statements by the Senate will not help very much.   What will we likely have in front of us in the next couple of hours  or between today and tomorrow?   I know it has been described in a lot of ways, if the Republicans  want to get there. Here is the way I describe it. It is a congressional  Republican scheme that they are working on to get to repeal--not repeal  and replace. In this case, it would be repeal and decimate--decimating  Medicaid, repealing the entire Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Act.   Some here will argue that they can support this because this next  version--this scheme--will not include Medicaid and will likely not  even include tax cuts for the very wealthy. Cuts to Medicaid have been  the core part of every House version of healthcare and every Senate  bill that we have seen so far. They will get to those cuts one way or  another, and they will also get to the tax cuts for the superrich.   The bill that we are debating, H.R. 1628, as you know, creates block  grants in the context of Medicaid. Block-granting, in a sense, may be  sending to the States a limited amount of money and saying: Good luck  when you have to balance your budget and pay for Medicaid services. It  will have per capita caps, which would, again, limit what States can do  in terms of the dollars they have, or it would just continue to have  cuts to Medicaid, as every bill has had, the likes of which we have  never seen--sometimes over $800 billion, sometimes over $700 billion,  but it is in that neighborhood of hundreds and hundreds of billions of  dollars of cuts to Medicaid. This next version of the Senate bill will  do the same.   When you consider the cuts to Medicaid juxtaposed with the tax breaks  given to the superrich--really giveaways--there is no other word that I  can come up with other than ``obscene.'' There are probably other  words, but that is, I think, a good description of what that is. That  is one of the reasons that these measures have been so unpopular across  the board with every income group. Those folks who would get those big  giveaways--I think most of them would not want them if they knew the  price of that tax giveaway to someone with a lot of money would be to  decimate Medicaid.    So passing this version of the bill--passing a scaled-down scheme-- means that Republicans have not abandoned their Medicaid cuts. They are  going to get to that as soon as they can. This is simply what we are  going to see over the next couple of hours--a back door to cutting and  capping Medicaid--and anyone who believes otherwise is probably  deceiving themselves.   What we need are serious policies crafted to ensure long-term  supports and services that provide and guarantee community-based  services that promote choice and freedom for people with disabilities.  This bill doesn't promise freedom or liberty. It doesn't promise the  choice to live in a community and to be part of a family, like this  family, where one member of that family has a disability and gets to  live in a house with other members of the family. That is not possible  for many Americans without Medicaid.   For people with disabilities, this bill is anything but a bill that  would enhance freedom or enhance choice. This bill would, in fact, be  an anti-freedom bill when it comes to people with disabilities. It is  not a key to liberty. It is really just a pathway to institutional  care, where we were years ago and where we have come from, from whence  we have made progress. It is a return to limited choices, a lack of  rights, and a place where freedom is not possible.   In conclusion, let me thank the Members of the Senate who have  supported  [[Page S4254]]  this motion: Senators Stabenow, Duckworth, Hassan, Van Hollen, Murray,  Brown, Blumenthal, Carper, Durbin, Kaine, Baldwin, Wyden, Markey,  Murphy, Harris, Cardin, Warren, Hirono, Reed, Nelson, Klobuchar,  Warner, Shaheen, Coons, Bennet, King, Menendez, Whitehouse, Leahy, and  Booker. I want to thank them for joining me in this effort.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I know the Chair said I may speak for a few  minutes before the vote. I spoke earlier so I will not reiterate every  argument.   Really, what we are doing with this particular amendment is sending  this legislation to the Finance Committee so as to focus it as the  motion itself says: When this bill would be recommitted to the Finance  Committee, the Finance Committee could examine it from the perspective,  in this case, of people with disabilities and to focus on changes that  could be made in order to prevent harm to individuals with disabilities  as defined in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.   The reason we mention that particularly is that is the seminal piece  of legislation to protect people with disabilities who would be harmed  by this legislation because you cannot just have rights that are  guaranteed without the support for those rights. Medicaid provides that  support so folks, if they want to live at home or if they want to live  in a community-based setting, can do that, but they can only do that  with the help of Medicaid. It is a pretty simple amendment to make sure  there is some adequate review of the impact on Americans with  disabilities.   We have, in Pennsylvania, for example, over 720,000 people who have a  disability and depend upon Medicaid. I want to make sure every one of  those Pennsylvanians has all of the protections we say we are  guaranteeing with disability legislation--with laws like the Americans  with Disabilities Act and with the protections Medicaid provides.   This is critically important. At a time when we are talking about  freedom and liberty in the context of healthcare, I would hope we would  take steps to guarantee that freedom and liberty apply to those with  disabilities so that as the Americans with Disabilities Act has  enshrined in our law, they may be able to choose the kind of places  they want to live and choose the settings within which they want to  live their lives, to be able to have the freedom to choose that by way  of the support they can get from Medicaid. I hope that is something  that is reasonable enough so as to get support from both sides of the  aisle.   I know my friend from Nevada is offering a sense of the Senate in the  next vote. I just do not think that a sense of the Senate, in any way,  is commensurate with the gravity of this problem. There is a time and a  place for a sense of the Senate--when we are expressing a sentiment  that is bipartisan--but we need more than sentimentality here. We need  more than good wishes. We need to make sure we get this policy right as  it relates to people with disabilities.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Madam President, I intend to offer the following motion to  H.R. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the  Record. The motion is supported by Senators Stabenow, Duckworth,  Hassan, Van Hollen, Murray, Brown, Blumenthal, Carper, Durbin, Kaine,  Baldwin, Wyden, Markey, Murphy, Harris, Cardin, Warren, Hirono, Reed,  and Nelson.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Mr. Casey moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same       back to the Senate within 3 days with changes that are within       the jurisdiction of such Committee to strike provisions in       the American Health Care Act of 2017 that would harm       individuals with disabilities as defined in the Americans       with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) by       reducing their access to affordable health care or limiting       coverage or benefits under Medicaid or in the private health       insurance market.    Ms. Duckworth. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of this motion to commit be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion to Commit With Instructions         Ms. Duckworth moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the       Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions with       instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,       not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,       with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) strike any provision in the bill that results in a       decrease in maternal care for new mothers, including pre-      natal care, delivery, and post-natal care.
