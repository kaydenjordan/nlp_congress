 Madam Speaker, earlier this year, Congress sprung  into action to deal with the part of the economy that was hit perhaps  hardest than any: the hospitality industry.   Independent restaurants suffered massive job losses. Congress  responded with the Restaurant Rescue Plan, $28.6 billion. Madam  Speaker, the need was so overwhelming that the fund was totally  subscribed in 3 days.   We are working now with H.R. 3807 to replenish that fund with a $60  billion allocation, with bipartisan support in the House and Senate.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  important legislation to replenish the fund and rescue our restaurants,  which are the cornerstone of a livable community.                            ____________________
