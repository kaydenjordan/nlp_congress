 Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the  importance of prioritizing ethanol as we move toward a cleaner, more  renewable energy future.   Today, I am introducing the Fuels Parity Act legislation that would  allow ethanol from cornstarch to qualify as an advanced biofuel.  Removing legal barriers that limit the use of corn-based ethanol will  bolster American energy production and support our agriculture  industry, all while lowering emissions.   The Biden administration continues to tout its focus on clean energy,  yet routinely leaves ethanol and other biofuels out of the equation.  Transitioning to 100 percent electric vehicles is simply not feasible  at this point in time. Our energy demands as a Nation are increasing  every single day, and our grid cannot support this transition.   Instead of naively pushing for a change without considering the  potential side effects, the Biden administration should be promoting  all kinds of renewable energy, whether wind and solar to support our  power grid, or advanced biofuels to reduce carbon emissions without  forcing the purchase of expensive EVs while not having the grid to  support them.   My bill is proof that Republicans and Democrats from all different  regions are supportive of a cleaner energy future. I am proud to be  joined by Representatives Bice, Hunt, Sorensen, and Budzinski, and I  look forward to continuing our efforts to prioritize American energy  production.                                time  1215                             National Police Week     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize National  Police Week.   Our officers do their job because they are committed to serving and  protecting their communities. It is a selfless profession filled with  brave men and women who put their lives on the line to protect others  and keep order in society. They deserve recognition for their tireless  efforts, yet are oftentimes met with hatred.   Maintaining public safety is the key to thriving communities and our  Nation as a whole. In the last few years, our officers have been  constantly attacked and defunded in many major American cities.  Progressive district attorneys are contributing to the problem by  refusing to prosecute crimes, leaving criminals on the street who are  highly likely to re-offend. We have all  [[Page H2319]]  heard stories far too often about serious crimes committed by people  who have been arrested countless times before being let back out on the  streets. Unfortunately, this has become the norm in too many cities.   Our law enforcement officers have been left with policies that leave  them feeling powerless to do the job they selflessly dedicate their  lives to. Whether on the border or in major cities, we need serious  bipartisan police reform that holds bad officers accountable and  dedicates resources to help good officers do their jobs.   I am grateful for the men and women in law enforcement for their  commitment to keeping us safe. I thank them for all they do.                  Congratulating Thomas Gibson of Iowa City     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Thomas  Gibson of Iowa City for winning a Congressional Bronze Medal. I had the  pleasure of presenting the award to Thomas last week in front of his  friends and family at Iowa City West High School. Thomas is an  outstanding young man, deserving of the award given to him to recognize  the dedication to service and achievement in our Nation's youth.   In order to earn a Congressional Bronze Medal, participants must set  and achieve goals in public service, personal development, physical  fitness, and exploration. Thomas fulfilled his goals by restoring a  native prairie to its original beauty, volunteering at a community  garden that gave all of the food to people in need, and becoming a  senior patrol leader for his Boy Scout troop, serving as a role model  for younger Scouts and learning valuable lessons in leadership.   Thomas is also a member of Iowa City West's most advanced jazz band  and spends his free time working at a local ice cream shop. His peers  speak very highly of him and recognize him as a valuable member of the  community.   Madam Speaker, I wish Thomas the very best of luck as he continues to  be a leader and role model in the community. He represents the very  best of Iowa and the rest of the country.              Congratulating Hailey Whitters of Shueyville, Iowa     Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Hailey  Whitters of Shueyville, Iowa, for being named the Academy of Country  Music Awards' New Female Artist of the Year.   Hailey had a farm-town upbringing before moving to Nashville to  pursue a career in music. She spent the next 10 years honing her craft  and finding her true voice before her breakout album ``The Dream''  caught national attention and The Washington Post called it 2020's  ``deepest country album.''   Hailey's next album titled ``Raised'' drew inspiration from her  upbringing in Iowa and focused on her childhood adventures in  Shueyville. This album introduced the world to her own, unique brand of  Iowa country music. Her song ``A Beautiful Noise'' was a 2022 Grammy  nominee for Song of the Year, and she solidified her spot in the  country music scene with her Academy of Country Music Awards' New  Female Artist of the Year title earlier this month.   Hailey's success is a testament to her hard work and dedication to  her craft. I wish her the best of luck as she goes on tour to showcase  the new album. I know she will continue to make the people of  Shueyville and Iowa proud.                                World Beer Cup     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Backpocket Brewing Company from Coralville, Iowa, for winning first  place for their Pumpkin Ale at the 2023 World Beer Cup. They have set  the bar for excellent beers worldwide. They already had a gold coin.  Now they have a gold medal.   When I first put together my draft remarks, I knew any praise I  heaped on Backpocket would pale in comparison to their actual  accomplishments. So I will let their beer speak for itself and simply  say: congratulations.   I also encourage all the breweries who won silver or amber: Do not be  sour. You were stout competitors.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Backpocket  Brewing Company from Coralville, Iowa, for winning first place for  their Pumpkin Ale at the 2023 World Beer Cup, drowning out their  competition.   They have set the bar for excellent brews worldwide. They already had  a gold coin, and now they have a gold medal.   When I first put together my draft remarks, I knew any praise I  heaped on Backpocket would pale in comparison to their actual  accomplishments. So I will let their beer speak for itself and say  simply: congratulations.   I would also encourage all the breweries who won silver or amber:  Don't be sour. You were stout competitors. However, one thing is clear.  We may not have much of a timber industry in Iowa, but we do have great  lagers. I encourage all my colleagues to hop on the bandwagon and try  Iowa beer.                            ____________________
