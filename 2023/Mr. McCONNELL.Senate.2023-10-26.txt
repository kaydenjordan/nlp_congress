 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I was devastated to hear the news last  night of a deadly shooting in Lewiston, ME. I know the entire Senate  stands behind our colleagues Senator Collins and Senator King as they  help their State marshal its response.   We pray especially for the victims of this senseless violence, for  their families, and for the law enforcement personnel working  tirelessly to save lives and bring the suspect to justice.                     Speaker of the House   Mike Johnson    Mr. President, now, on an entirely different matter, yesterday, I  spoke with the newly elected Speaker of the House,   Mike Johnson. I  congratulated him on his victory, and I expressed my support as he  begins to steer the House Republican majority.  [[Page S5199]]    We have a lot of work ahead of us. House and Senate Republicans need  to work together on a number of urgent priorities, beginning with  supplemental appropriations for a number of our national security  priorities. So I look forward to meeting with the Speaker soon to begin  this important work.                                    Israel    Mr. President, every day brings new harrowing details of the  terrorist attacks of October 7, and we continue to learn more about the  role Iran plays in aiding and abetting terror. Just yesterday, new  reports indicated that hundreds of terrorists from Hamas and  Palestinian Islamic Jihad traveled to Iran last month for specialized  combat training with Tehran's murderous Quds Force.   Of course, waiting for specific evidence of tactical involvement  really misses the point. Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of  terror. It has spent decades supporting proxy terrorists who share  their hatred for Israel and America precisely so Tehran can maintain  plausible deniability. We cannot lose sight of this savage charade.  Evil will continue to target the United States and our allies, whether  we pay attention to it or not.   And the threats our adversaries pose are all connected. Iran doesn't  just underwrite terrorist attacks on Israel; it outfits Russia with  drones to help kill Ukrainians. China doesn't just menace Taiwan; it  helps Iran circumvent international sanctions by trading consumer goods  for oil. And Russia isn't just pummeling a sovereign neighbor; it has  joined China for joint naval exercises in the Sea of Japan, as well as  off the coast of Alaska.   Our adversaries' ambitions are not local. They have been showing us  for years that they are determined to challenge American leadership,  undermine our interests, and weaken our alliances.   But on every front, the Biden administration's response has fallen  short. The President was hesitant to deter Russia's aggression in the  first place and has dithered about helping equip Ukraine to defeat it.  He has prioritized engagement with China on climate policy over  building resilient supply chains with trusted allies.   And just listen to his administration's jaw-dropping naivete after 3  years of squandering leverage on Iran. In early October, the  President's National Security Advisor wrote a self-congratulatory  article assessing the administration's foreign policy.   Here is some of what he said about the Middle East:         In the face of serious frictions, we have de-escalated       crises in Gaza and restored direct diplomacy.    He went on:         U.S. troops were under regular attack in Iraq and Syria. .       . . Such attacks, at least for now, have largely stopped.    Finally, he claimed that the President's approach ``frees up  resources for other global priorities'' and ``reduces the risk of new  Middle Eastern conflicts.''   Well, at least that was the account that went to print before 1,400  Israelis were murdered on a Saturday morning and before Iran-backed  terrorists injured two dozen servicemembers in numerous attacks in Iraq  and in Syria.   The incongruity between the administration's spin and the reality has  since been scrubbed from the article online, but the Biden  administration's naive approach to terror remains woefully inadequate  to meet the growing threat of radical Islamic terrorism--from  Afghanistan to Yemen, to Iraq and the Levant, to the Sahel.   Abandoning Afghanistan, obsessing about closing Guantanamo Bay,  removing the Houthis' designation as a terrorist organization, turning  the other cheek when terrorists attack Americans and our allies,  squandering leverage over Iran--weakness in one theater begets weakness  in another.   The United States is a global superpower, and it is high time we  started embracing and properly resourcing the responsibilities that  come with that role. Now is the time to invest deeper in our alliances  and partnerships. It is time to restore credible deterrence with hard  power.   That is why I will oppose Senator Paul's resolution to compel the  withdrawal of American servicemembers from Niger later today. Radical  Islamic terrorism in that part of the world is on the rise, and we  should be working more closely with local partners, not abandoning  them. We should be conducting more surveillance flights, not blinding  ourselves by abandoning strategic airfields in Niger. Russia and China  are working overtime to displace American influence in Africa. We  should not be making their job any easier.   Beyond today's vote, the Senate should recognize the opportunity  before us to shape a supplemental appropriations bill that equips our  military, our defense industrial base, and our allies and partners to  meet the growing threats that we face--from our southern border to  radical Islamic terrorism, to authoritarian aggression. We have a  chance to demonstrate the American leadership our people, our allies,  and our interests require. We should take it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
