 Mr. Speaker, Alvin, Texas, is known nationally for two  things: 42 inches of rain in 24 hours, our gift from Tropical Storm  Claudette; and baseball strikeout king Nolan Ryan, our gift from the  gods of baseball.   But those gifts are in our past. Our now greatest gift has been going  strong since 1976: Joe's Barbeque.   Owner Joe Saladino is a walking, Texan-talking American dream.   Joe opened with four tables, one barbecue pit, and three employees.  He served eight potatoes per day; four at lunch and four at dinner.   I was at Joe's a few weeks ago, and man, oh, man, has that world  changed. 1,200 Texans eat at Joe's every single day. They enjoy 100  pounds of sausage, 80 briskets, and endless potatoes.                            ____________________
