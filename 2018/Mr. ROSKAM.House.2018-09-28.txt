 Mr. Speaker, what a joy it is to be on the floor today.  What a joy it is to be amongst a group of people who have set aside  partisanship and have come together to address a crisis that is  crushing our constituents. What a joy it is to be a part of the process  and among a group of people who are trying to find common ground.   This is a good day, Mr. Speaker. There is good work that is  happening. I chair the Health Subcommittee, and it was incredible to  see the work that that subcommittee did on the Ways and Means  Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to strongly endorse this bill, and I urge  its passage.
