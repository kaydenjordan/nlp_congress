 Mr. Speaker, this transparency bill lacks transparency  on two of the major problems that are impacting soaring healthcare  costs. The only reason to reject transparency for, first, private  equity and, second, Medicare Advantage is that they have got more to  hide and apparently more lobbying power.   A growing private equity takeover of healthcare has already  undermined care in nursing homes and now threatens hospitals and  medical specialty practices across the United States with higher  prices, higher cost to taxpayers, and less quality.   A Senate committee has just launched a major investigation into the  impact of private equity on hospital costs and lower quality care.   Having failed to save taxpayers a dime that was promised--of the many  millions that was promised--Medicare Advantage costs $1,500 per person  each year over the cost of traditional Medicare. That is billions in  wasted taxpayer dollars.   The best way to fund much-needed services at community health centers  and to expand and improve and strengthen Medicare with services such as  dental, hearing, and vision is to take it right out of Medicare  Advantage.   This bill, I believe, should be rejected until these issues are  addressed by permitting the very amendments that we offered in the  House Ways and Means Committee that rejected them, as usual, to address  private equity and Medicare Advantage.   Mr. Speaker, with all respect to the bipartisan efforts and hard work  in the Energy and Commerce Committee, I believe there is a better way  to finance needs, and a very important need, to address the issues of  transparency on Medicare Advantage and private equity. Therefore, I  oppose the bill.
