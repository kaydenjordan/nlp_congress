 Madam Speaker, a few days ago I walked into a Coast  Guard base in Boston and I saw something I never thought I would  witness on American soil. Members of our Armed Forces were lined up at  a food pantry while they were on the clock because their employer, the  United States Government, wasn't paying them for the work that they put  in that day.   Madam Speaker, look around this country, and you will see nearly a  million civil servants and more than a million contract workers who are  forced to deter medical care, find part-time jobs, return Christmas  presents, take out loans, pawn valuable possessions, draw down  retirement savings, just to afford to feed their family and to keep a  roof over their head.   You will find families that are terrified that their food stamps will  run out. You will see notices threatening eviction for families who are  upholding their end of their rent, while the government defaults on its  own obligations.   You will see businesses struggling to stay afloat under lost Federal  support. Domestic violence organizations will have to turn away  survivors because critical grant funding isn't coming through.   Yes, this is about a misguided and demagogued immigration fight. And,  yes, this is squarely about a President who couldn't keep his promise.   But at its core, it is about an administration that has spent 2 years  treating the livelihood of working families as a bargaining chip,  quickly traded away time and again to protect power, profit, and  political gain.   Theirs is a system that asks American workers to make painful  sacrifices that those in power only read about; a system where tax cuts  for international corporations are paid for by Medicaid cuts for  working families; where healthcare premiums skyrocket for the sick and  the suffering; where healthcare industry executives reap the reward.   Theirs is a system where labor protections for workers are wiped out  as distant CEOs lay off loyal employees and gut pensions; where a  safety net that keeps our fellow Americans afloat shrinks and tears as  their President smiles and holds the scissors; where profits accrue to  those who have already profited, and the loss is borne by those who can  least afford to bear it.   Beyond the shutdown, beyond this President, our government needs to  prove to the American people that we are fighting for them. Because  right now, they don't believe we are in their corner, and I don't blame  them.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
