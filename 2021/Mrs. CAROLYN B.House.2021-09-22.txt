 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, on September 1, the  Supreme Court allowed Texas Senate Law 8 to go into effect, which bans  nearly all abortions in Texas.   Make no mistake, a 6-week ban is a ban on virtually all abortions.  Most people don't even know if they are pregnant at 6 weeks. This is  the latest in a series of extremist attempts to restrict abortion  access.   This December the Supreme Court will consider a 15-week ban in  Mississippi that directly threatens Roe v. Wade. With this recent  action, the Court has shown that we cannot depend on it to protect our  rights.   This Thursday, I am holding an Oversight Committee hearing on the  unending threat to abortion access, and on Friday the House must pass  the Women's Health Protection Act.   Our abortion rights are under threat, and we must act now before it  is too late.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I have an  amendment at the desk.    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today in  support of this amendment, which contains my bill to increase  transparency and accountability of senior leaders in the executive  branch, called the Periodically Listing Updates to Management Act or  PLUM Act.   This bill would require the Office of Personnel Management to  maintain a current publicly available online directory of senior  government leaders.   Currently, a comprehensive list of people appointed by the President  is available only once every four years in a publication referred to as  the Plum Book.   The Plum Book provides only a snapshot in time and does not reflect  changes that occur between publications. As a result, current  information about senior administration officials is often outdated and  difficult to find. In the digital age, providing Americans with a list  of top Federal officials once every four years is simply unacceptable.   This bill would implement recommendations made by the Government  Accountability Office and the Administrative Conference of the United  States by modernizing and expanding the current publication of the Plum  Book and aligning it with modern data standards.   The Committee on Oversight and Reform considered this bill in June of  this year, and it was approved on a voice vote.   The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  approved a similar bill last Congress with broad bipartisan support,  and the PLUM Act has been strongly endorsed by a bipartisan group of  more than two dozen civil society organizations and experts.   I want to thank my cosponsors on the bill: Representatives Connolly,  Sarbanes, Norton, Mfume, and Castro.   I also want to thank my colleague, Representative Ocasio-Cortez for  introducing the Political Appointments Inclusion and Diversity Act,  which requires OPM to coordinate with the White House to make a summary  of demographic information on political appointees publicly available.  The requirements in her bill are included in the PLUM Act.   We should be working together and working toward making our  government more transparent for the American people and more  representative of everyone in our country. The PLUM Act would provide  timely and transparent information about senior government officials  who are making decisions impacting the lives of millions. It would  shine a light on who is at the table in our government and who is not.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say  that I disagree with the gentleman strongly. We need to move into the  modern age. Right now all information is on the internet. It is digital  and it is available. The bill would merely require the Office of  Personnel Management to maintain a current, publicly available, online  directory of senior government officials so that anyone could access it  at any time.   A comprehensive list is already out there, as you said, but it is  printed only once every four years in a book that is called the Plum  Book, and it is only a snapshot. It is not up to date.   This bill is about modernizing the Plum Book and aligning it to  modern data standards. That is what this is about.   Information on senior leaders in government may already be obtained  by outside groups through FOIA, freedom of information requests, or  paid subscription services. There are paid subscription services, and  you can get it through a freedom of information. So it is available.   OPM civil service regulations stipulate that certain information from  personnel records for current and former Federal employees is available  to the public, including names, present and past position titles,  salaries, position descriptions, and duty stations.   Federal employees generally have no expectation of privacy regarding  this information. It is available on all of us. It is available by  private means, it is available through other means, through the FOIA,  so why not make it available and easily used by the public?   I want to answer the gentleman's claim that identifying appointees  publicly puts them at risk of political demonstrations or may make them  not want to serve or whatever. He mentioned that this was a negative.   My time is running out, but right now there is an exception for  national security positions that is recognized and reporting on  demographic information is important to get to the public, too.   I strongly support this bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.
