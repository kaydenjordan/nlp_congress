 Mr. President, let me once again thank my friend and  colleague from Florida. There is no one--no one--who has defended his  State more diligently, more assiduously, more effectively than the  senior Senator from the State of Florida. I know there are close to 20  million people in Florida who are grateful, as are all of us.   Thank you.   Mr. President, we will vote today on the final passage of NDAA. I am  pleased with the bipartisan manner in which the Senate has worked on  this important legislation. Senators McCain and Reed managed the bill  with great skill. I commend them for their bipartisan work on this  important legislation.  [[Page S5779]]                                       Healthcare    Mr. President, I am going to use the rest of my time to address  something that is not so bipartisan. It is terribly partisan, and that  is the issue of healthcare. I hope the American people listen closely.   After a few months of lying dormant, TrumpCare is back, and it is  meaner than ever. TrumpCare now lives under the name of Cassidy-Graham.  Guess what. It is another bill that would drastically cut back on  healthcare funding for Americans who need it most.   My colleagues, my fellow Americans, this is a red-alert moment for  the entire country. Our healthcare system again is threatened by a  hastily constructed piece of legislation, put together in a back room  by only one party--no CBO score, no committee process, not a single  hearing. Everyone is totally in the dark about the effects of this  bill, yet there is an effort to rush it forward.   This Frankenstein monster of a bill that would harm so many Americans  keeps coming back and back, and somehow each time it has managed to get  worse.   Here is what we know the new TrumpCare bill would do. It would roll  back protections for Americans with preexisting conditions. It would  allow States to impose burdensome requirements as a condition on  Medicaid coverage. It would defund Planned Parenthood, stripping  millions of women of their right to access affordable healthcare. Most  crucially, the new TrumpCare would plunge a dagger deep into the heart  of Medicaid, immediately ending Medicaid expansion and establishing a  per capita cap on Medicaid spending. That jeopardizes coverage for 11  million Americans and puts at great risk the coverage and affordability  of insurance for the 12 million who buy insurance on the marketplaces.   It would take the money used for Medicaid expansion and subsidies and  block-grant it to the States, imposing a massive cut on funding that  helps so many Americans well into the middle class.   The term ``block grants'' may sound harmless, but in practice they  are anything but. Right now, our healthcare system reimburses States  for the costs of what their citizens actually need and use. Block  grants are a fixed amount of money given to each State, forcing people  who need healthcare to fight among each other as to who gets those  dollars. People with parents in nursing homes will fight with those on  opioid treatment, who will fight with those who have kids with  preexisting conditions, who will fight with those who simply need to go  see a doctor. They will all be pitted against one another in a  heartless scheme, a heartless scheme that will hurt so many.   Block grants are a not-so-clever way of disguising a massive, massive  cut to healthcare--cutting back care, raising premiums, hurting  millions and millions of average Americans.   That is the case with this new TrumpCare. The Center on Budget and  Policy Priorities took a look at the new TrumpCare and found that the  block grants in the bill would deprive States of hundreds of millions  and sometimes billions of dollars. I am going to mention a few States  here. My colleagues should know the effect of the bill. They don't.   CBO has told us--I will talk more about this later--that they cannot  give us a full score but simply notes whether it meets the budget  reconciliation numbers. They say it will cut a billion dollars. That is  all it will say. We will not know how many citizens are hurt, but the  Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, whose numbers are very  reliable, has done a calculation. I would ask my colleagues to pay  attention. I just picked out some States. There are more. Arizona would  lose $1.6 billion in Federal funding. Alaska would lose $255 million in  Federal funding. Maine would lose $115 million in Federal funding. West  Virginia would lose $554 million in Federal funding. Colorado would  lose $823 million in Federal funding. Ohio, the State most racked by  the opioid epidemic, would lose over $2.5 billion in healthcare  funding. Iowa would lose $525 million in Federal funding. These are  devastating numbers. My colleagues, if you don't believe the accuracy  of these numbers, then have the courage and decency to wait for a CBO  score. To pass this legislation before CBO measures out the effect on  your State would be legislative malpractice of the highest order. These  numbers, we believe, are accurate. They come from a group that has had  years of expertise and accurately predicted healthcare effects. There  will be devastating cuts to so many in so many States.   If you don't believe these numbers, then show us what yours are. Wait  for CBO, an impartial arbiter, and see what they have to say. The  numbers are devastating. They represent millions of Americans,  especially middle-income and low-income, who will receive poorer  healthcare, face higher costs, or both. Whom do they represent? You are  an American family--a nice, middle-class family making a good income.  You have a parent in a nursing home. It is likely to be paid for by  Medicaid. That parent is at risk if this Graham-Cassidy bill passes.  You have a young son or daughter afflicted by opioids. The treatment  they receive would often be at risk if this bill passes. You give birth  to a child with a preexisting condition who desperately needs help. We  met so many of these families, every one of us. That child's life, in  many cases, would be at risk if this bill passes. This is the poorest  way of legislating I have seen in all my years here. To try to rush  this bill through with no hearings, no CBO score, no knowledge of how  it actually affects your constituents--how can we do that?   Already, some Republican Governors have spoken out against this  legislation. Governor Kasich, Governor Baker, and 16 patient and  provider groups have come out against this TrumpCare, including the  American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association. The ratings  agency Fitch says Graham-Cassidy would be even ``more disruptive'' than  all the other ACA bills. The American people have rejected TrumpCare  repeatedly. Its numbers in the polls are below 20 percent. Hardcore  supporters of Donald Trump do not want us to pass this bill. Virtually  only one in five Americans wants us to pass this bill--hardly anybody-- and we are going to go do it for a political scalp? No, we can't.   I know there are some on the other side of the aisle who say they can  work it out so each State wouldn't be hurt as badly as under the  current draft of the bill--these bad numbers--that they can tweak the  formula for one State or another that would make the cuts less  devastating. First, they are never going to come up with that kind of  money. I heard one Governor was told by a Senator: Don't worry about  the big cuts to your State. We will make it up with disproportionate  share payments--uncompensated care. It is impossible. The amount of  money in the DSH Program is so much less than the amount of these cuts  that we couldn't even come close. That is what is being thrown around  here. There are lots of different surmises: Maybe we will do this,  maybe we will do that. We are playing with people's lives. That is so  wrong. States will end up facing a harsh cut--most of the States in the  Union--many States represented by my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle who voted for the previous bills.   We shouldn't do it on substance, but we also shouldn't do it on the  basis of regular order. To have such a major bill that affects so many  people be rushed at the last minute in the dark of night--no  discussion, no analysis, no real knowledge of how it affects each of  our States--is legislative malpractice of the highest order.   If the Founding Fathers were looking at this Chamber now and  watching, they would be turning over in their graves. An America  founded on debate and discussion and sunlight is veering off all of  that in a really nasty way. There is no regular order here. There are  no bipartisan public hearings on the Graham-Cassidy bill. The HELP and  Finance Committees are not debating the legislation. It is the same  backroom, one-party sham of a legislative process that ultimately  brought the previous bill down. A contrived, eleventh-hour hearing on  block grants in the Homeland Security Committee--a committee that has  very little jurisdiction over healthcare matters--does not even come  close to suggesting regular order.   In conclusion, I think many of us on both sides of the aisle thought  there was a ray of light in the last few  [[Page S5780]]  weeks. The partisanship that had governed this place for the last 8  months seemed to be breaking. I had good meetings in the White House-- hopes of working together. Senators Alexander and Murray began talking  about how we move forward. I was joyful that maybe the partisanship  could end and we could work together. The majority leader and I are  getting along very well. This bill, if done this way and passed, would  dash those hopes.   There is a way out. Senators Alexander and Murray have had hearings.  They have had discussions. They are negotiating at this moment. What  they will come up with will have some things I don't like and some  things people on the other side of the aisle don't like. That is the  legislative process. It is not to rush a bill through in the dark of  night without even knowledge of how it affects people. CBO has said  they cannot measure how many people would lose coverage and how they  would be affected until a few weeks because this is a block grant. It  takes a long time to weigh it.   So after 2 weeks of thinking bipartisanship--that flickering candle  might gain some new light--this is the last thing we need. Let's not go  back to the divisive, destructive healthcare process that paralyzed the  Senate for much of this year. Let the leader and I encourage our  Members to talk to one another and come up with bipartisan solutions-- not just on this bill but on bills to come. Let's pursue the bipartisan  path courageously used by Senators Alexander and Murray.   In conclusion, I would ask every American who hears these words, who  longs for us to work together, to call your Senators and Congressmen  and let them know. Tell them this bill is even worse than the previous  bills. Tell them it hurts average families dramatically. Tell them  there is a better way. The same level of activism that we saw on the  previous bills must be garnered now or this will just slide through in  the dark of night, with effects that are desperate, devastating, and  unknown. Democrats in the Senate, we have no choice. Our  constituencies, our consciousness impels us. We will oppose the Graham- Cassidy bill in every way we can, using every tool at our disposal, and  we ask the American people to speak out, once again, and make their  voices heard. The hour is late, and the need is desperate.   I yield the floor.
