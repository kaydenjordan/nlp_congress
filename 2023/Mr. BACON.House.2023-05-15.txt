 Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Rutherford for  leading tonight's Special Order and being the expert on law enforcement  issues. We came in together, and I look to the gentleman for doing the  right thing to support our police. I appreciate Mr. Pascrell, too. We  worked a lot on traumatic brain injury and law enforcement issues. We  find areas to agree on. I know Mr. Gottheimer is getting up here soon,  and he is also a partner in many of our policies that we need to work  on together.   I rise today in honor of our police, the men and women who walk the  streets of our communities to keep us safe. Those who leave their  families do so every day to protect ours.   In particular, I recognize the 556 officers who never returned to  their families last year, including Saunders County Deputy Sheriff Jeff  Hermanson, who passed away. He was a K9 handler and a volunteer  firefighter. Deputy Hermanson was best remembered as a respected  officer dedicated to his job.   The best way we can honor those who give their lives, and their  families, is to introduce legislation that better protects them on the  job and prepares them for their profession and protects them in  retirement.   This Congress I introduced H.R. 355, the Back the Blue Act of 2023,  which makes it a Federal crime to kill, attempt to kill, or conspire to  kill a Federal judge, a Federal law enforcement officer, or federally  funded public safety officer. Criminals who cause harm or death to our  officers should face punishment to the fullest extent of the law.   Mr. Rutherford talked earlier about all these ambushes. This is  unacceptable. They must be held accountable. Our police are also facing  radical attacks, and there are growing calls for them to be defunded.   Let us be absolutely clear: We stand with our police.   I am an original cosponsor of the Invest to Protect Act which would  direct the Department of Justice to establish a grant program to aid  police departments with fewer than 200 law enforcement officers. I am  also a cosponsor of the EAGLE Act of 2023 to assist with the  accreditation of small and midsize police departments.   Unfortunately, there is an effort to eliminate the protections of  qualified immunity for police officers. Let's be clear. Qualified  immunity is not a blank check allowing law enforcement officers to do  what they want. It only protects them for personal liability if they  have not violated clearly established policies.                                time  2015    Without it, law enforcement officers would face a deluge of civil  suits for simply doing their jobs.   I am a cosponsor of the Qualified Immunity Act, which would codify  qualified immunity protections for law enforcement.   We are seeing a rise of crime across the Nation. In contrast, I want  to brag on our Omaha Police Department, which has worked with the  community to lower crime rates.   Fifteen years ago, the Omaha Police Department partnered with  Empowerment Network 360 to foster relationships with neighborhood  organizations, nonprofits, and churches. Coupled with solid support  from the Omaha city administration, they have the funding to do the  work they have identified through these relationships as vital to  lowering gun violence. They are now a model of success for reducing  homicides and violent crime in the city.   Recently mentioned on ABC, the Washington Post, and the Wall Street  Journal, we are one of the few large cities that have seen a drop in  gun violence and crime. In 2022, there were 90 citywide shootings, down  from 191 just 13 years ago. Even more impressive is that the homicide  clearance rates are now at 87 percent in 2022. It shows our police are  working hard and are professionals.   My family has been a victim of crime twice, both times when I was  deployed in the Middle East during my time in the Air Force. I will  take this time to thank the law enforcement officers who are there at  people's worst times in their lives. In my case, I was gone both times  when my family was a victim of crime. I was unable to help, but I knew  the police were there to support my wife and our kids, and we are  grateful. I know this is the story of Americans from coast to coast,  Hawaii and Alaska.   These legislative actions, in addition to the work of our local law  enforcement and community advocates, can lead to safer communities and  help ensure that our law enforcement officers are able to return home  to their loved ones.   Tonight, we say to our police, our law enforcement, that we thank  them. We love them, and we are grateful for what they do day in and day  out.
