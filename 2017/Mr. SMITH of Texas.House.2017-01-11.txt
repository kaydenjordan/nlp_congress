 Mr. Speaker, whenever you see climate change in  the news, remember the difference between actual data and exaggerated  predictions. For example, much coverage was given yesterday to the  predictions by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that polar bears now  face extinction because of climate change. That prediction is  contradicted by the evidence. The polar bear population has been  increasing and is now around 26,000, probably the highest number in  many years.   Climate alarmists want to scare people with extreme predictions.  Better for Americans to look at the scientific evidence and discount  the wild tales. Climate change has many causes and has occurred  throughout the history of the Earth. Real scientists acknowledge this  and are hesitant to make long-range predictions.                            ____________________
