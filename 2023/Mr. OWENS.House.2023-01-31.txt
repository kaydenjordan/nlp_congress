 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend,   Ken Buck, a leading  voice on demanding accountability from Big Tech and big media, for  bringing us together tonight.   I am here to speak against the censorship of conservative outlets by  AT&T and DIRECTV.   On April 16, 1963, Martin Luther King, Jr., was confined in a  Birmingham, Alabama, jail. His crime? Fighting Jim Crow segregation and  showing the injustice to the American people through peaceful,  nonviolent protest.   He shared his thoughts through a letter titled: ``Letter from  Birmingham Jail.'' He gave millions of Americans the opportunity to  read the thoughts of reason and one of faith in the Judeo-Christian  values upon which our Nation was founded. Dr. King was someone who  believed in the innate goodness of American's justice-seeking heart.   He stated in that letter: ``Injustice anywhere in this country is  injustice everywhere.''   We see injustice in the canceling of conservative voices by board  members and executives who cowardly hide in secret behind closed doors,  using the power granted to them through the corporate name built by  other American-loving business leaders. AT&T and DIRECTV have in the  last 2 years deplatformed two very prominent and successful  conservative platforms, OAN and Newsmax.   The cancel culture is driven by the insecure, the weak, and the  intellectually lazy who work in the shadows to control the American  heart. This is because they feel inept and unable through meritocracy  to compete and change the American heart.   We are standing in Congress today to fight against injustice. It is  an injustice that literally threatens our freedom. The power brokers of  the early 1900s focused on controlling the marketplace of property,  wealth, and industry. Today's power brokers are focused on controlling  the marketplace of thoughts, ideas, and communication. In doing so,  they steal the American people's opportunity for unity.                                time  1900    There will never be American unity without the freedom of speech, to  be heard, and our thoughts to be judged by one another.   Ignorant and free can never be. Those who seek to keep us ignorant,  regardless of how powerful and popular they are, are not the friends of  freedom. They are not friends of the American way.   I call on all Americans to join us in this fight against censorship  and preserve our freedom.
