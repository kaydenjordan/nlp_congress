 Mr. President, I was unable to attend the rollcall  vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination of James Richard  Kvaal, of Massachusetts, to be Under Secretary of Education. I am  supportive of his nomination and would have voted in support of  cloture.                            ____________________
