 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Archbishop  Hoban boys' basketball team from Ohio's 13th Congressional District and  the city of Akron for winning the Division I boys basketball  championship for the year 2023.   On Sunday, the Archbishop Hoban Knights defeated Pickerington Central  53-47 in the Division I championship, marking the team's first title in  34 years. This was Archbishop Hoban's first appearance at the State  championship since they last won the title in 1989.   These student athletes have made the entire Akron community proud and  continue to display their excellence, determination, and work ethic  both on the court and in the classroom.   I also congratulate head coach T.K. Griffith, who has led the Hoban  boys' basketball program for 30 years, as well as the staff, trainers,  parents, cheerleaders, and everyone who helped carry these student  athletes over the finish line.   They are, in fact, the reason why Ohio 13 is the birthplace of  champions.   Congratulations one more time to Ohio 13's Champions of the Week, the  fearless Knights, for bringing the Division I trophy back home to  Akron.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Moore for organizing  this Special Order hour so that we can recognize women who have led the  way who are trailblazers, history makers, glass breakers, and overall  fantastic human beings.   You may know or you may not know, Mr. Speaker, that Ohio has elected  13 women to Congress. These women have been incredible role models and  leaders for girls and women as well as boys and men across this  country, but particularly for us in Ohio.   I am going to take a few moments today just to talk about a few of  those women, just about eight of them, starting in 1977 with the first  Democratic woman elected to Congress from Ohio. Her name was Mary Rose  Oakar. She, at the age of 36, was one of the youngest women ever  elected to Congress and the first Arab-American woman ever elected to  Congress in the United States.   Mr. Speaker, the next Democratic woman elected to Congress, you know  her, we all serve with her, she is the dean of the Ohio delegation and  the longest-serving woman in Congress, Marcy Kaptur. She has been  called the queen of the Great Lakes because of her advocacy. But there  is nothing you can mistake about Congresswoman Kaptur that would make  you think that she did not believe strongly in the people of Toledo and  the people of northwest Ohio.   Our third Democratic woman from Ohio was none other than Stephanie  Tubbs Jones, the first Black woman elected from the State of Ohio.   Unfortunately, Congresswoman Tubbs Jones lost her life in 2008, but I  got to know her and my family got to know her very well. Her spirit and  her passion were unmatched. The people of Cleveland were the people  whom she always, always championed.   Something that she said stuck out to me. I want to read it to you  here, Mr. Speaker, because this is a great reminder for all of us who  serve in this hallowed institution. She said that if they--our  constituents--are willing to stand at the polls for countless hours in  the rain, then I should surely stand up for them here in Congress.   The fourth woman from Ohio I would like to acknowledge is  Congresswoman--now judge of the Ninth District Court of Appeals--Betty  Sutton. She was the youngest woman elected, and I am honored to take  her seat, Ohio's 13th District in Congress. Betty Sutton was not only a  Member of Congress, now the judiciary, but also local city, county, and  State elected office.                                time  2015    Following Betty Sutton, I am going to acknowledge Marcia Fudge, a  woman who certainly needs no introduction, who now serves as the  Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Congresswoman, now  Secretary, Fudge served the House from northeast Ohio honorably for  seven terms, and we are grateful for her new position where she leads  this Nation in affordable housing for all people, no matter where they  may reside across the country.   Mary Jo Kilroy, the Congresswoman from central Ohio served one term,  and she was a vocal supporter of the Affordable Care Act. It is a  fitting tribute to talk about her today, considering it is the 13th  anniversary of that bill passing. She was instrumental in a very  important vote ensuring healthcare for people across this Nation.   The first Democratic minority leader in the Ohio House you may not  know, Mr. Speaker, was none other than Joyce Beatty. She was the former  CBC chair, most recently serving, and someone who I was able to follow  in the Ohio legislature. She is a towering figure here in Congress, and  we are so excited to have her as a leader in central Ohio.   Shontel Brown, who won not one, not two, but three elections in a  very short amount of time to make sure that folks knew how serious she  was about representing the people of northeast Ohio. She came from  Warrensville Heights City Council to the Cuyahoga County Council to  becoming the first Black woman to lead the Cuyahoga County Democratic  Party.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, I am number 13, Emilia Sykes, representing the  13th Congressional District of Ohio and Ohio's 13th female Member  elected to Congress.   Mr. Speaker, as I close my remarks, I remind those who may be  watching that none of us would be here, none of the women that we have  talked about, without the gracious and tenacious activities of the  suffragettes who made sure that we even had the right to vote so we  could stand here in Congress to advocate for our communities.   I always like to talk about Sojourner Truth. Although she was not a  Member of Congress and although she was not a person from Ohio, she  gave a very important speech in my district, Ohio 13, called Ain't I a  Woman. At the end of that speech, she reminded us that if the first  woman that God ever made was strong enough to turn this world upside  down, then all these women together ought to be able to get it right  side up again.   That is the legacy of the women from Ohio and throughout the Nation  who have served in this Congress have done, get this world right side  up again.
