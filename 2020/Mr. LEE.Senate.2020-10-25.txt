 Mr. President, it is an honor and a privilege to speak on  behalf of the confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme  Court of the United States today.   One of Judge Barrett's familiar themes, one that she has invoked in  speeches when speaking about the Constitution and about the role of the  Federal judiciary, involves a line from Odysseus. It involves a  reference to the ``Odyssey.''   She says:         The Constitution is like when Odysseus ties himself to the       mast to resist the song of the Sirens. And he tells his crew,       `Don't untie me no matter how much I plead.' That's what       we've done as the American people with the Constitution.       We've said . . . it's the people sober appealing to the       people drunk, [that when you are tempted to get untied], that       when you are tempted to get carried away by your passions and       trample upon the First Amendment rights or minority rights,       this document will hold you back.    Judge Barrett points out a very critical matter here, an absolutely  essential matter, which is, first of all, that the whole point of  having a Constitution involves restraining and restricting government.  As it relates to the judiciary, it involves acknowledging the  necessarily limited, finite, and confined role of the judiciary.   Sometimes when people refer to the three branches of the Federal  Government, they will get it backward. Sometimes people will refer to  the judicial branch as if it were the most powerful. This gets it  exactly backward. It was designed to be--and, in fact, is--the least  dangerous branch of the three branches. That is not to say it is not  the most dangerous of all. Government, generally, is something that  while necessary is also dangerous just like water or fire or wind or  oxygen or any of the things that we depend upon for our day-to-day  existence.   Government, including the power of the judiciary itself, has to be  managed carefully, and it has to be channeled. If it is not, we become  dangerous. So that is why we have a Constitution. It is to restrain  government because government is force. Government is nothing more or  nothing less than the collective, coercive use of force. We use it to  protect life, liberty, and property. We use it to make sure that people  don't harm each other and to make sure that we are protected from our  adversaries within and without our borders, our boundaries. Yet, if we  lose sight of what government does and what it doesn't do, what it can  and cannot do, what it may or may not do, or what any branch of the  government may do, we find ourselves in troubled, troubled waters.  [[Page S6555]]    The reason I say that the judicial branch is the least dangerous of  the three is that it doesn't possess the power to say what should be,  only what is. The power of the legislative branch, where we serve, is  the most dangerous of the three because we have the power to prohibit  conduct. We have the power to prescribe policy. We make the law.    The second most dangerous power is probably that which is held in the  executive branch. It has been made more dangerous over the last 80  years as Democrats and Republicans alike have ceded more power to the  executive branch, voluntarily relinquishing the role, which is  uniquely, distinctively, and by constitutional mandate ours, over  mostly to unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats who are, in some cases,  the President of the United States or those who serve under his employ.   The judicial branch possesses neither the power of the purse nor the  power of the sword. We have the power of the purse. We spend the money.  We prescribe the policy. The executive branch has the power to  implement and force and execute the laws, hence the power of the sword.  The judicial branch possesses only the power to decide what the law  says. In that respect, it is operating as if through a rearview mirror.  It is not saying what will come or what should be but what already is,  what the law means as it already exists.   In order to do that, the judicial branch has to come to a conclusion  that our laws consist of words; that those words have meaning; and  that, in order to tie themselves to the constitutional mast in order to  make sure that they themselves are able to resist the siren call of  power and to keep each of the three branches of government in check  insofar as it is their prerogative to do so, they have to check back  continually and check themselves constantly with the words of the U.S.  Constitution and the words of the law itself.   Yes, it matters. Yes, these things are easily ignored. These powers  are easily abused. In fact, they often have been abused. There are a  number of reasons for this. They have to do mostly with human nature  itself. Human beings, while redeemable, are flawed. They crave power.  They tend to act toward those things that make them more powerful if  they are already in positions of government authority. That is why it  is easy to understand why, from time to time, the courts stray.   Now, I want to be very clear at the outset. The Federal court system,  notwithstanding its flaws, is the best of its kind in the world. There  is no judicial system anywhere in the world that I am aware of that is  as respected or as consistently dedicated to the rule of law, to  interpreting the law consistently and faithfully as is our Federal  court system.   The Supreme Court of the United States, while it has made some very  bad decisions along the way, for the most part, gets things right. In  fact, it is something that may come as a surprise to many Americans  that of all of the decisions that the Supreme Court decides in a  typical year, in modern times, it is most common that the Supreme Court  decides those questions either unanimously or with near unanimity. Most  cases at the Supreme Court are decided with a vote of 9 to 0 or 8 to 1  or 7 to 2--the overwhelming majority, in fact.   Keep in mind, these are cases that with very few exceptions have  proven difficult for the lower courts. They have caused some of the  greatest legal minds in our country to address the same finite legal  questions and to come up with different results. Yet those on the  Supreme Court of the United States, for the most part, decide these  cases with unanimity or nearly unanimity. Why?   Well, most of the time, they tie themselves to the mast. They  remember what is their charge. They remember that they are there not to  decide matters of policy but to decide questions of law. They can't  just reach out and say, I don't like this type of law. Let's go after  this type of law and attack it or undermine it or let's pursue this  line of law that should be in place and isn't.   They don't have that authority. They have to have a case or a  controversy, meaning one or more parties that can properly invoke the  jurisdiction of the Court, and they have to have an actual, live, ripe  dispute between people who are actively affected by the law. Then and  only then may the Court act.   From time to time, however, the Court has been tempted to give in to  the siren call--to make law. It isn't always with the same political  objectives in mind, and those objectives can change over time. To cite  one of many examples that we could point to today, I am going to refer  to a decision made by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1905 in  a case called Lochner v. New York.   In that case, the State of New York had enacted some laws governing  minimum wage and maximum hour issues for bakery employees in the State  of New York. The Supreme Court of the United States decided that those  laws were bad and that they didn't like them, and on that basis, it  said in essence: These laws are bad, and they are so bad that they must  be unconstitutional. They are so bad, and they lack any legitimate  purpose that we can see. We are, therefore, going to deem this part of  the due process protections, the due process protections that are  covered by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and allow us to  impose our judicial authority on State law and invalidate that State  law.   Their reasoning essentially amounted to that: We don't see any good  reason for this law. We, therefore, deem it incompatible, inconsistent,  irreconcilable with due process, and we hereby strike it down as  unconstitutional.   This, in my view, was wrong. It was a problem. It was a political  dispute that was becoming increasingly common as the Progressive Era  was gaining momentum.   Conservatives in the country were losing many of these battles in  many lawmaking bodies, including, apparently, the New York State  legislature. They didn't like it. So these particular jurists on this  particular day chose to exercise their authority as jurists to strike  down that law even though it was really a political argument they were  making, even though it wasn't within their jurisdiction.   So they stretched the meaning of the law. They stretched out the  concept of due process so that they could declare this to be a  constitutional violation.   They took debatable matters beyond debate--not only beyond debate,  but they took them outside the proper realm of State law jurisdiction  and outside the context of legislation and debate surrounding such  legislation within political branches of governments generally, whether  State or Federal. They said: This is now Federal. We are going to make  it Federal, such that you can't legislate in this area because we don't  like it, and because we don't like it, we are going to say that it is  part of the Constitution; it is part of your due process protection,  notwithstanding the fact that due process, as the name implies, is  about process. It is about making sure that you have your day in court,  making sure that you have access to tools connected to fundamental  fairness on procedural questions, not an outcome.   So in Lochner v. New York, the Supreme Court Justices untied  themselves, as it were, from the mast of the Constitution. They did so  in a way that was harmful and unsustainable. They did so  notwithstanding the fact that there was no logical end point to this.  It was very difficult to conceive of any question of public policy that  could not and, ultimately, would not come before the Supreme Court of  the United States if you used their standard of analysis: This law  doesn't really do anything good. It is not something that has a  legitimate purpose, so we are going to strike it down.   Fortunately, the Supreme Court of the United States--it took many  years to do it--eventually saw the error of its ways and eventually  overturned Lochner v. New York. In many instances we ought to look back  at that moment and say that we don't really want the Supreme Court  taking debatable matters beyond debate. That is how political  accountability works in this country. If you have something that you  don't like as a matter of policy, you ought to try to change it before  the legislative body in which it is properly considered. Now, if it is  unconstitutional, yes, it should be unconstitutional. I am not one who  focuses obsessively on judicial activism for fear that by focusing  obsessively on judicial activism, we will perpetuate the  [[Page S6556]]  idea that really what we want is judicial passivity. We don't want  either. It is just as bad to invalidate as unconstitutional a law that  is, in fact, not unconstitutional as it is to leave intact an  unconstitutional law that is constitutionally defective. Both are  equally repugnant to the Constitution. Both represent an effort by  jurists to untether themselves from the mast of the Constitution and  from the finite judicial role.   Justice Scalia was someone who was nominated to the Supreme Court of  the United States in 1986. He was confirmed overwhelmingly, by a vote  of 98 to 0, if I recall.   Justice Scalia was someone who, while a law professor, and later,  while serving as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC  Circuit, had acknowledged the need for judges to keep themselves  tethered to the mast, had acknowledged the need for them to focus on  deciding cases based on the law rather than on the basis of favorable  policy outcomes.   This was at once a somewhat revolutionary idea at the time, and yet  it wasn't overwhelmingly controversial at the time, given the fact that  he was confirmed by a vote of 98 to 0 to the Supreme Court of the  United States.   But over the next three decades or so, while he served on the Supreme  Court of the United States, Justice Scalia revived--he restored--this  concept, this constitutional understanding of the proper role of  government and of the proper role of each branch of the Federal  Government, including and especially the judicial branch of the Federal  Government.   During his service on the Supreme Court of the United States, he was  able to mentor a number of law clerks, including Judge Amy Coney  Barrett.   Judge Barrett has explained that she believes in the same line of  reason. She believes that judges and Justices need to tether themselves  to the mast of the Constitution. They need to confine their role to  that that involves judging, and they need to not covet and, ultimately,  try to overtake the role of the elected lawmaker or the role of the  executive. One has the power of policy and the purse; the other, the  power of the sword.   But as Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 78, there is a  profound difference between these powers. The legislative branch, he  explained, has the power of will. It exercises will when it decides  what should and should not be within the law.   The power of the judiciary, by contrast, involves only the power of  judgment, to decide what the law says. That is the kind of jurist we  need today.   Now, make no mistake--this is not a conflict that involves a desire  to put on the Supreme Court of the United States people who will wage  political warfare within the judicial branch from the conservative  side. It is not that. It is not anything close to that. In fact, it is  the opposite of that.   We don't want Judge Barrett on the Supreme Court to be our advocate.  We want Judge Barrett on the Supreme Court to decide law, to decide  cases based on what the law says, to keep herself tethered to that mast  because it is through that mast that our rights are protected, that we  are able to elect people who will exercise sound judgment in deciding  what the law should be. And, yes, we want them to strike down laws when  they are unconstitutional. But, no, we don't want them striking them  down simply because of a policy disagreement.   In fact, all of our political, our economic, and our civil rights end  up being tied to this very feature within our government. They are all  protected by the willingness of our jurists to keep themselves tethered  to the constitutional mast, just as Odysseus insisted on being tied to  his. Notwithstanding how hard he might plead upon hearing the call of  the sirens, he knew that it was important for him to stay on task, to  stay focused on his job.   Judge Amy Coney Barrett is an exceptionally well qualified and  talented legal mind and jurist. She is bright. She is articulate. She  is, as we have seen, unflappable, and she is willing to set her mind on  that course--to uphold and protect and defend that document that I  believe was written by wise men raised up by Almighty God for that very  purpose   That document, insofar as we have followed it, has fostered the  greatest development of the greatest civilization the world has ever  known. I hope that it ever will be that way because it is a strong and  sure foundation upon which we have built, but we need people who  believe in that foundation and are willing to tie themselves to it.   Thank you.
