 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in  support of H.R. 2471, the Haiti Development, Accountability, and  Institutional Transparency Initiative Act. I thank Congressman Jeffries  for his leadership in offering this important piece of legislation that  will ensure that we take stock of U.S. policy in Haiti and measure our  progress in addressing corruption, improving governance, and advancing  the rule of law.   Haiti is facing one of its worst outbreaks of violence since 1986.  This has had a devastating impact on the Haitian people and threatened  any long-term progress we have made. We have seen this movie before.  Instead of continuing the same approach and hoping for a different  outcome, it is critical that as we are conducting our long-overdue  review of policy, we are analyzing the drivers and risks of conflict,  instability, and violence in Haiti.   This bill sets out to do just that and more. The amendment I offered  in committee requires the State Department and USAID to conduct an  assessment of conflict, instability, and violence in Haiti, analyzing  the systemic patterns and causes of violence and the role of actors and  beneficiaries who play a part.   This bill also makes sure that State and USAID are consulting with  NGOs and civil society groups in Haiti, a critical step that is often  overlooked.   As someone who has worked in conflict stabilization at the State  Department, I know how important it is that we understand the root  causes of violence in order to craft sound policy and make decisions on  where to focus our foreign assistance. This bill would ensure our  review of U.S. policy in Haiti takes this important step.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.
