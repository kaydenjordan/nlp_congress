 Mr. President, this is a meritorious issue, obviously,  involving veterans. But at this late juncture, after the weeks we have  spent in deliberation both in the committee and then on the floor, it  is not yet--this particular amendment--ready so that there is no  opposition on my side. Since there is opposition, I would like to  inform the Senate and the chairman of that situation.    Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.   Mr. President, I rise, once again, to express my support for the  National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2021. I want to  commend the chairman for his leadership and his thoughtfulness  throughout this whole process.   I am pleased, as we all are, that we will be voting soon on passage.  I believe this is an excellent bill. I believe it provides the men and  women of our military with resources and the authorizations needed to  defend our Nation, while at the same time taking care of their  families. It was crafted after a series of thoughtful hearings,  discussion, and debate on both sides of the aisle. It was passed out of  committee with strong bipartisan support.   Most importantly, I am very pleased that this bill has had such full  consideration on the Senate floor. For the first time in a long time,  we were able to come to an agreement to debate and vote on several  amendments. In addition, we were able to adopt over 140 amendments from  Members on both sides of the aisle.   I want to, again, thank Senator Inhofe for his leadership getting the  Defense authorization bill to this point, overcoming the many  challenges posed by the pandemic and by other factors that made this a  very unusual year. I look forward to working with him as we go into  conference.   Finally, I would like to thank the committee staff who have worked so  hard. I specifically want to recognize, as the chairman has, the staff  director, John Bonsell, for the Republicans and the staff director for  the Democrats, Elizabeth King. They worked together. They are diligent.  They are bipartisan. They are thoughtful. They are the best examples of  a staff member of the U.S. Senate.   I would also like to thank my staff on the Democratic side: Jody  Bennett, Carolyn Chuhta, Jon Clark, Jonathan Epstein, Jorie Feldman,  Creighton Greene, Ozge Guzelsu, Gary Leeling, Kirk McConnell, Maggie  McNamara Cooper, Bill Monahan, Mike Noblet, John Quirk, Arun Seraphin,  Fiona Tomlin, and, once again, staff director Elizabeth King.   Also, let me thank the floor staff and the leadership staff. You have  been part of this process for the last several weeks, and you have done  a remarkable job. We thank you for that very, very much. You  facilitated our efforts.   Finally, I would urge all of my colleagues to vote for this very  excellent bill.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, with the U.S. economy reeling, millions of  families struggling, and COVID-19 cases soaring in states around the  country, this is exactly the wrong time to cut off or massively cut  back unemployment insurance as Republicans are proposing.   Unemployment insurance is a financial lifeline to tens of millions of  Americans. And it also provides a big boost for small businesses . . .  and communities. Because in addition to helping those who've lost their  jobs, it effectively injects needed spending into local economies. Cars  don't run without fuel, and the economy won't run without consumers.   The President failed to listen to public health experts and that hurt  public health and the economy. He downplayed the pandemic, derided the  science, and tried to force states to rush their re-openings.   Now he is failing to listen to economic experts across the spectrum  who widely agree that four months into this crisis, the jobs picture is  worsening. Experts are once again warning the President and Republicans  now is NOT the time to cut off unemployment insurance.   Today, more than 31 million Americans--roughly one out of five  workers--are collecting unemployment and thousands of businesses are  shutting their doors. More than 1.4 million workers filed for  unemployment for the first time just last week. Those who predicted a  quick V shaped recovery . . . who misled Americans that the virus would  just disappear on its own were wrong. There will be no economic  recovery until we get the virus under control.   Congress needs to end the shortsighted approach and start taking the  long view. We need a smarter, coordinated, evidence-based approach that  recognizes reality: things are bad. Cutting off UI would make them  exponentially worse.   But look: Hope is not lost. We have the tools, the assets, the  advantages to turn things around. There are proven, effective measures  that we can take, both on the public health front and the economic  front. Let's focus on the economic front:   Economist Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics notes that unemployment  benefits are the most effective dollar-for-dollar stimulus to the  economy, with each dollar of UI translating into $1.61 of economic  activity. Cutting off $600 would slash the weekly income of 20 million  households in half or more overnight. In a recent study, Ernie  Tedeschi, a former economist at the Department of Treasury, projects  that what will follow is a two percent decrease in the nation's gross  domestic product and 1.7 million fewer jobs by the end of this year.   This is not surprising. If Senate Republicans let the enhanced  pandemic unemployment assistance expire, it could tank consumer  spending while increasing business closings that will lead to even more  unemployment. It could also further exacerbate this public health  crisis by forcing more Americans into desperate situations.   That is why I, along with Senator Michael Bennet and Congressman Don  Beyer, have proposed the Worker Relief and Security Act. This  legislation would take politics out of the equation and use ``automatic  stabilizers'' based on actual unemployment rates to ensure the help  goes where it is needed, when it is needed, and expires when it is no  longer needed--rather than leaving it up to Congress and an arbitrary  date.   And look, it's not just individuals who are struggling. Businesses  need help too. That is why I have backed the bipartisan RESTART Act and  today I am introducing the Workforce Retention Act, which would  strengthen and expand work sharing programs that many businesses are  effectively using to keep their workers. This program is a win-win that  offers businesses increased flexibility and payroll support, while  keeping more Americans attached to their jobs.   Right now, business owners who want to keep their doors open are  facing the prospect of having to let go some percentage of their  workforce because of circumstances far beyond their control. Businesses  that are particularly dependent on foot traffic, such as the  hospitality and tourism industries, are only looking at re-opening  later this year or early next year. In many cases, businesses are also  set to lose out on the considerable expense and time they have put in  to hire and train these workers.   With work sharing, struggling companies can reduce hours instead of  their workforce and it helps employers save money on rehiring costs,  while employees who participate in work sharing keep their jobs and  receive a portion of unemployment insurance benefits to make up for  lost wages. Especially in this pandemic, work sharing programs would  allow businesses to retain their employees, easily putting them back on  full-time status once business picks up, and avoid having to lay them  off in the first place.   As part of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act, Congress  enacted legislation that I authored, the Layoff Prevention Act of 2012,  which provided temporary federal financing for 100% of work sharing  benefits paid to workers. According to the Department of Labor, work  sharing saved approximately 570,000 jobs in the wake of the Great  Recession. Multiple studies have found that communities that adopted  more robust work-sharing programs weathered the recession with lower  unemployment rates.   Mark Zandi estimates that temporary financing of work share offers a  very high ``bang for the buck'' of $1.69 . . . making it a critical  companion to traditional UI benefits. It's another win-win policy that  has been field-tested and demonstrated to work well in more than 20  states across the country. Simply put, work sharing helps more workers,  businesses, and communities stay afloat, and positions them for a  stronger economic recovery.   The Workforce Retention Act that I am introducing today along with  Senators Whitehouse, Merkley, and Van Hollen, enhances the program and  encourages states with existing work share laws to utilize them more  frequently. It incentivizes states without work sharing laws to stop  denying their businesses an easy and effective way to retain employees.  This legislation is supported by the National Employment Law Center and  the Economic Policy Institute.   It builds off the $100 million initiative included in the CARES Act,  stemming from my Layoff Prevention Act of 2020, by extending federal  financing for states with permanent and temporary work sharing programs  by two years. It would incentivize states to structure their work  sharing laws to reduce barriers to entry for companies . . .  particularly for small businesses that have been hard hit by this  pandemic. Our bill also provides much-needed federal grants to state  unemployment agencies to improve implementation and administration.   States would also qualify under a new grant program for meeting  certain enrollment incentive benchmarks and increasing the number of  work share claims as a percentage of their overall unemployment  insurance weekly claims.   This is a cost-effective job preservation program and we need to  invest in ensuring it is accessible to help more businesses, preserve  more jobs, and save taxpayers billions of dollars in the long run.   Our economy can't afford more of the same mistakes that have deepened  this crisis and steepened the economic climb back out. America controls  its own destiny, and we have the tools and know-how to succeed. Other  nations have fared much better during this crisis because their elected  leadership took COVID more seriously. They encouraged people to wear  masks. Other heads of state didn't taunt regions into reopening before  it was safe to do so. And they invested in unemployment insurance and  economic stimulus.   Ending unemployment insurance in the midst of a surging pandemic  could  [[Page S4475]]  make a desperate situation worse for individuals and harm the economy.  Being jobless in these uncertain times and relying on unemployment is  stressful enough. If Congress cuts benefits off too soon and tries to  prematurely push workers into unsafe environments, it will cost  families, businesses, and communities alike.   It is beyond the pale that the Administration and Senate Republicans  purposely put off action for months. Everyone knew the virus was not  going to disappear. It's a perfect example of the Trump view of one set  of rules that provides benefits for him, and nothing for everyone else.  Incompetence and willful avoidance is not a policy, and it's time for  Republicans to stop drawing up new ways to seem like they're helping  people and come to the table with solid ideas that actually do  something meaningful.   It is my hope that we can proceed in a bipartisan manner on another  round of coronavirus legislation. This next relief bill must include  extended and enhanced unemployment insurance benefits tied to economic  and health conditions, and expanded work sharing, to keep families,  businesses, and states solvent through this crisis. I urge my  colleagues to join us in supporting these needed initiatives.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Baldwin, and Ms. Smith):   S. 4314. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to address  the teacher and school leader shortage in early childhood, elementary,  and secondary education, and for other purposes; to the Committee on  Finance.
