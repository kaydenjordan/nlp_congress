 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I have a great deal of respect for my  friend from Pennsylvania, as we have worked together on a number of  issues, but forgive me if my blood boils when I hear my Republican  friends talk about breaking precedent in this body when it comes to the  consideration of Supreme Court nominees. Forgive me if I get a little  angry when I hear those on the other side of the aisle talk about  Democrats' using exceptional measures, in their opinion, in order to  oppose a Justice for the Supreme Court. Come on. Everybody knows what  happened here last year. The Republican majority decided to deny the  President of the United States--at the time, Barack Obama--the ability  under the U.S. Constitution to nominate a Justice to the Supreme Court,  not because of anything having to do with the merits of the nominee,  Merrick Garland, but simply because the President was a Democrat.  Everybody knows that is what happened. Everyone knows that precedent  was broken and that comity was broken here in the Senate when the  Republican majority decided not just to deny a vote on this floor but  not to even give the courtesy of a meeting, of a hearing to Merrick  Garland despite the fact that he was unquestionably qualified for that  position.   It is a fiction to suggest that there is some strategy amongst  Democrats on this nomination. We are all making up our minds  individually. I decided yesterday that I was not going to support  [[Page S2089]]  Judge Gorsuch because I think he is likely going to side on behalf of  corporations and special interests instead of my constituents and bring  his politics to the bench in a way that I do not think squares with the  people whom I represent. Yes, I am going to use my ability to vote on  the floor of the Senate in order to stop his nomination.   I understand Republicans may not be happy about my decision and the  decisions of others on this side of the aisle, but let's have a  discussion about the merits of Judge Gorsuch, not the question of which  side is breaking precedent because everybody remembers what happened to  Merrick Garland. Nobody has forgotten that. This is not some quid pro  quo, this is not some tit for tat, but to come down and pretend as if  2016 did not happen.   Mr. President, I would like to speak for a moment about a potential  CRA--another CRA--that is perhaps coming to the floor this week or next  week. It is one that would take away the ability of States to try to do  something about the retirement crisis that is enveloping this country.   I speak as one of the youngest Members of this Chamber, and it scares  me to death to think that half of Americans who are in their working  years have no money saved for retirement today before a qualification  for Social Security or Medicare. Even worse, a study that I looked at  the other day suggested that 58 percent of Americans who are working  have not even done the calculations as to how much money they will need  in order to retire.   There is a retirement crisis in this country, and you can understand  why, as wages have been essentially flat for tens of millions of  Americans and employers have largely left the space of defined benefit  plans. And there is just no money to save when you have to cobble  together your paycheck to meet your budget every week and when your  employer is not putting in the kind of plan he used to and the kind of  contribution he used to. So you can understand why Americans are in  this position.   State governments--those laboratories of experiments that I hear a  lot of my friends talk about--have come up with an idea. There are 55  million working Americans who do not have a way to save for retirement  out of their regular paychecks, meaning their employers are not  offering them any way to set aside a portion of their incomes in order  to save.   So that is one number--55 million Americans. Here is another: In my  State, 44 percent of workers do not have access to retirement plans  through their employers. That is about 600,000 people in Connecticut.  Half of my State does not have access, when they show up to work, to  retirement savings plans through their employers. Yet we know that  employees who have access to a payroll deduction are 15 times more  likely to save for retirement--not twice as likely, not 5 times as  likely, but 15 times more likely.   It stands to reason that State legislatures would step in and say:  OK, for employers who are not offering plans, we are going to give  employees the ability to set aside a small portion of their earnings in  a privately run plan that is sponsored through the State governments.   If the employer is not going to do it, then there is really no one  else other than the State governments. In a handful of occasions, the  States of decided to step in and offer this option to employees.   By the way, as far as I understand, it is not traditionally a State- run plan; it is a privately run plan. It is just that the State is  acting as the conduit to get employees linked with private plans and to  allow for a small portion of their paychecks to be set aside. Employees  are 15 times more likely to save if they have access to that payroll  deduction.   This is a pretty run-of-the-mill, typical State intervention in order  to try to solve a problem that is real for State legislators. So it is  a mystery to me as to why we would try to take that ability away from  States.   What we are doing is taking away an ERISA exemption for States  relative to these plans. Why that is important is that ERISA is all  about the employer-employee relationship. There are important  responsibilities that flow from employers to employees when they are  engaging in a retirement plan that is offered through the workplace.  But the State is not the employer of this individual; the State is  simply acting as a conduit to get that employee into a private sector  plan. So the ERISA rules simply do not work. They are a mismatch for  this State innovation. The Federal Government, through regulation, has  recognized that.   Importantly, in my State of Connecticut, which does have one of these  plans, we provide ERISA-like protections, so the protections you get in  ERISA, you get through this State innovation. It is just that the way  in which the Federal Government normally requires it does not make  sense because the State in this case is just the conduit, not the  employer.    This sort of seems like a pretty run-of-the-mill exercise of State  innovative power, a fairly run-of-the-mill exercise of Federal  regulatory authority to allow for this innovation to happen, and it is  hard to understand why we are taking it away, why we are taking this  ability away from 600,000 Connecticut residents who, frankly, will not  have access to easy retirement savings without it.   We have known that set-asides in your paycheck work. That is why we  have provided incentives for employers to do it. But not every employer  does it. Why? Because if you are a small employer, it just may not make  sense administratively to establish one of these plans. So States have  decided to offer it themselves.   I know that the retirement industry may not love this idea because it  might not make the same fees on these plans as it would if the plans  were offered through the employer, but, frankly, these hundreds of  thousands of people in my State are not going to be the retirement  companies' customers without this innovation. It is not like these  State-backed plans are stealing business from the private retirement  plans. They were never going to be customers without their ability to  put aside a little bit of money.   We have a retirement crisis in this country right now, and this is an  innovative way to solve it. I know this is not yet scheduled for a  vote, a Congressional Review Act vote that would take away the ability  of States to offer these plans in a meaningful way, and I really hope  we think twice about it. It sort of feels like we are just inventing  CRAs to bring before the Senate and the House. We are kind of scraping  the bottom of the barrel, and this one just does not make sense. This  does not make sense.   Let States that want to pass this innovation, that want to give their  constituents, their citizens the ability to save through payroll  deductions, through payroll withholding, the ability to do that. Do not  do the bidding of the big retirement providers, who may think they are  going to make more money if the CRA passes, but in reality these folks  were probably never their customers. Let States move forward with this  innovation. Let the people of Connecticut and California see how it  works so that maybe other States can learn from our experience.   I hope we can come to some agreement to leave this innovation alone  and move on to some other important issue here and not risk doing  something that is, frankly, going to exacerbate the retirement crisis  that exists in this country. Republicans and Democrats should be trying  to work together on this question of giving people more access to  retirement plans.   For all of the things that we fight over, whether it be the  healthcare law or whether it be a tax cut bill or a budget, this just  seems like one of these issues in which we should set this CRA aside  with respect to State innovations and try to find a way to find some  common ground. I hope that is where we will head. It would really  matter to my constituents in Connecticut, who are expecting to receive  the benefit of this newfound access to retirement.   I yield the floor.
