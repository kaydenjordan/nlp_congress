 Mr. Speaker, energy security and climate action are ripe  for bipartisan cooperation in this Congress. Unfortunately, H.R. 1 is a  partisan grab bag that fails to meet the challenge before us and  reverses our climate progress in many cases.   H.R. 1 would eliminate the methane emissions reduction program, the  greenhouse gas reduction fund, and energy efficiency and  electrification incentives that reduce energy demand and costs for  Americans, all vital components of the Inflation Reduction Act.   Last week, climate scientists issued their starkest warning yet that  the world must cut emissions by 60 percent by 2035 to limit the  planet's rise in temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We don't have time  to waste refighting the battles of last year.   Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said they  don't want a bill that favors one type of energy over the other. The  problem is that their bill, H.R. 1, explicitly favors fossil fuels. It  ramps up oil and gas leasing and exploration over the clean, affordable  fuels and technologies of the future.    Right now, pipelines that carry fossil fuels are already expedited  and given regulatory exemptions, while transmission lines, which  transmit electricity long distances from all energy sources, don't get  the same preferential treatment. The current system favors fossil  fuels, risking our energy and climate security.   Look, it is not all bad. There are pieces of H.R. 1 that I believe we  can work together on--a better process for determining the level of  review to apply to a project, reusing existing data instead of  reinventing the wheel at each step, and creating presumptive timelines  for reviews so that projects are not indefinitely stalled. I am more  than willing to admit that NEPA, a law from 1970, can be updated to  meet today's challenges. In fact, clean energy permit reform is  required to meet our climate goals, but this proposal fails to match  the scale of our climate challenge.   The current power grid took 150 years to build. To get to net-zero  emissions by 2050, we have to triple its size in the next 30 years.   According to Americans for a Clean Energy Grid, North America has  built just 7 gigawatts of interregional transmission since 2014, less  than half of that in the United States, so let's say 4. South America  has built 22, Europe 44, and China 260 gigawatts of interregional  transmission.   We currently have enough wind, solar, and storage projects in the  pipeline to power nearly 85 percent of our economy, but 80 percent of  those projects could be canceled due to insufficient transmission.   This decade, we will need to deploy solar and wind at five to six  times our historical record pace. We need to be laser-focused on making  it easier, not harder, to build clean energy because all the money in  the world can't solve the climate crisis if we leave it in the bank or  don't move fast enough.   Our country prides itself on accomplishing big things together,  whether it is winning a world war, constructing an interstate highway,  or discovering the next big medical breakthrough. During World War II,  San Diego war factories built a bomber an hour to help combat fascism  and support our Allies. During COVID-19, we developed a vaccine in less  than 2 years when 10 to 15 years is the norm. Today, we are debating  whether a decade is an appropriate amount of time to construct one  single transmission line, an offshore wind facility, or a geothermal  plant.   With a climate crisis that requires us to move at scale and speed  orders of magnitude greater than ever before, we can't be bogged down  in reviews and litigation before we even begin to build a given  project.   We can fix our judicial review processes to protect vulnerable  communities while preventing wealthy NIMBYs, corporations, and bad  actors from blocking essential clean energy projects, which is what is  happening right now.   We can reduce the level of review for climate projects on non- sensitive land  [[Page H1470]]  while ensuring that polluting projects remain heavily scrutinized.   What we can't do is simply stand by and accept the status quo that is  bogging down clean-energy projects that will combat extreme weather and  climate catastrophes that threaten vulnerable communities, endangered  species, and stable economies.   Mr. Speaker, I am ready for us to get to this vote on a bill that has  no chance of becoming law to get it out of the way so that both sides  can come together to work on a bipartisan solution. I invite any of my  colleagues to come to me and to talk to Chairman Westerman, who has  been working with me on that kind of bipartisan solution. The future of  our planet depends on it. We have no time to waste.                   Welcoming Joe Garcia and Michael Morasco     Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge and welcome Joe Garcia and  Michael Morasco, members of the Escondido City Council, to Washington,  D.C. It is my great honor to now represent that wonderful city in  Congress. I look forward to working with them.                            ____________________
