 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  support of H.R. 2. This vital legislation rebuilds our Nation's  infrastructure, invests in American workers, and bolsters our Nation's  economy, all at a critical juncture in our fight against COVID-19.   This pandemic has cost thousands of Americans their lives and many  more millions their jobs. It is essential that we do everything in our  power to drive investment and boost our economy, and this bill does  just that.   I am particularly pleased that H.R. 2 includes my legislation, the  GREEN Act, which invests over $150 billion in reducing car emissions  and expanding clean energy technologies. That bill extends and expands  Federal tax incentives, promoting investment in solar, wind,  geothermal, and fuel cell technologies, all with the goal of  decarbonizing our atmosphere.   The bill also increases Federal support for energy efficiency,  including in commercial buildings, and revives the energy manufacturing  credit, a successful Recovery Act program designed to spur investment  in renewable energy jobs.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2 represents the kind of bold, forward-thinking  investment our planet and our economy desperately need.   I urge everyone to vote for this bill.
