 Madam Speaker, I rise today in remembrance of  a U.S.-backed coup that, even now, hangs as a cudgel over the people of  Honduras.   Ten years later, Hondurans still face an erosion of human rights amid  unimagined violence, an unaccountable government, lack of opportunity,  and increasingly militarized internal security forces.   Just last week, in response to civilian protests, President Hernandez  deployed the armed forces to quell his critics, a response that not  only is recent, but reoccurring.   When you hear horrific accounts of violence and lawlessness in  Honduras, it is no wonder so many seek a better life in America.   Ten years after the coup, we must own up to our role in the upheaval  in Honduras and come to the aid of the people of Honduras.                            ____________________
