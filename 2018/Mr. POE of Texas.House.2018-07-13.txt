 Madam Speaker, ``This is no NATO for deadbeats,''  to quote Wesley Pruden of The Washington Times.   Some of our NATO allies are beside themselves over President Trump's  calling out our NATO friends for not helping pick up the tab of 2  percent in military spending.   As a member of the U.S. NATO Parliamentary Assembly, I have been  befuddled for years how some of the countries make excuses for not  paying their committed share of NATO defense--defense against the  Napoleon of Siberia, Putin.   Our ever-proper European friends may not remember that American  teenagers went to war and shed blood two times in the last century to  help save Europe. Well, Madam Speaker, Americans have not forgotten the  American sacrifice in those lands over there.   It is time for all NATO countries to be as concerned about European  defense as America is. If President Trump's comments irked the  sensibilities of our allies, well, they should just get the message. It  is time for NATO to buck it up and keep their word and help pay for our  common defense.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 11 o'clock and 23 minutes  a.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until Monday, July  16, 2018, at noon for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
