 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the incredibly  strong city of Flint.   I had a unique relationship with Congressman Dingell, who we lovingly  called ``The Dean'' in Michigan. Because I was a young activist,  ``radical,'' always out there protesting for clean air, protesting for  good-paying jobs, and he was the person who, even though we had  different styles and different approaches to various issues, he never  reduced or tried to silence my voice and many of the voices of the  [[Page H1571]]  young people who were really trying to get the Clean Air Act to be put  in place and have corporate polluters be held accountable.   As I transitioned into elected office in the Michigan Legislature and  became a State representative, within a few months of being a State  representative, there was a corporate billionaire who owned a bridge,  and there was this whole, huge controversy around whether or not he had  a permit or whether or not he was following the environmental impact  statement process that is there on the Federal level.   This is a community where one in five children has asthma. This is  the community I was raised in. It was the first issue that came before  me as a member of the State legislature in Michigan, and I was at a  loss. Many people said, Congressman Dingell, The Dean, has historical,  institutional knowledge of this company, and you should sit down with  him and talk to him.   I was completely taken aback and could not believe that Congressman  Dingell reached out to me right away and also got my residents at that  time a hearing, which you don't usually get with the U.S. Coast Guard,  a hearing that happened in a public school right in the center of the  neighborhood that was directly impacted.   We had over 500 residents that finally felt heard, many of them  giving testimony after testimony of why a corporation needed to follow  the rules, needed to follow the processes for the EPA, the Federal  Highway Administration, and the number of entities that were involved  in possibly a new bridge crossing.                                time  1900    What I also incredibly loved is I remember sitting on a panel about  immigration reform with Congressman Dingell at the University of  Michigan-Ann Arbor. As a city and State rep, I remember coming in to  the capitol, driving about an hour or so. It was a very cold day, and I  believe it was snowing. I was disheveled, as I usually am, and I looked  to him--if you know Congressman Dingell, Mr. Speaker, he always had the  cane, and he would put his cane right between his two knees and just  sit there, and he would look up from his glasses.   I looked at him, and I said: Congressman Dingell, I just don't know  how you have been doing it for so long. This is so hard because they  lie.   He looked at me, and he said--I just loved what he said, because he  turned to me, and he always called me young lady--he said: Young lady,  there is a saying in India that if you stand still enough at the  riverbank--stand still--that your enemies will float by dead.   I have no idea why, but that calmed me because he was teaching me  stillness, but he was also teaching me patience. I just felt so much  better afterward.   We had an incredible panel that uplifted so many of our immigrant  neighbors. Again, from someone who has such a huge and powerful  presence and from me, this young activist who carries a bullhorn in her  car, and I could sit next to this amazing, incredible person and feel  heard, feel seen, and be on a panel with him and serve with him in so  many powerful ways around our environmental justice issues.   I will forever remember the humbling experience as his last ride in  front of the Capitol, to have been serving now in this Chamber that he  served for 59 years, 11 different Presidents. I was telling my 13-year- old son about him. He said: I want to look him up. I want to find out.   I said: You need to, because he is a rarity.   I hope to honor his tremendous legacy by doing the same thing he did,  because I know there will be a generation after me that may be  different and may have a different style, and I never want to ever  shush or silence them in any way and I want them to be heard just like  he did for me.   So I want to thank him from the bottom of my heart for teaching me so  much. I am just so pleased to have been serving by his side in many  ways, but also that he served me and my family for so many years.   I thank Congressman Kildee so much for allowing me to speak about my  dear friend, Congressman John Dingell.
