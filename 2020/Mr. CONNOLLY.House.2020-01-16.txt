 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jeanette Pedone  on her recent retirement as our Assistant Chief Clerk of Debates, after  nearly 17 years of service here in the House.   Jeanette grew up along the eastern seaboard but always enjoyed her  summers in Harvey Cedars, New Jersey. She attended the Fashion  Institute of Technology and the New York School of Interior Design.  Jeanette came to the House from the Stenograph Company, where she was a  sales representative. She first served as an editor for committee  hearings in the Office of Official Reporters in 2003, and she became an  Assistant Chief Clerk of Debates a year later.   Jeanette was a debate clerk for more than 16 years, the longest job  she ever held, and served under four Speakers of the House, four Clerks  of the House, and four Chiefs of the Office of Official Reporters.   As a debate clerk, she coordinated the production of the  Congressional Record from the floor of the House, recording who spoke  on the floor and all parliamentary actions of the House, a pretty big  job. She also assisted the official reporters and editors in gathering  speeches and supplemental information for the Record.   Jeanette was a familiar face on the floor and had a front-row seat to  history. She represented the office at a State of the Union Address,  five speeches to joint meetings of Congress by foreign leaders, and  many important legislative moments here on the floor. But she most  fondly recalls meeting her childhood idol, Patty Duke, and her son, the  actor Sean Astin, when they toured the House floor late one night after  adjournment.   Jeanette retired to Lords Valley, Pennsylvania, with her husband,  Joe. She looks forward to spending more time with her family, including  her daughter, Courtney, and her son, Jeff. She also now has two baby  granddaughters to shower with attention.   Mr. Speaker, we wish Jeanette all the best on behalf of the entire  House of Representatives.                            ____________________
