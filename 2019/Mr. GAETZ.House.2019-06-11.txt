 Madam Speaker, after the Mueller report, we now know that  President Trump was falsely accused of engaging in a criminal  conspiracy with Russia for 22 months. So the question is, what to do  now that we are aware of that false accusation?   Democrats believe that the right approach is to tweeze through all  the President's reactions to being falsely accused. Republicans believe  that we should figure out what the root was of the false accusations in  the first place.   As we endeavor upon that work, we see across the rotunda in the  Senate that harassment of the First Family continues. Donald Trump,  Jr., will be hauled before a Senate committee tomorrow because his  prior testimony purportedly conflicts with the testimony of Mr. Gates  and Mr. Cohen, people who are either in prison for lying or going to  prison for lying.   It is past time to stop the harassment of the President and the First  Family, acknowledge those who engaged in false accusations for an  extended period of time, and figure out how in the world such an  accusation was able to be funded by the DNC, cooked up in the Obama  White House, and then polluted by Russians.   We can do a lot better, and we are going to figure out what happened.                            ____________________
