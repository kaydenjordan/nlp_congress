 Mr. President, today, the Senate voted to confirm  U.S. Magistrate Judge Jennifer Hall to the U.S. District Court for the  District of Delaware.   Judge Hall's significant courtroom experience--as both a litigator  and as a jurist--will make her an excellent addition to the bench. She  received her B.A. from the University of Minnesota, her M. Phil and  Ph.D. from Yale University, and her J.D., magna cum laude, from the  University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. Judge Hall clerked on the  Federal Circuit and the Third Circuit before beginning her legal career  in private practice, working on patent infringement and complex  contract disputes. In 2011, Judge Hall became an assistant U.S.  attorney in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Delaware,  rising to chief of the civil division in 2015. As a prosecutor, she  handled a wide range of criminal and civil matters. In 2019, Judge Hall  was selected to serve as a magistrate judge in the District of  Delaware. Since joining the bench, she has presided over four cases  that have gone to verdict or judgment.   Judge Hall has strong support from her home State Senators, Mr.  Carper and Mr. Coons. In addition, she was unanimously rated ``well  qualified'' by the American Bar Association.   I strongly support the nomination of Judge Hall, and I am glad to see  her confirmed on a broad bipartisan basis.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, the Senate voted to confirm  Julia Kathleen Munley to the U.S. District Court for the Middle  District of Pennsylvania.   Born in Carbondale, PA, Judge Munley received her B.A., magna cum  laude, from Marywood College and her J.D. from the Dickinson School of  Law. She then clerked for Judge Stephen J. McEwen, Jr., on the Superior  Court of Pennsylvania before entering private practice in Scranton.  During her more than 20 years as a litigator in both State and Federal  court, she tried 23 cases to verdict. Notably, she also provided pro  bono representation to a Ground Zero emergency responder before the  September 11th Compensation Fund and helped him recover an award to  compensate him for the health issues that stemmed from his emergency  work. In 2016, Judge Munley was appointed to the Lackawanna County  Court of Common Pleas by then-Governor Tom Wolf. She won election to a  10-year term in 2017. Over the past 7 years, she has handled both civil  and criminal matters, and she has presided over approximately 57  trials.   The American Bar Association unanimously rated Judge Munley ``well  qualified'' to serve on the Middle District of Pennsylvania. She has  the strong support of both of her home  [[Page S5038]]  State Senators--Mr. Casey and Mr. Fetterman--as well as the  Pennsylvania legal community. She has deep ties to the Middle District  of Pennsylvania, and her significant litigation background and  experience as a State court judge will serve her well on the Federal  bench.   I strongly support this nominee, and I am glad to see her  confirmed.                            ____________________
