 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce bipartisan H. Res.  328 with my colleague from Florida, Francis Rooney, celebrating the  50th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem.   For centuries, the Jewish people yearned to pray at the Western Wall,  the only remaining connection to the Great Temple destroyed in 70 A.D.,  a cry that infused their daily prayers.   Fifty years ago, in 1967, this mere hope became a reality when  Jerusalem was finally reunified at the conclusion of the Six-Day War.   Of that precious moment, Yitzhak Rabin recounted: ``We stood among a  tangle of rugged, battle-weary men who were unable to believe their  eyes or restrain their emotions. Their eyes were moist with tears,  their speech incoherent. The overwhelming desire was to cling to the  Wall, to hold on to that great moment as long as possible.''   The reunification of Jerusalem restored the city as a beacon of  religious freedom for all of the Abrahamic religions and the rights of  Jews, Muslims, and Christians to pray at their respective holy sites.   We share the joy of our brothers and sisters as we celebrate this  special milestone and as we continue to strive for a two-state solution  between Israelis and Palestinians. In a world of increasing  instability, our enduring relationship with Israel was never more  [[Page H4234]]  vital, and I am honored to stand with our close friend and ally.                            ____________________
