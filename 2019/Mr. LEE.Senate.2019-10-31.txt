 Mr. President, there is no doubt that we are blessed with  beautiful, useful, and productive lands in our Nation. And there is no  doubt that some of them should be preserved as what they are, which  happen to be national treasures. But, unfortunately, the Federal  Government owns far too much land. It owns far more of these Federal  public lands than it should own and far more of these lands than it can  possibly take care of.   Let's take a look at this map, for example. This shows in red the  land that is owned by the Federal Government in parts of the United  States. The Federal Government owns most of the land. This is certainly  the case in my home State of Utah, where the Federal Government owns  two-thirds of the land. Notice, by the way, that in every State east of  Colorado, the Federal Government owns less than 15 percent of the  land--in most States, significantly less. In every State west of  Colorado, the Federal Government owns more than 15 percent of the land,  and in many cases, a whole lot more than 15 percent.   The sheer volume of land that it owns is nothing short of staggering.  In fact, the Federal Government owns 640 million acres of land. This is  a total larger than the entireties of France, Spain, Germany, Poland,  Italy, the United Kingdom, Austria, Switzerland, and the Netherlands  combined. That is how much land the Federal Government owns just in  America.   With such a vast estate, it is no wonder that there is currently a  $19.38 billion maintenance backlog on those lands. Of that backlog,  $11.92 billion is on lands owned and managed by just the National Park  Service. In fact, there are National Park Service backlogs in every  single State in the country, as this map demonstrates.   I see here that the question is not whether a particular State has a  National Park Service backlog within its State; the question is, How  much? In some States, it is very severe. In some States, it is  significant but not yet severe. But there is a National Park Service  maintenance backlog in every single State.   Many of my colleagues--especially those from the Midwest, as this map  shows--don't have a whole lot of Federal land in their States. They  have a whole lot less Federal land to maintain, and therefore they have  less of a maintenance backlog. They should thank their lucky stars for  that. That is a position to be envied.   On one end of the spectrum, there is a $1.3 million backlog on  National Park Service properties in Delaware. The backlog for the parks  in Rhode Island is just under $1 million. But at the other end of the  spectrum, California alone has a whopping $1.8 billion maintenance  backlog just on its national parks alone. That is in just one State.  What does that mean? That means the damage from wildfires, ill-kept  roads and trails, and neglected facilities have actually kept citizens  from accessing our national treasures--national treasures like Yosemite  and Yellowstone, our National Mall and the Grand Canyon. Visitors who  come from far and wide to see them are either unable to see them at  all, or perhaps they make it, but they don't have a good experience  when they do. All the while, Washington continues to purchase ever more  land, so the maintenance backlog continues to grow.   This must not continue. This staggering, stunning maintenance backlog  on the Federal land that we own--the Federal land that is more than all  of the long list of European countries I mentioned just a minute ago-- can't continue. If we continue on this path, we will only do greater  disservice to  [[Page S6321]]  our citizens and to the lands themselves.   That is why I have introduced an amendment that would stop the  Federal Government's use of taxpayer dollars to acquire more lands in  the next year. Specifically, it would prevent the money currently going  to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Range Improvement Funds,  the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the National Park Service from being  used to acquire new lands that the Federal Government cannot properly  care for.   It is important, when describing a piece of legislation--in this  case, an amendment to another piece of legislation--to explain both  what it does and what it does not do. Let me be very clear in telling  you what this amendment does not do. This amendment would not reduce  the dollar amount being given to any of these programs--not one of  them, not by one dollar. It would simply reauthorize the money to  ensure that it is being used to care for the lands we already own and  lands that need to be cared for so desperately.   While some of my colleagues may disagree with me and may believe that  we should continue growing the Federal estate, I ask that, at least for  this year, we think of our current lands and our existing national  parks and that we think of those States where there are a lot of them  and States where the maintenance backlog is especially staggering.  These lands won't be national treasures for everyone if we don't,  can't, or simply won't properly care for them.   If we continue in this pattern of neglect, there will be treasures  for no one. If we continue with this pattern of neglect, we will  continue to inflict significant environmental harm that, in addition to  being stunning in and of itself, may, in some cases, be difficult or  impossible to reverse.   If you support the environment, if you want to protect the  environment and the natural wonders and beauties with which this land  has been blessed, if you want to protect our national treasures, then  you should vote for this amendment.   Voting against this amendment means you are willing to have the  gluttonous Federal Government continue to acquire more land, even while  it refuses to and professes itself to be utterly incapable of  maintaining the land it has.   For now, at the very least, we ought to ensure that these lands are  safe and accessible for generations to come. Our lands, our citizens,  and our environment deserve nothing less.                   Amendment No. 1209 to Amendment No. 948    (Purpose: To prohibit the expenditure of certain amounts from the  Land and Water Conservation Fund for land acquisition.)    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1209.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be  dispensed with.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now be 2  minutes of debate between each vote in this series and that all votes  after the first be 10 minutes in length.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume consideration on the motion to proceed on H.R. 2740.    Madam President, I would like to speak briefly about an  issue important to me, about an issue important to many Americans, and  I would like to speak briefly about Senator Durbin's recent request for  a hearing concerning the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act.   The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act is a bill that many  Senators have worked for, for nearly a decade, and it has long been a  top priority of mine. I have introduced this bill in every single  Congress, ever since I was first elected to the Senate back in 2010.   During that time, it has been a subject of widespread debate and  discussion. There has been a period of time in which a lot of people  have learned a lot about this area. The debate and the discussion has  occurred both on the Hill and off the Hill throughout the United  States.   Other Members, including Senator Schumer, have sought to pass the  bill, as I am doing. Whether that passage occurs by unanimous consent  or through some other form matters less to me than that we get it  passed, but we do need to get it passed. This year, we have come closer  to making this important and bipartisan reform a reality, closer than  we have ever come before at any point over the nearly decade that this  has gotten a lot of attention.   In early July, the House of Representatives passed the bill on the  Suspension Calendar by a wide bipartisan supermajority vote of 365 to  65. Around that time, I negotiated an agreement with Senator Grassley  to help advance the bill by adding provisions drawn from the Durbin- Grassley H-1B reform bill.   Senator Grassley has for many years, openly and publicly, made it  known that he had concerns with the bill. I was therefore very pleased  that we were able to sit down and work out an agreement to address  those concerns, while keeping the bill narrow and focused on the  immediate problem that it is trying to solve. That is eliminating the  country of origin discrimination in our employment green card system. I  thank Senator Grassley for working with me on that.   The process by which I have tried to advance this bill through  Congress has been open, transparent, and straightforward. I have sought  and continue to seek unanimous consent to pass the bill on the floor.  If any Member has raised concern about the bill, I have been willing to  work with them quickly and in good faith to address their concerns.   That is why, after reaching an agreement with Senator Grassley, I  also worked with other Members to resolve their concerns. For much of  the past few months, I simply didn't know who, if anyone else on the  Democratic side of the aisle, might have had concerns with the bill. We  were told that there might be holds on the Democratic hotline, but we  were not told who exactly might be holding the bill, and no one  approached me with objections.   I certainly had no reason to think that Senator Durbin would have  concerns with the bill. As I have explained before, he was a leading  cosponsor of the bill in a previous Congress. What is more, the only  substantial difference between the bill he supported and the bill I put  forward in this Congress is the addition of the amendment that I  negotiated with Senator Grassley, which is drawn almost entirely from  provisions of the Durbin-Grassley H1-B reform bill.   In September, I learned that Senator Durbin did in fact have concerns  about the bill in this Congress. As I have with other Members and as I  have expressed the willingness to do with other Members, I am ready and  willing to work with Senator Durbin in good faith to quickly and  reasonably resolve any objection he may have, while preserving the  bipartisan support that this bill has long enjoyed and that it deserves  to enjoy.   As I have said before, I don't believe that any further factual  development concerning this bill is necessary. Indeed at this point, I  believe a hearing can serve no purpose other than to delay speedy  action on this important reform and jeopardize our ability to act  before the end of the year.   For that reason, I do not support Senator Durbin's calls for a public  hearing. Every day that we delay action on this bill is another day  that suffering experienced by immigrants stuck in the green-card  backlog continues and indeed intensifies. That is precisely why I will  continue to work to pass this bill at the earliest possible date.   The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act arguably has wider and  more bipartisan support than any other immigration bill that has been  considered in this body in recent years. The reason for that is that it  is focused on a single, serious, solvable problem that I think we can  all agree needs to be solved.   Whatever other reforms you think might need to be made to our  immigration system, with good reason, we can all agree that America  should not treat immigrants differently based on their country of  origin. There is no reason for this bill to become yet another casualty  to the polarized, partisan divisions that plague immigration policy.   I look forward to working with Senator Durbin to resolve the concerns  he may have about this bill. I reiterate that, once again, this is a  narrowly focused bill, one that focuses on a simple but long-standing  problem, a problem that subjects some immigrants to needlessly lengthy  delays for no reason other than their country of origin. This is from a  bygone era that we shouldn't be perpetuating in this country.   We need to fix the problem. The Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants  Act would do that, and I encourage all of my colleagues to join me. We  are almost there, but we need to get it over the finish line.   Thank you, Mr. President.
