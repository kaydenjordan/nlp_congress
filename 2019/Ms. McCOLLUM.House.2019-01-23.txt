 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this omnibus  appropriations bill, and I come to you in good faith with it.   Two weeks ago, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle told us  that they could not support the appropriations bills on the House floor  because they reflected only the Senate's priorities.   Well, there is good news today. The bill before us is a product of  bipartisan negotiations. It reflects both the priorities of the House  and the Senate. It is a compromise bill, and it will reopen our  government.   The interior and environment section provides $35.6 billion, which is  $300 million more than the fiscal year 2018 enacted bill.   We made critical investments in this legislation in Indian Country,  environmental protection, public lands management, and the arts.   The National Park Service is funded at $3.2 billion, an increase of  more than $20 million. This money is more urgently needed than ever  because of the damage at our national parks due to the Trump shutdown.   The Land and Water Conservation Fund, which supports tens of  thousands of projects all across the States, is funded at $435 million.  That is a $10 million increase.   The Environmental Protection Agency is funded at $8.8 billion. That  is an increase of $17 million above the 2018 enacted level.   Clean water and safe drinking water go hand-in-hand, so I am pleased  that this bill includes $2.9 billion for the State revolving funds and  $35 million for grants that reduce lead in drinking water, even at our  schools. This funding will enhance the EPA's ability to protect human  health and the health of our environment.   We continue to invest in Historically Black Colleges and  Universities, the Civil Rights Initiative grant program, the Historic  Preservation Fund, and Save America's Treasures.   Once again, we have worked in a bipartisan way to increase funding  for the National Endowment for the Arts and for the National Endowment  for the Humanities.   Congress also continues its commitment to providing funds necessary  for the Smithsonian to complete its rehabilitation on the beloved  National Air and Space Museum.   Finally, critically, it is important that this interior bill upholds  the Federal Government's trust responsibilities to our Native American  brothers and sisters. Funding for Indian Country is $1 billion more  than the President's budget. It provides a $266 million increase in the  Indian Health Service, the largest increase for any agency in this  bill, and it is a $17 million increase for the Bureau of Indian  Affairs.   This bill is a lifeline to restart funding and stop the senseless  cruelty of the Trump shutdown in Indian Country. Basic services like  health clinics, Tribal Justice services, and food assistance for  seniors are being put at risk for nearly 1.9 million Americans  throughout Indian Country.   As Democrats have continued to advance bills to reopen the  government, to end the Trump shutdown, I have listened to my colleagues  across the aisle. Our colleagues insisted that, if we brought up the  conference negotiated bills, they would give their support.   Well, this is it. This is the conference negotiated bill, and, Mr.  Speaker, I am looking forward to their support.   Programs in the interior bill impact all of us, from preserving our  natural and cultural resources to protecting our health and our safety  by ensuring clean air to breathe and clean water to drink, for today  and for future generations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides to support this bill,  and I thank Mrs. Lowey for yielding me the time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the Republicans' motion  to recommit that was offered on the previous bill and to explain to the  American people the harm that that motion would have caused.   The Trump shutdown is in its 33rd day. Critical programs that help  our most vulnerable friends and neighbors, like SNAP benefits for  seniors, will soon run out.   As chair of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies  Appropriations Subcommittee, I know the difficulties this shutdown is  causing for Indian Country, where basic healthcare programs could end  soon.   Mr. Speaker, for our Native American brothers and sisters, this  shutdown is literally a life-or-death matter, and that is why the  Republican motion to recommit was so very disappointing. It strips the  entire text of the bill, keeping the Federal Government closed and  threatening the well-being of tens of millions of Americans.   It is callous, it is cruel, and it is wrong. And that is why I join  my Democratic colleagues in rejecting the motion to recommit.   House Democrats are doing our job. We are passing legislation to  reopen the government and to fund our Federal employees with the  paychecks they deserve. Mr. Speaker, it is time for the Senate and the  President to do the same.                            ____________________
