 Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the first time  during this  [[Page H346]]  118th Congress to call for unity and bipartisan action in this  Congress.   This is a call that echoes across this House from commonsense  Republicans and Democrats who are ready to focus on what unites us  rather than what divides us. It is a call that echoes across my  district in the State of Nevada from independent-minded folks who are  tired of Congress playing games and politics as usual. It is a call  that echoes across the entire country.   In November, every one of us in this Chamber won the support of our  constituents, and the trends were clear: Extremism is out, and real  results are in.   Last Congress was different. Democrats had control of the House, the  Senate, and the Presidency, but we didn't close the door on our  Republican colleagues. Instead, we brought them to the table and led  together to deliver results for all Americans, and the track record  shows it:   The bipartisan PACT Act, now law, protecting healthcare for veterans  exposed to toxic burn pits and Agent Orange;   The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, now law, the first major gun  safety action in decades;   The bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, now law, increasing our  economic edge in a global economy and ensuring that we make more of  everything in America;   And, of course, the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs  Act, now law, the investment of a generation in every corner of this  country: roads, bridges, ports, airports, internet access, water  solutions for the West, and so much more.   These accomplishments are significant, and they will stand the test  of time because we brought Democrats and Republicans together to make  them happen.   Voters defied midterm predictions, recognizing that Democrats deliver  by putting people over politics and joining hands with our commonsense  colleagues across the aisle, but the work continues.   What we can work on together will always outweigh what holds us  apart. We all want to tackle inflation. We all recognize the need to  address the historic drought and to secure future water supplies for  all Americans. We all want to fix our broken immigration system, to  build one that strengthens our security without compromising our values  as a nation of immigrants.   Congress is at our best when we put policy first and politics last.  That is what the American people want.                     Congratulating Rebel Girls & Company     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  UNLV Rebel Girls & Company dance team for winning yet another national  championship title.   This program is no stranger to success, and this makes eight wins for  the university in the last 15 years. This time they even achieved a  99.1, the highest hip-hop score in program history.   Coming from the entertainment capital of the world, the decorated  dance team and crew have always represented Nevada well, and their  stellar performances have even dazzled audiences across the globe.  Their many titles are a reflection of the hard work of each and every  person involved, especially the leadership shown by Head Coach Marca  DeCastroverde.   The past, present, and future of this program is so bright, and I  speak on behalf of all of Nevada as we continue to cheer them on.   Congratulations, UNLV Rebel Girls & Company, on yet another success.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of my  amendment to H.R. 21.   This amendment would ensure that the Federal Government is not forced  into leasing public lands with low- or no-potential for oil and gas  development to the fossil fuel industry as a result of this bill.   The reckless leasing of low- to no-potential lands, also known as  speculative leasing, has allowed millions of acres of our Nation's  invaluable public lands to be put in harm's way for no real economic  benefit in return.   The problem is pervasive, affecting all Western States. However, it  is particularly severe in my home State of Nevada where there are very  few productive oil and gas formations but plenty of Federal land.   Speculative leasing is a serious problem that costs taxpayers serious  money. These leases are cheap. They are easy to acquire, usually  selling at near the minimum bid of $2 per acre.   Because they are so cheap, companies with purely speculative  interests target these lands with little intent or likelihood of  putting them into production.   Thus, the government is then forced to use taxpayer dollars to  administer and monitor them, but the leases almost never generate  royalties or other benefits for the American taxpayer.   In fact, according to the GAO, 99 percent of these noncompetitive  leases, which are frequently issued with little or no-potential lands,  never went into production or generated royalties for taxpayers.   In addition to burdening taxpayers, these leases also come with  environmental risks. In many instances, low-potential lands receive  fewer protections than areas with high potential because Federal land  managers forecast low likelihood of development activity. This leaves  land, water, and wildlife all incredibly vulnerable.   The current policy creates an opportunity cost. Once leased, low- potential lands are not prioritized for other uses like conservation  and recreation, regardless of their development status.   My amendment will prevent speculative leasing from becoming an even  bigger problem. It will exclude Federal lands with no or low potential  for oil and gas development from the scope of this bill.   My amendment will save taxpayer dollars instead of strong-arming  Federal agencies into spending those tax dollars on issuing and  administering speculative leases that generate little or no revenue.   This means the Federal oil and gas program can more efficiently focus  on managing leases that actually generate royalties and revenues for  taxpayers.   My amendment will mitigate environmental risk. Nearly 50 percent of  all leases in the West--spanning 9.9 million acres--are currently idle,  with iconic landscapes they encompass frequently left neglected, and  the unique cultural and natural resources of these storied places,  likewise, are left largely unprotected.   This amendment will prevent additional acreage from being put in  environmental jeopardy to satisfy leases that half the time are simply  left to gather dust.   On balance, this amendment reins in the practice that has numerous  costs and provides little or no return on investment for us, the  American taxpayers.   So I implore all of you, Democrats and Republicans, to vote ``yes''  on my amendment, a clear example of commonsense land management and  fiscal responsibility. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
