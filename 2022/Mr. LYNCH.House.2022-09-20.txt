 Mr. Speaker, as a 50-year member of the Massachusetts  Building Trades, as former president of the Ironworkers Local 7 in  Boston, and as a proud member of the Committee on Transportation and  Infrastructure here in Congress, I rise in support of and in  acknowledgement of the success and benefits to our States, cities, and  towns, of President Biden's transformational Infrastructure Investment  and Jobs Act, better known as the bipartisan infrastructure law.   Signed by President Biden this past November, this landmark  legislation continues to provide critical investments in our Nation's  infrastructure and transportation systems, including $550 billion in  new funding to repair and modernize America's roads, bridges, public  transit systems, passenger and freight rail ports, airports, high-speed  internet, and water systems.   Importantly, the bipartisan infrastructure law also stands as a  testament to what we can accomplish together on behalf of the American  people when we set aside partisanship and divisiveness in favor of  collaboration toward addressing the most urgent needs of the  American people.    In my own State of Massachusetts, the Eighth Congressional District  that I represent, we are already putting historic Federal funding  delivered by the bipartisan infrastructure law into use.   We have older infrastructure in Massachusetts, especially the city of  Boston, the city of Brockton, and the city of Quincy. Over $8.5 billion  will be allocated to Massachusetts to support that infrastructure, to  rebuild it over the next 5 years.   In fact, this year alone, $2 billion in new Federal funding has been  announced for our State to date, including more than $1.7 billion  identified for  [[Page H7976]]  key transportation and infrastructure projects.   Considering that 472 of our State bridges and more than 1,100 miles  of Massachusetts highway has been declared deficient or in poor  condition, this funding will not only be used for structural repairs,  but also will serve to reinforce our coastal infrastructure against the  devastating impacts of climate change.   Our State has already received nearly $190 million in bipartisan  infrastructure law funding this year to support lead pipe replacement  and other clean and safe water improvements. This funding will be  critical to some of our older historic cities, like the city of  Brockton, that struggle with toxic chemicals in their water supply.                                time  1100    As it does in all 50 States, the bipartisan infrastructure law has  already allocated approximately $534 million this year for  Massachusetts to improve our public transportation systems. This  funding could not be timelier for the residents of Massachusetts in  view of the ongoing safety incidents, operating deficiencies, personnel  shortages, and service reductions at the MBTA, one of the oldest  transit systems in the country.   Earlier this year, we also broke ground at a new electric bus  maintenance facility in Quincy, Massachusetts, that will serve to  accommodate a modern electric fleet of MBTA buses and alleviate the  carbon footprint of our public transportation that exacerbates the  incidence of asthma and respiratory disease.   Just this month, our State delegation joined President Biden at  Boston Logan Airport to recognize the $62 million in bipartisan  infrastructure law funding that will be used to modernize and increase  the climate resilience of our international terminal and its  surrounding roadways. That project is expected to create almost 6,000  jobs.   Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan infrastructure law is supporting similar  projects and job creation across this great country to the enormous  benefit of the American people. It is also, I remind my colleagues, a  worthwhile example of what Democrats and Republicans can do here in  Congress when we work together.                            ____________________
