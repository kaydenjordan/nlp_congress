 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                                  ______                                       Madam President, when our country was founded,  corporations were on the minds of no one. They are not mentioned in the  Constitution or the Bill of Rights, and when the topic finally came up  to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Marshall called corporations a  ``mere creature of the law.''   People have certain unalienable rights. Corporations do not. We  established corporate personhood so that companies could raise capital  and enter into contracts, but nobody ever thought that this term that  was used--``personhood''--actually meant that corporations were people.  They are not. It is not complicated. Corporations do not eat. They do  not sleep. They do not worry about their children or their elderly  parents. They do not get sick. They do not retire, and they do not have  complex motivations. In fact, under the law, they have only one  motivation, which is to maximize profits.   Any logical person knows that corporations are not people, but in  Judge Gorsuch's America, they are.   There is no doubt that he is a very smart person, but he, actually,  had a hand in creating this theory that corporations have the same  rights as human beings--that they are, in fact, people. We are supposed  to pretend that this premise is not insane, but it is crazy, and it is  hurting our democracy. For the past several decades, we have  increasingly limited people's rights in favor of corporate rights.   Now Republicans want us to confirm a judge who says that corporations  have religious rights. Judge Gorsuch was a part of the Hobby Lobby  decision that went before the Supreme Court, in which the Tenth Circuit  decided that corporate personhood extends to First Amendment religious  rights, and because the corporation itself--not just the people who own  it--has been granted those rights by judges like Neil Gorsuch, the  rights of corporations now usurp the health and the rights of American  citizens. That is the problem with Judge Gorsuch's worldview.   It is not just that he is a conservative; it is that he actually  thinks that corporate entities have the very same rights as American  citizens--rights, by the way, that do not come with the same  responsibilities that we all have as American citizens. Yet this judge  wants to confer more rights onto corporations when we are already past  the tipping point as a society when corporations have more power than  people.   We are in the absurd position of asking: How far are these corporate  rights going to extend? They have been given First Amendment rights.  They have been given Fourth Amendment rights. Do they get the right to  vote next? Do they get the right to keep and bear arms? How many more  constitutional rights are we going to give to corporations before we  say that enough is enough? We are already well beyond the point at  which corporate interests beat out the individual, whether it is at the  polls or in the workplace.   There are a lot of other things about Judge Gorsuch's worldview that  I object to, but, at my core, I think I might be able to get around  some of those things in knowing that the Constitution requires the  Senate to advise and consent, not agree with. Yet his worldview  regarding corporations as people embodies everything that is going  wrong with our country and with the Court. By the way, it is probably  fair to say that almost every nominee whom we have seen this year  embodies this worldview.   Time and again, Democrats in the Senate have raised the alarm about  this administration's nominees, and we have been overruled. What is the  result? You have Cabinet Secretaries destroying American diplomacy. You  have Secretaries trying to ban Muslims from entering the United States.  You have an EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, leaving a dangerous  product on the market that has been proven by his own scientists to  hurt children. Why? Because they prioritize corporate rights over  people's rights.   The problem is this: Cabinet Secretaries come and go; Supreme Court  [[Page S2312]]  Justices do not. Let me put it this way: This administration's Cabinet  is like a date. It is a really bad date, but at least it comes to an  end. A Supreme Court Justice on the other hand is not a bad date; it is  a marriage. It is a lifetime appointment that will have an impact on  generations of Americans.   The fact that he is out of the mainstream is absolutely essential for  us to consider. The fact that he thinks corporations are people is, in  my mind, disqualifying--so disqualifying that I will vote no on  cloture, and I will vote no on final confirmation if it comes to that,  which brings me to the question of cloture.   When the Senate votes on cloture, the question before the Senate is,  Is it the sense of the Senate that debate should be brought to a close?   For the Supreme Court nominee, we have rules, and those rules say  that you need 60 Senators to end debate--not 59, not 51, not 57. There  are 59 Senators who do not get to decide when to end debate; 60 do. If  you cannot get 60 votes to end debate, you do not have cloture.   After 2013, there is only one position--one appointed position that  retains that 60-vote threshold, and that is the U.S. Supreme Court.  That is for a very straightforward reason. It is that we have decided  as a body that the Supreme Court needs to have bipartisan support; that  if a person cannot get 60 votes, you change the nominee, you do not  change the rules.   We have decided that this position--this institution, the Court  itself, the highest Court in the land--should be beyond our partisan  disputes and differences. That is the foundation of the U.S. Senate. It  is the way this place works. Without this rule, the reality will be  grim. Without this rule, if you are a Member of the minority party, the  President's nominees don't have to listen to you, meet with you, think  about you. Without this rule, advice and consent is rendered  meaningless for whichever party is out of power.   I have been here now 5 years, about 4\1/2\ years. Even in my short  time here, the door swings both ways in Washington. Remember that  today, this week, for the Republicans it might feel satisfying to use  power maximally, to use the greatest authority possible under the U.S.  Constitution, but without this rule, the Senate itself will be  undermined by its own Members. I have never seen any legislative body  endeavor to diminish its own authority, and that is what is going to  happen this week.   We can argue about how we got here. Was it in 1987 when the Senate  rejected Robert Bork? Was it in 2013 when Leader Reid responded to  historic obstructionism by eliminating most filibusters on nominees?  Was it last year when Merrick Garland was not even given a hearing? We  all have our talking points. At the end of the day, both sides own some  of this mess. I am a Democrat. I think it is 80/20. Republicans will  think it is 80/20 on the other side. The general public may think it is  60/40 or 50/50. I am not sure that matters anymore. The question of who  is at fault is not the most important question. The question is, What  do we do next? Will the Senate undermine its own authority and  strengthen the power of partisanship?   I would say this to my Republican colleagues: Think about what you  are going to do next. Think about what this is going to mean the next  time you are in the minority party, because it will not be Senators  Duckworth and Cortez Masto who can't even get a meeting with a Supreme  Court nominee, it will be you.   This is about the future of the Senate and the Supreme Court. The  nuclear option will mean nominees for the Supreme Court will not have  to meet with or consider minority opinions. It will mean that the  Senate's habit of being slow--sometimes maddeningly so, but we know it  is in the best interests of the country--will go away for this  appointment. That tradition allows the center to hold, and it will be  undermined.   To my Republican colleagues, I am not asking you not to do this. I am  asking you to take your time. In the world's greatest deliberative  body, there is no reason to rush this decision. I am asking you to  wait. I am asking you to take a few weeks before you decide to change  the Senate forever. Take your time. This is probably one of the most  consequential decisions you are going to make in the U.S. Senate  because it is about the Senate itself. This is worth talking about.  This is worth deliberating over. It is worth thinking over. Go home.  Talk to your constituents. If you want to do this, you can do this  anytime you want. You can do this the Monday we get back from our  spring work period. For goodness' sake, there is no reason not to think  about it for a little bit longer.   All we need are three Members of the Republican Party to go to their  leader, publicly or privately, and say: We are not with you on nuclear  yet; give us some time to try to save this important aspect of the  Senate. Otherwise, you will make both the Supreme Court and the world's  greatest deliberative body more extreme and more divided, and I believe  you will regret it.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.    Mr. President, what is the purpose of the Senate? The  authors of the Constitution laid the foundation of the Senate without  really knowing what it would look like once it was standing. They knew  it would rival and restrain the House of Representatives. After all,  the Senate has a higher age requirement, Members serve 6-year terms,  and they have to represent not just a district but an entire State. But  it was clear from the beginning of the formation of the Senate that it  would take time before the purpose of this body was truly realized.   For several decades in our Nation's history, it was the House of  Representatives--not the Senate--that hosted the great debates and  introduced major legislation. It wasn't until the Nation began to  splinter in the shadow of slavery that the Senate came into its own.  While the rules of the Senate gave us its basic structure, it was the  Members of the Senate--the people who made up this body--who had to  stand up and lead. We remember them today as lions  [[Page S2358]]  of the Senate: Daniel Webster, John Calhoun, and Henry Clay. This body  owes its status to them and their leadership because they began to  define the Senate in a way that no one had before.   Over time, this place became one that valued bipartisanship,  deliberation, and compromise. It has become a Chamber that balances the  right to debate with demands for action.   In some of the toughest moments in our history, the Members of the  Senate have used this body to lead, particularly when the President has  faltered.   Take President Nixon. The Watergate scandal had weakened the  Presidency in ways that do-nothing Presidents never had. But the  Senate, led by a Member of the President's own party, didn't stand by  and watch the void, unmoved. They filled the vacuum for the good of the  country.   It is this kind of history that has shaped the Senate into what it is  today, a body that examines, considers, and protects.   Senator Byrd, the longest serving Senator in U.S. history once said:  ``The Senate is a source of wisdom and judgment--both on the actions of  the lower house and on the executive.''   That is what the Senate is for. That is our purpose. We achieve that  purpose through customs and traditions; through members who serve 6- year terms and represent whole States; through rules that force  bipartisanship, deliberation, and compromise.   Now the majority leader has placed one of those rules on the chopping  block because they can't get to 60. He can't find the 60 votes needed  to end debate on the President's nomination to the Supreme Court.   We shouldn't be surprised to find ourselves here because, after all,  back in February, President Trump told the majority leader to change  the rules if he had to. Now, as this administration closes in on its  first 100 days without passing a single piece of major legislation, the  Senate majority leader is ready to fulfill the President's request and  change the rule, instead of changing the nominee.   The question I have for this body is this: Should we change the rules  in order to give the President a win before spring break? Should we be  weakening the Senate at a time when the executive branch is so weak?  Isn't it our obligation to assert ourselves into this void, instead of  receding from responsibility?   I can think of no instance in the history of any great legislative  body in which a legislature decides to diminish its own power. This is  beyond strange in the world's greatest deliberative body, in the  world's most powerful legislative Chamber. For what good reason would  we give up our own prerogatives?   This administration has been ineffective. Now the Senate majority  leader is suggesting that the Senate respond to this executive weakness  by weakening ourselves. This is wrong. The purpose of the Senate is  achieved through bipartisanship, deliberation, and compromise. The 60- vote threshold for Supreme Court nominees preserves these ideals.  Changing this rule will make it harder to get there.   Look at the House of Representatives. Look at the way the House  Intelligence Committee has dissolved so quickly into partisanship,  unable to do its job.   Look at the country. Look at the campaign last year. We are a country  divided. Polarization is at an all-time high. Now is not the time to  crush a cornerstone of the Senate's foundation.   I don't think this is inevitable. This is not unstoppable. This is up  to all of us. It is up to the Members of the Senate to decide if we are  going to damage the world's greatest deliberative body at a time when  the country needs us the most.   The Senate has always been defined by its Members. The rules, the  customs, and the traditions--they help. But at the end of the day, it  is the Members of the Senate--like Calhoun, Webster, Clay, Kennedy,  Inouye, Hatch, McCain--who make the Senate relevant and necessary.   We are going to find out who we are, as Senators. I would ask that at  a minimum, the Senate take its time on this decision. Don't rush. That  is not who we are. That is not how we get to the best decisions. This  is about the future of the Senate and the future of the Court. The  nuclear option will mean nominees for the Supreme Court won't have to  even meet with the minority party to be confirmed. It will mean that  the Senate's habit of being slow--sometimes maddeningly slow--will go  away. That tradition that allows the center to hold--not just in this  Chamber but across the country--will be undermined.   So to my Republican colleagues, please take a few weeks before you  decide to change the Senate forever. Take your time here. This is  probably one of the most serious decisions that you are ever going to  make as a Senator because it is about the Senate itself. This is worth  talking about. This is worth deliberating over. It is worth thinking  over.   Go home and talk to your constituents. If you want to do this, you  have the votes. You can do this three Mondays from now, anytime you  want. But for goodness sake, there is no harm in thinking about it. All  we need are three members of the Republican Party to go to the majority  leader--either publicly or privately--and say: Give us some time to  find another way to do this. Otherwise, you will make the Supreme  Court, this place, and this country more extreme and more divided. You  will answer this difficult moment in history by weakening one of the  last bastions of bipartisanship, and I believe you will regret it.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
