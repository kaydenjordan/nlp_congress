 Madam Speaker, Sunday afternoon, the  University of South Carolina's women's basketball team clenched their  third consecutive Southeastern Conference championship.   The Gamecocks beat Mississippi State 59-49 in the SEC's women's  basketball tournament title game in Greenville, South Carolina.   Juniors Kaela Davis of Suwanee, Georgia, and A'ja Wilson of Irmo,  South Carolina, an extraordinary constituent, led the team with an  impressive 38 combined points. This all-star team will likely hold the  number one seed in the NCAA tournament that will begin on March 17.   Head coach Dawn Staley joined the University of South Carolina in  2008, building a team based on teamwork and determination. In the eight  seasons that Coach Staley has been with the program, the South Carolina  Women's Basketball Team has also seen three SEC regular season  championships, three Sweet 16 seasons, and the program's first number  one national ranking, with an average home attendance of over 14,000  Gamecock fans.   As March marks Women's History Month, it is especially fitting to  congratulate Coach Dawn Staley and the historic Gamecock women's  basketball team.   Best wishes for continued success in the NCAA playoffs. Go Gamecocks.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.
