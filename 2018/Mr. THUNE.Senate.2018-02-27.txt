 Mr. President, tax reform is working. The Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act has been the law of the land for just 2 months, but it is  already helping American workers.   When it came time to draft tax reform legislation, we had one  objective, and that was to make hard-working Americans' lives better.  To accomplish that, we focused on two important priorities.   First, we focused on immediately increasing Americans' take-home pay.  We lowered tax rates across the board, we nearly doubled the standard  deduction, and we doubled the child tax credit. All of those provisions  went into effect on January 1, and by the end of this month, according  to the IRS, 90 percent of the American people should see lower  paychecks.   While immediate relief for hard-working Americans was crucial, we  wanted more than that. We wanted to give the American people access to  the kinds of jobs and the kinds of wages and opportunities that would  set them up for long-term security. We wanted to give them the kinds of  jobs and wages where they wouldn't be forced to choose between sending  their kids to college and saving for a secure retirement or between  paying the mortgage or medical bills. So in addition to lowering the  tax burden on Americans directly, we set about improving the playing  field for American businesses so that we could make things better for  American workers.    Needless to say, in order for American workers to thrive, the  American economy has to thrive, and that means that American businesses  have to thrive. It is pretty hard for a small business to hire a new  worker or to raise wages if the owner can barely pay the tax bill. It  is unlikely that an American company is going to have a lot of spare  cash for investing in its workforce if it is struggling to compete with  foreign companies that are paying far less in taxes. It is unlikely  that America's global companies are going to focus on reinvesting in  the United States if they face a tax penalty for bringing foreign  earnings back home. So we lowered our Nation's massive corporate tax  rate, which, up until January 1, was the highest corporate tax rate in  the developed world. We lowered tax rates across the board for owners  of small- and medium-sized businesses, farms, and ranches. We expanded  business owners' ability to recover investments they make in their  businesses, which will free up cash that they can reinvest into their  operations and their workers. We brought the U.S. international tax  system into the 21st century by replacing our outdated worldwide system  with a modernized territorial tax system so that American businesses  are not operating at a disadvantage next to their foreign competitors.   The goal in all of this was to free up businesses to increase their  investments in the American economy and in American workers, and that  is exactly what businesses are doing. The list of tax reform good news  keeps growing--wage increases, new jobs, increased investment, bonuses,  benefit increases, and the list goes on and on.   Take utility bills. Lower utility bills might not be the first result  we think of from tax reform, but tax reform is saving utility companies  money, and they are passing those savings on to consumers.   Washington, DC, radio station WTOP reports:         In a flip-flop related to tax reform, [utility company]       Pepco now says it wants to cut rates instead of raise them.        In December and January, the utility announced plans to       raise rates in D.C. and Maryland respectively. . . . But the       sweeping Federal tax bill signed into law late last year       meant a significant tax savings for the utility. As a result,       Pepco is now asking the Maryland Public Service Commission to       approve a rate cut.    That is right--they were talking about a rate increase, but now they  are talking about a rate cut in their utility rates.   Take this story from the Daily Energy Insider titled ``Federal Tax  Cut More Than Reverses Eversource Rate Increase in Massachusetts.''   The Daily Energy Insider:         Many Eversource Energy electricity customers in       Massachusetts who were expecting to see a rate increase this       year instead will see a rate reduction because of the recent       Federal corporate tax cut.        ``What was expected to be about a $36 million annual rate       increase has turned into a $20 million annual decrease,''       said the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities.    In my home State of South Dakota, Black Hills Energy in Rapid City is  working with regulators to pass tax savings on to South Dakotans. So  far, utility companies in at least 39 States are passing tax savings on  to consumers, and that can be a real help to family budgets. Everybody  knows how much gets spent out of every family's budget on utilities, on  energy, and certainly in my part of the country in South Dakota, with  the cold winters, that is even amplified. It can be a real help to  family budgets, particularly families who are living paycheck to  paycheck.   In Florida, Florida Power and Light Company announced that thanks to  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, it will no longer require its customers to  pay a surcharge for Hurricane Irma restoration. Instead, the company  reports:         Florida Power and Light plans to apply federal tax savings       toward the $1.3 billion cost of Hurricane Irma restoration,       which will save each of Florida Power and Light's 4.9 million       customers an average of approximately $250.    Thanks to tax reform, good news for American workers seems to just  pour in daily, whether it is lower utility bills, new jobs, bonuses,  or, as Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina announced last  week, lower rate increases on health insurance.   I am proud that tax reform is accomplishing our goal of making life  better for hard-working Americans, and I look forward to seeing even  more benefits for American workers in the weeks and months to come.  [[Page S1230]]    I yield the floor.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I recognize the hard work of  my Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee intern Anthony  Stoks. Anthony hails from Adelaide, Australia, and is a law student at  Flinders University.   While interning for the Commerce Committee, Anthony assisted the  Subcommittee on Space, Science, and Competitiveness. He is a dedicated  worker who was committed to getting the most out of his internship. I  extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Anthony for all of the  fine work he did for the committee and wish him continued success in  the years to come.                            ____________________
