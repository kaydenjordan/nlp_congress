 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 765, I call  up the bill (H.R. 1158) to authorize cyber incident response teams at  the Department of Homeland Security, and for other purposes, with the  Senate amendment thereto, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the House amendment to the Senate  amendment to H.R. 1158.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the national security appropriations minibus combines  four bills: Defense, Commerce-Justice-Science, Financial Services and  General Government, and Homeland Security.   Madam Speaker, I would like to highlight a few key successes that our  cardinals have secured: $7.6 billion, $1.4 billion more than President  Trump proposed, to ensure a fair and accurate 2020 Census; $425 million  for election  [[Page H10379]]  security grants to States, a key priority for Democrats for a program  that was not funded last year; robust funding for initiatives to  improve the quality of life of our women and men in uniform; and a 3.1  percent pay raise for Federal civilian employees.                                time  1115    Unfortunately, the President and Senate Republicans insisted on  funding a wasteful border wall while simultaneously blocking Democratic  policies that would make our immigration system more humane. However, I  am pleased that we have established an immigration detention ombudsman  tasked with protecting the rights of individuals in DHS custody.   Madam Speaker, this is not the bill I would have written on my own,  but I am proud that we have been able to do so much good in this  political environment. I urge support, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  distinguished gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader.   (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), who is the distinguished chairman of the  Defense Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Quigley), who is the distinguished chairman of the  Financial Services and General Government Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the chairwoman of the Subcommittee  on Energy and Water Development, and Related Agencies.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the chairwoman of the Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Florida.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), a member of the Appropriations  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Frankel), a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I urge support of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 765, I call  up the bill (H.R. 1865) to require the Secretary of the Treasury to  mint a coin in commemoration of the opening of the National Law  Enforcement Museum in the District of Columbia, and for other purposes,  with the Senate amendment thereto, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the House amendment to the  Senate amendment to H.R. 1865.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This domestic priorities and international assistance minibus  combines eight appropriations bills: Labor-Health and Human Services- Education, Agriculture, Energy and Water Development, Interior- Environment, Legislative Branch, Military Construction-Veterans  Affairs, State-Foreign Operations, and Transportation-Housing and Urban  Development.                                time  1215    The Appropriations Committee is fortunate to have outstanding  cardinals, and they have done an extraordinary job negotiating these  bills. Because of their hard work, we have secured record funding  levels for Head Start, Child Care and Development Block Grants, and  title I schools; hundreds of millions of dollars in increases for  programs that expand access to housing; $41.7 billion for lifesaving  medical research at the NIH, a $2.6 billion increase and a record  level; $25 million for gun violence prevention research at the CDC and  NIH, which is being funded for the first time in more than 20 years;  strong funding for environmental protection, with $9 billion for the  EPA, $495 million for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and robust  investments in clean energy to address the climate crisis.   Turning to my bill, I am proud that the State, Foreign Operations,  and Related Programs Subcommittee reached bipartisan agreement on a  robust bill that rejects the short-sighted, dangerous cuts proposed by  the Trump administration. Our bill provides $54.7 billion in  discretionary funding, which is $467 million above fiscal year 2019 and  $11.3 billion above the request.   To confront today's global challenges, from poverty to civil war,  from climate change to violent extremism, our bill provides strong  investments in security, humanitarian, and development assistance;  basic education; and global health programs like HIV/AIDS, nutrition,  TB, and malaria.   It restores the State Department's and USAID's staffing to 2016  levels and increases funding for many of our critical partners, like  the National Endowment for Democracy, the Global Fund, the U.S.  Institute of Peace, the Inter-American Foundation, and the U.S. African  Development Foundation.   Of critical importance, the bill limits the administration's ability  to redirect or deviate from congressionally directed spending levels.   Amid all these successes, I must note how disappointing it is that,  in these negotiations, President Trump and congressional Republicans  refused to relent on their counterproductive assault on women's rights  and health programs that provide basic healthcare to women and families  here and around the world.   Madam Speaker, I joined the Appropriations Committee because it is  the best place to give more people a better chance at a better life.  With this bill, we have lived up to that promise by making historic  investments for the people. I am so proud that we are able to do so  much good for children and families across the country and around the  world.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this  important legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the chairwoman of the Energy and Water Development  Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price), the chairman of the  Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Bishop), the chairman of the Agriculture, Rural  Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.

Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), a senior member of the  Appropriations Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 10  seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), who is an appropriator. She  is and has been valuable in our discussions of this bill and getting  the completion of these bills in an orderly and timely way.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, as we close debate on this important package, I want  to thank the many hardworking staff who made this possible. While there  are too many to name them all, many thanks to my staff at the State,  Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee; my entire  committee staff led by Staff Director Shalanda Young, Deputy Staff  Director Chris Bigelow, and to the minority staff as well. To the  extraordinary staff in my congressional office, I want to express my  appreciation because it is teamwork that brought us to this point.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
