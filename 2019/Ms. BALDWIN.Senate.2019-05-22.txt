 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the ongoing  threat from the Trump administration to healthcare and the guaranteed  protections that millions of American families depend upon.   President Trump has tried to pass repeal plans that would take  people's healthcare away and allow insurance companies to charge more  for people with preexisting health conditions or those insurance  companies could deny them coverage altogether.   When that repeal plan failed to pass in the Senate in the summer of  2017, instead of working in a bipartisan way to lower healthcare costs,  President Trump turned to truly sabotaging our healthcare system.   What do I mean by that?   The Trump administration made it harder for people to sign up for the  Affordable Care Act coverage. They have done so by limiting the window  of time when people can enroll. They have truly created instability in  the healthcare market, and their sabotage has contributed to premium  spikes that we have seen across the country, including in my home State  of Wisconsin.   The Trump administration has even gone to court to support a lawsuit  in order to overturn the Affordable Care Act completely, and that, of  course, would include protections for people with preexisting health  conditions. They have essentially gone into court to ask the court to  strike down the Affordable Care Act. Now, if they were to succeed,  insurance companies will again be able to deny coverage or charge much  higher premiums for the more than 130 million Americans who have some  sort of preexisting health condition. The number with preexisting  health conditions includes some 2 million Wisconsinites.   What is the President's plan to protect people with preexisting  health conditions? He doesn't have one, and I don't believe he ever  will.   In fact, he has acted in just the opposite vein. This administration  has expanded junk insurance plans that can deny coverage to people with  preexisting conditions, and they don't have to cover essential services  like prescription drugs or emergency room care or maternity care.   I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle to think about this  for a moment. President Trump supports overturning the law that  provides protections for people with preexisting health conditions at  the same time he is expanding these junk plans that don't provide those  very protections. If this isn't straight-up sabotage, I really don't  know what is.   When I was 9 years old, I got sick. I was really sick. I was in the  hospital for 3 months. Now, I recovered, but my family still struggled  because I had been branded with the words ``preexisting health  condition'' and I was denied insurance coverage.   That family and personal experience has driven my fight to make sure  that every American has affordable and quality healthcare coverage.   Today, because of the Affordable Care Act, those with preexisting  health conditions cannot be discriminated against. They can't be denied  healthcare coverage, and they can't be charged discriminatory premiums.   I want to protect the guaranteed healthcare protections that so many  millions of Americans now depend upon. I have introduced legislation  along with my colleague Senator Doug Jones of Alabama to overturn the  Trump administration's expansion of junk insurance plans.   The entire Senate Democratic caucus, including the two Independents  who caucus with us, have supported this legislation. They have signed  on to this bill. The Nation's top healthcare organizations,  representing tens of thousands of doctors and physicians, and patients  and medical students, and other health experts have supported this  legislation and endorsed it. Anyone who says they support healthcare  coverage for people with preexisting conditions should support my  legislation.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1556    Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee be discharged  from further consideration of S. 1556; that the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration; that the bill be considered read a third time  and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I am certainly disappointed that my  Republican colleagues have chosen to object to protecting people with  preexisting conditions.   It is my contention that some of the very opposite impacts, because  of these junk plans, are occurring than what my colleague has recited.  In fact, I hardly consider them insurance plans. Many have argued that  they are not worth the paper that they are written on. They don't cover  many essential benefits. They are not required to cover people with  preexisting health conditions. They can drop people. They can charge  outrageous prices. What we found--and the reason that the Obama  administration went from yearlong plans to 3-month plans--is that they  saw the distortion in the markets. They saw that people who had  believed that they might not get sick--healthy, often younger people-- were availing themselves of these plans, making the Affordable Care----    I would yield to one question, and then I want to wrap  up my comments.    Mr. President, these short-term plans do not have to  cover preexisting conditions. I can tell you, as I have inquired--    I yielded already for a question. But I want to say----    It may not be to the Senator's liking, but I was going  to tell you about the plans that I read the fine print on from the  State of Wisconsin. Now that these short-term plans are renewable for  up to 3 years, in these junk plans, you can see the fine print. Many  times they start with this: We will not cover a preexisting condition.  Every single one of them refuses to cover maternity care. That means  none of these junk plans cover that essential benefit. Most of them  don't cover  [[Page S3036]]  emergency room care. Most of them don't cover prescription drugs. So  regardless of how the law impacts people who have other types of  insurance, I feel strongly that these junk plans are very distorting of  the market and not worth the paper they are written on for those who  have chosen to take that route.   Last fall, we heard all my colleagues across the aisle say, often  repeatedly, that they support protections for people with preexisting  health conditions. Today I just offered an opportunity for Democrats  and Republicans to come together to protect people's access to quality,  affordable healthcare when they need it the most, but there was an  objection.   I say to the American people that we must not lose sight of the fight  right in front of us. We have a President who time after time has  sabotaged our healthcare system, raised healthcare costs, and pushed  these junk insurance plans that don't have to cover people with  preexisting conditions. We have an administration that is asking a  court to strike down the Affordable Care Act and its protections for  people with preexisting conditions in their entirety.   The choice for the American people could not be more clear. We want  to make things better, and my Republican colleagues refuse to join us  in this effort, which would be to prevent this administration from  making things worse.   I yield the floor.
