 Mr. Speaker, in the midst of a statewide drought  emergency, the Central Valley experienced considerable rainstorms this  week.   While communities across my district are incredibly grateful for this  rainfall, we know this relief will be short lived.   Farmers are desperate for water to grow their crops. Rural towns  continue to face water shortages.   We are grateful for this rain. We need this rain. But we need this  administration to understand the dire nature of our situation and take  appropriate measures to capture our most precious resource.   I have asked time and time again for support from the House majority  to address this issue.   I have expressed the urgent need for action to prepare for exactly  the opportunity that has been pointlessly wasted this week.   The families in my district cannot continue to wait. I ask my  colleagues yet again to join my efforts to improve water infrastructure  and water management in California.                            ____________________
