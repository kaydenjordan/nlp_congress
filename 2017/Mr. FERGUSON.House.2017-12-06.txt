 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 38, the  Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act.   As a lifelong gun owner and staunch advocate for protecting our  Second Amendment rights, I am proud to cosponsor this legislation.   H.R. 38 would protect law-abiding gun owners with concealed carry  permits, like the single mother, Shaneen Allen, from Pennsylvania. Many  of you have heard this story. I know the author of this bill, Mr.  Hudson, has told this story many times, where Miss Allen was arrested  in New Jersey during a routine traffic stop because her valid  Pennsylvania concealed carry license had no legal standing in New  Jersey.   Our constitutionally protected Second Amendment rights should not  stop at a State line. This commonsense bill would ensure that concealed  carry permit holders' rights to carry firearms across all State lines  will exist.   The legislation would allow Georgia's 600,000-plus concealed carry  permit holders to remain protected while traveling. The bill would also  incentivize  [[Page H9679]]  States to report individuals prohibited from owning guns to the FBI's  National Instant Criminal Background Check System, better knows as  NICS, and it gives States the resources they need to follow this law.   This would not put an additional burden on law-abiding gun owners or  make it more difficult for them to purchase or carry a firearm. It  simply ensures that agencies and bureaucrats are following the existing  laws.   I appreciate Mr. Hudson's hard work to advance this commonsense  legislation to protect Americans' constitutional rights, and I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting this rule and the bill.
