 Madam Chair, I want to thank Chairman Scott for his  leadership and Representative DeLauro for bringing this bill to the  floor.   I rise today in strong support of the Paycheck Fairness Act because,  like Fannie Lou Hamer and Representative DeLauro, I am sick and tired  of being sick and tired of paycheck inequity.   For three decades, from the North Carolina House to the United States  Congress, I have been fighting to close the gender wage gap. As the new  chair of the Education and Labor Subcommittee on Workforce Protections,  I am very proud to support this bill. It takes the average woman an  additional 91 days to earn what her male peers earned in 2018, and that  is unacceptable.   In my district in North Carolina, women still only make about 82  cents for every dollar a man makes. It is even worse for women of  color, who are even less likely to make as much as their male  counterparts working the same job. Black women earn only 61 cents for  every dollar a man makes; Hispanic women only 53 cents.   When we shortchange women, we shortchange our children, our families,  and our economy. In fact, women are shortchanged $500 billion every  year. Fifty-six years have passed since the Equal Pay Act was signed  into law, and it has been 10 years since President Obama signed the  Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.   Yet, our work remains unfinished. Today, the U.S. House of  Representatives speaks loud and clear, and we will no longer wait while  women continue to do the same work and not get the same pay. The time  is up for that.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record a letter from AFSCME which  states that the Paycheck Fairness Act is integral to ensuring women  earn the same amount as men for equal work.                                                         AFSCME,                                     Washington, DC, March 25, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the members of the       American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees       (AFSCME), I am writing in support of the ``Paycheck Fairness       Act'' (H.R. 7). This legislation is integral to ensure that       women earn the same amount as men for equal work.        To date, women make up almost 47 percent of the workforce       in America. Their participation has steadily climbed since       the 1970s, and they are completing college and university       education at higher rates. The range of occupations women       workers hold has also expanded with women making notable       gains in professional and managerial occupations. Yet with       more than 74.6 million women in the civilian workforce, there       is still a gender pay gap between men and women. That's why       passage of this bill is necessary. Even with the enormous       progress made by women over many decades, women continue to       face discrimination that limits their ability to succeed and       advance at work.        Fifty-six years after former President John F. Kennedy       signed the Equal Pay Act into law, women earn less than men.       While that law along with other civil rights legislation like       Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act have helped to narrow       the wage gap, it still exists across all occupations,       industries, and trade and educational attainment. This       shortchanges many working families and creates little upward       mobility in compensation to meet basic household needs.       Currently, women make only 80 percent of every dollar a man       makes in nearly every occupation where there is enough       earnings data to compare. This gap in earnings translates       into $10,169 less per year in average earnings. This       percentage is even lower for women of color. Black women earn       61 cents, Latina women 53 cents, Native Hawaiian and Pacific       Islander women 62 cents, Native women 58 cents, and Asian       women 58 cents for every dollar paid to a white man. This       trend is not only troubling for women's career and financial       success, but it also limits their ability to save for       retirement.        Stronger equal pay protections and enforcement measures are       essential to ensure that our workplaces treat women fairly       and operate free of discrimination on the job. AFSCME       strongly supports the ``Paycheck Fairness Act'' (H.R. 7) and       encourages swift passage to alleviate gender-based wage       discrimination, and ensure women receive equal pay for equal       work.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,                            Director of Federal Government Affairs.     By passing the Paycheck Fairness Act, we will strengthen  the Equal Pay Act. We will bolster the rights of working women, and  finally, we will put an end to gender-based wage disparity.
