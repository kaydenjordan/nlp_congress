 Mr. Speaker, this Pride Month we need to both  celebrate the LGBTQI+ community and take action to further LGBTQI+  equality. A vote for today's bill is a vote to do just that.   The Financial Services Racial Equity, Inclusion, and Economic Justice  Act includes a portion of my bill--the Equality Act--to explicitly  prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender  identity in credit.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill and my amendment to  explicitly clarify that all forms of sex discrimination are prohibited  by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Importantly, my amendment makes  clear that discrimination on the basis of sex stereotypes, pregnancy,  childbirth, sexual orientation, gender identity, and sex  characteristics, including intersex traits, are all forms of unlawful  sex discrimination under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act.   No one should be denied access to credit because of who they are or  who they love. Yet, 7.7 million LGBT adults 18 and older live in states  without statutes explicitly prohibiting LGBT discrimination in credit.   A vote for today's bill and my amendment will ensure long-lasting  explicit nondiscrimination protections for the LGBTQI+ community and  others in credit.   I thank Chairwoman Waters for introducing this bill and ensuring it  is inclusive of the LGBTQI+ community. I urge my colleagues to  [[Page H5575]]  stand with the LGBTQI+ community this Pride Month and vote for my  amendment and the underlying bill.
