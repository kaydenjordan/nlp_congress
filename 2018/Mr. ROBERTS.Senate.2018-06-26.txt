 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise as the Senate considers  legislation on an issue that is critically important to our Nation--the  Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018--the farm bill.   The goal, the responsibility, the absolute requirement is to provide  our farmers, ranchers, and growers, and everyone within America's  agriculture and food value chain certainty and predictability,  especially during these very difficult times. This is paramount,  absolutely paramount to any other issues and concerns.   It is not an exaggeration to say our Nation's food and fiber  capability, with regard to production, hangs in the balance with what  we do on this legislation. Simply put, let's get this done.   Many of my colleagues have introduced legislation over the last year  that addresses priorities and stakeholders in their States. The bill  that passed the Agriculture Committee, with the help and partnership of  my distinguished ranking member Senator Stabenow, passed with a strong  bipartisan vote of 20 to 1 earlier this month. That bill addresses many  of these concerns. In fact, the Ag Committee's bill includes this bill  we are considering today, portions of 65 stand-alone bills, and an  additional 73 amendments were adopted in the committee. That is called  working together. That is called regular order.   Needless to say, we have work to include as many priorities from  Members both on and off the Ag Committee, and we want to continue  working with Members to address their concerns. Prepare your amendments  and come work with Senator Stabenow and me.   We are endeavoring to craft a farm bill that meets the needs of  producers across all regions, all crops. All of agriculture today is  struggling, not just one or two commodities. We are indeed going  through a very difficult time; what we call in farm country, a rough  patch.   We must have a bill that works all across our great Nation. We must  ensure that our voluntary conservation programs are keeping farmland in  operation while protecting our agriculture lands and forests and other  [[Page S4382]]  natural resources. Let us not forget that in a few short decades, the  global population will top 9 billion people--some are saying even 10  billion. Agriculture production will need to double in the near future  to meet that demand. Accomplishing this task requires efficiency, not  just on the farm and ranch but also in our government.   We must focus on program integrity--we have done that--and  commonsense investments to strengthen our nutrition programs to ensure  the long-term health and success of those in need of assistance. We  have done that in this bill with efficiencies, reform, and a priority  with regard to program integrity.   With trade and market uncertainty, to say the least, we must provide  certainty for our trade promotion and research programs. Today we are  losing our markets. Kansas wheat is not going to Mexico. Mexico is  buying its wheat from Argentina. It is the same for corn. Our corn is  not going down to Mexico. Mexico is buying their corn from Brazil.   I think it could be said that when a tariff is imposed to try to  improve trade deficits, you also run the risk--and we have already seen  it happen--of retaliation, and retaliation comes back directly on our  producers and agriculture.   That is why we have to have this bill passed. Feeding an increasing  global population is not just an agricultural challenge, it is a  national security challenge. Show me a country that cannot feed itself,  and I will show you a nation in chaos. This means we need to grow more  and raise more with fewer resources. That is going to take investments  in research, new technology, lines of credit, and proper risk  management. It takes the government providing tools and then getting  out of the producers' way.   In this bill, we have made and must make tough choices and be  judicious with the scarce resources we have. Through an open and  deliberate hearing process over the last 18 months, Members of the  Senate Agriculture Committee have asked tough questions, reexamined  programs to determine their effectiveness, and tried to ensure programs  accomplish their fundamental purposes. Agriculture, and specifically  the farm bill, has consistently answered the call to do more with less.  To those who say passing a farm bill in this environment is a daunting  task--and, yes, it is--I say, together we can get this done.   I think about the folks back home right now. I would like to point  out that the wheat harvest is still growing across Kansas, starting in  Nebraska, and headed for South Dakota and North Dakota. These farmers  in the midst of harvest are facing Mother Nature. The unknown of a  thunderstorm or hailstorm can hit just as they try to harvest their  grain. In Kansas, we have a drought, but we are still hopeful we can  harvest a reasonable crop.   We must adopt the attitude of our producers--optimism and ingenuity.  A farmer doesn't plant a seed in the ground without the faith and  optimism of harvesting a good crop. That is what we should do. That  means, with bipartisan support, we must do our job. We must pass a bill  that provides those same men and women the much needed certainty and  predictability they deserve. Again, that is the paramount issue.   I know many Members have concerns. Many Members have amendments that  want to address a specific problem. They feel very strongly about it,  and we are here to help. We are here to help them to address such  issues in this bill, but we also have to understand the tough  challenges we face. Farmers, ranchers, and growers are in a very  difficult time. We must respond to that. We are the Agriculture  Committee. We must accept that challenge. We must be champions for  these people, and we need a bill. That is the No. 1 issue--certainty  and predictability during a very difficult time for our farmers, our  ranchers, and our growers.   Now, this is not the best possible bill, but it is the best bill  possible under these circumstances. So I look forward to working with  my colleagues on continuing to move this process forward.    To my partner in this process, Senator Stabenow, thank you so much  for your help and cooperation and working together. I look forward to  working with you toward that goal in the days ahead. Let's get this  bill done.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, just a comment, and I state to the  Presiding Officer that I thank the Senator from Texas for his general  support for the farm bill.   The issues Senator Cornyn has mentioned are very important. In the  nutrition title, we have addressed deficiencies that he has mentioned.  We have 10 States now that have private projects for job training to  figure out what really works best. The law currently allows States to  have job training and a worker program. Kansas has that law. I am sure  Texas probably has the law.   I think we have achieved about as much as we can to at least  determine where we are going. The House bill, with all due respect, has  $8 billion in cuts, and then there are questions as to how that is  implemented and what agency does that. Agriculture, I don't think, is  prepared to really launch into a full program of job training. The one  issue the Senator from Texas specifically mentioned that caused me to  come down here and interrupt his great speech is, we do have that  private part to supplement the Federal situation in the Food Stamp  Program. I don't know if we have hit all three areas of concern he has  mentioned, but we are pretty darn close.   I appreciate the Senator's interest. We are just trying to get a  program that has better integrity, that works better, and is more  efficient.   By the way, we deal with that bonus program, where some States-- actually, only eight States--were not guilty of this, but a lot of  States gamed the system, and we have taken care of that. We have taken  a hard look at the nutrition program, but we don't declare the farm  program to be a welfare program or try to put it into that kind of a  description.   So, basically, I am just saying with the three things the Senator  just mentioned, we tried to address all three. Now, perhaps, not to the  degree that the distinguished Senator would like, but that is still up  for consideration, and I appreciate his comments.    I thank the Senator for yielding.   We are looking at those provisions, and we are looking at making sure  able-bodied people do achieve the goal of going from dependence to  independence, more especially in this time of economic recovery, which  is really the secret to all of this. The numbers in the Food Stamp  Program have decreased dramatically as we have seen our economy  improve, but we are taking a look at those waivers. The difference is,  in the House bill, we have a situation where if somebody has children 6  and under, it used to be 10 and under, and then on the other side,  people who were 50 to now 60 are included--that has raised some dust.   There are several other issues the Senator has mentioned. It is just  a matter of degree. We want to provide integrity to that program. We  want it to work and have it go to the people who truly need it, and we  have tried very hard to accomplish that.   We will study hard the good recommendations the Senator has  mentioned, and we will do our best.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    For the information of our colleagues, the Senate will  proceed to the bill tomorrow morning at 10 a.m., and the amendment  process will begin.   After Senator Stabenow and I offer the bipartisan substitute, the  first amendment offered on this side will be the Thune amendment on the  Conservation Reserve Program.   There will be no further rollcall votes tonight.   I yield to my distinguished colleague, the ranking member of the  committee, Senator Stabenow.
