 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Goodlatte for yielding me  the time.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 26, the REINS  Act. In a minute, I want to share an experience I had a few months ago  which will explain why, aside from the Constitution, I think it is  important that we rein in unelected bureaucrats.   When we talk about regulatory reform, it is sometimes hard to  understand the impact regulations have on our economy. That is for the  simple reason that someone who goes in for a job interview never sits  there and is told by the employer: I would love to offer you the job,  but I can't because of the crushing regulatory burden coming out of  Washington. And that is because the crushing burden of regulations  causes the job not to be created in the first place; and, hence, there  is no interview for the job.   The experience I had a couple of months ago, I was back home, and I  met with the Michigan Restaurant Association. There were 8 or 10 folks  sitting around and telling me about the issues that are important to  them. They said they were dying because of the EPA, because of the FDA,  because of the EEOC, because of the ACA, because of the overtime rule  from DOL, and because of the CFPB. I quickly surmised that the  restaurant industry is dying, and it is death by acronyms. That is what  is happening in this country. That is why we are not creating jobs.   If you come in from the airport, you come across the 14th Street  bridge and you enter the city, all you see is cranes. There was never a  recession in Washington. Today, there are 277,000 people who write and  enforce rules in this country in Washington, D.C., and around the  country. That is more than the entire employee base of the VA.   A few minutes ago, my friend from Tennessee said that all of these  great regulations have saved our country. Well, if that had happened, I  would have expected a different result on November 8.   A few minutes ago, my friend from Georgia, who I was proud to serve  on the Judiciary Committee with, talked about all of the problems with  our plan.                                time  1515    I say to my colleague, the next time you pull up in front of your  favorite Outback Steakhouse restaurant and it is closed, it is not  because the cook quit, it is not because of the cost of beef, and it is  not because the restaurant was poorly managed. It is because of death  by acronyms. I ask everyone to support H.R. 26. It is time we rein in  unelected bureaucrats, follow the Constitution, and create some jobs.    I thank the chairman.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 11, which offers a  strong objection to U.N. Security Council Resolution 2334.    President Obama started his foreign policy 8 years ago with an  apology tour in the Middle East, and now, not surprisingly, he ends it  with a slap in the face to our ally and friend, Israel.   For over 40 years, the United States Government--Republicans and  Democrats--stood shoulder to shoulder with our ally, vetoing countless  resolutions at the United Nations. However, this past December,  President Obama broke that tradition and chose to allow this resolution  to come before the Security Council for a vote. As Prime Minister  Netanyahu said: ``This was a disgraceful anti-Israel maneuver.'' Not  only does this one-sided resolution blatantly target Israel, it  seriously impedes the peace process.   Unfortunately, while I wholeheartedly reject what happened at the  United Nations, I cannot say that I am surprised. The Obama  administration has been more concerned with appeasing nefarious actors  like Iran and Cuba, all the while ignoring friends like Israel. I look  forward to a new era of foreign policy in which our enemies fear us and  our allies respect us.
