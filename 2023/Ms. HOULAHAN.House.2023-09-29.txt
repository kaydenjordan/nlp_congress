 Madam Speaker, I rise for the indefatigable, musical,  mystical, magical Mr. Murray Savar.   Murray, you have been the pied piper for more than 40 years--two  generations--for our community's young women and girls. Students have  been entranced by you and have literally found their voice and their  agency under your spell.   You are priceless. Your life is an exemplar of the impact that one  person, one teacher, can have on hundreds and thousands of lives, an  impact that you have had by joyfully meeting the mundane world where we  are with a song every single day. Southeastern Pennsylvania is so lucky  that you have called it home for so many years.   I am here--just one person--standing in on behalf of more than four  decades of parents and students in our community.   To quote a song that you taught generations to love, I say, ``Thank  you for the music, for giving it to me.''   Murray, your community loves you and wishes you Godspeed.                            ____________________
