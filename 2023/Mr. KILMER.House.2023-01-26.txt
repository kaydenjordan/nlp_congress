 Mr. Chair, for decades, Democrats and Republicans agree  that opening the waters off the coast of Washington to drilling would  be dangerous. Doing so would threaten our fisheries, shellfish growers,  tourism, and jobs in other sectors of our economy.   The underlying legislation we are considering could result in over  300 million acres of Federal lands and waters being opened up for new  oil and gas drilling. That is an area equivalent to more than six times  the size of the State of Washington.   I support this amendment because I am standing up for the coastal  communities I represent. We do not want new oil and gas drilling off  our coast. This isn't just about environmental protection; it is about  protecting our economy and our way of life.   Let's protect our marine ecosystems. Let's protect coastal  communities and coastal jobs. Let's create new jobs in renewable  energy.
