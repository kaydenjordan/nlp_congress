 Madam Speaker, impeachment didn't start with Ukraine. It  started before he was elected. It started on July 31, 2016, when the  FBI opened an investigation and spied on four American citizens  associated with the President's campaign. That is when it started. It  continued after he was elected before inauguration when they go up to  Trump Tower and they brief the President on the dossier. The dossier  that they already knew was false, the dossier that Michael Horowitz  said when they took it to the FISA court they lied to the court 17  times. It continued after inauguration with the Mueller investigation  and those 2 years that we went through.   Why are the Democrats so focused on getting to the President?   Why are they so focused about going after the President?   Because they don't like what this guy is getting done. They don't  like the fact that he is shaking up this town. They don't like the fact  that he is doing what he said he would do. They don't like the fact  that he is draining the swamp, and when you drain the swamp, the swamp  fights back. And that is exactly what we are seeing from the Democrats  in this entire impeachment escapade we have lived through now for 4  months that has needlessly divided our country.   Here is the good news: the American people get it. They understand  it. They know the four key facts. They have got the call transcript,  there was no quid pro quo. The two individuals on the call, President  Trump and President Zelensky have repeatedly said: There was no  pushing, no pressure, and no linkage of an investigation to any type of  security assistance money. We know the Ukrainians knew at the time of  the call that aid wasn't even on hold at the time of the call. Most  importantly, they took no action to get the money released.   The American people get the facts. They know the facts are on the  President's side, and that is why this whole thing is wrong. They get  the facts, and they understand.
