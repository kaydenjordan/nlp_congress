 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a legendary  human being in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who is celebrating his 100th  birthday.   Morrisville resident Sam Snipes has lived a life defined by service  and community. Following in his father's footsteps in the legal  community, Sam founded the Yardley firm Snipes & Collins after  graduating from Temple Law School and Haverford College.   Sam served as a dedicated public servant for nearly three decades as  the Falls Township solicitor. For his community service, Sam was  honored with the United Way of Bucks County Founders Award and the Mark  E. Goldberg Award from the Bucks County Bar Association, among many  other distinctions.   Sam truly embodies dedication to our home of Bucks County. He still  lives on the Snipes Farm, where he grew up, makes frequent appearances  in parades and other community events, and serves on several boards.   Mr. Speaker, Sam is truly a legend, and we wish him a very happy  100th birthday and thank him for being a bright beacon of hope in our  community in so many ways.   Happy birthday, Sam.                            ____________________
