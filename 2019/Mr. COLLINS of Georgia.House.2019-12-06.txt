 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the right to vote is of paramount importance in a  democracy, and its protection from discriminatory barriers has been  grounded in Federal law since the Civil War and, more recently, in the  Voting Rights Act of 1965.   A Supreme Court decision called Shelby County will be mentioned here  many times today.   And, also, I want to say, it has been mentioned many times that the  Supreme Court directed or instructed this body to do something. They  did not. What they did say in the decision was that, if Congress wants  to, they can revisit this. And, as we could on most anything, we are  revisiting. But to say that we were directed to is a little bit of an  overstatement and just needs to be clarified.   It is important to remember that this Supreme Court decision only  struck down one outdated provision of the Voting Rights Act, namely, an  outdated formula based on decades-old data that doesn't hold true  anymore, describing which jurisdictions had to get approval from the  Department of Justice before their voting rules went into effect.   It is important to point out that other very important provisions of  the Voting Rights Act remain in place and were not changed, including  section 2 and section 3.    Section 2 applies nationwide and prohibits voting practices or  procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, color, or the  ability to speak English. Section 2 is enforced through Federal  lawsuits, just like other Federal civil rights laws. The United States  and civil rights organizations have brought many cases to enforce the  guarantees of section 2 in court, and they may do so in the future.   Section 3 of the Voting Rights Act also remains in place. Section 3  authorizes Federal courts to impose preclearance requirements on States  and political subdivisions that have enacted voting procedures that  treat people differently based on race in violation of the 14th and  15th Amendments.   If a State or political subdivision is found by the Federal courts to  have treated people differently based on race, then the court has  discretion to retain supervisory jurisdiction and impose preclearance  requirements on the State or political subdivision, as the court sees  fit, until a future date, at the court's discretion.   This means that such a State or political subdivision would have to  submit all future voting rule changes for approval to either the court  itself or the Department of Justice before such rule changes could go  into effect.   As set out in the Code of Federal Regulations: ``Under section 3(c)  of the Voting Rights Act, a court, in voting rights litigation, can  order as relief that a jurisdiction not subject to the preclearance  requirement of section 5 preclear its voting changes by submitting them  either to the court or to the Attorney General.''   Again, section 3's procedures remain available today to those  challenging voting rules as discriminatory. Just a couple of years ago,  for example, U.S. District Court Judge Lee Rosenthal issued an opinion  in a redistricting  [[Page H9313]]  case that required the city of Pasadena, Texas, to be monitored by the  Justice Department because it had intentionally changed its city  council districts to decrease Hispanic influence.   The city, which the court ruled has a ``long history of  discrimination against minorities,'' was required to have their future  voting rules changes precleared by the Department of Justice for the  next 6 years, during which time the Federal judge ``retains  jurisdiction . . . to review before enforcement any change to the  election map or plan that was in effect in Pasadena on December 1,  2013.''   A change to the city's election plan can be enforced without review  by the judge only if it is submitted to the U.S. Attorney General and  the Department of Justice and has not objected within 60 days.   Voting rights are protected in this country, including in my own  State of Georgia, where Latino and African American voter turnout has  soared. Between 2014 and 2018, voter turnout increased by double  digits, both for men and women in both of these communities, and we are  committed to ensuring the ballot box is open to all eligible voters.   We are committed to ensuring constitutional means are used to  accomplish that. We are committed to protecting the value of every  American voice by securing our elections from fraud. These are our  priorities and our principles.   Full protections are afforded under current Federal law for all those  with valid claims of discrimination in voting. Unfortunately, the bill  before us today would turn those Federal shields that protect voters  into political weapons. This bill would essentially federalize State  and local election laws when there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever  that those States or localities engaged in any discriminatory behavior  when it comes to voting.   The Supreme Court has made it clear that this type of Federal control  over State and local elections is unconstitutional because Congress can  only do that when there is proof of actual discrimination, which is  what the bill is supposed to be about.   House Democrats continue their breakneck speed of everything else  that we have going on, and now, today, a partisan bill comes to the  floor to prevent States from running their own State and local  elections when we are dealing with this very issue of impeachment and  discussing elections at the same time.   When can we stop and ask: What is best for the United States? What is  best for our voters?   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 4, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), the  Republican leader on the House Administration Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   A final statement of something I am about to submit for the Record,  it is a Statement of Administration Policy. It says this: ``In sum,  several provisions of H.R. 4 violate principles of federalism and  exceed the powers granted to Congress by the Constitution, and these  provisions would likely be found unlawful if challenged. Accordingly,  the administration opposes H.R. 4.''   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record this Statement of Administration  Policy.                     Statement of Administration Policy                H.R. 4--Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2019                  (Rep. Sewell, D-AL, and 229 cosponsors)         The Administration opposes passage of H.R. 4, the Voting       Rights Advancement Act of 2019. H.R. 4 would amend the Voting       Rights Act (VRA) of 1965 by imposing a new coverage formula       and transparency obligations on States and local       jurisdictions regarding their elections. These amendments       raise serious policy concerns because the Federal Government       would be granted excessive control over State and local       election practices. Additionally, the Supreme Court has       already held similar restrictions imposed by Congress on       States and localities to be unconstitutional.        No individual should be denied or deterred from exercising       his or her right to vote. Federal law protects against voting       discrimination, allows judicial review of State and local       voting laws, and establishes preclearance requirements. H.R.       4 would overreach by giving the Federal Government too much       authority over an even greater number of voting practices and       decisions made by States and local governments without       justifying the current needs for such policies.        Section 3 of H.R. 4 would amend the VRA by setting forth a       new coverage formula that subjects certain States and local       subdivisions to Federal preclearance requirements before       undertaking certain election activities. For example, the       coverage formula would place restrictions on States with ``15       or more voting rights violations [that] occurred in . . . the       previous 25 calendar years.'' Once a State or locality is       covered by the formula, it would need permission from the       Attorney General or Federal courts before conducting certain       election activities prescribed by the bill.        In striking down the VRA's prior coverage formula, the       Supreme Court held that although ``[o]ur country has changed,       and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much,       Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy       that problem speaks to current conditions.'' Shelby County v.       Holder, 570 U.S. 529, 557 (2013). Accordingly, the coverage       formula set forth in section 3 of H.R. 4 that ``imposes       substantial federalism costs'' on States must therefore be       tailored to ``current needs.'' Id. at 540, 553 (internal       quotation marks omitted). Instead, section 3 continues to       permit reliance on potentially decades-old data--incidents       dating as far back as 25 years--as a justification for       imposing a preclearance requirement.        Additionally, section 4 of H.R. 4 would create a new       ``Practice-Based Preclearance'' standard, which would       automatically subject certain election laws to Federal       preclearance, thereby raising significant policy concerns.       This section would, among other things, prejudice Federal law       against State and local voter integrity efforts, such as       voter ID laws, and even impose requirements on routine       administrative actions that include changing voting       locations.        Finally, H.R. 4 would amend the VRA by imposing additional       transparency requirements regarding certain election       activities in Federal, State, and local jurisdictions.       Section 5 of H.R. 4 raises constitutional concerns because       its broad language would interfere with State and local       elections beyond the powers afforded by the Elections Clause.       Specifically, section 5 would require notice of demographic       information related to ``any change in the constituency that       will participate in an election for Federal, State, or local       office.'' This broad language would impose notice       requirements on States that make redistricting changes       despite no Federal election involvement. By doing so, H.R. 4       would impermissibly grant Congress authority beyond what is       authorized by the Elections Clause, and therefore section 5       would likely be found unconstitutional.        In sum, several provisions of H.R. 4 violate principles of       federalism and exceed the powers granted to Congress by the       Constitution, and these provisions would likely be found       unlawful if challenged. Accordingly, the Administration       opposes H.R. 4.        If H.R. 4 were presented to the President, his advisors       would recommend that he veto it.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  1100     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would just like to remind those of us voting, we can  like this bill or not like this bill, but this is not a reauthorization  of the Voting Rights Act. This is in addition to, and it is something  we have talked about on our side.   We appreciate the debate going on, but just as a clarification, we  are not reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act. The sections that are  already there are still going to be there, they are permanently  enshrined, and we are not going to be changing that. This is a  different part of that, and we would just like to make that clear.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1115     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I have made my statements very  clear on this, and I will continue to do so. For people who have really  struggled with and want to be a part of this, I am also going to say  that this is a time when we can reach out occasionally across the  aisle, and I can help my chairman with a little bit of time.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Clyburn).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume to close.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity at the time we have laid  this out. There have been exhaustive hearings on this.   Our objection to this is not about anything else except that we feel  the wording of this and the way this bill is laid out is not good for  our country, much of it will not be held up and will not have its  intended consequences.   I am one who believes and has a State that has been very active in  seeing our minority rolls and our minority voting participation  increase dramatically over the last 4 or 5 years, after, even, the  Shelby decision.   That is an undisputed fact; although, many times, it has been  disputed in many public speeches saying Georgia is going backwards. We  are not. Georgia is going forward and had many, many successes over the  last little bit encouraging minority voting. From my perspective, that  is exactly what we are supposed to be doing.  [[Page H9325]]    So, simply, as we have looked at it, we must move forward with ways  that we make sure every person who wants to vote has the ability to  vote and does so in a proper and legal way. That has never been a  discussion from our side. My only objection here is the way this goes  about it.   And there have been many other issues that we have brought up on  numerous, numerous occasions about how this could actually have adverse  effects across the country, especially if people wanted to really mess  with our voting system and play it for political gain. That is not a  discussion that we are having right here because we have had this in  multiple hearings up to this point.   So I think, for the voter who looks today, this is something that is  going forward with a good-hearted attempt. I will never question the  motivations of what is happening here. I just question the very fact of  what words are on paper.   We do not, in this body, vote on ideas. We do not vote on thoughts.  We vote on words on paper. And the words on paper here do not fulfill  what is being said about this bill.   With that said, I would ask that we vote ``no.'' There are plenty of  opportunities for us to continue to work on this, just not in this  current situation. I respectfully request that people would vote ``no''  and that we move forward with something that actually possibly could  work at a future date.   But from the majority side, this has nothing to do with people voting  or not voting. We want everyone to vote and everyone to participate,  but we want to do so in a fair and legal way.   This is something that we actually think would actually hurt that in  the long run as we go forward. That is why we are asking that this be  voted down, will not support it today, and, along with the  administration, who has said that it will be vetoed if it does reach  his desk, this is something we would rather find a way to have a bill  that could suffice or could make the provisions of this bill even  stronger. This is not happening today.   Mr. Speaker, I will ask for a ``no'' vote when this comes forward,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
