 Mr. Speaker, Mark Twain said many years ago: ``Thunder  is impressive; but it is lightning that does the work.''   Look, we can talk about doing things, or we can get the work done. I  think today we should choose to get the action done.   This is the first step that we need to take in order to help the  folks that live in our district, the small businesses, the cities and  the counties and the front-liners.   We know what's going to happen. We are going to go ahead and pass  this bill, this particular bill. It is going to go over to the Senate.  We will negotiate with the Senate. We will come back. And sometime in  the near future, we will be voting, and this particular bill will  become law.   Mr. Speaker, we can either talk about doing things or we can take the  first step. I choose to take the first step and get this bill moving.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all members to support this legislation, the  HEROES Act.
