 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of former Navajo  Nation President Albert Hale, who lost his battle with COVID this week.   Years ago, Albert and I served together in the Arizona House of  Representatives, working on water issues and fighting to uphold Tribal  sovereignty. As the second elected president of the Navajo Nation,  Albert Hale taught me so much about the Dine people, their culture, and  their long-overlooked struggles.   In this body, we are no strangers to the suffering the Navajo Nation  has endured throughout the course of this pandemic--and still is.  Forced to wait months for CARES Act funding to arrive, Navajo families  were often at the epicenter of this global pandemic, several times  experiencing the highest per capita infection rates in the world.   As a Congress, we must, once and for all, commit ourselves to  discontinuing the shelving of Native American issues and concerns. I  know that is what Albert Hale would have said.   We must wholeheartedly devote our efforts to serving all Americans  equitably and come together reinvigorated to pass legislation to meet  our obligations.   Today, I think of Albert's passing with a heavy heart for many  reasons. I am saddened to lose his friendship and guidance, his smile,  his sense of humor, and his sense of caring for his fellow Navajo and  American people. And I am frustrated to see yet again that the  community he fought to uplift continues to be left behind. Too many  Dine mothers, grandfathers, neighbors, and friends have fallen to this  deadly disease.   Since coming to Congress in 2017, I have strived to bring the voices  of all 12 sovereign Tribal nations in our district to the discussion  table in Washington. Today, I recommit myself to fighting for their  needs and honoring their unique stories, as Albert Hale did during his  time with us.   My thoughts are with the Hale family and the entire Navajo Nation as  we mourn Albert's passing. His work, his light, and his mission will  not be forgotten.   And I can't stand here today and not say that one of my last  conversations with Albert was about COVID.   I am so sad that he and many other people who have died from this  dreaded disease have not been able to be with their loved ones as they  have passed away, or their friends. I am saddened that I didn't know at  that time that Albert would have been stricken with this terrible  virus. But we do know Albert would say to us, Please continue to fight  the fight for the American people.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of David Snider,  a constituent, a colleague, and a friend who passed away late last  month. In every role, he dedicated himself selflessly and tirelessly to  his community.   I was honored to spend years working together on our State's water  conservation and management issues. Water is the lifeblood of the  Southwest, and David helped ensure that families across our great State  had access to clean drinking water.   David wore many hats, but the one that jumps out is his two terms as  Pinal County Supervisor. His efforts helped to keep Arizona on track  during the drought that still exists, and his plans and expertise have  helped us form important multi-State water agreements.   I know David's legacy will live on. My heart is with the Snider  family and the entire Casa Grande community as we mourn his passing.                            ____________________
