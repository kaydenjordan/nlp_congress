 Mr. Speaker, I rise to associate myself  with the remarks of the distinguished gentleman from Massachusetts.   I think he used the right words when he talked about theater.   Isn't it long overdue that we are honest with the American people  about what this is about?   Come on, Mr. Speaker, you can't really believe that what you are  proposing here isn't shielding the wealthiest people in this Nation and  corporations.   People at Augie & Ray's in East Hartford are not fooled by this, and  they understand what the agenda is. You place us further in debt and  leave us with little else to do to help the people who need it the  most.   What is this a guise for?   Cutting what you call entitlements.   What people at Augie & Ray's know are earned benefits that they pay  for every single week out of their paycheck where they pay their taxes  as well.
