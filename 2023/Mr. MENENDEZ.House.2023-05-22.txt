 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great public  servant, a law enforcement professional, a veteran of the United States  Navy, and a dear friend, Hudson County Sheriff Frank X. Schillari.   Sheriff Schillari will be honored tomorrow in New Jersey for his over  25 years of service, 13 of which he has served as our county's highest  ranking law enforcement professional.   Throughout that time, Sheriff Schillari has garnered respect from all  corners for his devotion to protecting the residents of Hudson County  and for ensuring our county roads, parks, and government facilities are  safe for all to use.   His accomplishments have included improved community policing, the  modernization of the sheriff's office, increased patrols of our county  parks and roads, and building up the county's crash investigation unit.   In the last 25 years, Sheriff Schillari has embodied the best of law  enforcement: fairness, respect, and devotion to his county, State, and  country.    All the while, he has been a caring father to his children and a  husband to his wonderful wife of 50 years, Mrs. Schillari, an  incredible individual in her own right.   Today, on behalf of our county, I thank him and congratulate him on  being honored by those who he has so selflessly served.                            ____________________
