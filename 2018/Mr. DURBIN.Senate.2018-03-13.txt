 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, on September 5 of last year, President  Trump announced the repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood  Arrivals Program, known as DACA. As a result of that decision by  President Trump, hundreds of thousands of immigrants who came to the  United States as children, known as Dreamers, face losing their work  permits and their right to stay in America without deportation. They  are threatened with being returned to countries that many of them  barely remember, if at all.   These Dreamers were brought here as children--infants, toddlers,  young kids--by their parents to America, and they grew up here. They  went to school in America, to our public schools and other schools that  were available to them. They stood up in their classrooms every morning  and pledged allegiance to the flag. They grew up believing that this  was their home.   At some point in their lives their parents pulled them aside and told  them the bitter truth--that they were not legally in America, they were  undocumented, and they were vulnerable. At any minute, a knock on the  door or a stop on the highway could result in not only their  deportation but the deportation of every member of their  family. Growing up is tough enough for an adolescent. I can't imagine  growing up with this shadow over me, wondering whether at any moment a  misstep or being in the wrong place might mean that I would be sent  from this country and that my parents would be sent with me, but they  grew up with that reality and with that danger.    They did some extraordinary things. They not only prospered in  America and finished their education, they went on with great ambition,  believing the day would come when they would get a chance to be part of  this country.   Seventeen years ago, I introduced the Dream Act. The purpose of that  bill was to give those young people a chance--a chance to earn their  way to legal status, earn their way to citizenship. If they have a  serious criminal record, they are gone and we want nothing to do with  them. They had squandered any opportunity they had to be part of  America's future. But if they were doing the right thing, leading a  good life, working hard, finishing school, many of us believed they  deserved a chance. In fact, at this point, 85 percent of Americans  believe they deserve a chance, and that includes 60 percent of the  people who voted for President Trump.   We have never passed the Dream Act and made it the law, but when I  asked my former Senate colleague, President Obama, to see if there was  something he could do by Executive order, he created DACA. DACA gave  these young people a 2-year renewable protection. They had to pay a  $500 fee, submit themselves to a criminal background check, and if they  passed it, they would end up with a temporary, renewable right to stay  in America. About 800,000 came forward and did it.   There were many more who were eligible but scared--scared that  turning over their family's information and their personal information  to this government or any government could turn out badly. Can you  blame them? They have lived their whole lives in fear that a highway  stop or somebody being arrested next to them could mean they would have  to leave the only country they had ever known. But 800,000 stepped up  and said: We will do it. I encouraged them. I went to so many meetings  in Chicago, around the State of Illinois, and around the country  telling them that this DACA Program was for real and that the  government was giving them a pledge that they would stand by them on a  renewable basis because of President Obama's order.   The program was a huge success. As I mentioned, 800,000 signed up,  and some even renewed. Then came the decision by President Trump to end  the program. What he said was that by March 5 of this year, there would  be no more DACA. Those who were protected could play out their  temporary protection but no renewals.   That is where the issue stood for the longest time. Many of us  decided that we needed to do something about it and to accept the  President's challenge and create a law--a law that would provide  protection for these young people. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican  from South Carolina; Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican from Arizona;  Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican from Colorado; Senator Michael  Bennet, a Democrat from Colorado; and Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat  from New Jersey--we came together and decided on a bipartisan basis to  draw up a bill to try to solve this problem, be fair to these young  people, and give them a chance to stay in America and earn their way to  citizenship. When we proposed the bill to President Trump, he rejected  it. In fact, he rejected six different bipartisan proposals to solve  this problem.   So the deadline was looming and passed last week on March 5, and the  program, by the President's proclamation, would have been finished were  it not for two Federal courts that intervened and said: No, Mr.  President. You may have overstepped. You may have done more than you  can legally do. So we are going to protect these Dreamers, these DACA  young people, until we resolve the question on your constitutional  authority to make that decision.   At the current moment, more than 700,000 of these young DACA  recipients are protected by a court order that required that they  reopen DACA eligibility for those whose DACA protection had expired,  the 2-year temporary protection. Now tens of thousands of them are  coming forward and applying for DACA renewal.  [[Page S1647]]    Last week I called Secretary Nielsen at the Department of Homeland  Security and said: I have some questions that I am hearing as I travel  around. For example, if I was protected by DACA and my protection came  to an end and I am now reapplying for DACA and going to your agency,  how long will it take your agency to process my application?   Secretary Nielsen could not give me an exact date, but there has been  speculation that it could take 4 to 6 months. You see, there is a big  backlog of cases, and it could take months before they process all  those cases. That was my first question.   My second question: In that 4- to 6-month period, can these young  DACA recipients be deported?   She said no. I put out an order, she said, that no one is to be  deported if they made an application for DACA renewal.   I asked Secretary Nielsen: Can we have that in writing?   I will get back to you, she said.   I don't think that is too much to ask--whether these young people can  be protected from deportation while they are applying for DACA renewal.   The third question: There is also a legal ability to work under DACA.  Can you protect these young people's ability to have a job while you  are processing their applications?   She didn't know whether she could. I have since learned that she has  the authority to do that, but it is an important question, isn't it? If  you happen to be one of these DACA recipients--the vast majority of  them are actually working, and most of them are in school or have  graduated. They have to. They don't qualify for any Federal Pell grants  or government loans, so they need to work to pay off their education.  That is understandable.   So it is still uncertain as to what is going to happen. Then what  happens when the court lifts this injunction, and what will be the  future of these young people?   President Trump said some harsh things about immigration during the  course of the Presidential campaign. We all remember his comments about  people of the Muslim religion, his comments about Mexican rapists, and  his pledge to build a big, beautiful wall from sea to shining sea and  have Mexico pay for it. Do you remember? We all heard those things. But  an interesting thing happened after he was elected: He started saying  more moderate, positive things about Dreamers, to the point where I  actually had some hope that this particular group would have a fighting  chance. As of today, there is no indication that President Trump feels  the same way. Six different bipartisan proposals have been rejected. So  here we stand with this uncertainty.   When the issue came before the Senate, we did our best to put  together a bipartisan rollcall. We came close but not close enough.  There were 4 proposals on the floor, and the one with the largest  number of votes received 54 votes. There were three Democrats who  disagreed with some parts of it. I think we could have probably found a  way to get their support. But we only had 8 Republicans who joined us-- 8 out of 51--to vote for the measure to deal with this issue. So it is  still an unresolved issue at this moment as to what is going to happen  after the court cases.   I have come to the floor many times--in fact, over 100 times--to tell  the stories of these Dreamers, and I would like to do that today before  I yield to the Democratic leader.   This is Maria Torres Mendoza. Maria is the 111th Dreamer I have  featured here on the floor of the Senate. She came here to the United  States from Mexico when she was 5 years old, and she grew up in the  State of Washington. Her family didn't have much money, so she worked  pretty hard. She used to deliver newspapers. She delivered 100  newspapers before school each morning. She worked odd jobs--shoveled  snow, cut grass. When she was in high school, she worked as a server at  a restaurant every day while she was still going to school, kept up  with her studies, and delivered the newspapers in the morning. You can  tell Maria is not a lazy person.   Because of her family's financial struggles, despite her best  efforts, her family was homeless for some time. Through it all, she was  an excellent student, and despite her family difficulties, she  graduated from high school with a 3.8 grade point average.   She didn't believe she would ever make it to college, but she did.  She was accepted at Washington State University Tri-Cities. She is a  senior now, and this spring, she will graduate with a bachelor's degree  in mechanical engineering and a minor in computer science. She is  currently working as a student engineer at ATI Titanium and Specialty  Alloys, a specialty parts manufacturer. Her main project is creating a  system to facilitate the usage of AutoCAD drawings and manuals for  engineering and maintenance. I hope none of my colleagues ask me to  explain what I just said, but it sounds like pretty important work.  What is her dream? She wants a master's degree in engineering. She is  particularly interested in nuclear-powered mechatronics--the technology  that combines electronics and mechanical engineering.   Maria wrote me a letter, and here is what it said:         DACA is a whole world of opportunities for me. If DACA were       to be taken away from me, all my hard work would not count. I       want to see the results of my hard work and I wouldn't be       able to do so without DACA.    Would America be a better place if Maria was asked to leave? Would we  be a stronger nation if we took this young girl's amazing energy, her  academic accomplishment, and her dream and drive and sent them back to  Mexico? After all these years, after education and hard work--two jobs  at a time when she was in high school--is there any doubt that this  young woman is going to be a spectacular success in life?   That is what this comes down to--real human beings, DACA recipients,  protected by that Executive order of President Obama's, who are now  under the threat of deportation because of President Trump's decision.  It is a test of who we are as a nation, whether we believe in fairness  and opportunity or whether we are going to walk away from our legacy.  This is a nation of immigrants.   I stand before you proudly, the son of an immigrant to this country.  My mother was brought here from Lithuania when she was 2 years old, and  here her son stands as a Senator from the State of Illinois. That is my  story, that is my family's story, and that is America's story.   It is time for us to remember Maria and the hundreds of thousands  just like her who are asking for a chance to be part of our future.   Mr. President, is it possible that with all the things on your mind,  you have forgotten DACA and the Dreamers?   We need President Trump to step up and lead.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues, Senator  Sanders, Senator Murphy, and Senator Lee, for this bipartisan effort.   Why are we here today? Why are we discussing wars so far away? We are  here because of this book. This is the Constitution of the United  States. The Constitution very expressly tells us what we are supposed  to be doing here. In article I, section 8, it lays out the things that  we, the men and women who serve in Congress, are responsible for. Among  the things that Congress shall have the power to do is to ``declare  war.''   Why did the Founding Fathers make certain that it was clear that  Congress would be involved in that decision on the declaration of war?  When they created Congress, the idea was that the people of this  country, far and wide, would at least have a voice in the decision,  through the people they elected, and we would be held accountable for  our decisions to declare war or to not declare it because we are up for  election. So Congress has this responsibility, and over the years, many  times, Congress has not exercised its responsibility in a responsible  way.   I have a question. I bet that if I brought in every U.S. Senator and  asked them the following question, very few would be able to answer it:  How many countries is the United States military currently involved in  [[Page S1667]]  fighting? How many countries are we in today, fighting? Would you guess  two? Iraq, Afghanistan--all right, for sure, there. Five? Ten? Twenty?   Brown University's Costs of War Project recently published data  saying that the United States fought terror through direct fighting,  training, or military support to other forces or through drone strikes  in 76 countries between October 2015 and 2017. Is that the right number  today? I am not sure. None of us know.   We are often surprised to learn we are sending our military and  fighting in another country. When something awful occurs--Americans are  killed, for example--sometimes Members of Congress hear it for the  first time: Oh, we are in what country fighting?   I take this pretty seriously, and I have over the years when it comes  to the authorization of using force, because it isn't just a matter of  projecting American power; it is life and death. These are decisions  that will be made by Congress or by the President--sometimes both--and  the net result of it, even under the best of circumstances, is that  Americans will perish. Funerals will be held in Illinois and in Utah  and in Vermont and in Connecticut and in Wisconsin. That is the reality  of the decisions we reach.   I can remember the debate right after 9/11 on the floor. It was one  of the most important of my career. It was a question about whether we  would authorize the President of the United States--President Bush at  the time--to use military force to respond to 9/11. If my colleagues  remember the debate, there were two real options on the floor. One was  to use military force against those responsible for the attack on the  United States and to send that force into Afghanistan. The other was to  go after the so-called weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. They were  two parallel debates, but two debates that I saw very differently.   I was skeptical from the start about this Iraqi invasion. Nobody ever  connected the dots between Saddam Hussein and 9/11. We were talking  about the threat that he was to the rest of the world. Yet we voted  here on the floor of the U.S. Senate in 2002 to authorize the use of  military force to go into Iraq. Sadly, we are still there today. Sadly,  Iraq is in shambles, politically and physically, and the war continues.   I voted no. I remember that night. It was in October of 2002. I  remember that night because the vote was taken very late, and there  were two or three of us who stayed on the floor here, including Kent  Conrad, as well as Paul Wellstone of Minnesota. Paul Wellstone was up  for reelection. We wondered if that vote would affect him in any way,  and I remember going up to him and saying: Paul, I hope your vote  against the war in Iraq doesn't cost you the election.   Wellstone said to me: It is all right if it does. People know where I  stand. They expect nothing less.   He didn't live to see the election. If my colleagues will remember,  he died in a plane crash with his wife and staffers just a few days  after that vote.   But that is the gravity of this decision. That is the importance of  this decision. And that is why I want to thank my colleagues for  bringing us together--just a few of us but enough of us, maybe--in the  Senate to remind people of our constitutional responsibility.   The vote on Afghanistan was one I voted for--the invasion of  Afghanistan. The message was clear: If you attack the United States, we  will come right back after you, al-Qaida, and we did.   I recently asked the Secretary of Defense--when I voted that way in  2002, I did not imagine that 15 or 16 years later, that war would  continue. So I asked him: How does this war ever end in Afghanistan? He  didn't know the answer. He didn't come up with one. All he could say to  me was that if we left, it would be worse.    Well, you can say that about a lot of other countries in the world.  But what we are talking about today is what we are going to do in terms  of this horrid situation in Yemen. I was in my office looking down on  this debate via C-SPAN, and I saw the photos that have been displayed  here--the utter human and physical devastation that is taking place.   Senator Sanders is asking a simple but deeply important question here  today, and Senator Lee and Senator Murphy join him. Here is the  question: Who authorized the U.S. military action to help Saudi Arabia  fight the Houthis in Yemen? I didn't. I don't remember that there was  ever a vote. So how are we doing this? By what authority is our  government doing this?   This is not about the merits of the fight or in any way a vindication  of the Houthis' troubling role in the horrific Yemeni civil war; it is  about whether Congress follows its constitutional responsibilities. It  is about whether the American people have a voice in this decision--the  same people who will send their sons and daughters to bravely serve in  our military.   I am happy to be a cosponsor of this resolution that halts any such  U.S. support without any congressional authorization. I call on this  Congress to deal with revisiting the 2001 and 2002 authorizations of  force that I believe have been stretched by multiple administrations  beyond any credible limit.   There are real threats to the safety and security of America out  there--al-Qaida and its successors and others. But we in Congress have  the responsibility to authorize those conflicts and regularly update  them as necessary.   Congress and the Senate have been absent without leave when it comes  to article I, section 8, and our authority and responsibility to  declare war. We have other looming threats, including North Korea and  Iran, but any U.S. war against those countries or others, short of  protecting against an imminent attack as allowed for in the War Powers  Resolution, requires the vote of Congress, regardless of who the  President may be.   When it comes to the declaration of war, we simply cannot see this as  an annoyance. We must do our part. We must follow the Constitution,  even when it is difficult.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, for the past 6 years, Senator Sheldon  Whitehouse of Rhode Island has delivered weekly addresses to the Senate  Chamber on climate change, telling us that it is time to wake up. That  is the sign he posts on the floor each time he comes to discuss the  disastrous effects of global warming. Today will mark his 200th speech  on the Senate floor on this topic.   The urgency of the topic is real. Climate change threatens our  national security and our local communities. Climate change drives  global conflict and has far-reaching national security implications.   A report by Oxfam states that there is growing evidence that climate  change is making droughts more frequent and more severe.   Drought has contributed to the crisis in Syria, migration from West  Africa, and rapid urbanization in Somalia. Just last week, ``PBS  NewsHour'' reported that in the last year alone, more than 1 million  Somalis have been forced from their homes because of drought.   Herders and farmers used to live among one another, but increasingly  severe drought has led to a scarcity of land and water. Some animal  herders now carry weapons and fight over fertile land. Farmers who have  fled to the city claim herders burned down their homes and turned their  farmland into grassland. The fighting and scarcity of land has pushed  both farmers and herders to the cities, and most of them end up in  ramshackle camps, burdened by poverty--a tinderbox.   Last March, 110 people died from starvation and drought-related  illness in 48 hours, prompting President Mohamed Abdullahi Farmajo to  declare the drought a national disaster. Still, 1.2 million children  under the age of 5 are projected to be malnourished in 2018.   Somalia is not the only country where the effects of climate change  have created and exacerbated regional conflicts. In a few days, Syria  will mark the seventh year of civil war. Research published by the  National Academy of Sciences reports that climate change has  contributed to the crisis in Syria. Extreme drought in Syria between  2006 and 2009 was most likely due to climate change, and that drought  was a factor in the uprisings in 2011, when more than 1 million  displaced farmers joined pro-democracy protests.   Just last year, Pulitzer Prize-winning New York Times columnist Tom  Friedman wrote about massive migration out of parts of West Africa,  through the Sahara Desert, to Libya, where people were hoping to  eventually cross the Mediterranean Sea into Europe. The migration is  driven in part by drought made more extreme by climate change, which  has created widespread humanitarian crises.   As climate instability drives more extreme and frequent droughts and  the scarcity of fertile land, water, and food, it will trigger major  conflicts over resources, as we have seen in Yemen and Syria. As one of  the largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions, the United States  has a moral responsibility to act on this growing crisis.   Here in our country, my constituents in Illinois are already  experiencing the adverse effects of climate change. Climate models  suggest that if current global warming trends continue, Illinois will  have a climate similar to that of the Texas gulf coast by the year  2100. You can't grow a lot of corn in that climate. For Illinois  farmers, these changes to the environment have a direct effect on their  livelihood--and for all of us, a direct effect on our food supply.   Wetter springs and more frequent flooding will leave farmers  struggling to plant their corn and soybeans. Increasingly hot summers  and more frequent droughts will stunt the growth and hurt crop yields.  This means prices will increase, making it harder for families to put  food on the table.   In recent years, Illinois has seen historic storms, floods, and  droughts that have caused millions of dollars in damage.   Last week, scientists at the Illinois State Water Survey reported  that this February was the wettest on record, beating the previous  record precipitation by over half an inch. An average of 5 inches of  rain fell statewide. Streator, IL, had over 11 inches of rain, and  Aurora had the largest snowfall, with a recorded 26 inches of snow. In  the last week of February, rainstorms and melted snow caused flooding  across Illinois, with more than 20 counties throughout the State placed  under a flood warning. As the water level of rivers continued to rise,  several communities had to evacuate for their safety. Multiple  communities were evacuated, and in some areas, residents had to be  rescued by boat. Flooded roadways claimed the life of an Illinois  resident after her car rolled into a rain-filled ditch.   Climate change is likely to increase the frequency and severity of  flooding in Illinois, as well, and my constituents are concerned about  their ability to recover from repeated flood events.  [[Page S1670]]    How much is flood damage costing us in Illinois? Last July, 3,200  residences were impacted by flooding, including 244 with major damage.  This damage costs millions but often doesn't rise to the level where  anyone qualifies for Federal aid. From 2007 to 2014, flooding in urban  areas has caused $2.3 billion in damages.   Moving forward, repeated flood events will have a high price tag. In  the last decade, extreme weather events and fire have cost the Federal  Government over $350 billion, according to OMB. These costs will rise  as the climate changes.   The evidence is clear. We need to get serious about addressing the  cause and effect of climate change. Ignoring them threatens our  national security and our safety. I believe our generation has a moral  obligation to leave the world in better shape than we found it. Let's  not run away from our responsibility to our children and grandchildren.  Let's work toward solving the challenges of climate change.   This is a hard issue to explain from a political point of view. The  only major political party in the world today that denies climate  change is the Republican Party of the United States of America.   It is hard to imagine that a great party that once was actively  engaged in a positive way in this debate is now absent without leave.   It is hard to explain that the party of Richard Nixon, who created  the Environmental Protection Agency, now is in complete denial when it  comes to climate change and global warming.   It is hard to understand that they are missing the obvious indicators  of evidence from every corner of the world about the impact of global  warming.   It is almost impossible to understand how they can ignore the impact  this will have on the lives of our children and grandchildren. Is it  too much to ask our generation to make a little sacrifice to spare them  the devastation that will come from climate change? Is it too much to  ask us to be a little more sensitive in our use of energy so that our  kids and grandkids can enjoy a good life in their years on Earth? That  usually is a responsibility most generations accept, but we are being  told that it is just too much to ask--to ask current Americans to come  forward and do something that is thoughtful, meaningful, to reduce  energy consumption and reduce emission and pollution. I think that is a  horrible situation. I think it is one we shouldn't be proud of at all.   I thank my friend Sheldon Whitehouse for coming to the floor  regularly and reminding us of what is happening in this world today and  how we each have a responsibility to future generations to alleviate  the suffering, the pain, and the damage that has been caused by this  global warming.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
