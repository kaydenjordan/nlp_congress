 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 894) strongly condemning and denouncing the drastic  rise of antisemitism in the United States and around the world.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 894         Whereas acts of hate, intimidation, discrimination, and       violence based on ethnicity or religion have no place in our       country nor in the global community;        Whereas the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's       working definition of antisemitism is widely accepted and       serves as a critical tool to help individuals comprehend and       identify the various manifestations of antisemitism;        Whereas, since the massacre of innocent Israelis by Hamas,       an Iran-backed terrorist organization, on October 7, 2023,       antisemitic incidents of harassment, vandalism, and assault       in the United States have spiked 388 percent over the same       period last year, according to reports from the Anti-      Defamation League's (ADL) Center on Extremism;        Whereas drastic increases in antisemitic activity has also       been seen in Jewish communities around the world since the       October 7, 2023, Hamas attacks;        Whereas the slogan ``From the River to the Sea'', which is       a rallying cry for the eradication of the State of Israel and       the Jewish people, has been used by anti-Israel protesters in       the United States and globally;        Whereas, on October 8, 2023, a car with individuals holding       Palestinian flags appeared to intentionally swerve out of its       lane, nearly hitting a visibly Jewish family in Clifton, New       Jersey;        Whereas, on October 15, 2023, an individual in New York,       New York, punched a Jewish woman in the face at Grand Central       Terminal solely because she was Jewish;        Whereas, on October 28, 2023, a Jewish man in Sydney,       Australia, was severely injured by 3 anti-Israel rioters, in       which he was punched in the head at least 12 times, suffered       a concussion, 2 black eyes, and 4 spinal fractures;        Whereas, on November 3, 2023, a Jewish woman's store in New       York City was attacked by a mob of anti-Israel protesters all       because she hung posters of Israeli hostages in the store       window;        Whereas, on November 3, 2023, 4 masked men walked into a       restaurant in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and proceeded to       tear down an Israeli flag and yelled ``Free Palestine'';        Whereas, on November 4, 2023, an Arizona man was arrested       by Federal authorities for threatening to execute a local       Rabbi and ``every other JEW I can find tonight at midnight of       your Sabbath'';        Whereas, on November 4, 2023, during an anti-Israel protest       in Washington, DC, rioters shouted their support for Hamas       massacre on October 7, 2023, and other acts of terror       targeting Israel, called for the end of the State of Israel,       and spewed hateful and vile language amplifying antisemitic       themes;        Whereas, during that same protest in Washington, DC,       rioters stormed and tried to scale the White House fence,       vandalized property by staining blood-red handprints onto the       side of the White House pillars, and spray painted ``Death to       Israel'' and ``Glory to our Martyrs'' on buildings in DC;        Whereas, on November 6, 2023, Paul Kessler, a 69-year-old       Jewish man, tragically died due to injuries sustained when an       anti-Israel protester struck him in the head with a megaphone       in Los Angeles, California;        Whereas, on November 11, 2023, as part of a massive anti-      Israel protest, rioters set off smokebombs in front of a       synagogue in London, England;        Whereas, on November 12, 2023, police found several       headstones at the Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery, a Jewish       cemetery in Brooklyn, Ohio, were desecrated with swastikas;        Whereas, on November 13, 2023, a mezuzah was torn off the       doorpost of a Jewish person's apartment and a knife was stuck       into the wood in its place in Milan, Italy;        Whereas, on November 13, 2023, the evening before the March       for Israel in Washington, DC, anti-Israel rioters vandalized       a Jewish medical tent by spray painting ``Free Gaza'',       ``Palestine Will Be Free'', and ``Gaza Will Win''; and        Whereas, on November 15, 2023, anti-Israel protesters       illegally blocked and violently attacked the Democratic       National Committee headquarters, endangering the lives of       individuals inside, including Members of Congress, and       injuring 6 Capitol Police Officers; Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) strongly condemns and denounces all instances of       antisemitism occurring in the United States and globally;        (2) reaffirms and reiterates its strong support for the       Jewish community at home and abroad;        (3) calls on elected officials and world leaders to condemn       and fight all forms of domestic and global antisemitism;        (4) clearly and firmly states that anti-Zionism is       antisemitism; and        (5) rejects all forms of terror, hate, discrimination, and       harassment of members of the Jewish community.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H. Res. 894.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, since the October 7 terrorist attack by Hamas against  Israel, anti-Semitism has surged in the United States and around the  world.   Reports show that there was a nearly 400 percent increase in anti- Semitic incidents in the weeks after the attack. These incidents  include harassment, vandalism, and assault. Americans have been  punched, beaten, and forced to flee for their lives from swerving cars  simply because they are Jewish.                                time  1715    A Jewish cemetery in Brooklyn, Ohio, was vandalized with swastikas.   On college campuses, Jewish students have been subjected to  harassment, threats, and forced to hide from violent protests.   In a recent survey, 73 percent of Jewish college students said they  had experienced or witnessed some form of anti-Semitism this academic  year.   In the same survey, just 39 percent of Jewish students said they felt  comfortable with their peers knowing they were Jewish.   Less than half of Jewish students surveyed said that they felt safe  on campus.   At a hearing before our committee last month, a college student  testified that she now thinks twice before wearing any sign of her  Jewish faith. This was a young woman who is maybe 20 years old. She had  the courage to come and testify before Congress, but she can't safely  wear something that would suggest to her fellow students and her  teachers that she is Jewish.   She testified that her family and friends who live in Israel--people  who are under nearly constant rocket attack from Hamas--and others  check in with her every day to see if she is safe. They are in a war  zone. She is in the United States, and they are checking to make sure  that she is safe.   These incidents are absolutely horrifying, Mr. Speaker. They are  unacceptable in the United States and in any civilized society. Members  of the Jewish community should not have to hide their faith in order to  safely go about their lives or receive an education.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this resolution, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, November 30, 2023.      Hon. Jim Jordan,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Jordan: Thank you for consulting with the       Foreign Affairs Committee, which agrees to be discharged from       further consideration of H. Res. 894 (Strongly condemning and       denouncing the drastic rise of antisemitism in the United       States and around the world), so that the measure may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor.        I ask that you place our letters on this resolution into       the Congressional Record during floor consideration. I       appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                 Michael T. McCaul,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, December 1, 2023.      Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman McCaul: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H. Res. 894, Strongly  [[Page H6107]]       condemning and denouncing the drastic rise of antisemitism in       the United States and around the world, so that the measure       may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your forgoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee, or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this measure or similar legislation in the future.        I will include the exchange of these letters in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of this       measure. I appreciate your cooperation regarding this       legislation and look forward to continuing to work together       on matters of shared jurisdiction during this Congress. Thank       you for your attention to this matter.            Sincerely,                                                        Jim Jordan,                                                          Chairman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I say briefly that I very much do applaud the gentleman from New  York, who I think has shown tremendous leadership in many ways in  standing up for Israel and fighting against anti-Semitism in this  country.   I think one of the valuable things that we have seen over the last  several weeks is that we have had bipartisan support on both counts. I  actually sponsored a separate resolution dealing specifically with the  problem of anti-Semitism on college campuses, and that got overwhelming  bipartisan support on this floor. I think it had only about 21 ``no''  votes. That has been very encouraging.   With respect to the three charges that were mentioned, number one,  there is legislation in the House right now to codify the President's  executive order, on which I think it is important that we move forward.   Number two, far from saying we shouldn't have an Office of Civil  Rights within the Department of Education, Representative Burgess Owens  and I wrote a letter to the head of the Office of Civil Rights in the  Department of Education telling them they need to be doing more, they  need to be more proactive in looking into anti-Semitic incidents at our  universities, and we would certainly welcome their support on that  letter.   Number three, as far as the protection for synagogues and other  facilities, I would be very interested in partnering with you on any  such efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 5 o'clock and 35 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, December 5, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.
