 Madam Speaker, I will vote in favor of impeachment  today. The facts are irrefutable, and the ongoing obstruction and  coverup is shameful.   My parents came here as immigrants, and I am proud to live in a  nation that rewarded their hard work by providing a better future for  my sisters and me. As a first generation American and now a Member of  Congress, a story like mine is only made possible by a nation that  upholds the rule of law and truly lives out the values enshrined in our  Constitution.    Mona and I are blessed with three wonderful daughters and five  grandkids. Because of this living legacy and the legacy I intend to  pass on to my grandchildren, my vote today is rooted in protecting  their future.   The underpinnings for impeachment are real and historic. Trump has  perverted the rule of law, abused his power, and engaged in a coverup.  No amount of misdirection, lies, disinformation, tantrums, and cries of  victimization by Trump and others can undo the abuse of power and  obstruction of Congress that remain clear and present. The President  leaves us no choice but to vote to impeach, so that we can protect our  democracy and correct the damage that is already done.   I will vote in favor of the impeachment of Donald J. Trump, not as a  partisan act but as a serious, urgent, and necessary one.
