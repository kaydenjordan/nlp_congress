 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   As the majority leader gave his remarks a few moments ago, I was  reminded that, in December of 2010, I was in this House of  Representatives and, during a lameduck session, the House of  Representatives had, at that time, a sizable Democratic majority. They  had lost the majority in the 2010 election, so it was the waning hours  of the Democratic majority, and they passed what was then known as  Senator Durbin's DREAMer bill here in the House of Representatives.                                time  1645    It went over to the Senate, and Democrats had a 59-41 majority in the  United States Senate, and the Dreamer bill failed to achieve cloture,  not because it was blocked by Republicans. Three Republicans voted with  the then-majority Democrats to move the bill along. Senator Lugar, no  longer with us, Senator Murkowski, who is still with us, and Senator  Bennett from Utah, voted in favor of moving that bill along.   Five Democrats voted against cloture, and that was the reason why, in  the waning days of President Obama's first 2 years, as the Democratic  majority was winding down its term, that that bill did not pass.   But this bill before us today--and I felt so compelled to come and  talk about this because we have a serious problem in the lower Rio  Grande Valley sector on our Texas-Mexico border. There are parts of  that border where there is not a single stick of barrier and, as a  consequence, the number of people coming over--you have read the  headlines, you have heard the statistics that have been talked about  here today, 100,000 a month.   I serve on the Committee on Energy and Commerce. We have the Office  of Refugee Resettlement under our jurisdiction in the Health  Subcommittee. The men and women there do a tremendous job. They do  everything we ask.   I visited one of their facilities last week, Casa Padre, down in  Brownsville, Texas; 1,380 children under their care. That number has  stayed fairly constant since my previous visit last July. They get some  kids in, they move some kids out, and it is a steady state.   But at the border station in McAllen, it is a different story. They  have no control over how many come in.   Yes, the law says that within 72 hours--it is purely a processing  center--they are to move, particularly children, out of their center  and off to the OOR facilities. But if there is no place to receive them  then they cannot. And OOR, by law, cannot receive more children than  they are allowed to receive.   They closed the surge facility up in Tornillo by El Paso during the  summer, so there is no place else to go.   I have got to tell you, the men and women who work for the Customs  and Border Patrol in the State of Texas in the lower Rio Grande Valley  sector, overwhelmed is not a strong enough word. They are burnt out.  They have been taking care of so many people for so long, and they are  asking, Where is the United States Congress? Why will we not reform the  asylum laws that would allow us to get on top of this situation?  [[Page H4285]]
