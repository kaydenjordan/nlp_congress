 Madam Speaker, with great expectation, we expect to  have the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act on the floor of the House  this week.   I am joined in these special 1-minute speeches by Congressman Bowman  from New York and Congresswoman Lee from California. On behalf of the  Congressional Black Caucus, we are here to say that the tragic death of  George Floyd has awakened the Nation and the world to the gross  injustice that too many African Americans face on a daily basis.   Eight minutes and 46 seconds, and the world stood up. New Zealand and  London, around the world, they all said, enough is enough.   This legislation will now have qualified immunity reform, pattern and  practice investigations, the idea of a national police misconduct  registry, the Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity Act banning choke  holds, banning no-knock drug warrants.   It will be a new day in the relationship between police and  community. Crisis units because police do not want to be social  workers. We know there are officers who believe in protect and serve.  At the same time, we know the Nation does not want police misconduct.   Let's work together, pass this legislation, and let it be signed by  the President of the United States. I thank the Congressional Black  Caucus for its leadership. The world is watching us this week.                            ____________________
