 Mr. President, let me say at the outset that I support  the position from the Senator from Kentucky. I believe that what he has  said about the situation between the United States and Saudi Arabia is  timely and needs to be heard. People across the United States and  around the world should be aware of the fact that we are witnessing  four famines across this world. One of them is in Yemen, and three  others are on the continent of Africa. This is a famine that is created  not by drought, not by national defense, but by human disaster--by a  war that has been created and is one that has been pushed largely by  the Saudis at the expense of the people--the innocent people--who live  in the country of Yemen.   What the Senator from Kentucky is basically calling on all of us to  do is to ask: What role is the United States playing in Saudi Arabia's  aggressive activities? Should we be more vigilant in our knowing that  what we are selling them is being used in ways that are inconsistent  with the values of the United States of America? We know the record of  the Saudi monarchy when it comes to human rights, and the Senator from  Kentucky has spoken to that quite eloquently. We know what they have  done to their own people, to the people who live in their country, and  to those who seek to have the basic freedoms that we take for granted  in America.   We also know that, when it comes to the Saudi activity of promoting  their version--the most extreme version--of Islam, they have been  guilty of promulgating Wahhabism, which has led to extreme forms of the  Muslim faith in some places in the world. Those are realities.   We know the reality of 9/11. When we traced the origins of those who  came and killed 3,000 innocent Americans, too many roads led back to  Riyadh; too many roads led back to Saudi Arabia. So why can't we be  more open and honest in our relationship with this country?   The Senator from Kentucky has told us this morning that the amendment  that will be offered shortly by him and by Senator Murphy is one that  calls on the Senate to take an honest look at Saudi Arabia today and  its relationship with the United States.  [[Page S3419]]    May I add one other element on a personal basis?   It is so rare on the floor of the Senate to see what we have just  seen this morning--a proposal for an amendment to be debated and an  amendment to be voted on on the floor of the Senate. I can count on one  hand how many times that has happened this year in the Senate. What  used to be the most deliberative body in America--the great debating  society and so forth--has turned into a place of rubberstamps and  unanimous consents. I am glad--win or lose in our effort here on this  amendment--that the Senator is bringing this important issue to the  floor. I thank him for making it a bipartisan effort in the process.                            Healthcare Legislation    Mr. President, what I have come to the floor to speak to is another  issue that really calls on the Senate and asks the basic question: Why  are we here?   I think we know that we were elected to make America a better nation  and to help families across this Nation realize the great opportunity  and goodness of this Nation.   One of the issues that most people worry about the most in their  daily lives is healthcare. They should. Many times, I have said on the  floor that, if you have ever been in a position in your life as a  father of a seriously sick child and have had no health insurance when  that has happened, you will never forget that as long as you live. I  know. I have been there. I went through a period of time with my wife,  in raising our daughter, when she needed the best medical care in  America, and we did not have any health insurance. It was frightening  to think what would happen to our little girl because we did not have  the protection of health insurance and the quality care that everybody  wants for themselves and for the people they love.   At this moment in time, we are in a debate about the future of  healthcare in America--the future of health insurance in America. I  cannot think of a more serious topic. People say: Well, it is one-sixth  of the American economy--our healthcare system. That is critically  important. Even more so, this is such a personal matter for every  individual.   The Affordable Care Act, which was passed 6 or 7 years ago, I was  proud to vote for. We couldn't get any support from the other side of  the aisle--not one single vote, not one Republican vote in support of  it. Our goal, of course, with the Affordable Care Act was to reduce the  number of Americans who were uninsured when it came to health  insurance. We achieved a major part of our goal. The rate of uninsured  in health insurance in America was cut in half by the Affordable Care  Act. We expanded opportunities for health insurance through the  Medicaid Program, as well as through private insurance exchanges, which  were moved in the right direction.   We also said something else in that we wanted to build into the  health insurance system of America protections for families. We wanted  to make sure that you could not be discriminated against in buying  health insurance simply because someone in your family had been sick.  Think of how many of us--one out of three, I might add--have  preexisting conditions or of someone in our family who has a  preexisting condition. It happens--a child surviving cancer, a child  with diabetes, somebody in the family who has a heart condition. Those  are the realities of life for families across America.   Before the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the health insurance  companies could say not only no to you but, really, no when it came to  coverage, or they could charge you premiums that were way beyond what  people could afford to pay. We eliminated that in the Affordable Care  Act--eliminated it. You cannot discriminate against an American on the  basis of his having a preexisting medical condition.   The insurance companies went wild in defining what a preexisting  condition was that might raise your premiums or to deny you coverage.  Having had acne in your adolescence was a preexisting condition. The  fact that you were a woman who might give birth to a child was a  preexisting condition. The list went on and on. We eliminated that and  said that you cannot discriminate against Americans because of those  things.   We have people on the other side who have said that we have to get  rid of that protection. If we do, what will happen to all of these  people?   On Saturday, I went to a march in Chicago, in Lincoln Park. It was  the Children's Heart Foundation and the congenital heart defect  alliance. Of course, it speaks for itself. The No. 1 birth defect among  children in America is a heart defect, and 1 out of 100 babies born has  a heart problem. These are kids with preexisting conditions. You should  have seen the families show up in big, big numbers, supporting little  kids--some of them just babies. They were proudly wearing T-shirts,  standing up, and saying that we are going to fight for this little boy  or little girl. They were trying to promote medical research to save  their lives.   It is something that really touched me as I looked at 600 people on  that hot Saturday afternoon, marching in Lincoln Park in Chicago. I  said to them: When it gets down to the basics in life, the most  important thing in your life is your baby. The next most important  thing is your family, whom you have standing behind that baby. Then  there is the doctor--that doctor whom you are counting on to do  everything in his power or her power to make sure your baby  survives. But you need to bring into this conversation another group-- politicians, Senators, and Congressmen--because we are making decisions  right here in Washington that will decide whether the families who  marched in Lincoln Park in Chicago on Saturday and families like them  all across America will have access to affordable health insurance,  real health insurance that will cover them. That is what the debate is  about.    It was just a few weeks ago that the House of Representatives passed  a measure to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to replace it. At the  end of the day, not a single Democrat voted for the measure. It passed  by two votes--two votes--in the House of Representatives.   When they came back and analyzed what the Republicans had voted for  in the House of Representatives when it came to healthcare, here is  what they found: Their proposal to eliminate the Affordable Care Act-- the one that passed the House of Representatives several weeks ago-- according to the Congressional Budget Office--a nonpartisan, expert  group--according to the CBO, 23 million Americans will lose their  health insurance under the plan that passed the House of  Representatives. In my State of Illinois, with 12.5 million people in  our population, 1 million people would lose their health insurance.   I will just tell my colleagues, I don't see how any Member of  Congress can stand before us and say: I have a great solution for  healthcare in America. We are going to take health insurance away from  23 million people. But that is what the vote did. And their vote,  sadly, eliminated the protection against discrimination because of  preexisting conditions.   So what has been the reaction to the House repeal bill that was  passed? I can tell my colleagues that in my State there is not a single  group, not one medical advocacy group, who supports what the House of  Representatives did.   I am from downstate Illinois, outside the city of Chicago. I have a  congressional district down there in smalltown America, great people.  If you went into that part of Illinois and said to them ``I am going to  vote for a measure that is going to put in jeopardy the future of your  local hospital,'' the people would literally rise up to resist it.   The Illinois Hospital Association tells us that the Affordable Care  Act repeal passed by the House of Representatives endangers hospital  services all across our State but especially in small towns and in  rural America. They estimate that we are going to lose 60,000 jobs at  these hospitals in our State. I can tell you what those hospital jobs  are in smalltown America, in rural America. They are the best jobs in  the community. These are medical experts, doctors and nurses and  supervisors and administrators who keep these hospitals operating, and  they are paid well to do it, and they should be. Those are the jobs at  risk of being eliminated by the vote in the House of Representatives.   One million people in our State could lose health insurance, and our  hospitals are threatened with closure.  [[Page S3420]]  That is why the Illinois Hospital Association opposes what the  Republicans did in the House of Representatives, and that is why the  Illinois State Medical Society--our doctors--and the Chicago Medical  Society have come out against what happened in the House of  Representatives. That is why the nurses have opposed what was passed in  the House of Representatives as well. Not a single medical advocacy  group supports what happened in the House of Representatives. Not one  in my State. Can't find one of them.   So now we remember from basic civics that after it passes the House,  it is our turn in the Senate. What are we going to do with healthcare  reform? Well, I wish I could tell you. We are told we are going to vote  on it. Maybe as soon as 2 weeks from now, we will come to the floor and  vote on changing the healthcare system of the United States of America.   What is the proposal of the Republicans in the Senate when it comes  to the future of our healthcare system in America? I don't know, and  the reason I don't know is it is being done in secret. There have been  no committee hearings, no opportunity to offer amendments. In fact, we  haven't even seen the measure we are going to be asked to vote on in 2  weeks.   The Congressional Budget Office, which is supposed to analyze it,  hasn't published any analysis of the Republican plan. Yet they are  moving forward at a breakneck pace to have us vote on it, up or down,  before we leave for the Fourth of July recess. It is a frightening  prospect.   They will do it under what is known as reconciliation. I won't bore  people with Senate procedure, but what it basically means is they can  move it through with a simple majority vote in the U.S. Senate.  Amendments will be considered on what they call a vote-arama basis. And  if it sounds like some kind of a game, it is almost a game. You offer  an amendment and you get perhaps 1 minute to explain your amendment on  changing healthcare in America, and the other side gets 1 minute to  explain their opposition, and off you go to a vote and then another one  and another one. Your head is spinning, trying to figure out what in  the world each of these amendments and each of these votes is going to  mean. Those are the measures to be taken by the Senate when it comes to  healthcare.   This is exactly the opposite of what happened when the Affordable  Care Act was passed. We adopted 160 Republican amendments to the  Affordable Care Act. None of them voted for final passage, but 160  amendments were offered by Republicans to change it, and they were  adopted. It was a bipartisan process on the amendments.   How many amendments will we be able to offer to the Republican Senate  proposal that is going to come before us in 2 weeks? The answer is that  we don't know because we have never seen the Republican proposal. It  has been done in secret. Thirteen Republican Senators were chosen by  the majority leader to sit in private and come up with this bill. There  was no open committee hearing, no open discussion. Some Republicans  were invited in, and some were not. We don't know what the ultimate  product will look like, but I can tell you this: Whatever the  Republican Senators come up with, it is going to have a dramatic impact  on each and every single American, every one of us in our communities  back home.   I know this idea of repealing the Affordable Care Act in 2 weeks is a  solemn political promise that many Republicans made, but they also made  a promise to the people they represent to do what they can to help  these families through their difficult times. That is why we need to  make sure the product that is passed by the Republicans in the Senate  is one that serves the needs of people across the United States of  America.   If this product coming from the Republicans is like the House measure  that takes away health insurance for 23 million Americans, then I can  understand why the Republicans want to do this in secret. I can  understand why they don't want us to see it until the very last minute  and then vote on it and get out of town as fast as they can, because it  is an embarrassment to think that the U.S. Senate and the House, for  that matter, would vote to take away health insurance from 23 million  Americans. That is a dereliction of duty, and from where I am sitting,  it is just flat immoral to take away health insurance from that many  people.   What if we end up with a product like the House of Representatives'  that jeopardizes rural hospitals and hospitals in the inner cities,  that closes down these community healthcare clinics, reduces access.  Well, I will tell you what will happen. People without health insurance  will still show up at the hospital sick, in the emergency room, and  they will still be treated, but they won't be able to pay for it. Who  will pay for their care? We will pay for their care. Everyone else with  health insurance will pay more because people who are uninsured will  receive free medical care. That is the reality. And, of course, if you  don't have a regular doctor or a regular medical home, as they call it  these days, what started off as a minor problem could turn into a major  problem, even life-threatening. That is why the Affordable Care Act  builds into it community healthcare clinics and opportunities to create  a medical home.   When I met with the Chicago Medical Society at a convention they had  in Chicago this last week, I was surprised by a few things. First, I  was surprised to learn that out of the 5,000 physicians in the Chicago  Medical Society, they received responses back from over 1,000 who said  they thought the measure that passed the House of Representatives--the  Republican repeal bill--was the worst news they had heard when it came  to the future of healthcare. They preferred the Affordable Care Act.  But they went on to say something that may surprise people. These  doctors--over 1,000 of them responding to the survey--said they thought  it was time for us to talk about very significant changes to our  healthcare system in America. They are tired of fighting the private  insurance companies. What they suggested is that we look at a plan like  Medicare for all.   Right now, Medicare serves 50 million or 60 million Americans. People  can't wait to turn 65 and finally qualify for Medicare, with no  exclusions for preexisting conditions, and they know that Medicare is  going to give them quality care, and it is not going to bankrupt them  as individuals.   These doctors in the Chicago area have said it is now time for  America to seriously look at Medicare for all, and I agree with them. I  think it is time to look at it because the private health insurance  system, even as we have tried to save it, salvage it, remake it through  the Affordable Care Act, has real shortcomings.   I hope those on the other side who are considering changes in our  healthcare system will actually listen to doctors, listen to hospital  administrators, and listen to the families they represent. Why they are  doing this in secrecy, why they are refusing to give us a chance for  committee hearings and amendments I can't tell you, other than the  obvious: Clearly, what they have come up with is something they don't  believe the American people will accept, so they need to push it  through without disclosure at the last minute and get out of town in  the hopes that people won't blame them.   Well, when it comes to healthcare, people don't forget. I won't  forget, and the people of Illinois won't forget the votes that were  cast in the House of Representatives which threaten to take away health  insurance from 1 million people in my State.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). The Senator from Vermont.
