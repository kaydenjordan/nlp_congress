 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to answer the  question: How can we justify appropriating America's hard-earned  taxpayer dollars to a foreign military that emboldens Hezbollah in  their reign of terror and hate for America?   Hezbollah's influence runs rampant throughout the Lebanese  Government. Even advocates of aid to the Lebanese military concede that  Hezbollah's influence runs rampant throughout the Lebanese Government.   What matters is not the addressee. It is the address--Hezbollah's  house.   Money is fungible, and we are pumping cash and hard currency into a  terror haven infested with terror finance and corruption.   Even those advocating to aid the Lebanese military say that this is  an entity unwilling and unable to counter Hezbollah. Then why are we  wasting our money?   My amendment ensures that none of Americans' taxpayer dollars may be  made available for the Lebanese Armed Forces.   Funding to the Lebanese Armed Forces is a policy that has been in  place since 2006, essentially on autopilot. Since then, the U.S. has  provided more than $3 billion to the Lebanese military, supposedly to  build up state institutions as a counterweight to Hezbollah, but with  little to show in return.   In fact, Lebanon has come more under the sway of Hezbollah and Iran  today than when the U.S. began funding Lebanon's military. Hezbollah's  chief Christian ally, the Free Patriotic Movement, is the political  party literally in control of Lebanon's defense ministry.   This is a policy on autopilot that gets renewed every year without  Congress really having a chance to review this funding and ask whether  this is a good place to spend taxpayer dollars and is in our national  interests.   We are funding an army that just yesterday shot smoke bombs at  Israeli troops, which it called enemy troops. This should not be a  partisan issue.   Anyone who takes a look at this issue objectively, I think, will have  serious questions about why we continue to fund the Lebanese Armed  Forces, one of the most corrupt and bloated armies in the world. Most  of Lebanon's military expenditures go to personnel salaries and  benefits, a whopping 93 percent compared to 29 percent in the United  States. These benefits include healthcare, maternity leave,  compensation in the event of death, as well as domestic workers and  drivers for high-ranking officers.   For example, the Lebanese military, which consists of 80,000  soldiers, has 400 generals that are extremely highly paid, while the  U.S. Army has a force of half a million but just 295 generals.   This did not stop the Biden administration from notifying Congress  last year that it was repurposing $67 million in aid to the Lebanese  military in order to provide them with livelihood support, which just  funds their salaries even more.   Rather than funding armed Mercedes and other luxury goods for  Lebanese generals, we should be funding our southern border.   Lebanon's financial system is soaked in Hezbollah money laundering  and financial crimes, and the terrorist group touches almost every  facet of life in that country.   It is impossible that any administration could vet all the recipients  of these taxpayer dollars and their families because there are no  controls. There is no way to know how these individuals use this money.  Some of it could flow through Hezbollah exchange houses or possibly be  spent in Hezbollah-run businesses.   Mr. Chair, by safeguarding the actions of Hezbollah and other terror  groups, the Lebanese Armed Forces fuels Iran's mission to kill American  troops and wipe Israel off the map. I can't justify funding such  horrific activity.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to recognize the dangers of  funding the  [[Page H4775]]  Lebanese Armed Forces by voting for my amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it was described on the other side as ``a  full-blown crisis in Lebanon.''   Why in the world would we send money to a country that is recognized  by the opposition to be in a full-blown crisis?   Another speaker said that this money goes to pay the salaries of  Lebanese soldiers, and if they don't receive this money, some of these  soldiers won't be able to pay for their gas.   Since when is it the American taxpayer's responsibility to pay the  salaries of Lebanese soldiers and ensure that they can get from one  place to another?   Mr. Chair, I watched the debate on this floor for the last week or  so, and we are giving money to the Palestinians, we are giving money to  Lebanon. We are going to give $500 million to Jordan for their border  wall while we are not securing our border.   The American people are sick and tired of giving foreign governments  money and not putting America first.   We have a $33 trillion deficit and we are more concerned in this body  about giving money to Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Ukraine, you name it.   Mr. Chair, it is time to put America first. The American people have  asked us to do that and that is why they put us in charge of the House.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, as stewards of America's hard-earned  taxpayer dollars we must ensure such funds only go to measures that  advance our American interests, not undermine them.   We have provided billions of dollars to Iraq and lost thousands of  lives in that country. Yet in 2023, we continue to provide a blank  check to Iraq, despite this country going more and more against  American interests and essentially having transformed into a proxy of  Iran.   My amendment ensures that none of Americans' taxpayer dollars may be  used to provide assistance to Iraq.   I served in Iraq, and while protecting American interests in the  region remains critical, Mr. Chairman, we cannot justify sending our  taxpayer dollars to a nation while being unable to safeguard those  dollars from exploitation by Iran, ISIS, and other terror groups.  [[Page H4776]]    Iran's influence over Iraq is so emboldened that Iraq essentially  serves as a proxy state and haven for Iranian terror activity. Iraq has  a literal arrest warrant out for President Trump for killing terrorist  Soleimani.   The Pentagon has disclosed that large portions of Iraq's security  forces are overrun by Iranian-backed militants and IRGC terrorists, the  same ones who continue to target American troops in the Middle East and  the same ones who attacked the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad in 2019--and we  want to send them money.   This money is not countering terrorism. On the contrary, throwing  millions of dollars at a country which uses its resources to put  Iranian-backed terrorists on the payroll, terrorists which have  attacked U.S. forces and the U.S. Embassy is insane.   This does not give us leverage. It is unacceptable to appropriate  American dollars for these purposes with the likelihood that some of  the money could fall into the hands of the terrorists. This bill should  support our diplomats and servicemembers serving overseas, not threaten  them.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to recognize these dangers by  voting for my amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I ask how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Chair, I had the opportunity to serve our country in  Iraq and had the opportunity to work with the Iraqi Army and the Iraqi  police, and it all sounds well and good if we are going to send money  and it is going to go to these Christian organizations, it is going to  go to these different individuals that we want to help; however, that  is not the reality of what is happening based on the things that I  originally said in my opening. You don't have control over that, and  having had the experience of actually serving there and working with  these individuals and the clans that are there and the groups that are  there, the money isn't distributed the way that we want it to be  distributed. You are seeing that in Lebanon, and you are seeing that in  all these foreign entities.   It is very interesting to me to stand up here and listen to my  colleagues who talk about cutting spending and that we have a deficit  and that we have a spending problem in Washington, and they would  rather prioritize moneys to Iraq, to Lebanon, to Palestine, to Ukraine  over the needs that we have in this country.   The people in my district don't understand it. When I talk to people  in my district, they don't get it. They don't understand why we would  prioritize sending our hard-earned tax dollars to countries that are  completely corrupt and hate us with no assurances that it is going in  the places that it is going.   Why would we do that? I just don't understand why we would stand here  in the current economic situation that we have in this country and send  money to foreign governments that hate us and try to kill us.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, the United Nations Educational, Scientific,  and Cultural Organization, also known as UNESCO, is incredibly corrupt  and mismanaged.   This organization has a long history of anti-American bias and anti- Israel bias. They have even honored countries like China that  consistently violate human rights.   My amendment ensures that no taxpayer dollars go towards funding  UNESCO. We must ensure that funds appropriated by this Congress are  used in the interest of the American people.   Why on Earth would we give American taxpayer dollars to organizations  that hate America and favor our adversaries? President Trump was right  to remove our country's membership in UNESCO. It is unconscionable that  the Biden administration has chosen to rejoin UNESCO and, with that,  pay over $600 million in back dues.   Funding UNESCO is the opposite of America first. This Congress should  not provide a single dollar to organizations that seek to disparage  America and their allies.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, we need to put America first. We need to fix  the spending problem that we have here in Washington. We have $33  trillion in debt.   When I was first elected to Congress only 5 years ago, we had $21  trillion in debt; now we have $33 trillion in debt. We are running a $2  trillion deficit every single year to give money to an organization  that is anti-American and anti-Israel. It is not putting America first.  It is not putting the taxpayers' dollars to good use in this country.   Mr. Chair, I ask Members to support my amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.
