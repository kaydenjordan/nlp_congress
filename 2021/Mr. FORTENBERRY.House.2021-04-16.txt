 Madam Speaker, a long time ago, I made the decision  to stand by the people who grow our food, protect our country, and make  our stuff. Now, for a moment, if we could put aside the ever-expanding  definition of infrastructure, I think we could agree on a basic  principle: if we are going to ask American taxpayers to fund new  American infrastructure, then we need to use American companies,  American steel, and American labor.   It is especially important that American-made steel not be outsourced  for fabrication to nations with lax environmental standards and lax  labor  [[Page H1879]]  standards. As this pandemic has so forcefully and painfully shown us,  an overreliance on a foreign supply chain makes us vulnerable.   Madam Speaker, how about this: a ``Made in America'' label on all  products used in American public works across the country. On that,  perhaps, we can agree.                            ____________________
