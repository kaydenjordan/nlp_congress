 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in opposition to this resolution.   My Republican friends continue to be in a state of denial of the  climate crisis, the real and urgent sense that we have now.   Last month, in Houston, I had an opportunity to meet with two dozen  leaders of the renewable energy sector. They weren't concerned about  rolling back the things that we have done. They want to accelerate it.   The chairman and my Republican colleagues have spoken at length about  the importance of increasing accountability for China's unfair trade  practices and maintaining protections for American workers.   It is interesting, though, that these same individuals voted against  Democratic provisions to strengthen our antidumping and circumvention  laws and reauthorize the Trade Adjustment Assistance in the America  COMPETES Act.   They all voted against the Inflation Reduction Act's provision to  incentivize clean energy domestic manufacturing. In fact, 2 days ago,  they voted to repeal these provisions.   This resolution would undermine America's hard-fought wins in the  Inflation Reduction Act.    There are problems. No doubt, the Chinese are likely cheating.  [[Page H2094]]    President Biden struck the right balance by instituting a temporary  freeze on these solar tariffs. This approach is how we fix the long- term problem.   Importantly, he has said that he does not intend to extend the freeze  beyond June 2024 and that he will veto this resolution if it gets to  his desk.   My friends on the other side of the aisle are concerned about working  men and women. I would point out that the President's position is  consistent with the leaders in organized labor from IBEW, from LIUNA,  the Carpenters, and the Operating Engineers, people who represent these  hardworking Americans, as well as organizations in the environmental  community and the National Taxpayers Union.   This is a 2-year bridge that gives the solar industry the time needed  to reorient supply chains away from China and produce panels  domestically. We can't do that overnight, but we are committed to  making that change.   For too long, the United States has lacked a cohesive renewable  energy manufacturing policy. As a result, we have outsourced far too  much of our production.   In 2021, there were only 7 gigawatts of domestic manufacturing  capacity. That is the reality. But the Inflation Reduction Act marks a  significant departure from those flawed policies of the past. This  legislation bakes in domestic content bonuses in clean energy credits  to incentivize the industry to onshore production. But that takes time.  It also revives the advanced manufacturing credit and creates a new  manufacturing production tax credit.   The Inflation Reduction Act has already led to the announcement of  more than 45 gigawatts of domestic solar manufacturing capacity. Again,  my Republican colleagues voted to repeal all of those incentives just 2  days ago.   Ending the President's temporary initiative here would immediately  institute high, retroactive tariffs in the hundreds of percent that  would hurt solar development, increase energy costs, and lead to a  supply reduction at exactly the moment when the climate crisis means  that we need to ramp it up.   Many of us in Congress worked for years to achieve the policy  victories contained in the Inflation Reduction Act.   The clean energy tax credits are projected to reduce carbon emissions  40 percent by 2030, giving us a legitimate chance to meet the goals  contained in the Paris climate agreement. We should resist these  efforts to undermine this hard-won victory for America.   I would encourage my colleagues to take a hard look at the  legislation and then reject it when it comes before us for a vote.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from  the carpenters union and operating engineers union, who oppose  legislation that eliminates thousands of jobs; the International  Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; and LIUNA.      IUOE Contact: Jeff Soth      UBC Contact: Jen McKernan     Carpenters and Operating Engineers Unions Oppose Legislation That                        Eliminates Thousands of Jobs         Washington, DC.--The following statement was issued today       by James T. Callahan, General President of the International       Union of Operating Engineers, and Douglas J. McCarron,       General President of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and       Joiners of America, regarding their unions' opposition to       legislation that will eliminate thousands of American jobs:        Last year, the Department of Commerce opened a       circumvention inquiry, alleging that four Southeast Asian       countries were circumventing tariffs and duties on solar       cells and modules from the People's Republic of China. The       inquiry generated massive uncertainty in the domestic solar       market by suggesting possible retroactive tariffs as high as       250 percent. This threat resulted in a drop of 20 percent       fewer solar construction and installation jobs across the       United States.        President Biden took action to preserve these jobs, issuing       Emergency Proclamation 10414 to prevent tariffs on any solar       module and cell imports from the four countries until June       2024. House Joint Resolution 39 will repeal the President's       Proclamation and eliminate thousands of jobs in the American       solar industry.        ``Repealing President Biden's Proclamation will result in       retroactive duties and tariffs that would jeopardize 30,000       construction and 4,000 manufacturing jobs,'' said James T.       Callahan, General President of the International Union of       Operating Engineers. ``We are not prepared to stand by and       let some partisan dispute eliminate Operating Engineers' jobs       and slow the deployment of clean energy.''        ``The President's Proclamation saves Carpenters' jobs and       smooths the development of the domestic solar manufacturing       industry. Today, we're seeing the American manufacturing       sector respond to incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act       and develop homegrown solar modules,'' said Carpenters Union       General President Douglas J. McCarron. ``Now is not the time       to disrupt the solar industry and layoff thousands of union       workers just as we're getting a foothold in the burgeoning       solar business.''        The International Union of Operating Engineers and United       Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners urge Congress and       members of the Ways and Means Committee to vote against House       Joint Resolution 39, which will repeal the administration's       Proclamation and eliminate thousands of union jobs, slow the       deployment of renewable energy, and generate unnecessary       greenhouse gases.                                   ____                                           International Brotherhood                                           of Electrical Workers,                                     Washington, DC, April 26, 2023.      To: All Members of the United States House of           Representatives.      Re House Joint Resolution 39.         Dear U.S. Representative: On behalf of the 775,000 active       members and retirees of the International Brotherhood of       Electrical Workers (IBEW), I write to share the IBEW's       opposition to H.J. Res. 39, the joint resolution of       disapproval regarding President Biden's two-year suspension       of certain tariffs on solar imports that is expected to soon       come before the committee for consideration.        The IBEW represents tens of thousands of workers who make       their living installing and maintaining solar generation.       This includes large, utility-scale solar developments that       are currently providing significant amounts of emission-free       power to schools, hospitals, and homes in the United States.       The IBEW also represents over 30,000 workers in the       manufacturing sector, making the supply chains that move the       economy. IBEW members have been intimately involved in the       development and deployment of solar power in the United       States since its infancy.        H.J. Res. 39 would nullify Proclamation 10414, a carefully       crafted compromise to give the Department of Commerce       authority to provide a two-year pause, from June 6, 2022, to       June 6, 2024, on potential anti-circumvention duties on solar       panels being imported from Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and       Cambodia. The Biden Administration made this compromise in       order to provide market certainty to allow U.S. companies to       continue deploying solar panels while providing a bridge to       strengthening the domestic U.S. solar polysilicon       photovoltaic supply chain.        For far too long, China has participated in unfair trade       practices and human rights violations that deeply undercut       the U.S. solar manufacturing industry. The U.S. Congress       responded by writing key provisions in the Inflation       Reduction Act, including the 45X Advanced Manufacturing       Production Credit and 48C Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit,       which are providing the necessary market signals to solar       manufacturers to invest in America. These provisions, along       with the two-year bridge created under Proclamation 10414,       are making a real difference today and will create tens of       thousands of union jobs and help spur the kind of domestic       production of PV solar wafers, cells, and panels needed to       lessen America's reliance on supply chains from abroad.        Yet even the most significant investments cannot recreate       an industry overnight. With one year left in the Biden       administration's two-year pause on certain solar tariffs, the       IBEW has already seen the Inflation Reduction Act's benefits,       including more than 45 gigawatts in announced solar       manufacturing capacity since the law's passage. H.J. Res. 39       is a backward-looking resolution looking to reopen a settled       matter rather than create solutions. The IBEW has and will       continue to support congressional action that will lower       energy costs, strengthen the power grid, and create good-      paying union jobs. Moreover, at this time, IBEW does not       support an extension of the two-year pause on imposing anti-      circumvention duties on Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and       Cambodia.        On behalf of the IBEW, I urge you to oppose H.J. Res. 39       when it is considered before the House. Please contact       Government Affairs Department Director Danielle Eckert if you       have any questions.            Sincerely yours,                                                 Kenneth W. Cooper,      International President.                                   ____                                                            LiUNA,                                     Washington, DC, April 19, 2023.      Hon. Jason Smith,      Chairman, U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Member, U.S. House Committee on Ways and Means,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Neal: On behalf of       the 500,000 members of the Laborers' International Union of       North America (LIUNA), I write in opposition to the       Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution regarding solar       panel manufacturing. This resolution will have a harmful  [[Page H2096]]       and disruptive impact on our members' jobs within the solar       industry.        Our nation's energy industry directly employs tens of       thousands of LIUNA members across the country. These jobs       span across all sectors of energy production including,       natural gas, nuclear, hydro, and renewables. By way of the       Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), The Biden Administration has       brought good-paying union construction jobs into the       renewable industry. Because of this, our members have seen a       significant and rapid growth within the renewables sector, in       particular the solar industry. These jobs are finally good       jobs, with family-supporting wages and benefits.        Repealing President Biden's moratorium, however, will bring       several solar construction sites to a halt, leaving our       members without a paycheck. We recognize that the Department       of Commerce's investigation found some solar panel producers       committing trade violations. Of course, in time, this will       need to be addressed.        This CRA resolution comes at a time when our nation is       looking to bolster its wind and solar industry, steering away       from more harmful energy sources. Our union has never seen       this much solar construction work, and future construction       work already on the books, within the renewable energy       industry, and it is now all at risk if the CRA is passed.        I urge you to oppose the Congressional Review Act being       marked up today in committee.        With kind regards, I am,            Sincerely yours,                                                  Terry O'Sullivan,                                                 General President.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues' newfound  concern for the environment and for the industry.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record correspondence from the solar  industry in the United States opposing their resolution and supporting  our position.       Re: Please Oppose Retroactive Duties and Protect American           Clean Energy Jobs and Investment With a ``No'' Vote on           the Auxin CRA (H.J. Res. 39/S.J. Res. 15).         We are writing to respectfully ask that you oppose H.J.       Res. 39/S.J. Res. 15. Enactment of this resolution would       impose over $1 billion in retroactive duty liability,       increase energy costs for consumers, cost thousands of       American jobs, and hamstring efforts to reduce greenhouse gas       emissions.        Last year, a single company filed anti-circumvention       petitions with the Department of Commerce (Commerce). The       threat of duties ranging from 50 percent-250 percent on solar       panels and cells from Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and       Cambodia called for in the petitions abruptly froze solar       supply chains. A significant number of domestic solar       projects experienced cancellations or delays as a result.        To address this disruption, after Commerce accepted the       petitions and initiated a set of investigations, President       Biden issued an emergency declaration that included a       temporary 2-year pause on potential duties arising from the       investigations. This pause allowed planned solar projects to       move forward while the investigations proceeded.        American stakeholders subsequently relied on Commerce's       regulations to make significant business and economic       decisions. Nullifying Commerce's rulemaking as provided for       in H.J. Res. 39/S.J. Res. 15 would penalize companies, acting       in accordance with the law, by imposing large (up to 254       percent), unanticipated retroactive duty liability for these       stakeholders--back to April 1, 2022. Going back on this       federal commitment would create a chilling effect on American       business, setting a terrible precedent that undermines       America's competitiveness in the global marketplace.  [[Page H2097]]         Passing H.J. Res. 39/S.J. Res. 15 would also stall or       cancel planned solar projects, eliminate 30,000 jobs,       including 4,000 manufacturing jobs, and $4.2 billion of       investment in domestic solar projects. 4GW of planned solar       projects representing roughly 14 percent of the industry's       anticipated deployment in 2023 would be cancelled. This in       turn would increase CO2 emissions by 24 million       metric tons.        American businesses need certainty and a bridge to domestic       manufacturing. Right now, only about one-third of U.S. demand       for solar panels (including both crystalline silicon and thin       film photovoltaic panels) can be met with domestic       production, and domestic manufacturers are sold out for the       next 2-3 years. It is our preference to source solar panels       domestically, and we are heartened by the rapid expansion of       domestic solar manufacturing that is currently occurring.       However, ramping up this production capacity across the solar       supply chain will take time, and the temporary 2-year duty       pause provides a necessary bridge to the point where domestic       production capacity is more capable of meeting demand.        For these reasons, and to avoid needless disruption in the       solar marketplace, we respectfully ask that you oppose H.J.       Res. 39/S.J. Res. 15. Thank you in advance for your       consideration.            Sincerely,        Solar Energy Industries Association; American Clean Power;       American Council on Renewable Energy; Edison Electric       Institute; E2; Silicon Valley Leadership Group; Clean Energy       Buyers Association; Advanced Energy United; Coalition for       Community Solar Access.                                   ____                                             Solar Energy Industries                                                     Association,                                     Washington, DC, April 17, 2023.      Hon. Jason Smith,      Chairman, House Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.      Hon. Richard Neal,      Ranking Democratic Member, House Committee on Ways and Means,           Washington, DC.      Re H.J. Res. 39, a resolution disapproving the rule submitted           by the Department of Commerce relating to ``Procedures           Covering Suspension of Liquidation, Duties and Estimated           Duties in Accord With Presidential Proclamation 10414.''         Dear Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Neal: I am writing       to you on behalf of the Solar Energy Industries Association       (SEIA), the national trade association for the U.S. solar       industry. On behalf of the 250,000 American workers employed       by the solar industry, I wanted to share our perspective in       advance of the Ways and Means Committee's consideration of       H.J. Res. 39.        Barring a major departure from the new regime governing       circumvention outlined in Commerce's preliminary       determination on December 8, 2022, SEIA does not plan to       advocate for an extension of the 2-year duty pause beyond its       current expiration on June 6, 2024. However, nullifying the       Department of Commerce (Commerce) rulemaking that provided       the 2-year duty pause would punish businesses who acted in       good faith and complied with existing law with over $1       billion in retroactive duties and undercut the rapidly       accelerating expansion of domestic solar manufacturing       capacity that will onshore the industry's supply chains over       the next few years.                                  Background         On February 8, 2022, a single company filed anti-      circumvention petitions with Commerce that caused havoc in       the U.S. solar industry. The threat of retroactive duties       ranging from 50-250 percent on solar panels and cells from       Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia called for in the       petitions abruptly froze the industry's supply chains.       Industry surveys indicated that 75 percent of domestic solar       projects experienced cancellations or delays as a result.       This significantly contributed to the drop in solar       deployment in 2022 compared to the previous year.        To address this issue and provide time for additional       domestic solar production to come online, President Biden       issued Proclamation 10414 on June 6, 2022, declaring an       emergency and authorization for temporary extensions of time       and duty-free importation of solar cells and modules from       Southeast Asia. The proclamation gave Commerce authority to       issue regulations providing a 2-year pause from June 6, 2022,       through June 6, 2024, on potential duties arising from these       petitions while the investigations proceeded. Commerce posted       the regulations in the Federal Register on September 16,       2022.                            Impact of H.J. Res. 39         H.J. Res. 39 would nullify the Commerce rulemaking that       domestic stakeholders relied upon to make significant       business and economic decisions. Since Commerce regulations       provide that duty liability attaches upon initiation of a       circumvention inquiry, enactment of H.J. Res. 39 would       subject stakeholders to over $1 billion in duties retroactive       to April 1, 2022.        This abrupt and retroactive change in policy would       eliminate 30,000 good-paying U.S. jobs--including 4,000       manufacturing jobs--and $4.2 billion in domestic investment.       4 GW of solar projects would be cancelled, which would in       turn increase CO2 emissions by 42 million metric tons.     Temporary Duty Pause Provides Bridge to Domestic Solar Manufacturing         Domestic solar manufacturing capacity is rapidly expanding.       In 2021, the U.S. had the capacity to manufacture up to 7GW       per year of solar panels, or enough to meet roughly one-third       of total domestic demand. The U.S. solar industry prefers to       source equipment domestically and has put forward an       aggressive yet achievable roadmap to reach 50GW of domestic       solar manufacturing capacity by 2030. As an industry, solar       is diligently working to onshore its supply chains.        A major transition is underway. The Department of Energy       National Renewable Energy Laboratory's tracking of initial       public announcements shows forthcoming panel manufacturing       capacity totaling 42GW--on track to meet the industry's 50 GW       by 2030 goal. However, building out manufacturing facilities       and all the technology necessary to fully supply the solar       industry will take time.        H.J. Res. 39 would unfortunately undermine this progress.       Placing retroactive duties on solar cells, an essential       component of a solar panel for which there is currently no       domestic production, directly undercuts efforts to ramp up       domestic solar panel manufacturing.        The 2-year duty pause from June 6, 2022, through June 6,       2024, is a temporary measure that provides a bridge to the       point that domestic manufacturing is more capable of meeting       domestic demand. This policy is working, and our reliance on       foreign supply chains will lessen as more domestic production       capacity comes online. Barring a major departure from the new       regime governing circumvention outlined in Commerce's       preliminary determination, SEIA does not plan to advocate for       an extension of the 2-year duty pause beyond its current       expiration on June 6, 2024.                                  Conclusion         I appreciate the opportunity to share the U.S. solar       industry's perspective and concerns with H.J. Res. 39. Many       thanks in advance for your consideration, and I would be       happy to visit with you in greater detail about this issue.            Sincerely,                                      Abigail Ross Hopper, Esq.,                                                    President & CEO,                               Solar Energy Industries Association.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson), who played an instrumental role in crafting  many of these energy provisions. I love the partnership with him.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from  the National Taxpayers Union opposing the proposal from our Republican  friends to raise tariffs on solar goods.               [From National Taxpayers Union, Apr. 25, 2023]  NTU Urges All Representatives To Vote ``NO'' on House Joint Resolution         39, Congressional Review Act Legislation on Solar Tariffs         Just weeks after the House of Representatives passed The       Lower Energy Costs Act (H.R. 1), the House will consider a       proposal to increase energy costs by raising tariffs on solar       goods.        A proposed Congressional Review Act resolution, H.J. Res.       39, would nullify a two-year suspension of tariffs on certain       solar panels from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, or Vietnam       that use parts and components manufactured in China.        National Taxpayers Union (NTU) does not believe that       Congress should increase energy costs via the Congressional       Review Act.        The tariffs in question were initially imposed on       Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells from the People's       Republic of China in 2012. In 2022, in response to a request       from Auxin Solar Inc., the Commerce Department determined       that some of these duties were being circumvented through the       inclusion of Chinese parts on goods imported from other       countries.        NTU agrees with the House Ways and Means Committee that       trade policy should protect the interests of American workers       and our economy as a whole. However, the initial imposition       of solar tariffs resulted from a flawed and biased system.       The Commerce Department and U.S. International Trade       Commission (USITC) failed to utilize cost-benefit analysis to       consider the impact of tariffs on the U.S. economy. Solar       taxes were imposed without consideration of their impact on       U.S. jobs, on the energy industry, on manufacturing, or on       American households' energy bills.        A more fundamental question than whether foreign suppliers       are attempting to circumvent solar tariffs is whether       Congress should continue to allow the Commerce Department and       USITC to impose tariffs on solar goods, tin mill products,       fertilizer, and other goods without first considering the       impact of such tariffs on all Americans, not just the       industry seeking protection.        These tariffs would protect Auxin from import competition.       Ironically, according to the federal National Renewable       Energy Laboratory, as of 2019 most of the components and       materials used by Auxin are imported. Earlier this year Auxin       even asked the Office of the U.S. Trade Representatives to       exclude certain Chinese-produced solar goods from Section 301       tariffs, writing: ``Removing tariffs on junction boxes, solar       glass, EVAs, and solar module assembly equipment would free       up further resources to hasten the expansion of the U.S.       solar value chain, ultimately yielding a more secure domestic       solar supply chain.''        At a time when many taxpayers are struggling with high       energy prices--brought on, in part, by flawed government       policies--Congress should not use the Congressional Review       Act to increase taxes on American energy users. NTU urges you       to reject H.J. Res. 39.        Roll call votes on H.J. Res. 39 will be included in NTU's       annual Rating of Congress and a ``NO'' vote will be       considered the pro-taxpayer position.        If you have any questions, please contact Bryan Riley,       Director of NTU's Free Trade Initiative.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Panetta).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Chu).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from  the League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense Council,  Sierra Club, Climate Action Campaign, Environmental Law and Policy  Center, Clean Energy for America, Chesapeake Climate Action Network,  Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, and Union of Concerned  Scientists that urges the rejection of the proposal that our Republican  friends are making.                                                     April 17, 2023.        Dear Member of Congress: The undersigned groups write to       express our opposition to the Congressional Review Act (CRA)       resolutions of disapproval (H.J. Res 39 and S.J. Res 15)       aimed at reversing President Biden's temporary suspension of       tariffs on certain solar cells and panels from manufacturers       in Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam. Passage of these       resolutions could destabilize solar supply chains, harm       ongoing deployment of large scale solar projects, threaten       high-quality solar construction jobs, and impede our nation's       decarbonization goals.        Proclamation 10414, issued by President Biden in June 2022,       gave the U.S. Department of Commerce authority to issue       regulations suspending new solar tariffs until June 2024       while the department proceeded with its investigation into       claims that facilities in the Southeastern Asian countries       were circumventing existing tariffs on Chinese solar       companies. The Commerce Department subsequently issued rules       implementing the delay, and H.J. Res 39 and S.J. Res 15 would       nullify that rulemaking.        Our organizations support both a shift to cleaner and       fairer supply chains for clean energy, as well as the rapid       deployment of clean energy in order to meet the urgency of       the climate crisis. Thanks in part to the expansive       investments in clean energy manufacturing and high quality       job standards included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA),       we are now well positioned to achieve both of these goals.       The administration's strong implementation of the IRA's       domestic content provisions is a critical piece to further       drive manufacturing buildout in the U.S. However, passage of       these CRA resolutions would undermine the ability of the U.S.       solar industry to succeed in accelerating the shift to more       clean energy on the power grid.        The President's decision to pause tariffs for two years is       providing U.S. businesses with much-needed certainty after       several months of project cancellations and delays last year       due to the Commerce Department's investigation, which caused       solar deployment to decline by 30 percent--10 gigawatts below       expectations.        We have already seen more than $13 billion in domestic       solar manufacturing announcements since the passage of the       IRA. While more buildout is needed, this demonstrates that       domestic investment is headed in the right direction.       Additional panel shortages, as we saw during the Commerce       Department investigation, would once again debilitate U.S.       utility-scale solar projects and jobs. And if a CRA       resolution rolls back the President's two-year tariff pause,       then debilitating shortages and lost investment capital could       begin this year.        Beyond the harm to solar deployments across the U.S., there       is the larger issue of the CRA being the wrong tool for       Congressional oversight. Congress has always had the power to       create, modify or eliminate rules using the regular       legislative process. The CRA provides a more extreme path by       repealing a rule in its entirety and preventing an agency       from issuing a new rule that is ``substantially the same,''       an undefined phrase that can essentially freeze the       regulatory process.  [[Page H2101]]         In this instance, while the Commerce Department       investigation of tariff circumvention was being conducted,       the administration sought to provide enough lead time for       domestic solar panel manufacturing and supply chains to       rapidly expand operations to meet demand, bring certainty on       the prices of imported panels to the solar companies       deploying clean energy, and job stability for those workers       installing panels. Passing these resolutions could prevent       future administrations from being able to find appropriate       solutions to other tariffs and trade challenges.        For these reasons, the undersigned organizations urge you       to vote NO on H.J. Res 39 and S.J. Res 15. Thank you for your       attention to this matter and for considering our views.            Sincerely,        League of Conservation Voters, Natural Resources Defense       Council, Sierra Club, Climate Action Campaign, Environmental       Law and Policy Center, Clean Energy for America, Chesapeake       Climate Action Network, Earthjustice, Environmental Defense       Fund, Union of Concerned Scientists.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the concern I have is that what is being missed here is  the reality that we are dependent on the supply chain in which China  plays a key role. We don't like it. My Republican friends don't like  it. Unfortunately, they have undermined efforts that we have to try to  reposition the supply chain.   The energy proposals that we have offered up are an opportunity to  grow and strengthen America's capacity. Just yesterday, they would  repeal a number of those provisions. Their proposal would impose over a  billion dollars of retroactive tariffs on our solar industry at a time  when we are trying to grow it.   We want to give the industry time to reorient the supply chain. That  takes time. It is already made clear on the floor right now that the  current solar industry is at capacity. They need time to change the  supply chains.   Sadly, my Republican friends would reduce incentives to strengthen  the American supply chain. The reality is in the past we have allowed  China to have a dominant position. We don't want that.   We have offered up a variety of proposals that would strengthen and  incentivize American business, but this proposal, if enacted, would  punish American workers, it would punish American business, and it  would set us back on our climate goals. That does not serve anybody  well.   Instead, the Biden administration has offered a reasonable compromise  extending for 2 years the ability to continue the course here while we  reorient the supply chain.   I have a whole host of proposals if my colleagues want to be tough on  China. Mr. Beyer referenced the fact that, through the de minimis  provisions, we are allowing over 2 million packages a day in the United  States' stream of commerce often, no doubt, produced by forced labor,  uninspected, and not paying tariffs.   This is a simple, commonsense provision that we have offered up that  would help change that, and we have others if people want to deal  meaningfully with the Chinese challenge. This doesn't. This doesn't  change the reality of our current dependence on China for the supply  chain, and, indeed, it will complicate our ability to make the  transition.   I respectfully urge that we reject this resolution and allow the  opportunity for our industry to get its footing and make the transition  that we all want them to make.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to share my opinions, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
