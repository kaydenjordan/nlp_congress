 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  remarkable life of Mrs. Jasmine Moran, an admirable Oklahoma Fifth  District philanthropist.   After surviving World War II in England, she uprooted her life to  move to Seminole after meeting her husband, an oil man from Oklahoma.   Inspired by a children's museum in Michigan, Mrs. Moran decided to  start her own in Seminole in hopes of reigniting the city. Eventually,  her idea came to life, and she created a world-class children's museum  that attracts 70,000 visitors a year.   But she didn't stop there. Almost single-handedly, Mrs. Moran created  an animal shelter that adopts out 75 animals a month.   Mrs. Moran's generosity, resilience, and commitment to the betterment  of her community and everyone around her is truly inspiring.   Though she will be deeply missed, there is no doubt that through her  selfless endeavors, her legacy will live on forever. Mrs. Moran's story  and the way she lived her life should stand as an inspiration to all  Oklahomans.                            ____________________
