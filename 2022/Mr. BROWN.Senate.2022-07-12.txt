 Madam President, last week on the Fourth of July, a day  meant to celebrate freedom and independence, we witnessed another act  of senseless violence--this time, in the Chicago suburb of Highland  Park.   Yet again, more Americans have been murdered while going about their  daily lives--this time, attending an Independence Day parade.   Yet again, a community grieves. Yet again, we ask: How many times are  we going to allow this to happen?   The bipartisan gun safety bill was important--long overdue progress,  finally.   Today, we have the opportunity to keep up that work together and take  another important step in protecting Americans from violent gun crimes  by confirming a permanent ATF Director.   I urge my colleagues to support President Biden's nominee, Steve  Dettelbach, from Cleveland, to be Director of the Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.   There is no better person for this role than Steve Dettelbach, a son  of Ohio, a career public servant, with the experience and the record to  combat violent crime and keep Americans safe.   As U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, Steve worked with  law enforcement, including ATF, to prosecute tough cases.   I have known Steve Dettelbach for years. I have watched him tackle  some of the Department of Justice's most sensitive cases--cases at the  intersection of law enforcement and civil rights.   He prosecuted a White supremacist who tried to burn down First Azusa  Apostolic Faith Church, a predominantly Black church in my wife's home  county of Ashtabula, in a community called Conneaut, OH. Steve not only  prosecuted the man responsible, he helped create a clergy group, United  Against Hate.   When he prosecuted the firebombing of the largest mosque in Northwest  Ohio, Steve, a practicing Jew, attended worship services there as a  show of solidarity. He has lived the value of religious freedom. He has  consistently stood up against extremism and hate.   Steve Dettelbach understands that politics must play no role in  running the ATF. His experience, his record bear that out. That is why  he has broad support from across the ideological spectrum, including  prosecutors, including law enforcement officials who understand what it  takes to do this job.  [[Page S3225]]    This includes law enforcement groups like NOBLE, the National  Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives; the Hispanic American  Police Command Officers Association; Women in Federal Law Enforcement;  the International Association of Chiefs of Police; the Major County  Sheriffs' Association; the National Sheriffs' Association.   It includes more than 140 former Federal prosecutors, 8 former ATF  Directors, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the  association representing the men and women of the ATF.   He has the support of civil rights organizations--the National Urban  League, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and faith  organizations like the Jewish Federation of North America.   They understand that Steve is the right person to lead this vital law  enforcement Agency.   Following the horrific shooting in Highland Park, local law  enforcement was able to capture the murderer so quickly because of the  help provided by the heroes--the men and women of the ATF.   Yet there are some out there who not only don't want an ATF Director,  for whatever reason, they may oppose Steve Dettelbach. That is not even  it. They want to abolish the ATF entirely. That is one stupid idea.   You know who thinks that it is a terrible idea? Every single law  enforcement officer who has to combat gun crimes on a daily basis. They  know how important the ATF is, even though some fringe politicians and  just some fringe, conspiracy-minded characters think the ATF should be  abolished.   Abolishing the ATF, these law enforcement officers argue, rightly-- abolishing the ATF would make our communities less safe.   In their letter endorsing Mr. Dettelbach, the National Sheriffs'  Association said that he would work to bring ``people together by  working closely with state and local law enforcement to ensure that  resources are adequately allocated to combat violent crime.''   The sheriffs went on to write they appreciated Steve's ``goal of  being a value-add to local law enforcement by not only adding resources  to urban areas, but rural as well.''   Rural crime and rural terrorism and rural--abuses like that are just  as likely in rural areas as cities.         Mr. Dettelbach has emphasized the importance of ``boots on       the ground'' task forces and pledged to provide forensic help       to local law enforcement at crime scenes.    Sadly, our local law enforcement personnel need this help.  Fortunately, the ATF, with Steve Dettelbach, I hope, confirmed and soon  at the helm, will be there to provide that help.   I can think of no better way to support law enforcement, to reject  hate, to keep Americans safe from violent crime than for the Senate to  confirm Steve Dettelbach ATF Director.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting his confirmation.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  scheduled vote occur immediately.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
