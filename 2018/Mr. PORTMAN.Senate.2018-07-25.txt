 Mr. President, there are a few things I wish to talk  about today, but I would like to start by recognizing the service and  bravery of our Capitol Police officers.   This week is the 20th anniversary of a shooting which occurred in the  U.S. Capitol that claimed the lives of U.S. Capitol Police Officer  Jacob Chestnut and Detective John Gibson when a gunman forced his way  into this Capitol Building. They laid down their lives in defense of  others and made the ultimate sacrifice defending the U.S. Capitol, this  pillar of American democracy.   At the time, then-President Clinton said: ``The shooting at the  United States Capitol yesterday was a moment of savagery at the front  door of American civilization.'' He was right.   I was working in the Capitol that day, 20 years ago. I remember where  I was, as I am sure everybody does who was here. I remember hearing the  gunshots. I was on the telephone from my office in the House of  Representatives with a member of the leadership staff, and I heard the  chaos through the phone lines for the first time.   We are forever grateful for the sacrifice of those two police  officers and their families and for the continued service and  commitment of the U.S. Capitol Police every single day in the Capitol.  They are the ones who protect us every single day. This week, we are  reminded to thank everyone who puts on a uniform and steps into harm's  way to protect fellow Americans.    Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act    Mr. President, I also wish to discuss important legislation the  Senate passed earlier this week and the House passed today to improve  skills training in our country at a time when it is so badly needed.   I am the cofounder and cochair of the Senate Career and Technical  Education Caucus. I have to tell you, I am excited about this  bipartisan legislation. It reauthorizes what is called the Perkins  Career and Technical Education, or CTE, Act. It is a Federal law  designed to help Americans get the education, training, and skills they  need to fill in-demand jobs. The President supports the legislation. I  know he is excited about signing it into law and helping  [[Page S5353]]  those who need the skills to fill those jobs that are out there.   CTE--at one time called vocational education--is just a great  opportunity for the students but also for our economy and for  employers. The bill that passed includes what is called the Educating  Tomorrow's Workforce Act, legislation my colleague Senator Tim Kaine  and I authored a few years ago to allow States and localities to use  Perkins grant funding for a number of purposes.   No. 1, we allow them to use it for CTE-focused academies. We also  encourage schools to incorporate key elements of high-quality CTE  programs from around the country and promote partnerships between local  businesses, regional industries, and other community stakeholders to  create work-based learning opportunities for students, like  apprenticeships and internships. We know they work. Getting that work  experience really helps to be able to land a job, so we are excited  about this legislation.   It also includes important accountability information for our most  vulnerable students to track how well CTE programs are performing so we  can ensure high-quality skills training.   When I travel around Ohio talking to employers of all sizes, they all  stress one thing to me, which is, yes, the economy is doing better, tax  reform has worked well for me, the regulatory relief is happening--that  is great--but we are having trouble finding workers.   In Ohio today, on our website OhioMeansJobs, you will probably see  145,000 jobs being advertised, and yet we have 200,000 people out of  work. A lot of that is the skills gap. I often hear the biggest  challenge employers have is they can't find enough skilled workers for  the positions they already have. We want to give these students the  chance to acquire that training needed for today's jobs. Again, this  legislation helps to ensure it regardless of someone's economic  standing.   It provides a route to good-paying jobs and a successful career for  students who might not have been interested in a typical formal STEM  education or maybe they can't easily spend the time and money involved  in going through a traditional college education.   It is not just about the students. It also helps those who are  further on in life who are trying to rebuild or start a new career.  This bill will also help those incumbent workers. Recently, I visited  Flying HIGH, a welding school in Youngstown, OH. It is a very  impressive program. It focuses on teaching people in recovery and  people who have recently been released from prison to learn a skill--in  this case, welding--which lets them transition back into the workplace.  I am really impressed by it. Their placement rate is about 100 percent.  They have taken people and helped provide them with the skills they  need, and then, in turn, their lives have been turned around. This  legislation will help enable places like this school to be more  successful.   There are so many opportunities out there. Whether it is welding,  whether it is coding, whether it is machining, whether it is healthcare  skills, or whether it is in commercial driving, where we need drivers  right away who have the CDL commercial license, we should encourage  more of that.   I wish to thank my colleague and cochair of the Senate CTE Caucus,  Tim Kaine, as well as Senator Lamar Alexander, who chairs the Senate  HELP Committee that passed the bill this last month, Mike Enzi, and all  my colleagues on the CTE Caucus, for their work on this issue over the  years.   Once signed into law, this legislation will help students get the  career and technical education they need, regardless of economic  standing, and help them have the opportunity they need to be able to  pursue whatever their American dream is                           DATA Act Implementation    Mr. President, the last thing I want to talk about today is some bad  news we received this week. This is about our Federal Government and  the lack of information from Federal agencies as to how they are  spending our hard-earned tax dollars.   As many people know, our Federal Government has grown a lot in the  last half century or so. In 1961, President Kennedy entered office with  7 Cabinet positions and 451 career management positions. When President  Trump took office, we had gone about seven times higher in terms of the  number of people. The number of Cabinet posts have been doubled from 7  to 15.   The increased size of our Federal Government is intended, of course,  to provide a better structure to carry out important duties the  government has and help more Americans, but one result we have to be  cautious of is the increase in Federal spending that comes with it. As  the size of our government grows, transparency in how taxpayer money is  spent becomes increasingly important.   Most of the increase in funding we have seen over the last 20 years,  of course, is in programs that Congress does not appropriate every  year. This includes important entitlement programs like Medicaid,  Medicare, and Social Security. We need to address this unsustainable  growth in the so-called nondiscretionary spending. We need to save  these entitlement programs for the current and future generations of  Americans who rely on them, but we also need to ensure we rein in the  waste, fraud, and abuse in our departments and agencies, the so-called  discretionary spending that Congress spends every year on departments  and programs. That is why this legislation is so important--to be able  to require transparency and accountability with how Federal agencies  spend their taxpayer dollars.   While the White House and Congress tracks spending through the budget  and appropriations process, each Federal agency tracks its own spending  internally. They have their own metrics and measurement systems. As you  can imagine, it has made it hard to truly know where all of the funds  are going to various departments and agencies because each has their  own measurement. We recognized a need to address this.   In 2006, when I was Director of the Office of Management and Budget,  the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act became law. I  personally endorsed that legislation by then-Senator Tom Coburn--who  some will remember was a key sponsor of that--when I was at OMB because  I knew we needed it badly. We went about putting all grants and  contracts online. That was a good thing. The goal of that law was to  standardize the way Federal departments and agencies report their  spending to have a more comprehensive and transparent account of where  taxpayer dollars are going.   It also created a public website to be managed by OMB called  USAspending.gov, where taxpayers and policymakers could go to get  accurate, accessible information about what these funds are used for.  Taxpayers should be able to see where their money goes, and Congress-- which is given the power of the purse in our Federal Government--needs  to know what the funds it allocates are being used for to make informed  decisions about spending.   In 2010, the GAO, Government Accountability Office, looked into how  this program was working. What they found was the usefulness of the  USAspending.gov website was impaired by the lack of guidance to  agencies on how to report their spending. So, in 2014, my colleague  Senator Mark Warner of Virginia and I authored what is called the  Digital Accountability and Transparency Act, the DATA Act. We followed  what the GAO had said, and we wrote this legislation to fix the law.   The goal of the DATA Act was to create a more consistent spending  system across government to improve the efficiency of USAspending.gov  and make tracking Federal spending more transparent and accessible.  That would ultimately provide the American public and policymakers, we  thought, with accurate, consistent, and reliable data on governmentwide  spending to eliminate unnecessary spending.   Being able to follow Federal dollars from appropriation to the  resulting grant or contract that actually occurs is incredibly helpful  in that effort. The DATA Act required Federal agencies to report  spending in real time down to the location by congressional district by  2017.   Now it is time to take stock of how that program is working and to  assess the transparency in our Federal spending. The Senate Permanent  Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, has taken this task on.  Along  [[Page S5354]]  with the ranking member, Senator Tom Carper, we have looked into the  implementation of the DATA Act and how accurately departments and  agencies report spending data. What our bipartisan report found was  troubling.   We reviewed inspectors general, or IG, reports of 25 Federal  agencies, making up more than 80 percent of all Federal spending from  the second quarter of 2017.   At least 55 percent of the spending data--equal to roughly $240  billion those agencies submitted to USAspending.gov--was found to be  incomplete, inaccurate, or both. Notably, the IG's report on the  Department of Defense and the Department of Energy determined that 100  percent of those Departments' spending data was not accurate.   According to the inspectors general, some agencies, such as the  Department of Education and the Agency for National Development, did  well. They reported accurate data.   Unbelievably, about 96 percent of the spending data the Treasury  Department submitted for its own Department was not accurate. So the  Treasury Department, which the DATA Act says is supposed to monitor  other Departments' spending data for accuracy, overwhelmingly submitted  inaccurate data itself--and we found that just last month, OMB and the  Department of Treasury have updated agency guidance that appears to  weaken some of these data standards, which could lead to less accurate  and not standardized DATA Act submissions in the future.   So we should be doing more to ensure this law is properly  implemented, to ensure accountability and accuracy in our finances.   We also found deficiencies with the USAspending.gov website itself.  The DATA Act requires the website to be user-friendly and accurate. Our  investigators found it to sometimes be neither.   It is important to remember that the DATA Act is still in its early  stages. It was fully implemented just a little over 1 year ago. So it  is not yet what we had hoped it would be when it became law in 2014,  but it is not too late to improve it. We know it has to be done. Our  PSI--Permanent Subcommittee Investigation--report includes  recommendations to do just that.   First, OMB and the Treasury Department should continue to update the  standards and guidelines for agencies to follow when making DATA Act  submissions to improve accuracy and accountability of spending. It is  really up to them to do it.   Second, OMB and the Treasury Department should establish clear  definitions for agencies and IGs to follow when conducting reviews of  DATA Act compliance to avoid any existing confusion and disparity,  which we found is out there today.   Finally, the Treasury Department should improve the overall quality  of USAspending.gov.   These are all reasonable steps, and they are going to help increase  accountability within the Federal Government and provide greater  transparency for taxpayers. As I mentioned, taxpayers deserve to be  able to access accurate information on where their money is going, and  lawmakers need to know how departments and agencies are actually  spending their resources to be able to conduct proper oversight, plan  future budgets, and eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in our Federal  spending.   On the floor today, we were discussing appropriations bills. We will  pass another floor appropriations bill this week, I hope. That is good,  but part of this process is that we have to be sure we are doing the  oversight so that if we are passing spending bills--all 12 should be  passed by this Congress--we know where the money is going so we can  identify ways to improve the spending.    I recognize that a lot of hard work has gone into USAspending.gov to  date, and I am grateful for all the support and investments that many  outside groups--like the Data Coalition and the Project on Government  Oversight--have put into making this project successful. I also  appreciate those in the Federal Government who have taken this  seriously and have worked hard on this.   Although the executive branch has only implemented the law  selectively so far, it has already made our government more  transparent. If we continue to do the necessary followup to this  important law that passed 4 years ago, I am optimistic that it will  spur action to make our government spending more accountable, more  accurate, and more accessible. That is the goal.   Mr. President, I yield back my time.
