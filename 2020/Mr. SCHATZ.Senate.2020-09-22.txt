 Mr. President, we know that on Saturday the President is  likely to announce his nominee for the Supreme Court, and we don't know  who that is going to be, but we do know a couple of things. We know,  according to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, that they already  have the votes.   What an extraordinary thing to already know how you are going to vote  on a nominee who has not yet been nominated. What an extraordinary  thing to turn ``advise and consent'' into ``agreeing in advance.'' What  an extraordinary thing.   There is another thing that we know about this nominee. No matter who  it is, we know that this person is going to come from a list provided  by the Federalist Society, an organization that has worked for decades  to remake the Federal judiciary in its image. It has a long history of  advancing a certain agenda of seeking to roll back progress on civil  rights, diminish environmental protections, and eliminate a woman's  right to choose. It is an organization that believes in the power of  executive authority and advances a particular, unique, novel theory  called the unitary executive, which is something that Alan Dershowitz  proffered on the Senate floor during the impeachment trial.   It essentially says that the executive branch is the President and  that extensions of the President's authority can only go so far because  the President is a whole branch of government unto himself or herself.  The Federalist Society also fights for the corporations and the rich  individual donors who quietly fund their work.   As Amanda Hollis-Brusky says, who studies this organization from a  nonpartisan academic perspective as a professor at Pomona College:  ``The idea of the Federalist Society was to train, credential, and  socialize a generation of alternative elites.''   That is how we know that any nominee they put forth will have views  so far out of the mainstream and far to the right of even the existing  Supreme Court. So it is not a rhetorical flourish, and it is not a  partisan statement to say that Trump's nominee will not be committed to  ensuring our most basic and fundamental rights: the right to privacy,  reproductive rights, the right to vote, the right to marry who you  love, and even equal justice under the law.   Perhaps what is most worrisome is that the President has made clear  that whomever he nominates to the Supreme Court will be in favor of  striking down the Affordable Care Act. With the Court's hearing yet  another challenge to the ACA on November 10, it is not an exaggeration  to say that the law will likely be gutted. It is a real risk.   Let's be clear about what this means. The whole architecture of our  healthcare system could be destroyed during the worst public health  crisis in a century. This will, of course, disproportionately impact  our most vulnerable communities--communities of color, low-income,  indigenous, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian communities. We are  talking about repealing Medicaid expansion--the policy that allows  people under the age of 26 to stay on their parents' health insurance-- and, most importantly, protections for preexisting conditions.   Let's be clear about this, too: If you have gotten COVID, you now  have a preexisting condition. So, if you have gotten COVID because of  President Trump's inaction and then if his nominee is confirmed to the  Supreme Court, your insurance company will be permitted to kick you off  of your healthcare plan or at least to increase your rate so high that  you will not be able to afford coverage.   Ripping away healthcare from at least 20 million Americans and  denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions is a crazy and  horrific thing to do in normal times, but it is particularly cruel  during a pandemic that has already claimed the lives of more than  200,000 Americans, especially because, despite the recent promises and  despite the endless promises from both the President and members of the  Republican Party, they have no alternative healthcare plan. We cannot  and must not impose this catastrophe on the American people.   In moments when our country feels torn apart, the traditional role of  the Senate is supposed to be to calm tensions and solve our problems,  but instead of dealing with the tough issues, the majority leader and  the Republican Party are going to inflict procedural violence on the  legislative branch with many Republicans pre-announcing their support  for the nominee without even knowing who she or he may be.   ``President Trump will nominate a well-qualified justice and we will  uphold our Constitution and protect our freedoms''--the Senator from  Montana.   ``I will support President Trump in any effort to move forward  regarding the recent vacancy''--the chairman of the Committee on the  Judiciary.   ``It is critical that the Senate takes up and confirms that successor  before election day''--the junior Senator from Texas.   What makes this coordinated effort to stack the Supreme Court even  worse is that we heard the majority leader say specifically that he  felt no sense of urgency to move on COVID relief. He felt no sense of  urgency to move on COVID relief. I believe this was in May. I think it  was in May when the House passed the Heroes Act. The House passes a  bill, and the Republicans say it is too much. The majority leader  decides: Do you know what? We are the cooling saucer. We are the upper  Chamber. We are just going to chill out here during this pandemic and  see how things play out economically and in terms of public health.   Well, things have played out pretty badly economically and in terms  of public health; yet there has been no sense of urgency, no deal, no  negotiation. Forget a deal for a second. There has not even been a  serious attempt to negotiate between the parties or between the  branches of government--nothing.   Yet, when a Supreme Court vacancy happens--when Justice Ginsburg  tragically passes--there is a tremendous sense of clarity, a tremendous  sense of alacrity, a determination to fill that seat so that, on  November 10, they can take your healthcare away. That is the sense of  urgency that the majority leader feels in the middle of a pandemic, and  it is a shame.   I yield the floor   (At the request of Mr. McConnell, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
