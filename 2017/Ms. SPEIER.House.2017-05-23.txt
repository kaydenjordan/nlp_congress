 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Four years ago, I stood on the House floor and condemned the online  bullying of U.S. Marine Corps servicewomen on Facebook. These web pages  contained obscene and abusive pictures, and implied that women only  advanced professionally by performing sexual favors.   I sent a letter to the Secretary of Defense and the Commandant of the  Marine Corps asking them to take action. I got a letter back from the  Commandant which said, ``I share your indignation.'' I didn't want him  to share my indignation. I wanted him to do something about it. Neither  he nor the Department of Defense inspector general did anything.   Lack of consequences caused this cultural rot to spread further. The  Marines United page, through which hundreds of Active-Duty and veteran  marines viewed thousands of nonconsensually distributed intimate  imagines, damaged the lives and the careers of more servicemembers than  I can imagine. In fact, many of these servicemembers were identified by  name and the bases at which they served.   Despite reports of this vile site, new versions continue to crop up  and spread more destruction, unchecked by military leadership. Until  now, the leadership failures that allowed this to go on for 4 years  also extended to Congress. We did nothing except hold a subcommittee  hearing on--wait, let me indicate what it was on--social media policy,  without a single survivor brought to testify.   This is not about social media policy. This is about abhorrent  behavior by servicemembers against other servicemembers.   Two months ago, a bipartisan group of Members held a hearing on this  very issue, and we had victims who testified. One of those members, who  was Active Duty, said that her Marine Corps drill instructor said to  her and the other women during their training, ``The only women that  serve in the marines are sluts, lesbians . . . '' or a word that starts  with a B that I won't mention on the House floor.    How destructive can that be?   Today, that ends. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle are taking  a stand. Today, I am honored and proud to support H.R. 2052 with my  colleague, Ms. McSally.   This bill will ensure that nonconsensual pornography is made illegal  by explicitly forbidding the sharing of intimate images without the  consent of the subject.   Right now, the reprehensible acts of nonconsensually distributed and  consensually obtained photographs is not clearly defined as illegal  under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. That is why this bill is a  critical step in ensuring that our female servicemembers aren't  distracted from protecting the country by having to also protect  themselves against online abusers and colleagues within the services.   But let me be clear. Our work is not done. If the chain of command  continues to see nonconsensual pornography as a ``boys will be boys''  joke instead of sexual violence, nothing will change. Such conduct must  result in severe and immediate consequences for the perpetrators. The  PRIVATE Act must pass, and it must be enforced.   I also want to note that the passage of the PRIVATE Act does not  apply to the civilian people in our country. Although 34 States have  passed laws to address nonconsensual pornography, their approaches vary  widely, and some are very flawed. That is why a Federal law is needed  to provide a single, clear articulation of the elements of this crime  to ensure that Americans in every part of the country--civilian and  military--are protected if they are subjected to this heinous abuse.  [[Page H4479]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2052. We have come  a long way in 4 years since I found those vile Facebook pages. Four  years from now, I hope I am standing here commending us all for  stamping out the scourge of nonconsensual pornography.

Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative  McSally and Representative Jackie Speier for bringing us to the floor  today.   I speak on behalf of H.R. 2052, the PRIVATE Act. I was deeply  disturbed by the Marine United photo-sharing scandal, as were many of  my colleagues, both men and women, Republican and Democrat.   Our Armed Forces are the greatest fighting forces the world has ever  seen. It is unacceptable that members of the Marines sought out  intimate photographs of their fellow soldiers and distributed them  purposely online. Not only were the actions by the participants in the  Marines United scandal morally repugnant, but they jeopardized our  national security and endangered the security of both male and female  marines. Women in the Armed Forces put their lives on the line every  single day to defend our country, and they should not have their safety  risked by their fellow marines.    I am proud to support H.R. 2052, the PRIVATE Act, which will update  the Uniform Code of Military Justice to ensure that the type of  explicit image sharing we saw in the Marines United scandal is  expressly prohibited.   As the cofounder, with my colleague, Jackie Speier, of the Bipartisan  Task Force to End Sexual Violence, I understand the persistent  challenges that the culture of sexual violence poses on our society.   The conversation around sexual violence is beginning to change,  thanks in no small part to Members of this Congress on both sides of  the aisle. This legislation will support broader cultural reform and  improve the lives of our brave servicemembers.   This is an issue that transcends politics, and I am encouraged by the  bipartisan support for the PRIVATE Act. I urge my colleagues to support  the bill.   Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from  California (Mrs. Davis), the ranking member on the Democratic side of  the Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and, in so doing, I  also want to make the point that our commitment to making sure that our  armed services have the cohesion and readiness to serve requires us to  take action on this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   As a 26-year combat veteran, I am deeply disturbed, but not surprised  by the scandal.   As a former commander, I know that you need to give commanders all  the tools they need to hold perpetrators accountable. This is not just  about good order and discipline. This is about the military mission.  This bill gives commanders an additional tool in order to address this  culture and to hold people accountable for their abhorrent behavior.   I want to say that I appreciate the strong support across the aisle  and our side of the aisle. This is strong, bipartisan support. I would  urge all of my colleagues to support the PRIVATE Act.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentlewoman yield?   Ms. McSALLY. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. I want to add my support for this legislation, and I  thank the gentlewoman from California and the gentlewoman from Arizona  for their longstanding service.   We have been dealing with bills dealing with sexual assault in the  Judiciary Committee. Having listened to the young female soldiers who  were impacted by Marines United, I know that this legislation that  gives the military leadership additional tools to ensure that the  depiction of women and others in the United States military, against  their will, on social media, will not be tolerated and will not be  viewed as an honorable act under the U.S. Military Code. Giving these  tools will show that you will be punished and that men and women will  be respected in the United States military. I ask colleagues to support  this legislation.   Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Thornberry for his  leadership on this issue.   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 2052.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________
