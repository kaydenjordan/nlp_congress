 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday next, when it shall  convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative  business.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at 12 p.m. for  morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business with votes  postponed until 6:30 p.m.   On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning- hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative business.   On Thursday, Mr. Speaker, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for  legislative business, with last votes of the week expected no later  than 3 p.m.  [[Page H1520]]    We will consider several bills under suspension of the rules. The  complete list of suspension bills will be announced by the close of  business tomorrow.   The House will consider H.R. 2214, the NO BAN Act. This bill would  repeal the President's Muslim travel ban and prevent the administration  from putting in place other discriminatory travel bans.   In addition, the House will consider H.R. 5581, Access to Counsel  Act. This legislation would make certain that those held or detained  while attempting to enter the United States are guaranteed access to  legal counsel. That legal counsel, Mr. Speaker, would not be paid for  by the government.   The current FISA authorization expires March 15, requiring action in  this House. Conversations are ongoing, and I hope to bring legislation  to the floor next week.   Lastly, following Senate passage of Senator Kaine's bipartisan War  Powers resolution, it is possible that the House could also consider  the resolution as early as next week.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I will give a relatively short answer. First of all, there is nobody  in this House on either side of the aisle--certainly none of the  proponents of this legislation--who want to in any way limit the  President's ability to protect America, whether it is from terrorists,  whether it is from the coronavirus or some other threat that manifestly  presents itself to the safety and well-being of the American people.                                time  1145    What the bill attempts to do is simply to preclude violating, in  effect, the Constitution of the United States in either making a  religious test for admission to the United States of America, which,  very frankly, a number of statements of the President would indicate  that, in the past, that was what he intended to do and, in fact, was  manifest in the very broad reach, unrelated to whether somebody was a  terrorist but related to what their religion was or some other  distinction unrelated.   Now, obviously, both the health and safety of the American people  would not preclude the President from acting to protect that. I think  we would all agree on that. But, clearly, we believe the President has,  in fact, gone far beyond specific ways and means to protect the  American people and simply preclude people, as I said, of a particular  religion, a particular nationality, or some other broad base unrelated  to the specific items to which you referred, with which I think most of  us agree.   Of course, we will debate that next week.    Mr. Speaker, I want to assure the gentleman that it is our  view that nothing in this legislation will preclude the President of  the United States from acting, either on the basis of national security  or the security of our people, either from threats of terrorism or from  health, or  [[Page H1521]]  for some other identifiable threat to the American people.   This simply says that he cannot act based upon the generalization  that somebody is a Muslim, somebody is from this country, somebody is  from a different nationality or different religion, or some other  arbitrary distinction. He has to focus on specific reasons.   In China's case, for instance, we know that China has a very large  outbreak of coronavirus and that it poses a proximate threat to the  health not only of the American people but of people around the world  and that we need to take steps to ensure that that is contained.   So, we will debate that next week, but we certainly don't accept the  premise that the gentleman has just stated, that somehow we will limit  the President from protecting the American people for legitimate and  necessary reasons.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be able to tell the gentleman  that, this morning or late last night, we sent a response to your  offer, and the committees now have that in their possession. I see they  are shaking their heads that they may not think that we did it, but we  did. We have already sent a response to your offer, with reference to  the reforms.   As the gentleman knows, we have agreed on a number of items as,  frankly, the person that dealt with the person who had your job  previously, Roy Blunt and I, with Senator Bond, also from Missouri, as  is now-Senator Blunt but then-Minority Whip Blunt, and Jay Rockefeller  from West Virginia. We worked on the reauthorization of FISA in 2008,  and we received broad bipartisan support. I am hopeful that we can do  that.   This bill, as the gentleman knows, the authorization for section 215  expires on March 15. The Attorney General, as the gentleman knows,  recommended that we pass a clean reauthorization.   Obviously, both sides felt that there were some things they wanted to  deal with, and we are doing that now. Hopefully, we can get this done.    Mr. Speaker, I will assure the gentleman that, once we have  agreement, I will bring that bill to the floor.    Mr. Speaker, somewhat like the recitation of the Mueller  report that has been quoted--the Mueller report, of course, found  substantial reason to believe that there was wrongdoing. It was  projected by the Attorney General and others that the Mueller report  was a conclusion that the President or others had not done something  wrong. That was not the fact.   In any event, with respect to the gentleman's comments, with respect  to what was done by the FBI, it should not have been done, obviously.   But the gentleman didn't read this very important sentence from the  inspector general's report regarding the court's decision: ``We did not  find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or  improper motivation influenced his decision,'' meaning the court's  decision, the judge's decision.    The bill that we are talking about is reauthorizing section 215. None  of this deals with section 215. It deals with metadata on which the  parties have an  [[Page H1522]]  agreement. It also deals with business records and issues of lone  wolves, who are not necessarily associated with a terrorist  organization but present a danger to the United States.   There are reforms that we can pursue to ensure that the FISA court  gets all the information that it needs and, in fact, has a  representative who makes sure that they get that and who is not  associated with, necessarily, the law enforcement officers or  intelligence officers who are presenting information to the FISA court.   Unfortunately, and I want to say candidly, Mr. Speaker, the  President's focus on the Page case and distracting from the issues that  we are dealing with--Attorney General Barr recommended that we  reauthorize the FISA section 215 as is. That is what the Attorney  General recommended. I don't know what his present position is because  he was criticized by the President in a tweet, so heaven knows what he  did in response to the tweet.   But the fact of the matter is, the issues which the gentleman raises,  we all want appropriate, honest disclosure from individuals who present  to the FISA court. That is not an issue, and we ought to pursue reforms  that lead to that end. But in this case, the focus on an issue  unrelated to section 215, which we are really talking about, is slowing  up this process. And I would hope that in the coming days, because the  15th is upon us, we come to an agreement.   As I said, we sent an offer back, Mr. Whip. Hopefully, we will hear  back from you and, hopefully, reach agreement in the near term because  this is an important thing to pass, to reauthorize for the security of  our people.   The gentleman was talking about security before. We need to make sure  that we act in a bipartisan way to ensure that the FISA process is  working and working properly.                                time  1200     Mr. Speaker, I don't have anything further to say.
