 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for yielding.   H.J. Res. 17 is not a resolution to revive the equal rights  amendment; it is  [[Page H1420]]  a messaging vehicle. That is why Democrats bypassed the Committee on  the Judiciary and brought this resolution directly to the floor, a  common theme for this majority. There was no process for this  resolution, a resolution that Democrats claim is a priority. We are  here today for a headline so the Democrats can say they supported the  ERA when it was in the House.   But the fact is, Madam Speaker, that men and women in the United  States are already equal under law. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments  to the Constitution require as much, guaranteeing equal protection for  all under the laws of this country. To me, the ERA is unnecessary,  redundant, and divisive. The only thing it will do is empower the far- left special interest groups and lead to activist litigation.   Just last year, the head of Planned Parenthood declared: ``There is  no equal rights for women without access to abortion, plain and  simple.''   Or according to NARAL Pro-Choice America: ``With its ratification,  the ERA would reinforce the constitutional right to abortion.''   Madam Speaker, we should take them at their word.   For years, groups like Planned Parenthood and others have advocated  for adoption of the ERA so they can use it to pursue their pro-abortion  agendas. If the ERA became law, it would allow these organizations to  advance the radical policies through the courts without being in full  view of the American people. These groups have hijacked the ERA and are  seeking to use it as a tool to challenge States' pro-life laws.    But the reality is that this resolution is unconstitutional. Article  V of the Constitution empowers Congress to propose amendments to the  Constitution by a two-thirds vote of both the House and the Senate.  After Congress proposes an amendment, the amendment is sent to the  States for ratification. Three-fourths of the States must ratify the  amendment in order for it to become effective.   The equal rights amendment was proposed in 1972. The amendment set an  explicit deadline. It gave the States 7 years, until 1979, for  ratification. Setting a deadline for ratification is part of Congress'  authority to determine the mode of ratification under Article V.   In 1920, the Supreme Court held in Dillon v. Gloss that there was no  doubt that Congress can set a date for ratifying an amendment. The  deadline to ratify the ERA has long since passed, and the amendment  fell short of the required number of States. When proposing a  constitutional amendment, the deadline for ratification is just as  important as the substance.   The District Court for D.C., less than 2 weeks ago, denied an effort  by Virginia, Nevada, and Illinois to force the adoption of the ERA,  despite the 1979 deadline. In denying the effort of those States, the  courts said that a deadline for ratification still receives the assent  of two-thirds of both Houses of Congress, and putting it in the  resolving clause does not evade Article V's procedural requirements in  any way.   Because setting a deadline takes a two-thirds vote of Congress, it  would be absurd to say that changing that deadline requires anything  less. If a simple majority of Congress could alter a proposed amendment  after it has been sent to the States, the two-thirds requirement of  Article V would be meaningless.   A partisan majority cannot rewrite a proposed amendment at will after  there has been an agreement in Congress. However, that is just what  H.J. Res. 17 and the Democrats propose to do.   The ERA expired in 1979, and this joint resolution is a legal fiction  advanced for political purposes.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose this resolution.                                time  1030     Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).

Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I oppose H.J. Res. 17. I believe that the speakers we  have had here today on our side have agreed with that and made very,  very effective points on why to oppose this resolution.   Men and women are already equal under the Constitution. This  legislation would make us no more equal. It is merely a vehicle for the  far-left's special interest groups to use to enact their pro-abortion  agenda. It is unconstitutional. It is unnecessary. And it should not  become law.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The Violence Against Women Act was first signed into law almost 30  years ago with wide bipartisan support. The law recognizes that Federal  laws covering domestic violence could help ease overburdened State and  local criminal justice systems. It was narrowly defined and not  controversial. Since its passage, it has been reauthorized on a  bipartisan basis.   Unfortunately, in recent years, Democrats have politicized the law,  straying further and further away from its original intent. This bill,  H.R. 1620, is a continuation of the Democrats' politicization,  expanding and altering the fundamental nature of the Violence Against  Women Act.   The most significant change in this reauthorization effort is that it  erases important distinctions between women and men. It replaces  violence against ``women'' with ``a person of any gender,'' extending  the law's protections well-past the narrowly defined and necessary  protection for women.   This rewriting of the Violence Against Women Act not only undermines  the original intent of this legislation, but also jeopardizes the  safety and well-being of women at risk. It does more to advance the  Democrats' progressive agenda than it does to protect women.   It is not just VAWA. The Democrats' entire radical agenda hurts  women. Calls to defund, dismantle, and rethink local law enforcement  hurt at-risk women. Never-ending government lockdowns that require  battered and abused women to stay in violent households hurt women. A  southern border open to dangerous drug cartels and human traffickers  caused by President Biden's border crisis hurts women. In fact, the  Democrats' open border policies incentivize women to make the dangerous  trip to the U.S.-Mexico border on which one-third of women report being  sexually abused.   Those are not the only problems with this legislation. H.R. 1620 also  threatens Americans' constitutional right to religious freedom. The  bill denies faith-based exemptions for VAWA grant recipients,  prohibiting religious organizations from running shelters and legal aid  centers on the basis of their sincerely held religious beliefs. The  Democrats' culture war could actually force faith-based centers for  abused women to close.   H.R. 1620 also expands the definition of domestic violence to include  economic and emotional duress, pulling funding away from combating the  severity of violent crimes.   This legislation disregards the well-being of women by promoting  lofty concepts, such as restorative justice approaches to crimes  against women, which are unproven and could force a woman to confront  her abuser.   Democrats know that these are unnecessary additions that jeopardize  the bipartisan reauthorization, so why are they choosing to proceed?  Why are they putting forward this bill--with no hearings, no markups in  this Congress--at the expense of women's safety and well-being?   Any crime or abuse against any single individual is abhorrent. State  and Federal laws already protect individuals, women and men, from  domestic violence and sexual abuse and any related reprehensible acts  like dating violence and stalking. Resources should  [[Page H1458]]  be targeted to help those women and individuals cope and recover and  also prevent further violence and abuse. This bill falls short of that  goal and wildly distorts the original purpose of this law.   Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to oppose this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Good).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Arizona (Mrs. Lesko).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I reiterate my opposition to H.R. 1620, the Violence  Against Women Reauthorization Act.   Democrats filled this legislation with politically charged, highly  controversial provisions that dramatically expanded its scope, and  erased the bipartisanship that originally passed this bill.   Many of those points were pointed out by the speakers on the  Republican side, and unfortunately, it does nothing to address the  problem of domestic violence, it threatens religious freedom and  undermines the legislation's original intent.  [[Page H1463]]    Resources should be targeted to help women affected by the horrors of  domestic abuse and help prevent further abuse. This bill does neither.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Burgess).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Georgia (Mrs. Greene).
