 Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1529, I call up  the bill (H.R. 9640) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to  provide for examination and disclosure with respect to Presidential  income tax returns, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill that is under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, let me quickly lend my voice to having witnessed a  superb legislator, Mr. Hoyer, over a long career, and that is exactly  what the gentleman was and is: a superb legislator.   Madam Speaker, we are here this morning to affirm that, in America,  we are a Nation of equal citizens. No person is above the law.   By doing that, we honor the acknowledgment of congressional oversight  and responsibility. Congress has a responsibility that dates to Magna  Carta, and I am prepared to go back to the Battle of Hastings, if  necessary, in 1066 to make the argument that I have just offered.   The Ways and Means Committee is entrusted with the oversight of our  revenue system. The Ways and Means Committee and staff members all  honor that very profound tradition.   At the root of it all this morning is our Federal tax system that  funds the democracy that we all love and cherish. We rely on voluntary  tax compliance from all Americans and perhaps especially the President,  who always should model the highest order of compliance.   On December 13, 49 years ago this month, President Richard Nixon  asked the Ways and Means Committee chairman through a letter to have  the Joint Committee on Taxation review his tax returns.   Let me say something about the Joint Committee on Taxation. Both  political parties hold the JCT in the highest personal and professional  esteem.   This examination established the precedent for congressional  oversight of Presidential tax compliance.                                time  0945    Four years ago, our committee began reviewing the mandatory audit of  Presidential tax returns to see how the IRS was handling the stress of  a President with complex finances.   The committee expected to find that mandatory examinations were  conducted promptly and that more staff had been dedicated to the  program to meet the more rigorous demands. I would remind all that this  morning's New York Times--that I read online last evening--highlights  the fact that Barack Obama and Joe Biden both had their tax forms  reviewed.   Instead, after years of stonewalling and litigation that ended at the  Supreme Court, four Federal court decisions from three courts, our  committee found that for all practical purposes the mandatory audit  program was dormant. It wasn't just functioning poorly; it wasn't  functioning at all. In fact, the IRS did not start its mandatory audits  until receiving a letter that I sent requesting a President's tax  forms.   The IRS has failed to administer its own mandatory audit program  policies, so the best available recourse is for Congress to fill this  void with legislation that eliminates the IRS's discretion in the  matter. That is precisely what we are asking of this institution this  morning. I can't imagine that anybody, given the controversy of recent  days, would be opposed to legislation.   We would require the IRS to publish the President's tax returns,  audit them in a timely manner, and keep the American public updated on  the results because the President is not an ordinary taxpayer.   A reminder, our legislation is about the Presidency, not about a  President.   No other American holds this power, or influence, as the leader of  our executive branch.   We arrived at this legislation through a deliberate and cautious  process, as always. These improved guardrails will provide Americans  the assurance they deserve that our tax code applies evenly and fairly  to all of us, no matter how powerful.   The Ways and Means Committee oversight staff pursued the facts about  mandatory examination procedures with professionalism and diligence.  They did a great job. I emphasize that there were no leaks by the  committee leading up to this decision to release our report on the  mandatory examination process. Imagine that, in Washington for  something this complex, no leaks.   We adhered carefully and scrupulously to the law and resisted  entreaties from the fringe of both political parties as we proceeded  with great patience and deliberation. No leaks as to how we were to  move forward.   This bill, combined with investments in the IRS that we made as part  of the Inflation Reduction Act, will preserve the integrity of the  Presidency and our system of tax and ensure that no one in the country  is above the law.   Today's legislation, I repeat, is not about a President, it is about  the Presidency.   It is not about being punitive or malicious. And for those on the  other side and those who are witnesses here today, they have worked  with me for a long time, and they know what I just said is entirely  accurate.   The bill we consider today, once again, is about the integrity of the  Presidency and the integrity of our tax system.   Madam Speaker, finally, I include in the Record a technical  explanation of the bill prepared by the staff on the Joint Committee on  Taxation, which can be found at https://www.jct.gov/publications/2022/ jcx-20-22/   Madam Speaker, I urge our colleagues to pass this  legislation, and for the moment, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I still intend to say kind things about the  ranking member despite peeling the bark off my legislation.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Kildee), a leader on this issue of tax compliance.    Madam Speaker, a reminder, 9 out of the last 10 Presidents  of the United States have publicly offered their tax forms.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Danny K. Davis), one of the leaders on this issue.    Madam Speaker, we were not granted this information until  the Supreme Court ruled on November 23, and we did not pursue this  legislation at the last minute. We went through the regular order here,  indeed, with the gentlewoman from California, who did a great job on  this. She represented the committee at the Rules Committee session  yesterday.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Chu).    Madam Speaker, I did indicate, I think, perhaps earlier-- maybe the gentleman was not here--that Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden both  have had their tax forms audited. The majority staff has offered the  minority staff, who I have great regard for, the opportunity to  participate in the redaction process. They chose not to.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Evans), another leader on the issue of tax compliance.    Madam Speaker, the former Commissioner of the IRS has  indicated in the last 24 hours that he had no idea as to how the actual  audit of a President's forms played out. That is not from me; that is  from the public record.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Panetta) who has had a profound interest in this issue.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Nevada (Mr. Horsford), who has been a leader on this issue and gave one  of the most moving addresses as the caucus ensued.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Green), who has energetically spoken about this issue in the past  and will, I am sure, in the future.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), who has been outspoken on this issue, as well.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Before I finish my time here, I do thank Kevin Brady. We had an  excellent relationship at the committee. I can speak for all the  Democrats on the committee that they had high regard for Kevin Brady  when he was in the majority and when he was in the minority for the way  he allowed the minority, us at the time, to use the time that was  allocated to us. I never thought during that time that Mr. Brady did  anything that was mean or malicious.   In addition, I think what is important to point out here, as he did  in his comments, is that we did big things during that time. When you  stop and consider the CARES Act, when you consider what we did in the  health space, retirement and savings, what we were able to do with  USMCA, all of that was done in a bipartisan manner. I think part of it  is a reflection of his personality, which fundamentally lacks malice.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   The constant theme that we have heard today from our Republican  colleagues is that this is about targeting an individual. This is a  chance to clarify the law that they suggest is currently in a  convoluted stage, which means that there is, in their judgment,  sufficient confusion about the law as to whether or not the process  should play out.   What this legislation argues, I think, with great proficiency is the  following, and that is that we should codify the system that we have  discovered in recent days is not only dysfunctional but is nonexistent.   Nine out of the last 10 Presidents of the United States have  voluntarily released their tax forms. It dates to Richard Nixon in a  letter to the then-chairman of this committee, Wilbur Mills.   Barack Obama and Joe Biden have both indicated they have been fully  audited. What we are suggesting today is that this is an opportunity to  clear up the question of how the mandatory audit that is highlighted in  regulations at the IRS plays out.   By the way, when we say it is not in law, this institution here  functions on the basis of rules as well as law. The rules in the IRS  manual said that the audit ought to take place. We have discovered that  not only did the audit not take place but it hasn't even been  completed.   A reminder: This is not about a President. This is about the  Presidency going forward.                                time  1030    This was not done with malicious intent. It was not done in a  clandestine manner. It was this chance to say, okay, if there is a  legitimate argument about how the mandatory audit system plays out,  let's straighten it out this morning. Easily done and accomplished.  Paying taxes is a core responsibility, a reflection of our faith in  common citizenship.   Despite the idea that we talk about a voluntary system, treasure the  idea that about 87 percent of the American people pay their taxes on  time. That really speaks, I think, to the intent and sincerity that  they feel about a functioning government. All of us are expected to  fulfill that responsibility.   In exchange for voluntary compliance, we have to be assured that a  fair and well-functioning system ensures that everyone else is  cooperating, too. This shouldn't be the kind of country that allows  those with power and privilege to be held above the law that applies to  everyone else. That is not part of our national character. That is not  our ethic as a people.   Here, no one, no matter how powerful, should be out of the reach of  the tax system, least of all not in compliance with our tax laws.   The IRS failed its own policy to audit a President in an affront to  our shared sense of justice and fairness. Everybody on this occasion  acknowledges that, the audit did not take place. And no audit has been  completed 3 years later.   The legislation before us, H.R. 9640, rectifies the situation. It  offers great clarity.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
