 Mr. Speaker, this is not a House floor proceeding. This  is a partners meeting of Insurrection, LLC.   I ask them to tell me where Adam was wrong.   He said at the first impeachment: Can we be confident that Donald  Trump will not continue to try to cheat this 2020 election?   The answer is: No, we can't.   We can't trust this President to do the right thing, not for 1  minute, and not for one election. He will not change, Mr. Speaker, and  you know it.   Was he wrong when that President aimed and sent a mob into this  Chamber and made all of us leave?   Was he wrong when he said that Donald Trump has betrayed our national  security and will do so again? Was he wrong when he said that Donald  Trump stole and shared classified information?   Was he wrong when he said that?                                time  1500    Maybe he was wrong when he said to the country, you are decent.  Donald Trump is not who you are.   I ask my colleagues: Are you as indecent as Donald Trump? Will you be  remembered as footnotes and foot soldiers in history's books that  chronicle Donald Trump's corruption, or will you be as decent as Adam  Schiff?
