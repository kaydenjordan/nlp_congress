 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend, Chairman  McGovern, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we are back again on appropriations, and we are back  again on the exact same set of bills as before.   Last week, the House agreed, over Republican objections, to pass a  set of appropriations bills, six of which would fund the relevant  departments for a full year, the seventh of which would fund the  Department of Homeland Security until February 8.   Today, not content with already having passed these bills once, my  friends in the majority are again bringing up four individual bills  that were part of the same package covering the Transportation and  Housing and Urban Development bill, Financial Services and  [[Page H304]]  general government bill, the Agriculture bill, and the Interior and  Environment bill. Nothing substantive in these bills has changed.  Indeed, nothing substantive has yet changed anywhere in this process:   The government remains partially shut down;   The Senate is refusing to pass the bills my Democratic Party  colleagues are proposing;   The President is refusing to sign them; and   The majority is proposing to fix the problem by passing the exact  same bills.   To quote the great Yogi Bera: ``It is deja vu all over again.''   While I commend my friends in the majority for trying to reopen the  government, let's be clear about what they are proposing. The four  bills under consideration here represent only the Senate-passed  versions of the bills covering the fiscal year 2019 appropriations  process. They represent no input at all from the House, no input at all  from the Appropriations Committee, and no input at all from the joint  House and Senate conference committees that were appointed to iron out  the differences between these bills and their House counterparts.   In essence, the Democrats' only plan is for the House to swallow the  Senate's original bills, abrogate our authority and responsibility as a  coequal House of Congress, and declare victory. What is more surprising  is that my friends now expect that having tried this same thing before,  they will now get a different result.   To be clear, last week, when the House passed these exact same bills,  the Senate made it known these bills would not come to the floor; and  even if they did, the President has made it known that he would not  sign them. I don't know what they think is so different about this week  over last to make my friends think that all they need to do is to pass  them again and, magically, the Senate will pass these bills and the  President will sign them.                                time  1245    Perhaps even more surprising, the majority now wishes to bring these  four bills forward under a closed rule, with no opportunity for the  House to amend them and no opportunity for Members to weigh in. As a  member of the Appropriations Committee, I understand how hard it is to  have a full process on appropriations bills. But it is, indeed,  possible, even when funding bills carry over into a new year or even a  new majority.   In 2011, right after Republicans took majority control of the House,  we considered a bill on the floor to fund the entire Federal  Government. We did it under an open rule, with only a preprinting  requirement. When we considered that bill on the floor, 162 amendments  were offered from both sides of the aisle, and we had a grand total of  66 hours of floor debate on the bill, stretching out over 5 days.   Given the amount of time we used in 2011, I fully understand what an  undertaking that would be. But unless the majority believes that these  bills will quickly pass the Senate and quickly be signed by the  President into law, then there is plenty of time for thoughtful debate  and plenty of time to hear ideas from all Members of this House.  Instead, the majority has chosen to push forward with an appropriations  strategy that they know cannot succeed.   Mr. Speaker, the House should be taking steps this week to negotiate  with the Senate and the President to end this shutdown. That means  that, whether the majority likes it or not, they need to engage on  border security.   The American people have told us time and time again that they want  action on border security. The solution they are proposing today does  nothing on that front.   Even if we pass these bills today, and even if they, ultimately,  became law, the border would remain unsecured and the Department of  Homeland Security would remain shut down. Nothing the House will do in  this package will change that essential fact, and nothing in this  package is a step on the road to changing that essential fact.   Mr. Speaker, it wasn't always this way. In 2006, 64 Democrats joined  Republicans in passing the Secure Fence Act, which President Bush  signed into law. Those 64 Democrats then included 13 current Members  now and one additional Member who has since gone on to the Senate. Even  liberal lions of the House, like our good friend and former colleague  Congressman Barney Frank, joined the Republicans in voting for border  security. I am unclear what has changed, from then until now, that  would cause the entire majority Caucus to refuse to work with  Republicans on border security when so many did so back in 2006.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, while I agree with the good intentions of  the majority in seeking to fund the government, their method of doing  so is in no way sufficient. Instead of abrogating our own authority,  embracing a Senate-only product that the President will not sign, and  kicking the can down the road, we should be taking concrete steps to  reopen the government, secure the border, and move on to the many  important needs of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule and the underlying  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  make a couple of quick points, and then yield to another speaker, if I  may.   Mr. Speaker, I want to disagree a little bit with my friend's memory  on  [[Page H305]]  what the last Congress did and did not do. Quite frankly, it was the  most successful Congress in enacting appropriations bills in 22 years,  75 percent of them across the floor on time. We will see how good the  record is as my friends are in the majority. And I am going to work  with my friends on that, because I know it is the intention to do that,  but it is no easy task.   To say that the last Congress didn't act when, in fact, it put a bill  over in the United States Senate that the President would have signed  is simply untrue. To suggest that Republicans controlled the Senate in  this process, when a Democratic minority in the Senate kept us from  getting to 60 votes, there is where your real obstruction was. Quite  frankly, this problem would have never happened if the Senate chose to  operate the way we do, by simple majority vote, and the President would  have had a bill.   One last point, if I may. The President did offer to negotiate. The  reports in the media are that he actually offered to reduce his request  by half. That is normally, around here, considered a real negotiation:  Let's split the difference and find the common ground.   My friends didn't choose to take up that offer. So the idea that they  have somehow been innocent bystanders when they were in the minority,  in a process out of control, simply misstates reality.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from the great State  of Washington (Mr. Newhouse), my good friend, a member of the  Appropriations Committee, and a former member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Washington.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and  then I will yield to my good friend from Michigan.   Mr. Speaker, I will be happy to take up the challenge. I would be  happy to meet with anybody to reopen the government. I would be happy  if we had a product in front of us, which we did have in late December  that had actually been agreed to by the United States Senate.   Why my friends chose to just simply take the Senate bills--which I  will assure you, are not nearly as good as the conference bills between  the two bodies--and throw all of the work out that this body did over a  year, the appropriators, and the rest of the authorizing committees  that play a supplemental role in this, I will never know.   It would have been a lot harder to vote ``no'' than just simply sit  here and strip 435 Members of their ability to legislate, which is  effectively what my friends in the majority have chosen to do.   I hope going forward we can do exactly what my friend suggests. I  would also suggest that the people he mentioned go meet with the  President of the United States. He was here all December, happy to  negotiate with anybody. He wasn't in Hawaii. He was here. He offered to  split the difference. That was an unacceptable offer to my friends.   So if you want to negotiate, negotiate with the President. If you  want to do something with the Senate, I would expect that you should  probably sit down and talk to them because you are sending them  something this week that you sent last week, that they didn't take up  then, and they are not going to take up now.   So whenever we want to negotiate, I would be thrilled to be at the  table, but I haven't seen any evidence that my friends do want to  negotiate. Instead, they simply want to dictate. They simply want to  dictate the outcome and achieve what they think is a political victory,  and that is coming at the expense of the American people. Real  negotiations mean sitting down and settling differences. It doesn't  mean shooting paper back and forth across the rotunda.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Mitchell), my good friend and a distinguished Member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to notify the body, if we defeat the  previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to report  modified open rules for each bill before us today: H.R. 264, H.R. 265,  H.R. 266, and H.R. 267. The rule would include a preprinting  requirement.   Mr. Speaker, the bills before us today are simply nothing more than  Senate products. House Democrats would rather try to win political  points against the Senate than allow this House to do its job. Again,  the Senate hasn't indicated they will take up these measures, and the  President has not agreed to sign these measures. There is time to do  this the right way.   In 2011, right after Republicans took the majority control of the  House, the government was operating under a continuing resolution, and  we considered a bill on the floor to fund the entire Federal  Government, and we did it under one open rule with just a preprinting  requirement.   There were a total of 66 hours of floor debate from the afternoon of  February 15, 2011, to the early hours of February 19, including one  stretch of debate that lasted 42 hours.   I do understand what an enormous undertaking it would be, but that  doesn't mean we shouldn't and can't take the time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I was amused--and I actually mean this in very good  spirit--when my friend mentioned how frequently he had been quoted in  today's debate, and I have to say I consider my friend one of the great  debaters in this Chamber, and I enjoy hearing him quoted on the floor  of the House. So I accept that, and I hope the gentleman knows it was a  compliment to him in many ways.   I also want to tell him--and I mean this very seriously--I take him  at his word. I don't have any doubt my friend wants to operate  differently than we have operated in the past and that he wants this  institution to be more open to inclusion of various points of view and  very sincere debate, and I pledge to my friend I will work with him in  that endeavor.   Now, it is hard to resist pointing out the gentleman's first six  bills have all been under closed rules. I suspect we will continue to  point that out until we have an opportunity to say to my good friend-- and I think we will in the very near future--``Congratulations, you are  following through on the things that you said.'' Again, I know my  friend will do that at what he considers and the majority considers the  appropriate time.   We have a lot of discussion, Mr. Speaker, about who did and didn't do  their jobs in the last Congress. I would tell you, in my view, that the  House did its job. It passed its bills. It sent to the Senate a product  that the President would sign.   Mr. Speaker, I would tell you, you are doing your job here, as well,  right now in the majority. You passed bills last week. You sent them  over to the United States Senate.   In our case, the minority in the Senate blocked consideration of our  bills. Had those bills been placed on the floor, we wouldn't be here  today. They would have all passed. They had majority support in the  Senate; they had a President willing to sign them; and they had already  passed the House.    The only reason why we are here today is because the Democratic  minority in the Senate manipulated the rules of the Senate in such a  way that they could stop action. I suspect we all have had frustration  with that as House Members in the past. I think we will again in the  future.   I also want to reflect with my friends, and I draw this conclusion  not so much out of their actions, but actions that my own party, from  time to time, has committed, and I suspect I will say this to this  Chamber many times: Pursuit of absolute victory in domestic political  disputes is always a mistake. It always leaves a divided country and an  embittered opponent, and you will rue the day when you pursue it. We  have certainly done that, Mr. Speaker, on my side of the aisle.   I think that, to some degree, though, is what is going on today.  Sooner or later--and we are going to live with a Republican Senate for  the next 2 years and a Republican President for the next 2 years--my  friends in the majority will have to decide whether they want to govern  or debate, because that is all we are doing now.   Mr. Speaker, you are not the opposition party anymore. You are the  majority party, and you have every right to pursue your agenda. But if  you really want to govern, if you really want to get something done, in  the end, you are going to have to work with the Republican Senate, and  you are going to have to work with the Republican President.   We learned that hard reality when we were in the majority but dealing  with a Democratic Senate and a Democratic President in 2011 through  2014. I hope my friends learn the lesson more quickly and become wiser  than we were. I hope they benefit from our experience.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge opposition to this rule and the  underlying measure. The majority today is putting forward a closed rule  to bring up four appropriations bills, each of which the House has  already passed last week.   But, unfortunately, each of these bills is not a product of the House  of Representatives. These bills are Senate products that do not reflect  any House input. What is worse, they do not solve the fundamental  problem of border security, and they do not represent a serious effort  to reopen the government.   Since the Senate will not pass these bills and the President will not  sign them, all we are accomplishing here today is spinning our wheels.  The majority would be better served to undertake serious negotiations  with the President and the Senate over the need for border security and  to find a way out of the crisis of their own making rather than hoping  that something will be different this time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' on the previous question, ``no'' on the  underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I want to begin by welcoming my good friend from  Florida, first, to the Rules Committee, congratulate her on her first  rule on the floor, and, finally, thank her quite sincerely for the  distinguished service she rendered to our country when she was a member  of the Cabinet for former President Clinton. It is wonderful to have  the gentlewoman in the people's House.   Madam Speaker, we are here again, this time on the third and final  title of the rules package for the 116th Congress. Title III authorizes  the House to intervene, otherwise appear, or take any other steps in  the case Texas v. United States, the lawsuit currently pending over the  legality of the Affordable Care Act. In essence, if this passes, the  House will be giving Speaker Pelosi the authority to intervene in this  lawsuit on behalf of the entire House of Representatives.   I spoke briefly about this matter during the debate of the overall  rules package last week, and I am sure my opposition to title III comes  as no surprise to my friends on the other side of the aisle. Today, we  have several speakers on our side from the Ways and Means Committee and  the Energy and Commerce Committee, all of whom are deeply familiar with  these issues and who will be able to tackle this in more detail. But  for now, I will make a few key points.   First and foremost, it really isn't a surprise that the Democrats'  poorly written healthcare law finds itself, once again, in legal  trouble. The lawsuit this time arises from Texas where 20 States have  filed suits on the grounds that, because there is no longer a tax  penalty in place for failing to purchase health insurance under the  individual mandate, and because there is no severability clause, the  law itself is unconstitutional.   Last month, a district court judge in Texas agreed with the States  and struck down the Affordable Care Act. That ruling has been stayed  pending appeal.   This really should not have come as a surprise to the majority. At  the time the Affordable Care Act was passed, many of us on the  Republican side raised similar concerns. The act, as drafted, was too  poorly written and too precariously balanced to stand up under its own  weight.   The succeeding 9 years have caused those predictions to come to pass.  Premiums have skyrocketed; insurers have fled the market; and for many  Americans, the care they thought they were accessing under the  Affordable Care Act has become anything but affordable.   Before Republicans acted last Congress to repeal the tax penalty for  the individual mandate, literally millions of taxpayers made the  decision to pay that penalty instead of buying health insurance they  could not afford.   No matter what the outcome of this lawsuit will be, House Republicans  have over and over again expressed their support for protections for  those with preexisting conditions. Should the Texas decision be upheld,  Republicans stand ready to work with Democrats to build an insurance  system that protects people with preexisting conditions, increases  transparency and choice, and lowers costs across the country.   That is exactly what we tried to do in the last Congress with the  American Health Care Act, which we in the House proposed and passed as  a solution to the broken law that is the Affordable Care Act. While it  fell short in the Senate, its passage in the House clearly shows  Republicans were ready to take steps to fix this broken system.   Rather than taking those steps today, Democrats are asking us to  grant Speaker Pelosi a blank check to intervene in this lawsuit. Rather  than allowing the States to continue to pursue this litigation, as is  their right under the Constitution, Democrats want this House to  intervene. But the majority has not said why intervention is necessary  and why the House of Representatives must jump into this litigation  against some of the States. Other States have already made the decision  to intervene in support of the Affordable Care Act, rendering  intervention by this House unnecessary.   At best, this proposal is a political exercise intended to allow the  majority to reiterate their position on the Affordable Care Act. At  worst, it is an attempt to pressure the courts. Either way, there is no  real justification for doing what the majority wishes to do today.   Madam Speaker, the best way for the majority to protect Americans and  to protect access to healthcare is to pass a constitutionally sound law  that is well considered, well structured, and that will result in lower  premiums and better access to health insurance. It is not what they  have proposed here, which is a wasteful expenditure of taxpayer dollars  to defend the indefensible.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), a member of both the Rules  Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee, who also happens to be  perhaps the foremost expert on the ACA in the House of Representatives.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden), my good friend, who is also the former chairman of  the House Energy and Commerce Committee and current ranking member.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Roe), my good friend, the former chairman of the  Veterans' Affairs Committee and now its current ranking member.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Wenstrup), my good friend, who not only provided lifesaving care  to men and women in uniform in another career, but has actually done  that in this body as well.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Nunes), my very good friend and former  chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and current ranking member  of that committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  simply to make a quick point.   Actually, a vote against this provision is not a vote against  preexisting conditions. It is a vote to limit the power of the  Speaker--not to allow the Speaker to, on her own, decide whether she is  going to intervene in law cases where, frankly, the intervention of  this House isn't necessary. There are States litigating against the  ACA. There are States litigating for the ACA. The idea that either side  is unrepresented, I think, just doesn't bear serious scrutiny.   So, you know, not only is it an exercise in futility, in my opinion,  it is an exercise that is totally unnecessary because we have already  given the Speaker that power. The majority has already seen fit to do  that. So why we are wasting time, money, and effort in this particular  exercise eludes me.   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, to my good friend, the distinguished chairman of the  Ways and Means, I think that offer is made quite sincerely, and I think  it will be taken up by our side. We can work together in a bipartisan  way to do exactly what the gentleman suggests.   In my opinion, this particular measure doesn't do that. It doesn't  get us anywhere. It involves us in litigation unnecessarily, and it  doesn't--by the way, for the second time, since we gave the Speaker  this authority--I didn't vote for it, my friends did, that is their  right, she has it, so why we are here on the floor today arguing about  it mystifies me.   But, again, I know my friend's offer is made in good faith. I think  it will be taken up in good faith. We should work together to do  exactly what my friend suggests, that is, guarantee that every American  is protected from preexisting conditions and able to go into the  marketplace and buy insurance at a practical and reasonable rate that  they can afford.   So, with that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I am always delighted when my friends on the other  side believe in judicial restraint, so it is nice to see we have some  new converts in that.   I just make my basic point again, Madam Speaker. We are here for no  particular reason debating something that we did last week, giving that  power to the Speaker. I didn't agree with that vote. We had an  opportunity last week, actually, to take up a Republican measure that  would have legislatively guaranteed protections for preexisting. The  majority chose not to do that. So I have just forced back on the  conclusion that this is much more about political theater than it is  about genuine substance.   I will say, though, in disagreeing with my good friend from New  Jersey, I am not a lawyer. I don't pretend to be able to be an expert  judge of the legal merits, but I do think I would not so blithely  dismiss 20 State attorneys general and a court that ruled in their  favor. It tells me that there are significant legal issues here and  that those legal issues are going to be litigated in due course.   What mystifies me is why we need to be involved in it since there is  high-powered law from different States with different points of view  that are in this right now.   So, again, I see no particular reason to do this, although, with all  due respect, my friends have already given the Speaker the power to do  it, so I don't know why we need to do it a second time. But, again, I  am here to represent my colleagues on my side of the aisle, and we will  continue to do that.   With that, Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, let me advise my friend, I am prepared to  close. I see she has additional speakers, so, for the moment, I will  simply reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, actually, I know I informed the gentlewoman  differently, but my good friend, Mr. Burgess, got so excited by the  debate he came back and asked for an additional minute. So if I may,  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, in closing, I urge opposition to this measure. The  majority is asking the House of Representatives to authorize the  Speaker to intervene in a lawsuit over the legality of the Affordable  Care Act. Such an act is unnecessary and wasteful.   It should have been obvious to the majority that the Affordable Care  Act was and is poorly written and precariously unbalanced as  Republicans warned them at the time it was passed, and the intervening  years have brought those predictions to come about. Premiums  have skyrocketed. Insurers have fled the market. The American consumers  have suffered as a result.    The appropriate solution is not to intervene in a lawsuit but,  instead, to spend time working with Republicans to craft a replacement  fix to this broken system. And moreover, it is certainly not to do  today, in a rule, what we have already done in the same rule last week.   Madam Speaker, I have enjoyed the debate, but I am not exactly sure  why we had it. Again, it is always worthwhile to spend time on the  floor with my friends.   So, Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' on the previous question, ``no''  on the underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
