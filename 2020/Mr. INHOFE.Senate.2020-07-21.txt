 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, we have three groups of speakers having  to do with the vote that will take place at 11:45 a.m., and during that  time I will take the first 15 minutes, and then other Members will have  amendments. The first two amendments will be the Schatz amendment and  then my amendment.   I did have the intention of having more time and was going to kind of  rejoice a little bit because, right now, I understand we are about to  get the information on suggestions that the Secretary of Defense has  after working over a realignment of some of our resources, particularly  in Europe. This is kind of interesting because this is something that  18 years ago this year I tried to do unsuccessfully when Jim Jones was  the Supreme Allied Commander, and we were not able to get it done.  After 18 years, we are going to try it again. I will be speaking about  that issue at 4 p.m. today, and it is a significant one.   Today we are considering amendments to our national defense  authorization bill. We are still working on a managers' package, but as  I previously noted, we have already agreed to more than 140 bipartisan  amendments.   Let me be more specific than that. This is the first time we have  done this. We have had amendments to a lesser degree in the past. This  is the first time that the entire bill has been put together by Members  of the U.S. Senate.   To demonstrate that, the total number of amendments to date, on July  21--including our request prior to coming to the floor--are 818  amendments, of which 440 are Republican and 428 are Democratic. Then  there was the adoption of the substitute amendment. We all remember  what happened then. We had 79 amendments. Those amendments were 34  Democrat and 34 Republican, and 11 were joint. Then the amendments we  adopted with the managers' package included 34 amendments, 15 from  Republicans and 18 from Democrats, as amendments on the second  managers' package numbering 28 and the third package of 34. What I am  saying is that we have had many amendments, and this is the first time  there has been a bill that was entirely written by the Members. That is  why we are at a point now where we can introduce our amendments.   It was important to both Senator Reed and me to try to vote on at  least a few individual amendments. This is something we haven't been  able to do in the last several years. We made this arrangement 2 weeks  ago when we set up some six amendments to be voted on. We will start in  just a few minutes voting on the first two, which will be Senator  Schatz's and mine. I am glad we are doing this within the hour.   The first two amendments will be in relation to Senator Schatz  regarding the 1033 Program. I am strongly opposed to the Schatz  amendment to end the 1033 Program. I hear people talking about this,  and I guess they don't realize what we have done in the State of  Oklahoma. Our sheriffs and law enforcement officers were quite upset  when they heard that it might be in jeopardy. The 1033 Program is an  effective use of the taxpayers' money, taking equipment that is not  being used by the military and allowing it to go into the law  enforcement sector. All kinds of precautions have already been taken,  but we are talking about adding a few more precautions.   The 1033 Program is an effective use of taxpayers' money. In fact,  since the program's creation in 1990, more than $7 billion worth of  vehicles, desks, boots, computers, and more have been responsibly  recycled into law enforcement. This is military equipment that the  military no longer needs and that these agencies would be purchasing  anyway. The equipment is always demilitarized so that it is appropriate  for public safety use.   For years, local law enforcement has been asked to do more with less.  Now they face the liberal cause to defund the police. We need to  continue this transparent, responsive program.   There are a lot of us who have a hard time believing that this is  going on today--that people are trying to play down law enforcement,  trying to say that it is acceptable to break the law. This has never  happened before in America, but that is what we are seeing right now.  That makes this program one that is even more valuable.   Senator Schatz's amendment would place such stringent limitations on  the 1033 Program that it would make the program virtually impossible to  use. It adds only burdensome certification and reporting requirements.   Now, I don't say this critically of Senator Schatz, but he doesn't  like the program, and he wants to kill the program. We are not going to  allow this to happen.   As an example, let's say that a sheriff's office in my State of  Oklahoma or any other State decides that they want to receive sleeping  bags that the Department of Defense no longer needs. Under the Schatz  amendment, that sheriff's office would need to, No. 1, put the request  for sleeping bags out for public comment 30 days prior; second, they  would have to receive approval from local and State authorities; and  third, they would have to file reports on how the sleeping bags would  be used and the kind of training officers will have to receive in order  for them to have these sleeping bags.   Sheriff's offices are too busy working to keep our communities safe  to file numerous reports on sleeping bags that they receive from DOD.  To put it bluntly, I think this amendment would kill the 1033 Program.  Again, this is allowing trained law enforcement officers to use surplus  equipment that is not going to be used and has no value to the  military. This is why both the National Sheriffs' Association and the  National Fraternal Order of Police strongly oppose Senator Schatz's  amendment.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record the recommendations from the National Sheriffs' Association and  the National Fraternal Order of Police   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                 National Sheriffs' Association,                                      Alexandria, VA, July 14, 2020.      Hon. James Inhofe,      Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services,           Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I write today to lend the voice of 3,068       sheriffs in support of your amendment #2411 to the National       Defense Authorization Act and in opposition to Senator       Schatz' amendment #2252. The National Sheriffs' Association       has studied this issue thoroughly and determine that your       amendment to prohibit the transfer of bayonets, grenades       (other than flashbang and stun), weaponized tracked combat       vehicles and armed drones is a more thoughtful approach.       Senator Schatz, on the other hand, would stop the 1033       completely thru bureaucratic recordkeeping and reporting       requirements that make it all but impossible to legally       comply. It seems to us that, since taxpayers have bought this       equipment once, to simply throw the equipment away or let it       rust in warehouses is an incredibly wasteful approach to       taxpayers' dollars. The sheriffs implore you to let us       continue to use this equipment to save lives in high water       rescues, deep snow rescues, and hostage situations, which we       do many times a year.            Best regards,                                                 Jonathan Thompson,                                        Executive Director and CEO.  [[Page S4316]]                                          ____                            National Fraternal Order of Police,                                      Washington, DC, July 15, 2020.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles E. Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators McConnell and Schumer: I am writing on behalf       of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you       of our opposition to S. Amdt. 2252, which will be offered to       S. 4049, the ``National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal       Year 2021.'' The FOP urges members of the Senate to vote       against this amendment, which would impose sweeping       restrictions on an important surplus equipment program for       State and local law enforcement agencies.        The FOP has long supported the 1033 program, which is a       surplus equipment program administered by the Defense       Logistics Agencies (DLA) and the Law Enforcement Support       Office (LESO) at the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). The       media is constructing an inaccurate narrative that State and       local law enforcement agencies are becoming too       ``militarized'' simply because this program is administered       by the DoD.        It is important for Senators to understand that equipment       received through the 1033 program is demilitarized and       repurposed for public safety use. Simply because a piece of       equipment was originally purchased--with our tax dollars--by       the DoD does not make it military equipment. A tool is       defined by its use. The equipment is used to defend and       protect officers and civilians from threats and to carry out       law enforcement and public safety objectives.        There is no data, studies, or other information to support       the contention that State and local law enforcement agencies       are misusing equipment obtained through these Federal grant       programs. For this reason, on behalf of the more than 354,000       members of the Fraternal Order of Police, we urge members of       the Senate to vote against this amendment. If I can provide       any additional information on this issue, please feel free to       contact me or Executive Director Jim Pasco in my Washington       office.            Sincerely,                                                      Patrick Yoes,                                                National President.     Madam President, I support strong oversight of the 1033  Program, and I understand the intent behind my colleague's amendment.  We want to make sure that the wrong kind of equipment doesn't get into  the hands of people who cannot properly use it, so we have actually put  those modifications into an amendment that will be voted on--the Inhofe  amendment--right after the Schatz amendment, in another 30 minutes from  now.   We are offering an alternative to the Schatz amendment. It would  place a more narrow limitation on the transfer of Department of Defense  equipment, including weapons that cannot be used by State and local  enforcement. We are talking about weapons such as weaponized tracking  vehicles, drones, and lethal grenades. They are not being used anyway,  so let's put them on a list so that they can't be used. That should  satisfy a lot of people's concerns.   It also makes sure that those who receive this equipment get  necessary training on how to protect citizens' constitutional rights  and enhanced training on deescalation techniques.   Defunding and deequipping our law enforcement agencies simply will  not fix anything. Making sure they have the right equipment and right  training will. So I would request that my colleagues vote no on the  Schatz amendment and recognize the value of this program, and vote yes  on my amendment putting new safeguards into the 1033 Program.   With that, Madam President, having used the first 10 minutes of my  time, I yield the next 5 minutes to Senator Cramer.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 2411 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    I call up amendment No. 1729 and ask that it be reported  by number.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 60- affirmative vote threshold with respect to the Shaheen amendment No.  1729 be vitiated.    For the information of all Senators, it is my  understanding that we should be able to adopt the amendment by voice  vote.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, right now, we are in the middle of what I  have referred to several times as what I consider to be the most  significant bill of the year, the National Defense Authorization Act-- one that you can almost be sure will pass. This will be the 60th  consecutive year it has passed. That is a pretty good indication it is  going to pass.   That comes with problems, however. People know that a bill is going  to pass, so you get a lot of pieces of legislation that had not been  able to get passed, and it may be a whole year, and it becomes a part  of this bill. It is more than just the Defense authorization bill, but  it is the most significant one.   Before we even came to the floor, we did something that we have been  working on now--at least I know personally--for 4 years, and that is to  put ourselves in a position where just in case we find ourselves where  we can't get amendments--all it takes is one person to object, and  there will be no amendments if this happens. We decided to go ahead and  put this bill together and do it in such a way that the Members are  actually drafting the bill. We have 700 Member items.   You might remember that back in January, we started talking about  this, saying: If you want to have an amendment in the Defense  authorization bill, even though it is not going to become effective  until a year from December, you better get down there and do it because  now is the time you can get that done. Well, we ended up with 700  Member items, and that was before we even got to the floor, and then  more were added. We added another 140 amendments after that.   You can say that this bill was passed by you--I am talking about the  Members, Democrats and Republicans--in the Chamber because these items  all came out of it. We didn't do it the way it used to be done. We kind  of eased into this, but it has worked very well. I commend Liz and John  for the work they do in holding everyone together in making this a  reality.   Where we are right now is, we have had a lot of our Members coming to  the floor. My staff and I are continuing to work on the inclusion of  additional amendments. If you will recall, 2 weeks ago, when we took a  break for the Fourth of July, we agreed upon some legislation, some  amendments that would be a part of this. They are all structured right  now. We have already passed two--actually, passed four today. We have  another bunch of amendments, including a managers' package. It was  hotlined today, just today. We don't have the results of that yet.  People may have objected to it, and I am just not aware--apparently,  there have been some objections. I don't know what the count is. We  will  [[Page S4331]]  keep trying to get as many amendments as possible. My experience is  that this means we are nearing the end of the road.   I would have to say this about my partner in this effort--he has been  my partner for a number of years, Jack Reed, on the minority side. We  have both worked hand in glove in trying to get as many amendments as  possible, and we have set a record this year with either amendments or  letters from Members.   I am going do something that will make a bunch of people mad, but I  don't really care. You hear so much negative stuff. I have said several  times that when this President came in, up to the moment that we had  the virus, we had the best economy we have had in my lifetime. All  indications show that was true.   He did this in a way that was thought out, and it wasn't all a  Republican idea. Back when John Kennedy was President of the United  States, that is when they were expanding the Great Society. This is a  quote. He said: We are going to have to have a lot more revenue to take  care of the Great Society programs. The best way to increase revenue is  to decrease marginal rates--marginal tax rates. And it worked.  Unfortunately, he died right after that and could not see the benefits  of the efforts of this great idea.   This was done again during the Bush administration. It was the first  thing that was done by the Trump administration. But he did something  different this time, and this is the reason that it produced much more  revenue than the others had produced in years past. He said: We also  need to reduce the regulations at the same time.   I am very sensitive to this because I chaired the Environment and  Public Works Committee during the time the Republicans were in the  minority. During the Obama administration, we had so many regulations,  and that had to be changed.   Even the Chair is probably not aware that this is a regulation that  was passed during the Obama administration, but it is one which said  that if you are a domestic oil or gas company and you are in  competition with China or somebody else, you have to give them your  playbook--how you calculated your rates. That put them at a decided  advantage.   When I was fortunate enough to get to know this President, prior to  the time he took office, I was suggesting and he was saying: What would  be a good place to start in reducing regulations?   I said: A good one would be to do away with that regulation that was  passed.   I think it was only a week after he took office that we passed the  first regulation. That is just one example. But then regulation after  regulation after regulation--those of us who have grown up in the  business world know that is what costs money. And liberals have never  figured that out.   Anyway, this has happened. As a result of this, we have had really  great benefits. I bring this up now because--put the Johnson family up.  This is a family in Oklahoma. It is the Johnson family, Charlie  Johnson. He has several brothers, and he has a son named Andrew. They  are in the tree business. They find people who want to get rid of dead  trees, unwanted trees, and they get rid of the trees. They are the best  there are. They have been doing it now very competitively and doing it  for years.   When he came to take a tree out during the 2 weeks--I am talking  about less than 2 weeks ago--he said: We can do this, but I want to  tell you that we are really busy now. In fact, our business is better  than it has ever been in the history of our country. It is all because  of what has happened with the President.   These are his words. He said: I know everybody hates the President.  The media hates the President. But we love him, and let me tell you  why. We are now doing better than we have ever done before. Our  business is better than it ever has been.   He has a brother who specialized--when you are in the tree business,  you specialize. If you look, you can't see the bucket, but the son is  in the bucket. Another one is the guy who has developed a way of  grinding stumps. Almost anyone can take a tree out, but to grind a  stump, you have to have very expensive equipment.   A few days after I had seen these people, I got a visit by a guy  named Brad Johnson. Brad is the one who specializes in stump grinding.  He said: Our business is so good now--and they all credit the President  with this--our business is so good that I decided I would go off on my  own and buy a stump grinder. It is very, very expensive. No one ever  thought it would be, but it is. Now I think he owns the only stump  grinder in Delaware County in Oklahoma.   He said: I want you to do something. I know you will be going back to  Washington. I am going to give you this, and I want you to give this to  the President of the United States.   It says: ``Brad's stump grinding.'' I am going to give this to the  President of the United States and take his picture.   I only say all this to mention that good things are happening around  here. Things had not been this good, except for the virus problem. No  one had any control over that in terms of the President. When I stop  and think about how good our economy was right before the virus hit, I  think: If we had an average economy, where would we be today?   Anyway, that was the good news, and I was excited to tell them I was  going to share this with a few other people.   Earlier today, I mentioned I would be coming down to the floor to  talk about our troop basing in Germany. Those of us on the committee  know we have been working on this for a long time.   Secretary of Defense Mark Esper was putting something together where  he was going around and reevaluating our troop and asset distribution  around the world. I disagree with some of the things he came up with.   Africa, for example, is an area where they are starting to have some  very serious problems. If anything, it is going to end up taking more  activity. Along with other Members, I will be receiving detailed  briefings from the Department of Defense on plans to carry out the  President's decision in the coming days and weeks.   Based on my conversation with Secretary Esper and the briefings I  have received so far, the goal is to optimize our force posture in  Europe, in part by moving some of our forces along NATO's eastern  flank. It has always been in Western Europe. Going forward, as I think  about the plan to realign our posture in Europe, I am thinking about  the three guiding principles that I call the ``3 Fs.''   First is the forward presence--maintaining a strong presence in  Europe that gives our troops what they need to deter Russia and, if  necessary, to fight and win and defeat Russia. I like the idea of  rotational forces in southeast Europe.   The second one is force protection. Really, force projection is more  accurate. It is keeping strong, established bases for staging, air  capacity, and more. For example, at Ramstein Air Force Base, we have  invested quite a lot of money in that. It is going to work for any  future use in readjustments that take place in Europe. What I am saying  is a lot of things are going on in Europe that are going to be  enhanced, as opposed to being transferred.   The third is families. This is kind of interesting. Take our Air  Force in Tinker Air Force Base. There is a young lady who is the wife  of a worker at Tinker Air Force Base. Her name is Janna Driver. This  was 2 years ago. She told me that we have a problem at Tinker. When we  privatized our housing, it worked out fine for a long period of time,  but then it seemed to be that people got greedy in the housing. They  talked about deplorable conditions in housing. I thought: My gosh, this  is my home State of Oklahoma. Thank goodness it is just one military  establishment.   Then I found out it was in all five of our military establishments.  Then I found out it wasn't just in Oklahoma. It was around the world.   This is something that is very significant because when you look at  the problems that they have with so many people--and I will be  addressing this in a little more detail in a minute because of the  amendment that will be before us tomorrow--the problem is that we do  something different than other countries do. I have heard this over and  over, and I am sure the Presiding Officer has also heard.   We talk about all the money we spend on defense in the United States,  [[Page S4332]]  and yet we spend more money than Russia and China put together. They  are our strategic oppositions out there.   That is true because the most expensive part of the military is the  people. People don't understand that. We want housing, and we want to  make sure there are schools for the kids. We want to make sure all  these things are going on. That is what costs the money. That is the  reason.   If you are in a communist country, they give you a gun and say: Go  out and kill people--and the problem is solved.   We are concerned about our families. They make a lot of sacrifices.  Every few years, our families have to move, change locations, and the  kids have to change schools. They move to another area. Then, if the  spouse has a job, they have to try to get a job.   By the way, in this bill we have some help. We get relief from some  of the regulations that normally take a long period of time, so that  spouses are able to get a job at a new location. That is something a  lot of people are not aware of that is in this great bill.   They have to change hometowns, change houses, change doctors, and the  kids change schools. Of course, they live with the reality that their  servicemember is putting their life on the line to defend our country.  We have to be grateful and never take that sacrifice for granted. That  is why we should be trying to ease the burden of our military families  in everything we do.   When it comes to this plan we are talking about, which is changing  the forces around, primarily in Europe, that is what you hear more  about. It is important that we do it right and we do it right away. It  is going to take some time to do, but we need to get started.   The reason I am really excited about this program is that this is not  something new. If I have good memories, you might remember back when  Gen. Jim Jones was the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO at that time. I  had gone to him and said: You know, one thing we really need to be  doing is to start readjusting where we have our troops.   At that time, we had a lot of troops, as we do today, in Germany and  a lot of training was taking place there. But because of the  environmental movement in Germany, they were giving us restrictions,  saying you can only train with live ordnance maybe every 4 days a week  and not past sunset and all of that.   We were thinking that we were really doing a great thing for Germany  by stationing all our people over there because of all the money they  spend and all that. Yet they are not really trying to help us.    We did some surveying. This is kind of funny because John Bonsell,  the staff director of my committee on the Republican side, and I went  over to the different countries--Bulgaria, Poland, and other different  countries in that part of the world, in the eastern part of Europe. We  said: Are you willing to help us out? They said: Not only can you use  your ordnances as much as you want, but at the same time, we will help  billet you and all that.   The program was good and strongly supported by Gen. Jim Jones at that  time.   We did all we could to put that together, and we were visiting our  allies about it. We already had Ukraine, Bulgaria and Romania lined up.  They call that the lily pad approach to basic. It was something that  would work. There is no reason not to do that.   Unfortunately, President Bush decided he didn't want to do it. We  were unsuccessful getting that done. I have been fighting about that  with other Presidents since that time. I have not gotten any of them to  look at that and the great values that would make for us.   Anyway, that is something that is taking place right now. We don't  know, but we are going to get a Member briefing tomorrow that is going  to give us a lot of details on what is going to happen and what the  President is proposing in that area of Europe.   I want to speak about one of the amendments that is next up. Senator  Sanders' amendment would cut defense spending by 10 percent. I happen  to be very close with Senator Sanders, but we have areas where we  disagree with each other. This is one of those areas. I looked at this,  and I thought: He has an amendment that would cut defense spending by  10 percent.   First of all, this amendment would break the bipartisan budget  agreement of 2019 that we passed. Congress passed this agreement last  December with a bipartisan support, and the President signed it into  law. The fiscal year 2021 NDAA, or National Defense Authorization Act-- the bill that we are working on right now, as we speak--fulfills this  agreement and provides a total of $740.5 billion for our national  defense. I would have preferred to see a higher number at that time,  but it is now the law of the land.   Even though the amount is lower than ideal, having budgetary  certainty is critical. It is what our military leaders ask for every  time they come before the committee that I chair and before Senator  Shelby's committee. They need on-time, predictable, and stable funding  to do their job. And their jobs are only getting harder right now. Our  adversaries are investing in their militaries and building new and  advanced weapons systems and acting more aggressively than we have ever  seen before in any of our adversaries.   The national defense strategy describes this. This is a document, by  the way, that we adhered to. This is put together by six Republicans  and six Democrats. It is one of these things where it was bipartisan.  Everyone agreed on it. People who put this together were experts, and  we have followed it to the letter ever since that time.   This is the National Defense Strategy Commission report, which is a  bipartisan document written by six Democrats and six Republicans. They  tell us that we need to increase our defense budget each year. We  already know we need to be increasing our budget just to stay  competitive. We have already agreed to this total.   Now, one of the criticisms I hear of our defense budget is that we  pay much more than other countries. As I have already explained, we are  the ones who have to pay to take care of our people--our troops, their  families, their kids. Here is the problem with that argument: Other  countries don't have to do that.   Beyond the troops, we also take care of the families and all that,  while others don't do that.   This is significant. China and Russia are rapidly modernizing their  militaries. When I say this in public and I talk to groups, I don't  have credibility. It doesn't sound like it is possible.   I don't say this critically of the Obama administration. The Obama  administration, by his own admission, had other priorities. One of them  wasn't a strong military. During the last 5 years--and I am talking  about 2010 to 2015, during those last 5 years of using the President's  budget, he decreased the amount of money for our military by 25  percent. In 5 years, he decreased it by 25 percent. At the same time,  Russia increased theirs by 34 percent, and China increased theirs by 83  percent.   Stop and think about that. Our adversaries were out there building  and getting ahead of us in different areas. It is important to note  that the bill exempts military pay and the defense health program,  which means this amendment is actually the equivalent to a 14-percent  cut. I am talking about cuts in airplanes and equipment and assets that  are military assets. This means the nuclear modernization and key  research that help us stay competitive with Russia. This is something  that arguably cannot be done.   It means cuts to military construction, including schools for  military kids, programs that support military families, and programs  that support our troops' morale and welfare. It is just plain wrong.   Our military combat commanders tell me and the committee that they  need on-time, predictable, and stable funding to do their jobs. This  amendment would actually cut that by 14 percent in the areas that  concern people. In the strongest possible terms, I urge a ``no'' vote  on this amendment.   All this is going to happen while we continue to face the burden that  a pandemic has placed on our military. Our military is a key part of  the whole-of-government response to the virus.   Our competitors haven't given us a free pass while this is all  happening. In fact, we have seen China and Russia take advantage of  this situation, and  [[Page S4333]]  they have been acting more aggressively. At the same time, the  Department of Defense is working to protect our troops and the civilian  workforce from the virus, and this needs to continue to be a top  priority. Everyone understands that. In fact, rather than cutting the  defense budget, we actually need to support the military COVID response  with additional funding.   Take this one example. The defense industrial companies have done a  great job to ensure that their suppliers--primarily thousands of small  businesses--stay open and keep employees paid.   In the CARES Act, we gave the DOD the authority and the tools to  reimburse these companies to keep the defense workforce strong, but the  DOD needs money to use these tools. If we don't help these companies,  defense weapons programs and maintenance will suffer more cost  overruns, and the defense industrial base will lose experienced and  trained workers, which means schedule delays will be more likely. These  will be primarily the small companies. These will not be the giants  that are out there.   This would be a good investment for our national defense and a good  investment for the American taxpayer. Now is simply not the time to be  cutting our defense budget when we should be doing more. I know the  author of the bill who would cut defense spending by 10 percent is very  sincere and really believes in his bill, but it is not the time to do  it.   I hope people understand that we are now in a position wherein there  are actually different resources that are in Russia and in China that  are better than ours. Hypersonic weapons are a good example. Hypersonic  weapons are kind of state-of-the-art in both offense and defense, and  they are ahead of us. They are ahead of us right now.   With this budget we are going to be passing, I think that we are  going to be making broad steps to recapture those areas in which we had  previously been the leaders but now are not the leaders any longer.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Reserving the right to object.    Well, first of all, I don't know how long I have sat and  listened to this--a long time--probably not as long as it seems.  ``Secret police, sadistic, cruel.'' I am beginning to come to the  conclusion that they are not going to be supporting Donald Trump for  reelection.   I rise to object to my colleagues' request for unanimous consent.  This body has worked together to carefully consider each and every one  of the 739 amendments filed on the NDAA. It never happened before. We  adopted those amendments that have broad-based, bipartisan support. The  majority and minority have worked together to determine which  amendments would be brought up for a vote. Senator Merkley's request  for a UC circumvents that process.   Further, this morning, the Senate adopted my commonsense amendment  that will ensure that law enforcement has the right equipment and the  right training. Senator Merkley's amendment flies in the face of that  responsible approach.   His amendment would hamstring Federal and civilian law enforcement  and our military, even when operating in a title 32 status under the  control of the State government. This would hinder their ability to  keep our communities safe. For these reasons, I object.    Will the Senator yield?
