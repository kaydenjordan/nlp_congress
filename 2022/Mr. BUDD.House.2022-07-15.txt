 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commend the much-needed pay  raise for our military, passed yesterday in a bill that provides  critical resources to confront the national security threats from China  and from Russia.   I would also like to highlight one of my amendments. Simply put, my  amendment provides funding to help veterans pursue careers in  education--as teachers and as school resource officers.   The House passage of this amendment is a win for everyone:   For veterans who want to pursue a career in education.   For schools who need more qualified teachers and resource officers.   And for students who will be able to learn from worthy role models  about service, sacrifice and patriotism.   The Veterans-to-Classrooms program will be an excellent opportunity  for veterans to continue to serve our country.                            ____________________
