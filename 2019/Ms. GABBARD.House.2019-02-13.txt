 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman and the sponsor of  this important legislation for the incredible leadership and continuing  to be a resolute voice.   The United States support for Saudi Arabia's genocidal war in Yemen,  with no authorization from Congress, has resulted in the deaths of tens  of thousands of Yemeni civilians. The U.S.-Saudi coalition has dropped  bombs on children in school buses, on people in markets, and on  families who are celebrating weddings.   They have left millions of Yemeni people on the brink of death from  famine, disease, starvation, a lack of access to clean water,  sanitation, and healthcare. This has created the worst humanitarian  crisis in a generation.   Earlier this week, the Trump administration threatened to veto this  critical legislation should it pass Congress, this legislation that  would end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, by spreading  blatant lies. They have said that this legislation draws  ``constitutional concerns,'' and they say it would ``affect our ability  to prevent the spread of violent extremist organizations.''   But here is the truth. First, the United States' support for this war  in Yemen is unconstitutional. Congress has not authorized it. Second,  Saudi Arabia is not our ally, and continued U.S. support for this war  in Yemen is strengthening terrorist groups like al-Qaida.   A recent CNN report documented how Saudi Arabia is literally taking  the U.S. weapons that have been provided to them in this war in Yemen  and handing them off to al-Qaida on the ground in Yemen, the very same  terrorist group that attacked us on 9/11.   Or to speak of the fact that Saudi Arabia is continuing to spend  billions of dollars spreading their Wahhabi-Salafist ideology that is  fueling terrorist organizations like ISIS and al-Qaida, causing them to  grow stronger.   Congress must take action today. We must reclaim our constitutional  responsibility and pass this legislation to stop supporting Saudi  Arabia's genocidal war in Yemen and strengthening these terrorist  groups that threaten us.                                time  1245
