 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule for H.R. 3219.  This bill provides funding for the Federal Government's most critical  function--national defense--with the Make America Secure Appropriations  Act, as we are making sure the men and women who protect and defend our  country have the best equipment and training in the world, and that  they get the pay raise they deserve.   Additionally, I am pleased to see my provisions I have worked on were  included in this legislation to protect Lake Erie by preventing the  Army Corps of Engineers from using open lake placement as a method of  disposal of dredged material unless a State water quality certification  is provided. This is ensuring that Lake Erie remains on the path  towards a healthier natural resource.   The bill also gives the EPA Administrator and the Secretary of the  Army further authorization to withdraw the waters of the United States  rule.   Finally, this legislation provides the resources to better secure our  border and protect our citizens and our national security. We are  making good on our promises to build the wall.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the  underlying legislation.
