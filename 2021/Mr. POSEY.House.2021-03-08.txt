 Mr. Speaker, over the past 10 years we have made a lot of  progress in making Congress more transparent and accountable.   After years of persistence, I was pleased to see that the House  finally adopted the comparative text rule that I proposed.   The comparative text rule made it possible for Members of the House  and the public to actually see and understand exactly what a bill  changes.   Every legislature in the country does that. But sadly, boom, in an  instant this year the House abolished that rule, even though it was a  top priority with the bipartisan Government Efficiency, Accountability,  and Reform Task Force for commonsense solutions to a better government.   Now, Mr. Speaker, that is shameful.                            ____________________
