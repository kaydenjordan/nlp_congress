 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today in support of Judge Ketanji  Brown Jackson, President Biden's nominee to be an Associate Justice of  the U.S. Supreme Court.   Judge Jackson brings an exceptional level of experience to the bench.  After serving for nearly 8 years on the U.S. District Court for the  District of Columbia, Jackson has more trial court experience than any  sitting Supreme Court Justice and more than almost any Justice in a  century. She will also be only the second sitting Justice to have  served on all three levels of the Federal judiciary.   Judge Jackson's nomination is historic. If confirmed, she will be the  first Black woman to sit on the Supreme Court, bringing a long overdue  representation to the Bench. After serving as an assistant Federal  public defender in Washington, DC, Judge Jackson will also be the first  former Federal public defender to serve on our Nation's highest Court.   It matters that someone nominated to sit on our Nation's highest  Court has represented people other than corporate clients. It matters  that someone nominated has had real experience with people who can't  afford lawyers. It matters that someone nominated has had real  experience in fighting for the public interest.   The Sixth Amendment of our Constitution grants criminal defendants  the right to have the assistance of counsel in their defenses, but it  wasn't until 1963, in Gideon v. Wainwright, that the Supreme Court  unanimously ruled that the Constitution required State courts to  appoint lawyers for defendants who could not otherwise afford one.   Now, some Republicans have complained about the very idea of having a  public defender on the Supreme Court, but their objections run squarely  afoul of the meaning of the Constitution. This fundamental  constitutional right to counsel is safeguarded by the work public  defenders do every single day. Public defenders are literally on the  frontlines of helping America live up to our constitutional ideals.  Every American who supports and defends the Constitution should welcome  a Supreme Court Justice who has worked so hard to turn our  constitutional ideals into reality.   When asked about her work as a public defender, Judge Jackson said:         Every person who is accused of criminal conduct by the       government, regardless of wealth and despite the nature of       the accusations, is entitled to the assistance of counsel.    Judge Jackson restates a foundational constitutional point, one that  she has lived--up close and personal.   Public defenders understand better than anyone that none of us should  be defined by the worst thing we have ever done. Everyone, regardless  of who they are or what they have been accused of, deserves a lawyer.  Our legal system, as imperfect as it may be, strives to deliver equal  justice under law. It is only because of the commitment of public  defenders, civil rights attorneys, and legal aid lawyers that we can  aspire to achieving that ideal.   That is why we need Judge Jackson's expertise on the Supreme Court,  and that is why, for a long time now, I have called for prioritizing  professional diversity on our Federal bench.   For far too long, our Federal judiciary has been dominated by those  who only have experience representing the wealthy and well connected,  but what about those who don't have money or influence? We need more  judges with experience in representing the voiceless and the  disadvantaged. The makeup of our Federal and State courts has never  fully reflected the American people. Over time, this lack of  representation has formed cracks in the foundation of our legal  system--cracks that weaken public trust and threaten the legitimacy of  our institutions.   A diverse judiciary matters. Judges--all judges--draw on their past  personal and professional experiences when analyzing the law and  reviewing the facts of individual cases. Judges who have experience as  public defenders, civil rights attorneys, and legal aid lawyers are  well equipped to understand the circumstances that bring everyday  Americans into courtrooms. It is that background that strengthens  public trust and that reinforces the legitimacy of our judicial system.   Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan said it best:         If the court doesn't have legitimacy with the American       public, it can't do all that much. All kinds of different       people should be able to look at the court and say, ``I see       somebody there who looks like me, who thinks the way I do,       who has experiences of the kind that I had.'' And that's the       kind of thing that gives the court public legitimacy.    Justice Kagan is right. Our judiciary will, undoubtedly, be made  stronger because of Judge Jackson's confirmation to the Supreme Court.   It is not only her work as a public defender that informs Judge  Jackson's experience. Prior to joining the bench, Judge Jackson served  first as an assistant special counsel and, later, as the Vice Chair of  the U.S. Sentencing Commission. These experiences give her deep insight  into the sentencing guidelines and enhance her ability to think  critically about our criminal legal system's impact on ordinary people.   Judge Jackson's first stint on the Commission inspired her to become  an assistant Federal public defender in order to gain practical,  firsthand insight into our criminal legal system. Her work in the  trenches, representing those without means or power, provided Judge  Jackson with an invaluable perspective into our system of justice, and  it gave her the opportunity to effectuate the fundamental right to  counsel, which is outlined in our Constitution.   I look forward to supporting her confirmation, and I urge all of my  colleagues to do the same.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
