 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bob Briggs of  [[Page H272]]  Westminster, Colorado, who passed away on December 2, 2021.   Bob was born December 24, 1937, in Greeley, Colorado, as one of eight  children and the oldest son. His family moved to Westminster in 1943  where Bob graduated from Westminster High School.   He earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from Colorado  State University, both in horticulture. According to a January 2020  profile in Orchard Living, he majored in horticulture because he did  not want to wear a tie for a living.   Bob married his wife, Shirley, on September 8, 1957. He had a long  career in local and State politics, serving as Adams County  Commissioner for 4 years, beginning in 1979--where he actually helped  me on one of my very first cases that I had as a lawyer--as the local  board member for the Regional Transportation District for 4 years in  1999, and a State representative for District 29 from January 2003 to  2005. He served terms on the Westminster City Council, including a  stint as mayor pro tem. He was a longtime proponent of local rail and  helped found the advocacy group Rocky Mountain Rail.   Mr. Speaker, Bob was a devoted husband and a loving father and  grandfather. He and Shirley raised two children and enjoyed spending  time with their grandchildren. I am deeply grateful for his lifetime of  service to our community.                            ____________________
