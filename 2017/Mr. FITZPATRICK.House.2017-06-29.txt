 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  incredible work of the Anti-Defamation League, or ADL.   The founder of this uplifting organization, Sigmund Livingston,  envisioned an America where we all are created and treated equally.  This is an objective that remains ever-relevant in today's America.  Through programming in schools, the ADL creates dialogue to educate and  prepare students to fight back against hate and confront discrimination  wherever it may exist. In addition, the ADL works to bring individuals  together to build understanding.                                time  1045    I have had the pleasure of meeting a special person, Rabbi Gruenberg,  a leader in Congregation Beth El, in my community, as well as the  Philadelphia ADL, earlier this year. I am proud to stand with my  neighbors, advocates, and elected officials of every stripe to reaffirm  that there is no room for hate or discrimination in any of our  communities.   The work of the Anti-Defamation League must continue and expand,  because the only way we can end senseless hate is by building bridges  and engaging with people we may perceive as being different from  ourselves.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the ADL for the incredibly  important work they are doing. I stand with them, as should everyone in  this Chamber.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and members of the  House Judiciary Committee for their work on this issue. And as a member  of the Homeland Security Committee, the issues being debated and voted  on this week are an area of critical importance when it comes to  keeping our Nation and our people safe.   Mr. Speaker, we are a nation of immigrants. I am the grandson of  Irish immigrants. We are also a nation of laws. Both must be respected  and honored by all of us. Left, right, or center, we can all agree that  our immigration system is broken, and given that broken status, it is  the responsibility of this body to fix it. This goal cannot be achieved  by selectively choosing which laws we enforce and which laws we ignore.   As a former FBI agent, I worked each day to keep Americans and keep  our Nation safe. And as a Federal prosecutor, I prosecuted cases that  resulted in the removal of violent felons who were in our country  illegally in order to keep our communities safe.   I have seen firsthand the threats our Nation faces from a fragmented  and broken immigration system and a porous border. We cannot and must  not allow partisanship to prevent sensible fixes from being  implemented. Our Nation's security depends on us.   Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us today is one borne of a  preventable tragedy. Kate Steinle was a bright, aspiring, 32-year-old  woman with a life of possibilities ahead of her. Let this bill be her  legacy. Let this bill result in Kate Steinle saving the lives of  others. Let us do her that honor.   Kate's Law will increase penalties for those who reenter our country  following their removal from the U.S., including Federal prison  sentences up to 25 years for those previously deported who have  criminal records.   Moreover, this bill supports our brave women and men in law  enforcement as they work to keep violent gangs and criminal cartels,  including the likes of MS-13, out of our communities. I am a cosponsor  of this legislation, and I am proud to advance it.   Mr. Speaker, the time is now for us to step up and protect those who  elected us to serve on their behalf, and I urge all of my colleagues to  make a bold bipartisan statement to our communities back home today.  Join me in support of H.R. 3004. Let's get this done for Kate Steinle  and her family.
