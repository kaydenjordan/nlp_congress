 Madam Speaker, it is undeniable that  we have a gun problem in our country and that too many people lose  their lives to gun violence every single day.   We can't take on the issue of gun violence without also addressing  ammunition access for criminals and for those who are choosing to harm  others across our country.   This means holding people and institutions accountable for their role  in the public commercial ammunition sales that can get into the wrong  hands.   Just a few weeks ago, The New York Times released a report indicating  that ammunition produced at the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant has  also been sold widely in the civilian marketplace. Ammo from Lake City  has been seized from drug dealers, violent felons, and even rioters  from January 6.   Ammo from the plant has been tied to at least a dozen mass shootings,  including at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh and at the Robb  Elementary School in Uvalde.   Let me be clear: This is completely unacceptable.   We are demanding oversight, not just over this plant, but the  commercial sales of ammunition that is subsidized by the U.S.  Government and then is turned around and used in mass shootings across  the country.   We also need to pass my bill, along with Senator Elizabeth Warren's  bill, the AMMO Act to regulate ammunition sales across the country.  This is a serious challenge. People are losing their lives.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause  2(a)(1) of rule IX, I rise to give notice of my intent to raise a  question of the privileges of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   H. Res. 114. Resolved, that, pursuant to Article I, Section 5, Clause  2 of the Constitution of the United States, Representative George  Santos be, and he hereby is, expelled from the House of  Representatives.
