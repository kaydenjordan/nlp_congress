 Mr. Speaker, I stand today in solidarity with the  workers who have paid in for years to have retirement security only to  have the rug pulled out from under them. Mondelez International, the  maker of iconic Nabisco products, like Oreo cookies, has, in recent  years, moved hundreds of good-paying middle class jobs to Mexico. Now  they have doubled down on shafting their U.S. employees.   On May 23, Mondelez-Nabisco announced it would withdraw from their  employees' pension plan. How nice. They have participated in this plan  for 60 years. This decision jeopardizes the hard-earned retirement  security of 110,000 current and future retirees.   This decision comes at the same time that this corporation, Mondelez,  paid its new CEO, Dirk Van de Put, $42.4 million for 41 days of work in  2017.   I would be remiss if I didn't mention Mondelez reaped millions of  dollars in tax breaks as a result of the passage of the recent Trump  tax cuts.   Since 2014, Mondelez has increasingly shifted production from the  U.S. to Mexico and taken major jobs with it.   On December 15, I wrote a letter to the United States Trade  Representative asking them, in the context of NAFTA, to prioritize  strong, enforceable labor provisions to discourage this kind of  outsourcing to Mexico.   Mr. Speaker, this is an epidemic.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Leviticus Chapter 19: 33-34, in the Old  Testament--Democrats can quote the Bible also. As a practicing  Catholic, let me do that.   ``When a foreigner resides among you in your land, do not mistreat  them. The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native- born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt. I am the  Lord your God.''   When did, Mr. Speaker, this barbaric, xenophobic, anti-immigrant  modern agenda begin? Let's go through it quickly.   One, the birther issue: An embarrassment to this country by the  administration, the head of the administration.   The Muslim ban: Imagine banning people that profess a particular  religion.   Third, Charlottesville: That debacle, equal opportunity.   Fourth, the incendiary talk that painted the entire Mexican  population--our ally, probably our third or fourth leading trade  partner, our ally--with a wide brush of pure prejudice, pure. He  painted the entire population.   To say that Democrats are for open borders, that is a lie. You know  it; I know it. I am standing up to reject it. You sit quietly. You sit  quietly and say nothing.   I was on the original starting gate at the Homeland Security after 9/ 11. Democrats, just as well as Republicans, worked together to put that  together. How dare anybody insinuate that we don't accept the security  of this Nation.   By the way, by the way, we have four borders, not one. The people who  attacked us on 9/11 came from Canada. They didn't come from Mexico. You  have never met a Mexican terrorist, and I certainly haven't met one  either.
