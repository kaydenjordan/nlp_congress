 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Chair Foxx,  for yielding me time.   I rise today in support of my resolution, H. Res. 461, which bans the  Biden administration from using schools to house illegal aliens.   As a mother and a physician, I do not see how my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle can let this stand.   Using school facilities as shelter for illegal aliens, instead of as  schools, as they were intended, creates a host of issues ranging from  safety hazards for young children to a free fall of security issues as  a result of not providing adequate accommodations or security  screenings. At a minimum, it deprives students of their space for  recess and physical education and imposes financial burdens on schools  for cleaning and housing.    Municipalities such as New York City are using school gymnasiums as  overflow housing for illegal aliens and setting troubling precedents  for the future. It is easy to be a sanctuary city when you are not  affected by the border until the Biden administration opens those  borders.   Diverting educational resources to illegal aliens, or any  demographic, and not in a natural disaster--and in most cases we have  little or no background information upon these individuals--provides an  avoidable and incredible security risk.   We must protect America's children and save our educational systems  from being robbed of their purpose.   The Biden administration's open border policies have turned every  State into a border State. And a broken immigration system, paired with  the lack of responsibilities and execution of border security, is  simply not good enough.   Speaking of the minority's comments on useless resolutions, last  Congress, the Democrats introduced a total of 982 resolutions, of which  only 176 passed.   H. Res. 461 sends the Biden administration a clear message that their  open borders and broken immigration system will not stand, and I urge  all of my colleagues to support this legislation.
