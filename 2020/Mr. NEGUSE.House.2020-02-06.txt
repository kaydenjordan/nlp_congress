 Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of representing the great  State of Colorado. Unfortunately, Colorado is no stranger to gun  violence.   I was 14 years old when my high school was put on lockdown. Soon  after, my classmates and I learned that, just a couple of miles down  the road, a terrible tragedy was unfolding at Columbine High School, a  terrible tragedy in which 13 people were shot and killed.   One of those 13 victims was a 14-year-old boy named Daniel Mauser.  This week, I brought Daniel's father, Tom Mauser, to the State of the  Union to highlight the urgent need for action on the gun violence  epidemic. He sat here in the gallery just a few days ago as the  President delivered his State of the Union and heard that the President  failed to mention any effort to engage in gun violence prevention and  to deal with the public health crisis that we face.   For 20 years, Tom has bravely converted his pain and his anguish into  action, pushing for gun violence prevention. Yet 20 years later, he  and, frankly, the entire State of Colorado are still waiting on  Congress to address the most basic and commonsense solutions to gun  violence.    Mr. Speaker, today, I rise for Tom. I rise for his son.   I rise for the so many victims that we have lost to gun violence  across Colorado and across our country. I rise today for the more than  100,000 Americans who every year survive a gunshot wound and now face  the lifelong physical and emotional toll surviving gun violence takes  on an individual.   I rise today to give voice to the millions of Americans across this  great country who are tired of the Senate's leadership being held  hostage by the special interest gun lobby.   I rise today because all Americans have a right to make their  communities safe from the onslaught of gun violence that this country  witnesses day after day. They have a right to demand the dangerous  loopholes like the Charleston loophole are closed. They have a right to  demand an end to the unbelievable number of military-style firearms  flowing through their streets.   And demanded they have, Mr. Speaker. Indeed, a majority of Americans  support creating a red flag law, by way of example, allowing police or  family members to request a judge to temporarily remove guns from  individuals who may be dangerous. A majority of Americans think that it  is absolutely ridiculous that we do not require universal background  checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales. And a  majority of Americans think that it is beyond comprehensible that  Members of Congress would stand in the way of working to ensure that  individuals do not have access to weapons of mass murder.   Let us be clear, Mr. Speaker. Let us be clear. The gun violence  epidemic that has gripped this country is neither a Democratic nor  Republican issue, but, rather, one of national importance, the  solutions to which must not face further delay.   We have grieved together; we have demanded change together; and we  have been shocked by the paralysis that has gripped this institution  when it comes to tackling our country's gun violence epidemic.   Mr. Speaker, I will close simply by saying the time has well since  passed when we should have enacted these commonsense reforms. We should  have done it 20 years ago. There is bipartisan legislation in the  Senate right now that will address these pressing issues, and it is  time for the Senate majority leader to bring that legislation to the  Senate floor for a vote. Coloradans and Americans have waited long  enough.                            ____________________
