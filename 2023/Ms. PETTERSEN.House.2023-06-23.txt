 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk made in  order by the rule.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, we are in the middle of a housing crisis across the U.S.  and in Colorado, especially in the Seventh District. The housing supply  is lagging significantly behind the demand in our State which has led  to skyrocketing prices pushing far too many people out of the  communities that they have lived in their entire lives, as well as  creating significant challenges to hire and retain workers for small  businesses and public servants.   Some communities in the rural part of our district have seen property  increase threefold in just a couple of years. While so many people are  struggling to get their first home, there are far too many people who  are buying up real estate for their third, fourth, and even fifth  homes, which has also contributed to the challenges our communities are  facing.   While I am very concerned about the rising costs of housing, this  bill does not address the problem.   For a little bit of background, the Federal Housing Finance Agency  serves as the chief regulator of the enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie  Mac.   Essentially, the FHFA oversees the majority of all mortgages in the  United States. Earlier this year, the Financial Services Committee  heard from the director, Sandra Thompson, about how the agency is  working to help Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac meet capital requirements  and promote increased access to homeownership for creditworthy home  buyers.   The underlying bill that we are considering today would reverse  changes made by the Federal Housing Financing Agency to loan-level  price adjustments which are fees charged to originate a loan. The fee  matrix has not been updated since 2008 and is woefully out of date.   There was some controversy surrounding a debt-to-income ratio rule,  but that rule has already been repealed. The remaining fee matrix will  see fee increases only on wealthy individuals, people purchasing a  second home, or individuals who are purchasing an investment property  while reducing the cost for first-time buyers and low- to middle-income  families.   If my colleagues on the other side of the aisle agree that fees  should not be increased on those in the middle class who are already  struggling to make ends meet, then they should support my amendment.   It would ensure that this legislation would not be implemented until  the director certifies that it would not result in increased fees on  middle-class home buyers.   If the bill does what they are saying it does, then my amendment  would not create a barrier to implementation.   We must come together in a bipartisan way to address affordable  housing. I look forward to getting back to work with the chairman and  ranking member when we return in July.   Unfortunately, this legislation won't reduce costs for the middle  class and would tie the hands of the FHFA to address changing needs,  which is why this amendment is necessary.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Waters), who is the ranking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, I thank Ranking Member Waters for her remarks in support  of the amendment.   Once again, ensuring that all Americans have access to affordable  housing is a priority of mine and the Democrats on the Financial  Services Committee.   We must ensure that middle-class home buyers have access to our  housing market. Unfortunately, this legislation will not reduce costs  for the middle-class and first-time home buyers.   Not only are we focusing on a narrow subset of fee increases that are  supposed to target wealthy home buyers, individuals purchasing a second  home, and people buying investment homes, they are tying the hands of  the FHFA in moving forward in changing their fee structures on a more  regular basis to address changing needs.   This will make Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac less available to support  the housing market if there is a future fiscal crisis, and it only  threatens our housing market.   Once again, Mr. Chair, if you want to make sure that fees are not  increased for the middle class, then you should support my commonsense  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1030     Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
