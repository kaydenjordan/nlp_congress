 Madam Speaker, the Biden boom continues.   Last month, 678,000 jobs were created, and unemployment ticked down  to 3.8 percent--less than 4 percent. This follows the greatest year of  job growth in American history and the fastest economic growth in  nearly 40 years.   But it is not only the fact that new jobs were created, Madam  Speaker. It is also the fact that they are well-paying jobs--terrific  and impressive. These jobs have given Americans the dignity of a good  paycheck and much-needed financial breathing room.   On the public-health front, vaccination rates have increased 50  percent since last March, making it possible for 99.9 percent of our  schools to reopen and stay safely open. This is the result of strong  leadership in the White House, Congress' partnership, and the backing  of the American people.   Together, we are building a better America, and we are standing  strong with Ukraine.                            ____________________
