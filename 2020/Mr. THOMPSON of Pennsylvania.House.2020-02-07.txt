 Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, I had  the honor of meeting Gilbert Howland and Bob Passanisi at a reception  honoring Merrill's Marauders of World War II.   During the war, Gilbert and Bob volunteered for a mission that was  described as only dangerous and hazardous. These brave men, and  approximately 3,000 others, answered the call of duty and were deployed  to Northern Burma to fight behind enemy lines.   Only nine of these selfless volunteers are still alive today, and  they deserve to be honored for their bravery, their sacrifice, and  their love of country.   Pennsylvania had more Marauder volunteers than any other State, and  one volunteer, Russell Hamler, from Pittsburgh, is still with us today.   I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 906, the Merrill's Marauders  Congressional Gold Medal Act, introduced by Representative Pete King of  New York. I would like to encourage my colleagues to support this  bipartisan legislation and honor the legacy of Merrill's Marauders.                            ____________________
