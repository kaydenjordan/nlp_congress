 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment Nos.  946 and 947 be withdrawn.    Mr. President, I rise today to support the accession of  the Republic of North Macedonia to the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization and to encourage my Senate colleagues to vote in favor of  this protocol.   As we know, this past April marked the 70th anniversary of the NATO  alliance, the world's strongest and most successful political military  alliance in the history of the world.   In honor of this, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a  hearing to reflect on the alliance's successful past and to consider  its future. The Senate also passed and recognized NATO's many  accomplishments, and the resolution I authored, S. Res. 123, did so. I  am grateful to have another opportunity to demonstrate strong Senate  support for NATO by welcoming North Macedonia as a new member. As we  all know, this matter has been in the works for a long time.   NATO was founded by the United States and 11 other countries after  the shock of the Soviet blockade of Berlin. The Berlin airlift in 1948  made us realize the significant and real threat that the Soviet Union  posed to peace and prosperity. That conflict is far behind us, but NATO  has remained a critical piece of the framework that supports our  collective security.   NATO worked to help the United States in Afghanistan after the  attacks of September 11 and has ended genocides and maintained peace in  the Balkans. It has trained troops of the new Iraqi Government; it has  run air policing missions on Europe's eastern flank; it has helped end  the genocide in Darfur; and it provided assistance to the United States  after Hurricane Katrina. Most importantly, it has maintained a period  of unprecedented peace among the major European powers.   NATO has proven to be not only a military success but also a  political and economic one. NATO's security umbrella has provided the  kind of stable environment necessary for economic growth and  investment. Former Soviet bloc countries clamored for--and continue to  clamor for--NATO membership, not only for the protection against Russia  that they sought and seek but for the economic strength that membership  could foster.   U.S. trade with fellow NATO members remains vital to the U.S.  economy. NATO allies remain the largest  [[Page S5942]]  source of foreign, direct investment to the United States.   NATO is not perfect. It faces several challenges from within. First  is the need to invest more in defense. Those of us who serve on the  Foreign Relations Committee have for many, many years urged our friends  and colleagues--the majority of whom are not in compliance--about the  need to invest more in defense. But the number of allies spending 2  percent of their GDP on defense and 20 percent of their defense budget  on equipment has increased, adding more than $100 billion in European  defense spending. Eight allies currently meet this pledge, but it is  critical that all allies meet their Wales Summit commitment by 2024.   Second, NATO faces different security threats in different parts of  the alliance. Southern Europe is understandably worried about migrant  flows, while Eastern Europe faces the challenge of Russian military  buildup along its borders and domestic disinformation campaigns sowing  disorder by the Russians, just as we know Russia has attempted to do  here in the USA.   NATO has recently begun to think about security risks that China  poses to individual allies and the alliance as a whole.   Tackling all of these security risks will be challenging. But if NATO  allies commit to the alliance and needed reforms, NATO will be up to  the task.   Bringing a new member into the alliance also prompts us to reassess  the status of current members, and I feel compelled to address the  growing discussion regarding NATO allies that do not uphold the  democratic principles enshrined in the treaty's preamble.   I agree that there are NATO allies whose democracies are weakening  instead of strengthening and whose recent behavior does not demonstrate  a commitment to the alliance. To fix these issues, the alliance must  work from within.   There is no other alliance in the world like NATO. China and Russia  do not have allies. They have short-term, transactional-only partners  they have bullied into cooperation. NATO's strength and success come  from its commitment to the allies and to working through problems when  they arise.   On the expansion of NATO itself, which is what we are here to deal  with today, since 1949, NATO has expanded 7 times and now includes 29  countries. The entrance of North Macedonia will make 30. Adding a 30th  member during the alliance's 70th year sends a strong signal to our  fellow allies and enemies alike of the continued strength of this  alliance.   The U.S. Senate's consideration of North Macedonia as a member of  NATO is a piece of long-delayed and unfinished business. North  Macedonia was originally eligible for NATO entry in 2008 and was to  have joined the alliance alongside Croatia and Albania. As we know, an  ongoing dispute about North Macedonia's name prevented that from  happening. But the leaders of both North Macedonia and Greece  demonstrated great political courage in concluding the Prespa agreement  earlier this year, which has made today's decision possible.   The courage of Prime Minister Zaev and former Prime Minister Tsipras  to move the situation in the Balkans forward should be applauded. I met  with both leaders this year to thank and congratulate them.   Not only does Prespa pave the way forward for North Macedonia into  both NATO and the European Union, but it is an excellent example of how  other conflicts in the region could be resolved.   When the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held its hearing earlier  this year to consider North Macedonia's eligibility for alliance, the  committee heard strong and unequivocal testimony from top officials at  the Departments of State and Defense that North Macedonia would be a  strong partner to the allies and is ready for the requirements of NATO  membership.   After reviewing all relevant facts and holding hearings and meetings  with NATO, U.S., and North Macedonian officials for the better part of  this year, I am confident that North Macedonia is ready to fulfill its  NATO obligations and will benefit the alliance. It was ready in 2008  and is ready now. North Macedonia has a credible plan to meet the 2- percent spending requirement by 2024 and is already on track to spend  20 percent on equipment. It hosts the Krivolak training area, a top- notch Army training facility that has already been utilized by many  U.S. soldiers. Strategically, North Macedonia's membership would  provide NATO a direct land path from the Aegean to the Adriatic Sea,  facilitating military movements should they ever be needed. It will  continue to contribute soldiers to NATO's international mission as it  has done in Afghanistan and Iraq since 2002.   North Macedonia isn't perfect. As a small country with a young  democracy, it will certainly require further government reforms and  military modernization as have most new NATO allies. For example, it  will need to continue its transition from legacy Soviet equipment,  further reform its intelligence services, and above all, resist Russian  interference and continue to strengthen its anti-corruption efforts. I  urge North Macedonia to make these reforms and to continue on its  positive path inside the alliance with the help of its other democratic  NATO allies.   Expanding NATO to include North Macedonia is about what the country  will bring to the alliance and what the alliance brings to North  Macedonia, but it is not just about North Macedonia and its  qualifications for membership. Through its open-door policy, NATO has  promised membership to any European country that fulfills the  requirements of the alliance. Accepting North Macedonia as a new member  is a strong symbol and a message for European countries with NATO  aspirations that with hard work and perseverance, along with the  willingness to make tough reform decisions, they can provide a better  future for their people. As long as countries honor this commitment,  NATO's door should and will remain open.   It is important to note that this is a strong anti-Russian vote.  Standing here today, I can tell you the Russians are very much opposed  to this, not the least of which is exemplified by the way they resisted  this and pushed back against this as North Macedonia attempted to get  this done for their people.   I say to the Presiding Officer and colleagues, this day is a long  time in the making, and I am pleased it is finally here.   I urge all of my colleagues to support North Macedonia's bid to  become our newest NATO ally, No. 30, by voting in favor of this  protocol.   Thank you.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
