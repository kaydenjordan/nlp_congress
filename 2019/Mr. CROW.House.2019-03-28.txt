 Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Douglas County,  Colorado, being named the healthiest community in the United States by  U.S. News and World Report.   With all due respect to all of my colleagues in this body, there is  no State like Colorado. We are home to 300 days of sunshine, the Rocky  Mountains, and the best breweries and skiing in the country. And it  should be no surprise that it helped make us the seventh fastest  growing State in the country.   But this year we have added another accomplishment to our list:  community health.   With seven of America's top 25 healthiest communities in Colorado,  Douglas County tops that list. Home to countless walking trails,  community-building events, 63,000 acres of protected land, and  innovative infrastructure, Douglas County is truly a great place to  live.   Mr. Speaker, I welcome my colleagues to Douglas County and the rest  of our incredible district to see for themselves what makes The  Centennial State so great.                            ____________________
