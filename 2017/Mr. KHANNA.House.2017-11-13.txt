 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce for his work on this resolution,  Ranking Member Engel, and leadership on both sides: Majority Leader  McCarthy and the Speaker, and Minority Whip Hoyer and Leader Pelosi.   I think one thing we can all agree on, as Chairman Royce mentioned,  is the humanitarian crisis in Yemen. It is, arguably, the largest  humanitarian crisis currently in the world. There are almost a million  people suffering from cholera. This is a manmade crisis because of the  bombing of civilian targets that has made the treatment of water  impossible. Almost 7 million people face famine.    One hope out of this debate, the first one on the House floor on  Yemen, is that we will collectively demand humanitarian access to  people in Yemen. There is no justification for the ports to be closed.  There is no justification for the Sanaa Airport to be closed.   In The New York Times just this morning, there was an article stating  that chlorine medicine tablets are not being allowed in for people  suffering from cholera. That is not a Republican or Democratic issue.  That is an American issue. This Nation stands for human rights. We  stand for compassion and decency.   We should demand, collectively, that there is humanitarian access to  people who are suffering and that the ports and airports be opened.  This resolution calls for that, as has our U.N. Ambassador, Nikki  Haley, who made that clear.   The second part of this resolution, which I think goes a long way, is  the acknowledgment of our own role in the refueling of Saudi planes and  in the assistance of Saudi targeting.   The resolution explicitly acknowledges that the United States has  been engaged in the assistance of Saudi refueling and assisting the  Saudis in targeting. It explicitly also recognizes that the 2001  authorization of force that the United States Congress passed does not  apply to the Yemeni civil war.   Chairman Royce was absolutely correct that there is an al-Qaida  threat in Yemen to the United States. Our military, under the 2001  authorization of force, has the full authority to take counterterrorism  measures to deal with al-Qaida; but what our military is not authorized  to do is assist the Saudi Arabian regime in fighting the Houthis. In  many cases, the Saudis have aligned with al-Qaida to fight the Houthis,  undermining our very counterterrorism operations.   This resolution makes abundantly clear that we cannot be assisting  the Saudi regime in any of its fight with the Houthi regime. We have to  limit our involvement in Yemen to take on al-Qaida and to take on the  terrorists that threaten the United States.   The chairman and I have a disagreement about the War Powers  Resolution, but I will say that the negotiations were in good faith. As  I told some of the groups that were upset about the resolution, this is  a body of 435 Members. Every Member has their perspective. Ultimately,  we have to come to a consensus that moves the debate forward. In our  view, the War Powers Resolution does apply.   If I can quote from a plain reading of section 8(c), it says that,  for purposes of the War Powers Act: ``the term `introduction of the  United States Armed Forces' includes the assignment of members of such  Armed Forces to command, coordinate, participate in the movement of, or  accompany the regular or irregular military forces of any foreign  country or government. . . .''   I believe a plain reading of that statute suggests that refueling  Saudi planes constitutes coordination with a foreign government in a  foreign conflict. Frankly, it is precisely what the drafters of the  statute wanted to prevent after Vietnam. They wanted to prevent us from  getting entangled in foreign conflicts where our national security was  not at stake without a debate on the floor of Congress.   We currently have troops in harm's way in 13 countries around the  world. In many of those countries, we have not debated in the United  States what the mission is or whether we should be there or whether it  is making us any safer. That is certainly the case in Yemen.   We know that, to the extent Iran is involved with the Houthis, that  has been exacerbated because of the Saudi actions. It is debatable how  much Iran was involved in the first place, but what we do know is that  their minimal involvement--or, perhaps, now, greater involvement--was  triggered because of the Saudi escalation in bombing Yemen.   What is the United States' stake in a proxy war in Yemen? How is that  making us any safer?   If anything, it is creating another generation of Yemeni who will  view the United States with suspicion.   Nicholas Kristof wrote, in The New York Times: ``We Americans have  sometimes wondered how Russia can possibly be so Machiavellian as to  support its Syrian Government allies as they bomb and starve civilians.  Yet we're doing the same thing with Saudi Arabia, and it's just as  unconscionable when we're the ones complicit. . . .''   Our military has the highest standards. We take such great care in  minimizing civilian casualties. Why would we want to aid Saudi Arabia,  which doesn't share American values, which doesn't have the regard for  human life that we in the United States do? We are bearing the brunt of  their horrible actions.   So it is time, I believe, not just to stand up for humanitarian  access in Yemen, but to question whether the aid that we are providing  Saudi Arabia is making our country any safer and whether it is  consistent with American values.                                time  1715    Finally, I will say to those who argue that we need to support the  Saudis as a counter to Iran, there is no question that Iran has taken  actions that are not in the United States' interest, but I suggest that  we learn from our own history.   I remember, from history, the time when so many in our country said:  Let us arm Saddam Hussein to be a counter to Iran.   That didn't work out so well for the United States. It was our arms  that fueled Saddam Hussein's rise that led to two costly wars for the  United States.   My belief is the balance-of-power framework that has dictated our  foreign policy and the interventionism has not made us any safer. I  wish we would exercise more restraint in our foreign policy and return  to the traditions of John Quincy Adams who said:         We should not go overseas for monsters to destroy. These       are not conflicts where we can judge who is on the right       side; rather, we should be restrained, offer our hopes and       prayers to those fighting for freedom, offer our humanitarian       good will but not engage in interventionism abroad.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), who has been a real advocate and champion  for the War Powers Act in this institution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Nolan), who has often been a voice for diplomacy on  these issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Raskin), who is a constitutional law professor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Engel), the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee,  and I thank Mr. Engel for his leadership on this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank again Chairman Royce for working with us  to get to this resolution.   I want to acknowledge people on my own staff: Geo Saba, who really  led the efforts with Keane Bhatt from the Progressive Caucus; Chris  Schloesser and Pete Spiro. I also want to recognize Mira Resnick and  Mark Iozzi, who really helped with the language; of course, most of  all, the peace groups who brought this important cause to the Congress.   I know there is some disappointment in wanting to go further, and  people are very sincere in wanting to help civilians who literally face  famine and cholera, but I believe democracy is a messy and a long  process.   There are, as I mentioned earlier, 435 Members from different parts  of the country. I think today we have shown good faith in taking this  step forward, in highlighting the issue, in calling for humanitarian  assistance, in making sure that we curtail our support for Saudi  bombing.   I am confident that with the continued involvement of everyone in  this body, we will ultimately uphold our values and human rights, which  every person in this Chamber cares about.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
