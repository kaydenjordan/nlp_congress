 Mr. Speaker, three times President Biden  has had to deal with the Republican-manufactured default crisis around  raising the debt ceiling.   Since 1960, Congress has dealt with the debt ceiling 78 times. During  the Trump administration alone, it raised the debt ceiling three times  without holding the American economy and its people hostage.   President Biden is to be commended for being the adult in the room  and providing the leadership to prevent a catastrophic default that  hurts the U.S. standing in the global economy and Americans here at  home.   That does not excuse the behavior of the Republican majority in the  House, who seek to normalize hostage taking in an effort to hurt  programs that serve our people the most.   Mr. Speaker, I thank President Biden for protecting Social Security,  Medicare, and veterans' benefits. The trust the American people placed  in you has been validated again.
