 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 389.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], for Mr. Strange,       proposes an amendment numbered 389 to amendment No. 267.     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of  the amendment be dispensed with.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   (The amendment is printed in the Record of July 26, 2017, under  ``Text of Amendments.'')   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?   If no one yields time, time will be charged equally to both sides.   The majority whip.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until  5 p.m. be equally divided between the managers or their designees; that  at 5 p.m., the Senate vote in relation to the Strange amendment No.  389; further, that following disposition of the Strange amendment, the  Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3364, which was received  from the House; that there be 20 minutes of debate, equally divided  between the leaders or their designees; that following the use or  yielding back of that time, the bill be read a third time and the  Senate vote on passage of H.R. 3364; finally, that following  disposition of H.R. 3364, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 1628.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   Who yields time? If no one yields time, time will be charged equally  to both sides.   The Senator from Wyoming.    Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I need, up to  the limit that we have. This week, we have been debating why it is so  urgent for Congress to act on rescuing Americans from the collapsing  ObamaCare healthcare law.   We have heard from our colleagues across the aisle, questioning our  motives and our actions. Congress literally has millions upon millions  of reasons to replace and repeal this law. Hard-working American  families are begging us to provide them with some relief. These are  families who are forced to purchase high-deductible coverage insurance  and are facing thousands of dollars of out-of-pocket costs before their  coverage even begins. For them, the status quo--doing nothing--is not  an option.   For Senate Republicans, rescuing the American people from this law is  our only option. But the defenders of this law don't seem to grasp--or  are unwilling to admit--that ObamaCare is not affordable insurance and  has been a crisis-inducing failure. This is why Republicans are working  to fix the damage. Insurance markets are collapsing, premiums are  soaring, and healthcare choices are disappearing.   Americans expect the Congress and the President to address the  problem. With ObamaCare getting worse by the day, the time to act is  now. Just look at my home State of Wyoming, which is down to one  insurer in the individual market, both on and off the exchange. This  should be treated as the national scandal it is.   Some on the other side of the aisle like to focus on how many people  are insured under the law, but let's look at how many are not insured.  Almost 28 million Americans remain without insurance under ObamaCare  because they cannot afford insurance or no longer have access to it due  to ObamaCare's collapsing markets in their State or county. But  coverage numbers can be misleading because, even with insurance, many  hard-working families still cannot afford the care due to surging  deductibles. Insurance with sky-high deductibles is coverage in name  only.   When it comes to Medicaid coverage, what most news stories will not  tell you is that the newly insured gained coverage only through a  flawed Medicaid Program that is providing inferior quality and  threatening to bankrupt States across the Nation.   The Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, famously said that Congress  would have to pass the bill to find out what's in it. Well, Americans  soon discovered that President Obama and congressional Democrats  focused almost exclusively on coverage numbers boosted by government  mandates handed down from Washington, instead of true healthcare  reforms that might have actually provided better care, provided  affordable care. Obama's alleged coverage numbers are only on paper.  Coverage was their sacred cow, worshipped  [[Page S4386]]  above all others, because for President Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and Harry  Reid, coverage equaled healthcare.   Large coverage numbers touted by the Obama administration and  congressional Democrats have proved to have the healthcare utility of a  pet rock. Do you remember the pet rock? Millions of people purchased a  rock. It was very nicely packaged in a box. They would bring it home  and open it up and find a rock. Pet or not, it served no purpose other  than its name: a pet rock.   This is essentially how ObamaCare has worked, except people were  forced to purchase this marketing gimmick. Americans have purchased  insurance through ObamaCare exchanges with the promise of accessible  coverage. What they actually received, however, is coverage in name  only. It serves no healthcare purpose, and it doesn't work--merely  packaging a pet rock, if you will--and millions of Americans soon found  out. The high cost of insurance plans they forced people to buy made it  nearly impossible for them to pay for the coverage they signed up for,  or if they could afford coverage, they realized the care they were  paying for came with sky-high deductibles.    Congressional Democrats and President Obama focused almost  exclusively on the numbers of people now enrolled in ObamaCare and  relentlessly highlighted this information, which showed this law was  used mainly for public relations purposes at a large cost, as opposed  to an actual policy accomplishment. Instead, the reality is that  Americans who were able to get insurance were often plagued with  inadequate coverage, joined with enormous out-of-pocket costs. Senators  from across the country this week have been sharing stories about  families in their States who have had to forgo medical care, not  because they don't have insurance but because it was simply too  expensive to go to the doctor under the ObamaCare health plan.   For years, Republicans have pledged to repeal this disastrous law,  and this week we are working to address the broken promises of  ObamaCare to help ensure better care for each and every American. We  are doing this by working to stabilize collapsing insurance markets  that have left millions of Americans with no options, which will help  improve the affordability of health insurance and therefore healthcare.  Our goal is to preserve access to care for Americans with preexisting  conditions and to safeguard Medicaid for those who need it most by  giving States more flexibility, while ensuring that those who rely on  this program won't have the rug pulled out from under them. Most  importantly, Republicans hope to free the American people from onerous  ObamaCare mandates that require them to purchase insurance they don't  want or can't afford.   The President and Republicans in Congress last fall promised to  rescue the millions of American families suffering under ObamaCare,  which is what this bill will do.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.    Mr. President, we have loaned time before to the other side  of the aisle. If they would loan us some time so that the person  propounding this amendment could have a moment to explain his  amendment--they have agreed. So I yield time to the Senator from  Alabama.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.    Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 502, the Heller  amendment.  [[Page S4390]]    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi] for Mr. Heller,       proposes an amendment numbered 502 to amendment No. 267.     Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 502, the Heller  amendment.  [[Page S4390]]    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi] for Mr. Heller,       proposes an amendment numbered 502 to amendment No. 267.     I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment  be dispensed with.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The amendment is as follows:    (Purpose: To strike the sunset of the repeal of the tax on employee            health insurance premiums and health plan benefits)         Strike subsection (c) of section 109.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.    Mr. President, I heard somebody say that nobody was  listening. Well, I was listening. I have read a little bit from this  book before on the floor about healthcare. It is called ``Demystifying  ObamaCare'' by David G. Brown, who is a doctor. He does a marvelous job  of going through the history of how we got to where we are.   He says, maybe we need to answer the question: ``What does ObamaCare  do? What does ObamaCare purport to do? What does ObamaCare not do?''   He says that those answers are relatively simple.         ObamaCare is not a system of healthcare, nor is it a       healthcare reform. It is a system of healthcare control.        ObamaCare was supposed to significantly reduce healthcare       costs, but instead it has dramatically increased costs for       even those who are not directly within the ObamaCare program.        ObamaCare was supposed to increase access to care, but       instead it can actually reduce access (availability) of care.        ObamaCare reduces the effectiveness of the safety net       program, which is so very important to economically poor       Americans.        The quality of healthcare in America was derided when       ObamaCare was passed, but ObamaCare instead reduces the       quality of U.S. healthcare by reducing innovation.    And then he says:         ObamaCare removes a person's ability to make his own       decisions about his healthcare and that of his family. It       does so by removing the freedom to make those decisions.    He continues that what we are trying to do is correct those problems  and get back to a system of healthcare where the patient and the doctor  get to make some of the decisions, where we encourage more people to be  in the system, where we expand the use of HSAs, refundable tax credits,  where we also allow people to buy insurance across State lines.   We could put money back into State high-level risk pools. In fact, I  really like the invisible risk pools that allow people to continue to  pay what they were paying before, but to get the unique care.   We could ``pass Medicaid to the States in terms of `block grants' or  `per capita allotments,' '' and we could ``partially privatize Medicare  starting in 2024 with the premium support system.''   That is not in the bill; I am reading suggestions that he gives,  including ``cap the amount for tax exclusions in higher cost employer- based plans.''   Now, you need to know that in the proposals that we have been putting  out, in spite of what I have been hearing on this side, kids under 26  still get to be on their parents' insurance. We are not taking that  off. I keep hearing we are eliminating the preexisting conditions. We  are not. There hasn't been a proposal to eliminate the preexisting  conditions. So quit saying that. That is just fearmongering. As to  eliminating the lifetime caps on insurance, I haven't heard a proposal  for that. Also, allowing people to continue to be insured even if they  change jobs--that is what this guy wrote in the book, and I would like  for everybody to read it.    He said there are five factors that drive up healthcare costs. One is  taxes, another is mandates. Another is regulations. Another is lack of  competition and flexibility within the marketplace. As to the fifth  one, I don't know of anybody addressing yet, but it is the medical  liability system that encourages defensive medicine and drives the  costs up.   Seniors need to be protected. There needs to be an effective and  viable safety net system. Nobody is trying to work against that,  regardless of what you are hearing here.   I understand my time has expired. I have a lot more of the book I  would like to share, but I am not sure it is productive, anyway.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.    Mr. President, for 2\1/2\ days I have been listening to the  same rhetoric. It sounds like deja vu. For 2\1/2\ days I have been  listening to this. I have been giving extra time to the other side to  speak. I have been hoping out of that I would get one constructive  suggestion for what could be done with healthcare.   It has all been criticism. It has been criticism against all cuts.  Even tonight, after the bill was read here on the floor, I heard that  we were changing Social Security. We are not changing Social Security.  We can't change Social Security under the budget.   I heard we were changing Medicare. We are not changing Medicare. I am  not going to allow other time for that side. I will suggest that side  of the aisle go and read the bill. I think it would be a worthwhile  exercise.   There isn't even Medicaid in there. You have threatened about what  was going to be done about Medicaid. You talked about what was going to  be done with Medicaid, but it is not based on fact. So take a look at  the bill.   Another way that this is deja vu is I remember being here on  Christmas Eve when technical corrections were accepted from the other  side, but you went ahead and passed the bill. We mentioned things that  needed to be changed in the meantime, and we were told: No, no, that  doesn't have to be done. It just needs more time.   Well, we had more time, and there does need to be corrections. You  keep talking about how the Republicans have ruined the insurance  market. No, last October, the high rates came out for States across  this country that pointed out that healthcare was going down the tubes.  So something needed to be done. Something needed to be done, but  without getting constructive suggestions from the other side--just  criticism, saying ObamaCare is perfect, until this debate started, and  then I started hearing: It is not perfect. It is not perfect.   Well, where are the suggestions for making it as near perfect as  possible? We put up a lot of----   Ms. HEITKAMP addressed the Chair.    I am not asking that as a rhetorical question. Think about  it for a little while, come up with constructive suggestions.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.    No, I will not yield for a question.   When I feel like there is something constructive that is going to be  done around here--I remember that one of the Senators on the other side  of the aisle said: If you just take Medicaid out, I will be for it.  Well, Medicaid is not in this version so that ought to be some kind of  a commitment on it.   I keep referring to this book, which goes back to a lot of the  history that we have experienced around here. Here is what has  happened, and all of this is footnoted. I was reading at first the  footnotes. I didn't check out all the footnotes, but I did look to see  if they were footnoted.   Under the bill that we are trying to make some changes to, there have  been costs from new taxes. There are 21 taxes that have been included  in ObamaCare, but the most enormous one is the increased taxes on  healthcare companies that are then passed on to the public as higher  costs for insurance and pharmaceuticals.   I have heard that word ``pharmaceuticals'' thrown out a lot, and I  agree there are things that need to be changed there. I do remember the  pharmaceuticals joining in on the process of getting ObamaCare passed  because they did this little thing with the pharmaceutical Part D,  where there was this doughnut hole, and through the doughnut hole we  were hoping that people would switch to generic, but the pharmaceutical  companies said: No, no, no. If you will stick with the brand name, we  will cover you through the doughnut hole. Do you know why? Because  people, as they go through the doughnut hole, go beyond the doughnut  hole, and beyond the doughnut hole the Federal Government picks up the  cost of the name brands--the name brand pharmaceuticals. My insurance  commissioner was by to visit with me, and he mentioned that I have  twins in Wyoming, and they have a rare disease. There is a prescription  for it, and the prescription is costing $30,000 a year each. Well, that  is quite a bit of money, and the insurance company is picking that up.  Then the name brand pharmaceutical company bought out the generic one.  This was generics they were getting.   So now they have to have name brand because the generic isn't on the  market now. The cost? It is $1.6 million for each kid, each year.   That is why the companies, why the insurance companies are dropping  out  [[Page S4409]]  of the market. I mean, Wyoming is the least populated State in the  Nation, and an insurance company that is limited to Wyoming is going to  have to bear that $3.2 million worth of cost. So they are going to be  saying: We are the only ones covering Wyoming; maybe we shouldn't  provide insurance in Wyoming either. We lost the other two companies  already, and we are down to just one, but we have one, and they cover  all of the counties, unlike--it kind of surprised me that the rules  allow companies to just do some counties in some States.   Also, under ObamaCare, the insurance plans have to cover more.         This includes plans for the patient who may not want a       particular coverage but has to have this. [It comes under       the] essential health benefits, which are required through       HHS. This led to 5 million Americans losing their insurance       in the individual market.        Reduction of lower cost plans. High deductible [health       savings accounts] are very important in reducing costs for       individuals, families, and businesses. A RAND study in 2011       found that an HSA/high deductible plan (with a deductible of       at least $1,000) would reduce healthcare spending an average       of 14%. That savings incurred not only for patients but also       for employers and for total healthcare expenditures. These       more effective plans have been reduced under ObamaCare.    Most of the young people on my staff were getting HSAs, and the  reason they did is because they did a little bit of a calculation. They  did a little bit of financial literacy. They looked to see what the  plan was for the full coverage, and then they looked to see what an HSA  would cost, and they said: Well, gee, if I take the difference in the  cost between the regular insurance and the HSAs and I put that in one  of these savings accounts that can grow tax-free, in a maximum of 3  years, I will cover any deductible that I might have.   So they considered that to be good insurance and they got to make a  lot of their decisions.   But I don't think we want individuals making their decisions; that  appears to be how ObamaCare is constructed.   Then there is an increase in mandates, which is item No. 4.         Mandates existed before ObamaCare but have dramatically       increased with ObamaCare. It added mandates ``guaranteed       issue and community ratings.'' Both have been previously       tried in the states. Such mandates distort the marketplace       and drive up the cost of care. Policies within states that       had more mandates could actually have doubled the cost of       [their] premiums.        5. Increased costs by constricting hospitals and physician       systems. There has been consolidation with increased hospital       mergers by 50% compared with 2009. There has also been       movement of doctor's practices to connect with hospital       systems and both the contractures within the hospital system       and then physician's systems increased costs to the patients.       For example, group practice charges increased costs 18% to       20% and specialty care charges increased costs even more, 34%       after connecting the care with hospital systems. These       changes in care i.e. changing from private practice systems       into hospital-based systems have significantly driven up the       cost of care for the patients.        6. Medical legal liability reform has not been a part of       ObamaCare but is a significant driver of healthcare costs.    That is not considered in it, and it is considered to be about a 10  to 25 percent increase in total costs.    I think this is under my time.    I think this is under my time.    I think this is under my time.    I think the answer that I gave was perhaps your time might  be better spent taking a look at the bill because the conversations I  have heard here didn't necessarily speak to the bill.    They speak to the process, and I think we have already  covered that in 3 days.   Mrs. McCASKILL addressed the Chair.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.   Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, will he yield for a question about the  bill? He clearly knows more about it than we do because he has seen it  for much longer than we have.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.   Mrs. McCASKILL. He will not yield for a question?    I want to continue on with why we are trying to change  this.   The Galen Institute--Grace-Marie Turner wrote about 70 changes to  ObamaCare that occurred after it went into effect. And those changes  include the ``employer mandate delay, individual mandate delay,  preserved benefits to the military and VA, and reduction of funding to  agencies used for implementation of ObamaCare including IPAB, CO-OP's,  and IRS.''   Co-ops are an interesting thing. I was suggesting during the time  that ObamaCare was being considered that small business health plans  might make a real difference in costs for small businesses. Now, the  only thing I can see on small businesses in here is that if you are a  small business and you have over 50 employees, you have a problem.   I have people in Wyoming who come to me and say: I have this  business. It is working really well, and in the next town over--and  most of the towns aren't big enough to hold two of the same kind of  store--so in the next town over, I would like to put in the same kind  of shop.   My question to them is: How many employees do you have?   Most of them have said: Well, I have about 48 employees.   I said: How many will you need in the other store?   They said: Well, I hope to need the same amount of people.   I said: Well, the way this works, you are going to come under much  increased healthcare costs, and you better take a look at that before  you make your expansion.   So it has cost jobs that way.   Now, with small business insurance, with the small business health  plan--   Ms. WARREN addressed the Chair.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.   The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.    I will not yield. I would appreciate the same courtesy from  that side that I gave to you when you were doing your expositions about  healthcare, which included the things that I have mentioned that aren't  even in the bill. Our side has some time, and I would like to use some  of that time.   As I have been through this process for a long time now--I have been  on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee for the whole  time that I have been here, which is 20 years. Of course, it wasn't  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions when I first got here, but we  thought that that was a clever acronym: We are from the Federal  Government, and we are here to help you. There are a lot of people back  home who don't think we really help out much.   But, at any rate, the small business health plans, after three of us  who were in the Gang of 6 got thrown under the train or under the bus  or whatever it was, small business health plans were changed to co-ops,  and they were given a significant amount of money to work with, and  they haven't fared very well.   I will find the information about the co-ops here. Again, this isn't  stuff that I wrote; this is stuff somebody else wrote and footnoted and  sent to all of us. Again, the name of the book is ``Demystifying  ObamaCare: How to Achieve Healthcare Reform.'' It gives some good  suggestions.   He does point out that ``ObamaCare is not a system of healthcare, nor  is it  [[Page S4410]]  healthcare reform. It is a system of healthcare control.''   People are told what they are going to do.         ObamaCare was supposed to significantly reduce healthcare       costs, but instead it has dramatically increased costs for       even those who are not directly within the ObamaCare program.       ObamaCare was supposed to increase access to care, but       instead it actually reduced access to the availability to       care. ObamaCare reduces the effectiveness of the safety net       program, which is so very important economically for       Americans.    Under an amendment that I would like to see is one that would have  covered the people who make a living of under $11,000--because with  $11,000, you can't get insurance. They don't get subsidies; they are  just left out in the cold. It is one of the corrections that should  have been made and wasn't made. ObamaCare does reduce the effectiveness  of the safety net program, which is important to economically poor  Americans.   There are a lot of people out there in the States, several thousand  in my State, who can't get insurance under that.         The quality of healthcare in America was derided when       ObamaCare was passed, but ObamaCare instead reduces the       quality of U.S. healthcare by reducing innovation, and it       removes a person's ability to make his own decisions about       his healthcare and that of his family, and it does so by       removing the freedom to make those decisions by putting so       many qualifications on it.    Again, I repeat that we haven't done anything to take people off of  their policy if they are under their parents' policy if they are under  the age of 26.   We haven't done anything to deny patients who have preexisting  conditions. I have heard that for 3 days.   We haven't eliminated the lifetime caps on insurance. I have heard  that for weeks.   So there are things that need to be done. They could be done. We have  tried to do it in this bill, again, without constructive suggestions  from the other side. For any recognition that there was any problem  that ought to be solved, we have gone ahead. It is not my choice for  the mechanism that would be used; it is the mechanism that was chosen  by leadership and it falls to them. One of the things that makes this  difficult is it is a budget reconciliation, so there are things that  have to be written in a budget form in order to comply. That limits  some of the things that I would have liked to have done that I think  would have made quite a difference. And I think there would have been  some things the other side might have joined on and been excited about  too. But, again, we are limited by the mechanism that we have here, and  there is no indication that----    Mr. President, I have heard so many times that the other  side would love to be cooperative, but I have yet to see cooperation. I  am not going to take questions; I am going to--I really would  appreciate it if you would just take some time to look at the bill. I  have heard the rhetoric.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.    Yes, and I have an hour, whether I use it or not. As I  said, for the past few days I have been yielding time to the other  side. I haven't gotten much satisfaction out of that. I have listened  for the last hour, and I didn't get any satisfaction out of that  either. I did sit through all of it. I did listen to it. Again, it is  complaints about the process, but not constructive suggestions on what  could be done.   There are taxes, mandates, regulations, lack of competition in the  marketplace, increasing costs. When I travel across Wyoming, I have  people who have come up to me and they say: My insurance premium is  bigger than my house payment, and it is growing.   And they said: If something happens to us, my deductible is bigger  than my year's premium. That shouldn't happen in America, but that is  where we are. Those aren't isolated cases; those are a lot of cases.  That is the situation we find ourselves in. We are not trying to hurt  anybody; we are trying to fix some of these things.   As I said, for 8 years, every time there has been a waiver--that is  part of that thing that I mentioned about the 70 changes to ObamaCare  so far--a lot of those were in the way of waivers.   Every time there was a waiver, I said: Why are we waiving this? Why  don't we just fix it?   I was told: It is not broke; it just needs more time.   Well, it has had more time. Last year--this was before the election,  so you can't blame us. We had no idea who was going to be the  President. We had no idea who was going to be in the majority. Last  October, people started pulling out of insurance markets, and rates  increased dramatically. You can't put that blame on us.    No.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.    No.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.    Mr. President, I think what we have is a motion to commit  and the right for the other side to do other amendments. I would hope  that some of them would be constructive, but I am not expecting that.  As I said, I have been listening for 3 days and actually listening a  lot longer before that time.   I could talk about some of the things we can learn from ObamaCare,  because we should. We can learn that decisions have to be made by the  patients and not by the bureaucrats for the government. There are some  key examples of when the government starts making those decisions. I  don't have to pick on ObamaCare for it necessarily; the VA has had a  few problems, and I am sure all of you have been working casework on  what the VA has been doing. That is where the government and the  bureaucrats are making decisions. We have been through some enormous  times on that. That is why we did the Choice Act. And the Choice Act  had a lot of problems. That is government healthcare.   People say: Well, Choice got to go outside of the government.   That is not quite true. I think the folks with the VA picked the  companies you have to go through for healthcare, and when they did,  they didn't want it to be efficient. They wanted as much of it as  possible to come back to the VA. I am sure all of us, as we travel  across our States, are running into people who are having problems with  providers not getting paid or not being able to get their appointments.  If you check with the providers, you find out what kind of a terrible  process they have to go through to get paid. That is government  healthcare.   In my State, I provide the VA with a list every week of the new cases  I have of people who are not getting care. That shouldn't happen. But  they told me when I first inquired: Well, there are only two doctors  who haven't been paid.   I said: That is impossible. There are more than two doctors in my own  town who haven't been paid, and there are a lot of towns in Wyoming-- when I go to them, I hear that they are not paid.   They said: One was not paid for 30 days, and one wasn't paid for 45  days.   I said: Well, I don't know why either one wasn't paid before those  kinds of deadlines.   But I can tell you there are a lot more problems than that.   So if we are thinking about going to a Federal healthcare--and I  guess we are not because we had that vote a little bit earlier on  whether we would have a single-payer system. I was amazed at the number  of people who chose not to vote on that. At any rate, I don't think  that is where America wants to go. I have had some people ask me about  that. I have given them some suggestions on where to check to see what  kind of care they would get under that, and they have come back  [[Page S4411]]  to me and said: I don't think that is where we want to go.   I know the other side of the aisle has wanted to go that way for a  long time. When I first got here, Phil Gramm was one of my mentors, and  I really appreciated all of his advice in so many areas. One of the  things he said to me was, you have to watch out for healthcare because  where the Democrats want to go is to single-payer healthcare. In other  words, they don't care who drives the train as long as it wrecks.   So I look back on ObamaCare and I say: Man, this was 18, 19, 20 years  ago that he told me this. Is that where ObamaCare is supposed to go, to  wreck the train so we can go to single-payer? I don't think so, but I  think we are on the way to a train wreck, and I am not hearing a lot of  disagreement about the train wreck. I am hearing some disagreement  about the amount of calamity in the train wreck but not on whether  there is going to be a train wreck.   There are a number of things we could do to take care of the costs  that have gone up under this. That can be confronted within a free  market as opposed to the government-run, government-controlled market  we are under now. One of them is to reduce the tax burden. I did notice  that I have a lot of people in Wyoming--again, we are one of the  smallest or least populated in the Nation. We are big in land mass, but  we are small in population--In Wyoming, $5.6 million was collected from  people for fines for not having the adequate healthcare.   Those were people who said: Wait a minute, I have to spend so much on  my healthcare and then a high deductible that I am never going to get  anything out of it. So when I calculate the annual cost, the $1,700  that I have to pay as the fine--or $1,500, somewhere in that range--is  cheaper than paying for all those premiums and then a deductible if  anything ever happens to me.   These are real people I am talking about.    I allowed the other side to have their hour. I expect to  have this hour, even if some of it is in silence.   I mentioned reducing the tax burden.   We could also eliminate some regulations. We really need to take a  look at some of those regulations within the essential health benefits  and see if everybody needs all of them or if there are some they would  opt out of, given the opportunity, because they know they will never  need them. There are a lot of examples of that.   We could eliminate the mandates from the Federal and State. We have  the elimination of the Federal mandates in this bill, both the  individual mandate and the employer mandate.   We could also increase competition within the marketplace by  increasing flexibility. Some of these things we can't do, particularly  to the level we would like to do them, but we could have more  competition if we could increase the number of insurance companies.  Competition makes a difference.   I have had a number of people, though, who have suggested to me that  the biggest thing we could do would be to pass the medical liability  reform because doctors are practicing defensive medicine, which drives  up the cost, so that if they are ever in a lawsuit, they can prove they  did every possible thing that they could ever imagine or that anybody  could raise as an issue. There is a cost to doing that. One of the  suggestions----    I will not.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator declines to yield.    It has been suggested that the government could have an  appropriate role in healthcare by maybe using advanceable, refundable  credits to prevent any lapse in coverage. One of the problems we have  right now is that people can wait until they have something terrible  happen to them, and they can sign up for insurance on the way to the  hospital--you can't pay when you are in the ambulance, and you can't  pay when you are getting treatment, and you can't pay when you are  getting rehab--and when they are done, they drop out of it. It is hard  for an insurance company to figure in the cost of something they are  not going to get paid for at all.   There have been a number of suggestions. I don't know whether they  are any good. I could throw them out. One of them is that if you don't  keep continuous coverage, you should have to pick up your own expenses  for the first 6 months. That would encourage people to have continuous  coverage. It is just one possible suggestion.   There is a role for government within this setting, and that is  requiring some transparency within the system, encouraging the  development of new healthcare competition, prevention of collusion  between healthcare companies, and having prices posted.   I remember a hearing we had once--    I will not. You got your hour; it is my hour.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.   The Senator declines to yield.   The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.    When I was chairman or when Senator Kennedy was chairman of  the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, we switched from  doing hearings to doing roundtables. That was an interesting experience  too. Instead of having all of the witnesses except one picked by the  majority and the other one picked by the minority and then everybody  coming up to beat up on the person who was in the opposite field, we  went to roundtables.   What you do with a roundtable is you pick 2 or 6 or 8 or 10 people  who are actually knowledgeable in that field, who have actually done  something, who have had their hands on what we were talking about.   I remember the first one. One of the questions at the end was by  Senator Kennedy, and he asked the witnesses that he and I had selected.  This wasn't me selecting; this was a joint effort selecting them. He  said: What do you think about single-payer insurance? As they went  around, there was only one out of 10 people who said: Well, it might be  a good idea, but we probably ought to take a look at it. The rest of  them said: It won't work in America. We are already used to something  different.   When the hearing was over, Senator Kennedy said to me: You know, I  think these roundtables are a good idea. I think it is a good thing to  kind of hear about what the people are actually experiencing out there  before we write the bill.   Well, we did a lot of healthcare roundtables. One of the witnesses  was from Safeway. Safeway had been able to hold their costs level and  started to bring them down. Of course, we were interested in anybody  who could hold healthcare costs level or bring them down. The way they  had done that was to find out what the costs of different procedures  were in the area where they had stores. After they knew what the cost  of the procedure was, they could take the median price for whatever it  was, and if the people in their store would take the median price, it  didn't cost them anything. If they went above the median price, they  had to pay the difference. If they went below the median price, they  got the difference. So they were actually paying attention, using some  financial literacy in any of the treatments they needed to get, and  they appreciated that their company had done this research for them in  advance so they could have some kind of an idea of what the market  held. He estimated that if they were able to increase the flexibility  they had with this, they could bring down their costs by about 5 to 7  percent a year.   I worked on a 10-step plan--in conjunction with Senator Kennedy on a  lot of it--and talked about it across the country and particularly  across Wyoming. It would have been 10 steps to get healthcare for  everyone without mandates but with incentives.   Mr. VAN HOLLEN addressed the Chair.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. I wonder if the Senator would yield for a question.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.  [[Page S4412]]        Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?    The Senator will not yield.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator declines to yield.   The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.    Earlier I mentioned the CO-OPS. I would have preferred the  small business health plans. I didn't think the CO-OPS would work.         CO-OPS were included in ACA.        These plans were meant to provide competition with existing       health insurance companies.    It was an opportunity to set up insurance companies that actually  were funded.         The CO-OPS were given $2.4 billion in ``federal loans.''        The CO-OPS were prohibited from having former healthcare       executives with managerial or accrual experience.        The CO-OPS were conceived to drive down the premiums by       providing competition and underselling the cost for policies.        More than half the 23 CO-OPS went out of business in 2015,       but 8 of the remaining 11 CO-OPS were in financial trouble.        The number of CO-OPS is now down to 7 (4 of the prior CO-      OPS went bankrupt in 2016).        Examples of how the CO-OPS that have failed and have cost       the taxpayers. In 2015 alone, there was a huge amount of       money lost and also cost the enrollees in the CO-OPS their       insurance.        New York Health Republic, 23,000 policies lost, $57 million       dollars lost in the first half of 2015.        Iowan and Nebraska CO-Opportunity Health, 120,000 policies       canceled, $146 million dollars lost. Arizona CO-OP, 59,000       enrollees lost their insurance, $90 million dollars lost.       Colorado CO-OP, 89,000 enrollees insurance canceled, $72       million dollars lost.    Ms. HASSAN addressed the Chair.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.   The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.    No.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not yield.   The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.    No.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not yield.   The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.    Continuing:         The [Health and Human Services] and administration       officials knew that the CO-OPS were at risk even before they       received their first ``loan'' in 2014. Senator Rob Portman,       Chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on       Investigations, said that the HHS knew of serious problems       concerning the failed CO-OPS enrollment strategies, pricing       and financial management before the department ever approved       their initial loans.        Dr. Mandy Cohen, the director of the CMS, testified before       a House subcommittee that 8 of the 11 remaining CO-OP       companies were in serious financial difficulty and receiving       ``enhanced oversight'' and ``corrective action.'' Dr. Cohen       did not explain what that ``corrective action'' or ``enhanced       oversight'' consisted of nor could she indicate the       enrollment figures and the possibility of financial survival       for the CO-OPS that were being monitored.        Also, 4 more CO-OPS have failed over the first half of       2016, leaving only 7 remaining.    I am not sure what today's number is.         The HHS continued to make these federal loans though they       knew the CO-OPS were failing.    Under the small business health plans, there is no requirement to  have the Federal Government fund it unless we want to fund more  oversight. I am not opposed to that either.         So What are the American People Think of This?        There has been greater than $1 billion dollar loss of       taxpayer money to CO-OPS that have gone bankrupt.        Only 7 of the initial 23 CO-OPS remain in business.        The CO-OPS were constructed as a way of providing       competition against existing companies, however in order to       do that they underpriced their products. No company can       survive if they take in less than what they put out in       services and understandably, the majority of CO-OPS have gone       out of business.    That could be something to do with their being prohibited from having  former healthcare executives with managerial and accrual experience.         This was known by the HHS before the first ``federal       loans'' had ever been approved.        Over 800,000 people have lost their insurance because the       CO-OPS have gone out of business and there are more to come.        It speaks to the fact that the HHS and ObamaCare       Administration had very little regard for the American       taxpayer and the American people.        The disturbing question is whether any of the taxpayer's       money will be returned.    I did say those were loans, and there aren't many left that can pay  back the loans, which is a little bit of a difficulty.   Of course we did hear that ObamaCare was supposed to bend the cost  curve down. I ought to point out some facts on that as well.         From 2009 to 2012 healthcare, spending grew less than 4       percent, as spending started increasing dramatically in the       first quarter of 2014. This was the start of the       implementation of the legislation. Subsequent healthcare       spending from 2015 showed a 6.8% rise. In 2016, it is       estimated to increase to 6.5% spending growth.    We know from last year, which isn't included in this, that it started  doubling at that point.         Deductibles both inside and outside ObamaCare exchanges       have increased enormously and will continue to increase.       Healthcare costs are now increasing more than inflation.        Why has spending increased? There has been increased       utilization services. The increased healthcare spending thus       led to higher insurance costs. A particular cause of       increased spending related to ObamaCare is a marked increase       in deductibles and health insurance premiums in the ObamaCare       exchanges. Additionally, because of the increased number of       patients with Medicaid expansion there have been increased       costs. Healthcare costs [will] continue to rise.        The total healthcare spending for 2016 is to increase to       over $3 trillion dollars.    I will get some updated numbers on that.         Total healthcare spending . . . rate of spending increase.        Medicaid increased: 11%        Medicare increased: 5.5%        Private insurance spending increased: 4.4%.    If I would have known that Medicare was going to be mentioned, even  though it is not in the bill, I would have shown the little chart that  I have, which shows how much revenue we get for different mandatory  spending that we have.         All of those mandatory spendings are in a little bit of       trouble because the revenue streams to take care of them are       not sufficient. At one point, they were sufficient in some of       them, and the federal government doesn't have any place to       park cash. The federal government puts bonds in a drawer and       spends the cash. That is kind of double dipping because there       is nothing there for later. There is a Social Security trust       fund.    I have learned from trust funds that you have to find money to put in  before you can take money out. I never saw a trust fund that operated  that way until I got here. We have some crises that are coming up. We  are going to compound healthcare because for Federal pensions, we  really don't put any money away for them. We require businesses to put  it away, and we have had some other suggestions. I have some small  pension plans I would like people to look at, some pooling for that,  which I think would encourage more people to have pension plans in  small business.         But the cost of administration is extremely high unless       they can share in that. All of them would require that there       be money put away to be able to cover with reasonable growth       in the interest of the fund so that what was promised could       be taken care of.    In 2006, Senator Kennedy and I worked on saving some pension plans,  trying to make sure that promises that were made could be met. We did a  pension bill that needs to be redone again, particularly for some  sectors of the pension.         The private sector is required to put away money. When the       market goes down, it increases dramatically the amount of       money that they need to put in and creates some problems for       business.    The point I am making is that the Federal Government doesn't do that  with any excess funds we get. I don't care if it is in healthcare or  Social Security or where it is, those excess funds are allowed to be  spent with bonds put in a drawer, with the promise that the full faith  and credit of the Federal Government will cover them. I don't know how  many people at home believe that, but that is what it is.   How has the battle for the quality of healthcare fared? This gets  covered in this book too.   Here is a little bit on the quality of healthcare and outcomes.         The infant mortality rate . . . has been used by       politicians and others in political debate to describe the       inferiority of the U.S. healthcare [system]. U.S. ranked only       30th in the world (and the neonatal mortality below that).       When you look at this data, however, you find a very       different picture. The United States followed the World       Health Organization definition that a live birth is any       infant  [[Page S4413]]       that shows any sign of life, i.e. a baby that takes a single       breath or has a heartbeat. . . . Other countries however       including both developed and underdeveloped countries use       different standards. The definition of ``live births'' varies       between different countries. For example, in Switzerland a       newborn has to be 30 cm. long to be considered a live birth.       In Belgium and France, infants have to be at least 26 weeks       to be considered as live births. Infants less than 24 weeks       gestational age are excluded from registries of live birth in       multiple other countries including Japan and Hong Kong. In       Canada, Germany, and Austria, the newborns weighing less than       500 grams are not considered viable and are excluded from the       infant mortality rates.    What I am saying is, there are games that can be done with that, with  the performance ratings, with the life expectancy data, with the  Commonwealth Fund. All of these things are issues that we are  embarrassed about and things we ought to be working on, things we ought  to improve, things we ought to help with our country.   We need to be looking at all of those outcomes--the cancer outcomes,  the cardiac disease outcomes, the stroke outcomes, the chronic illness  outcomes, the hypertension outcomes, the diabetes and cholesterol  outcomes.         We know that the earlier and more effective there is       treatment of the disease, the better treatment of the disease       for chronic disease, the better the results are. The more       accessible and better technology there is, the more access to       specialty care for early diagnosis and treatment, better       preventive screening, and the inventiveness of the American       people.    I think it was today--my days blend together these days with this  healthcare that we are working on. I was visited by a couple of young  people from Wyoming who have diabetes. We have put some additional  money into research. We, as a Senate, don't say exactly where that  money has to go because we shouldn't be kicking the tires on the  different diseases and figuring that out. I worry about where we might  put the money, if that were the case, because we are affected  differently than what our constituents are.   Both of these young people were on a pump, and I have gotten to meet  Dean Kamen who invented the pump. It is kind of an interesting story.  Of course, that wasn't his first medical invention. His first medical  invention was actually when he was a junior in high school and his  brother was doing a residency in a hospital that handled transplants  for infants. They were mentioning some devices similar to a needle in  which medicine can evidently go through. This was needed for transplant  of a kidney. He was lamenting they didn't have that capability. He went  down to the basement and figured out how to make one of those. That was  his first patent. You probably know him more for the patents of the  Segway.    After he made some money, he got to experiment with some different  things. One of them is that mobile thing that police use and shopping  centers use and tourists use where you ride around on a Segway. He  built that for a specific medical purpose, which was to figure out a  way to have a wheelchair that could climb stairs. Instead of building a  ramp and being limited where there wasn't a ramp, he figured out a  wheelchair that could climb stairs. It could do a number of other  things too. For instance, if the person in a wheelchair went to a  cocktail party, they could rotate the wheels up so they were at  standing level to everybody else.   He had a lot of problems getting it through FDA. He finally got it  through FDA, then was told there are other wheelchairs that are less  expensive so we are not going to pay for that. I think another company  is coming back in to do that. It is an outstanding experience to sit in  a wheelchair and go downstairs with it.   He worked on this diabetic pump. It is interesting how he got into  the diabetic pump. He was told pregnant women who are on insulin, if  they take the insulin doses, they wind up often with babies that have a  bigger head, which makes the delivery a bit more difficult. Everything  changes so the head becomes normal after a period of time, but it is a  problem at childbirth. He thought, what if we gave them a dose of  insulin over a longer period of time; would that have an effect on the  infant? So he invented a machine which started out being a fairly good- sized machine, but it worked. If they got their insulin over a slow  period of time, but sufficient insulin, the baby didn't have the larger  head.   Well, this man is a businessman. He said: That is good. That will  provide part of a market, but there ought to be a bigger market for it.  He said: I wonder if men would have any benefit from having a diabetic  pump? So he was able to have a trial and found out that also worked. He  worked it down to be smaller and smaller and is working on other kinds  of inventions that will do better things.   We need to keep putting things into innovation. I said a lot of  times: If there is a problem in America and we put on a small  incentive, there will be somebody who will figure out how to turn that  into something very useful.   Mr. President, I think I have been requested by Senator Schumer to  have 2 minutes, and to have 5 more minutes by UC perhaps for others,  but I would ask that at the end, Senator Cornyn be allowed 2 minutes  before the vote.

Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 3001 of S. Con. Res. 3, the  concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2017, allows the  chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations,  aggregates, and levels in the budget resolution for legislation related  to healthcare reform. The authority to adjust is contingent on the  legislation not increasing the deficit over the period of the total of  fiscal years 2017 to 2026.   I find that amendment No. 667 fulfills the conditions of deficit  neutrality found in section 3001 of S. Con. Res. 3. Accordingly, I am  revising the allocations to the Committee on Finance, the Committee on  Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, HELP and the budgetary  aggregates to account for the budget effects of the amendment. I am  also adjusting the unassigned to committee savings levels in the budget  resolution to reflect that while there are savings in the amendment  attributable to both the HELP and Finance Committees, the Congressional  Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation are unable to produce  unique estimates for each provision due to interactions and other  effects that are estimated simultaneously.   This adjustment supersedes the adjustment I previously made for the  processing of amendment No. 267. This adjustment applies while this  amendment is under consideration. Should the amendment be withdrawn,  fail, or lose its pending status, this adjustment will be null and void  and the adjustment for amendment No. 267 shall remain active.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record. --   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record as follows:               BUDGET AGGREGATES--BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAYS   (Pursuant to Section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and  Section 3001 of S.
