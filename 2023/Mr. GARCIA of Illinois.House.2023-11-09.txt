 Madam Speaker, as we approach Veterans Day, I  rise to honor the memory of Philip Ayala, Sr., who passed away just  over a year ago.   Phil, as his family and friends called him, was a beloved neighbor in  Berwyn, Illinois.   When he was just 17 years old, Phil enlisted in the U.S. Army and  honorably served our country in Vietnam.   Phil kept our community safe as a Cook County deputy sheriff and  fought to make the police force more diverse through his work with  Congressman Ralph Metcalfe and the Concerned Citizens for Police  Reform.  [[Page H5666]]    Phil cofounded El Centro de la Causa, an agency that worked with  Mexican-American youth and the Spanish-speaking population in the  1970s.   In his three decades at El Centro, Phil provided support and built  the infrastructure that led to the founding of so many other  organizations in the community.   For Phil, the ultimate goal was to give back to the community.  Whether it was meeting with President Carter at the White House  alongside Latino leaders or serving as a member of the U.S. Commission  on Civil Rights or through his work in our neighborhoods, Phil  fulfilled the goal with every fiber in his being.    Madam Speaker, I thank Phil for his service. May he rest in peace.                            ____________________
