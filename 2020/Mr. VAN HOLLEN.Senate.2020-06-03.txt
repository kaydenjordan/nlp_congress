 Mr. President, after Monday's shameful display by the  Secretary of Defense, I voted against the President's nominees to be  Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy and Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Strategy, Plans, and Capabilities.   The language of war has no place on American streets in the face of  peaceful protests. Secretary Esper's dangerous comment that the  military needs to ``dominate the battlespace''--referring to American  cities--threatened the lives of American citizens exercising their  constitutional rights. His willingness to accompany the President to a  photo-op after gassing peaceful protesters underscores the moral rot in  the Department's leadership.   At this time, I have lost confidence that any nominee can be trusted  to stand up to the President's attempts to weaponize the Defense  Department for his personal and political ends. For that reason, I  voted against his nominees in the Department.                            ____________________
