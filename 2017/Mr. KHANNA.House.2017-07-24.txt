 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Walz.   I want to commend Ranking Member Walz and Chairman Roe for this  extraordinary piece of legislation that invests in the education of our  veterans. I also am pleased that you included Majority Leader  McCarthy's legislation of which I was a proud original cosponsor, the  VET TEC Act. That will allow veterans, for the first time, to take  technology courses and learn some of the skills that are going to be  needed for the 21st century economy.   It is no surprise that I read that the majority leader got this idea  from his son, who spent a lot of time out in Silicon Valley and is well  regarded. It is really heartening to see this House come together with  the chairman's and ranking member's leadership on the jobs of the 21st  century and making sure our veterans have opportunities for them.
