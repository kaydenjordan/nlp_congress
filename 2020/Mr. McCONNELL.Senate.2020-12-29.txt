 Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the veto  message on H.R. 6395 received from the House be considered as having  been read, spread in full upon the Journal, and be printed in the  Record.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, Congress has returned to work this  week to enact the 60th annual National Defense Authorization Act into  law. Yesterday, a bipartisan supermajority in the House voted to  reapprove the conference report of this must-pass legislation. Today,  the Senate will set up a final vote for tomorrow, Wednesday, for this  Chamber to follow suit. Soon, this important legislation will be passed  into law.   President Trump has rightly noted this year's Defense bill does not  contain every provision we Republicans would have wanted. I am  confident our Democrat colleagues feel the same way, but that is the  case every year.   Yet for 59 consecutive years and counting, Washington has put our  differences aside, found common ground, and passed the annual Defense  bill. Not once in six decades has a Congress let its differences  prevent it from completing this work for our national security and our  men and women who wear the uniform.   This year's NDAA will continue our momentum in rebuilding and  modernizing our Armed Forces. It will authorize the personnel,  equipment, tools, and training we need to reinforce the national  defense strategy and to deter great-power rivals like China and Russia.  It will cement our advantage on the seas, on land, in the air, in cyber  space, and in space. The bill will help us continue to recruit, retain,  and support the men and women who keep us safe. It provides a pay raise  for the troops, improvements for military housing, childcare, and more.   For the brave men and women of the United States and our Armed  Forces, failure is simply not an option. So when it is our turn in  Congress to have their backs, failure is not an option either.   I would urge my colleagues to support this legislation one more time  when we vote tomorrow.                                 Coronavirus     On Sunday, President Trump signed into law another  bipartisan rescue package that will provide major support to American  families through what we hope will be the home stretch of our fight  with the coronavirus.   Congressional Republicans and congressional Democrats and President  Trump's senior team had all worked together to pass hundreds of  billions more dollars of urgent assistance to the people who need it  most.   This new law will set up a targeted second round of the Paycheck  Protection Program to save jobs. It will renew and continue Federal  programs that helped laid-off workers endure this crisis. It will send  more cash to households. It will invest billions in vaccine  distribution so the success of Operation Warp Speed kills this pandemic  as fast as possible, and much more.   This bipartisan compromise was our shot at getting help to working  families on the urgent timeline that they need.   Once again, I want to applaud President Trump for signing the bill  and getting this much needed assistance into the pipeline.   During this process, the President highlighted three additional  issues of national significance, which he would like to see Congress  tackle together. First, as he explained, the President would like  further direct financial support for American households. Second is the  growing willingness on both sides of the aisle to at least reexamine  the special legal protections afforded to technology companies under  section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, including the ways that  benefit some of the most prosperous, most powerful ``Big Tech'' firms.  And the third subject--since every American, regardless of their  politics, should feel the integrity of our democracy beyond reproach-- is exploring further ways to protect the sanctity of America's ballots,  while continuing to respect the Federal Government's limited role in  standing behind State and local elections authorities who actually run  elections.   Those are the three important subjects the President has linked  together.   This week, the Senate will begin a process to bring these three  priorities into focus                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3985     Madam President, I move to proceed to Calendar No.  480, S. 3985.    I ask unanimous consent that following leader remarks  on Wednesday, December 30, the time until 1:15 be equally divided  between proponents and opponents of the bill, with opponent time being  controlled by Senator Paul or his designee; further, that upon the use  or yielding back of that time, the Senate vote on passage of the bill,  the objections of the President to the contrary notwithstanding;  finally, if passed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and  laid upon  [[Page S7957]]  the table with no intervening action or debate.    I object    I object.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text  of the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 5085         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
