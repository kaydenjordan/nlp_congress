 Madam Speaker, I have a message to send to all  Americans: Socialism is not winning in America.   We saw earlier this week Democrats lost their progressive, far-left  momentum among voters across the country. Turns out, the Democrats'  policies of defunding the police, removing parents from their  children's education, raising taxes, and expanding government control  are not a winning message for America.   Republicans are committed to opening America back up for business,  securing the southern border, creating strong energy independence,  addressing our national debt, and supporting Main Street America  through lower taxes and less regulation.   This week, despite the writing on the wall, Democrats and President  Biden are pushing their massive, far-left, socialist reconciliation  package that will  [[Page H6212]]  cost trillions of dollars to taxpayers for years to come.   With over 2,000 pages of text, Speaker Pelosi is conducting closed- door negotiations, bypassing the Congressional Budget Office report and  ramming through this legislation without full transparency on the true  cost and economic impact this would have for the American people.   Americans are rejecting socialism at every corner. The bottom line:  It is a loser.   In God We Trust.                            ____________________
