 Mr. President, first, while he is still on the floor, let  me say that I agree with the senior Senator from Vermont. If you don't  want to vote, you probably ought to look for another line of work.  Congress is a bad place to come if you don't want to actually vote and  be on record                            ____________________     Mr. President, as America waits for the results of the  2020 election to be certified in a couple of weeks, former Vice  President Joe Biden has begun to announce his picks for his Cabinet and  other high-ranking positions.   Some of these nominees have close ties to investment and other  consulting firms whose clients are largely unknown or who may be even  the subjects of nondisclosure agreements. The truth is that these  individuals could be working on behalf of a ``feel good'' nonprofit, a  malicious foreign actor, or a large company with business before the  government. The truth of the matter is, we have simply no idea what  kind of business or financial relationships these individuals have with  foreign powers that could influence their actions as high-ranking  government officials. This goes way beyond compliance with the Foreign  Agents Registration Act. This is an ethical issue. It is a conflict-of- interest issue, and Americans deserve to know if these nominees have  connections or relationships that could cloud their judgment on behalf  of the American people if they are confirmed.   When it comes to the business dealings of those who could serve in  high-ranking government positions, full transparency is the only  option. So I encourage each of these individuals, if nominated, to take  an open-book approach throughout the hearings and confirmation  processes. In fact, I will make a pledge here today that I will not  support any nominee who doesn't provide full transparency into his work  on behalf of a foreign government. I will not do it. The American  people deserve to know if these or any future nominees are beholden to  anything other than our national interest.   Just to make the point that this is not some imaginary or  hypothetical problem, let me refer to an article that was written today  in the Associated Press News, entitled: `` `Mercenary' donor sold  access for millions in foreign money.'' This is a story of a so-called  elite political fundraiser, Imaad Zuberi, who, maybe not surprisingly,  raised a lot of money for Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama  and who also became the top donor to the Trump Presidential Inaugural  Committee. In other words, he wasn't particularly partisan. He just  wanted to be close to power and be able to influence it.   Prosecutors who have now prosecuted him for a variety of violations  of campaign finance laws and foreign lobbying laws have called him a  mercenary political donor. His foreign entanglements were quite  extensive. He lobbied as an unregistered foreign agent for at least  half a dozen countries and officials, including a Ukrainian oligarch  who was close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. He lobbied for  countries like Turkey and Sri Lanka, among others. As I said, it really  doesn't make a difference so much which country. It was the fact that  he was lobbying in an undisclosed fashion, raising money for political  candidates, and violating campaign finance laws for which he has now  pled guilty and will be awaiting sentencing after the first of the  year.   We spent a lot of the last 4 years--and, certainly, as a member of  the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, we spent about 3\1/2\  years--investigating Russian interference with the 2016 election. Yet,  as this story makes clear,  [[Page S7104]]  Zuberi's story shows there are far easier ways to bend American foreign  policy than by using sophisticated hacking tools or well-funded troll  farms. In other words, you can do it the way he has done it, which is  by violating our foreign agent registration laws, representing foreign  governments and foreign interests, and hiring lobbyists and cutting out  donors in a way that funnels foreign money into the American political  process--unbeknownst to people like us unless it is disclosed.   Between 1966 and 2015, the Department of Justice brought just seven  criminal cases for violating the law relating to registering as a  foreign lobbyist, according to a 2016 inspector general's report. So  this is a serious topic.   The incoming chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, Senator  Grassley, and the current ranking member, Senator Feinstein, and I have  a bipartisan bill to reform the Foreign Agents Registration Act, but  this is going to be front and center in the confirmation process for  any nominee by the incoming administration, and I just think it is fair  to place everybody on fair notice that full transparency is the only  option.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, the Senate has, of  course, returned for a last end-of-the-year legislative dash, and we  have a lot of work to do before we cross the finish line.   As we know, government funding will expire in less than 2 weeks, and  we have to reach an agreement, as the senior Senator from Vermont  mentioned, before the December 11 deadline of the current continuing  resolution. With millions of Americans already facing economic  uncertainty, a government shutdown is, surely, not an option.   We need to pass the National Defense Authorization Act to support  America's brave servicemembers and ensure that our military leaders  have the ability to plan and operate with certainty and provide peace  through American strength. Also, as we move into the winter months,  which the experts have told us will present new challenges in our war  against the COVID-19 virus, it is time to cut the partisanship and  deliver another round of relief to the American people.   It is worth recounting--because people have short memories,  apparently, in Washington, DC--that, over the last several months, our  Democratic colleagues have consistently talked about the need to  bolster our support in the fight against COVID-19. Yet, despite the  repeated rhetoric and calls to action, they have unapologetically stood  in the way of each and every attempt to make real progress.   This summer, we proposed something called the HEALS Act--as the  Presiding Officer knows, for he was instrumental in that work--as a  starting point for negotiations on a new relief package. It was a  starting place, a place to begin bipartisan negotiations in the hope of  crafting a package that could get the requisite number of votes.  Unfortunately, before the election, our Democratic colleagues had  simply no interest in amending the bill or trying to find any kind of  common ground. I think they thought it was to their political advantage  for the American people to be experiencing the anxiety and the pain  before the election. I can't imagine holding them hostage, but that is  what appeared, to me, to be the case.   Instead of trying to find common ground--in particular, the Speaker  made the amazing statement that nothing was better than something when  it came to COVID-19 relief, which is just the opposite of what I have  always believed--she demeaned the bill of half a trillion dollars in  spending as ``pathetic.'' The minority leader called it ``unworkable,''  but then they didn't lift a finger to try to get anything done.   So the next month we took another shot. We attempted to narrow the  scope of negotiations to the most urgent matters--things like  continuing Federal unemployment benefits, which expired at the end of  July. This is last July. This time our Democratic colleagues rejected  what they called a ``piecemeal'' approach.   Well, never mind the fact that the House returned to Washington to  help pass a bill that supported the U.S. Postal Service. We all believe  in supporting the Postal Service, but apparently they thought that  piecemeal bill was acceptable as long as it was a Democratic-authored  bill and didn't provide any additional relief to the American people.   Well, being unsuccessful those first two times, we tried again a  third time. So in September the majority leader tried to bring a bill  to the floor to provide $500 billion for our shared bipartisan  priorities. There weren't any real differences in what was in the bill.  The only difference was that our Democratic colleagues wanted to spend  multiples of that for unrelated activities. We wanted to concentrate  the effort on helping small businesses keep their employees on payroll,  giving schools the resources they needed to keep their students and  teachers safe, strengthening testing nationwide, and investing in the  continued success of Operation Warp Speed, which is going to deliver an  FDA-approved vaccine before the end of the year--not just one, maybe as  many as two or three, and more, perhaps, to come.   Anyone who has spent time watching C-SPAN over the last several  months has heard both Republicans and Democrats talk about the  importance of every single one of these things, but when legislation  that includes all of these priorities came up for an initial vote, our  Democratic colleagues wouldn't even allow us to get on the bill. In  other words, here in the Senate you have to vote to get on the bill  before you can then offer amendments and try to make it better.   So they killed it. Without batting an eye, our Democratic colleagues  voted in lockstep to block the bill and unanimously oppose legislation  that would have invested an additional half-trillion dollars in our  fight against COVID-19.   When the majority leader tried to bring the bill to the floor again  in October, we saw exactly the same thing. It was the same bad movie  all over again. Our Democratic colleagues refused to let us even  debate, much less to amend, the bill.   It is not just these targeted packages that have been blocked by our  Democratic colleagues. They stood in the way of our commonsense  proposals, like the one from the now-former Senator from Arizona,  Senator McSally, which would have extended unemployment benefits for 1  week while we negotiated a larger compromise.   Our friends on the other side of the aisle have repeatedly said that  Congress needs to act, but the reality is their own actions have  prevented us from doing so.   Month after month, they have demonstrated it is either the House's  multitrillion-dollar, leftwing-policy grab-bag wish list or nothing.  They have consistently told the American people: It is our way or the  highway. You don't get an extension of unemployment insurance unless we  get tax breaks for blue-State millionaires and billionaires. You don't  get vaccine funding unless we get diversity studies on the marijuana  industry. You don't get funding for schools unless we get permanent  changes to hijack and take over our election laws and run them out of  Washington, DC.   Well, even rank-and-file Democrats have now understood and criticized  this sort of bogus approach to legislating. It has been the same song  and dance month after month--fiery speeches, press conferences, tweets,  and letters calling for action. But each time our Democratic colleagues  have been given an opportunity to actually do something--to do more  than spout off some meaningless, vapid rhetoric at the nearest  microphone--they have simply stood in the way.   The fact of the matter is our Democratic colleagues have blocked more  COVID relief bills than they have passed. Yet they continue to feign  outrage over Congress's failure to pass a bill--we heard it again here  today--as though they aren't the ones responsible for the impasse.   Our jobs here in the Senate aren't simply to vote against imperfect  bills. If that were the case, no bill would ever pass, because none of  them is perfect. But this body is built on making imperfect legislation  better through a debate-and-amendment process--two processes we haven't  seen much at work this year.  [[Page S7105]]    So the bottom line is Congress needs to act. The American people want  Democrats and Republicans to come to an agreement on the things our  country actually needs to make it through this crisis.   It won't be the last piece of legislation we pass, but we do need to  do this next step, and we need to do it soon--as soon as possible.   It is time for our Democratic colleagues to realize the election is  over and the only real people being hurt by their intransigence are the  people they represent in their various States.   So it is time to start getting back to work for all the American  people on a bipartisan piece of legislation and to quit the partisan  games. I can't say it any more directly than that.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
