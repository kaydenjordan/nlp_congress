 Madam Speaker, I am pleased to support this important  legislation to bolster the United States Postal Service.   As we all saw in the last few years, the postal service is vital to  our communities and I'm glad that it is getting the attention that it  deserves. From keeping rural and small-town America connected, to  delivering Social Security checks and medications, to maintaining our  democracy by ensuring that people can safely cast a vote, we have so  much at stake.   Meaningful postal reform affects us all and I am happy to support  this critical program.
