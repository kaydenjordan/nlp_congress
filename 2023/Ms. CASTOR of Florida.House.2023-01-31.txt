 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to  H.R. 497, which would actually endanger the lives of frontline  healthcare workers, patients, and their families.   We have been fighting the COVID-19 pandemic now for nearly 3 years.  Sadly, we have lost over 1 million Americans to this horrendous  coronavirus.   Thankfully, we have turned the corner, in large part by making safe,  effective, and rigorously tested vaccinations available to all  Americans. These lifesaving vaccines help save lives. They help prevent  unnecessary hospitalizations and severe illness, as well.   Perhaps nowhere is vaccination more important than for our healthcare  heroes who care for our neighbors every day. Vaccination is a vital  tool to protect them and to help end the pandemic.                                time  1530    Don't take it from me. Listen to the American Medical Association and  the American Academy of Family Physicians who support the vaccination  for healthcare workers.   They say that halting vaccination for healthcare professionals would  severely and irreparably harm patients and undermine the patient-public  interest.   They say the science is clear: No arguments against the need for  vaccination are medically valid. Vaccines are our way out of the  pandemic. No other measure has been shown to reduce hospitalizations,  severe disease, and death to the degree that vaccination does. We must  continue to let science lead the way.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my Republican colleagues not to confuse  Americans, or worse, endanger their lives. Vote ``no'' on this reckless  bill.
