 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to demand that critical natural  disaster relief be voted upon.   Tomorrow will be the 6-month anniversary of Hurricane Michael, 6  months with absolutely no disaster supplemental funding, no serious  action on the part of Congress except the political farce in the House  and two failed cloture votes in the Senate.   Both Chambers have refused to extend even routine tax relief to  ensure that people have access to their money when they need it most.  With tax day just around the corner, this is unacceptable.   Floridians are tough, but they need help and deserve help.   Six months ago, Hurricane Michael devastated the South, damaging more  than 90 percent of the structures on Tyndall Air Force Base, decimating  our agricultural industry, and destroying entire communities. Yet, here  we are with only 1 day left in the legislative calendar before Easter  and no tax relief in sight.   If the previous question is defeated, it will be a first step in  making some meaningful progress for victims of all the 2018 disasters.  It will bring the Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019 to the floor. I am a  proud cosponsor of that bill with   Tom Rice and Austin Scott.   This bill includes a set of common, routine tax breaks victims of  virtually every disaster over the last decade have been entitled to,  things like access to retirement savings without penalty, a tax credit  for employers who continue to pay employees while shut down, suspending  tax limitations on charitable contributions for relief efforts, and  allowing hardworking families to use earned income from the previous  year to calculate their earned income tax credits and child tax  credits.   It is a shame that we have to resort to a procedural trick to ask for  a vote on this very bipartisan, commonsense legislation that we have  passed many times before.   Mr. Speaker, it is time we take action to help those suffering from  the 2018 disasters. For this reason, I urge a ``no'' vote on the  previous question.    Madam Speaker, today, I join my colleagues in calling for  an immediate vote on disaster funding.   In 2018 and so far in 2019, we have witnessed devastating disasters  with hurricanes hitting Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and the Carolinas;  wildfires in California; flooding in the Midwest; an earthquake in  Alaska; and several other widespread weather events that have harmed  communities across our country and our territories.   The people in our districts and States need our help, and it is our  duty to fight for them.   I thank my colleagues for joining me today, and I yield to the  gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby), whose district adjoins my  district.    Madam Speaker, I wish to express my gratitude to Martha  Roby for her speech and for her sentiments on her people in Alabama.   Next, Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Austin Scott), who is my good friend and who has been one of the  champions for the disaster supplemental. He has worked tirelessly for  the last 7 months to advance this effort.    Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend, Austin Scott, for  his words. He has truly been at the forefront on the fight for this  disaster supplemental since day one.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Omaha, Nebraska, (Mr.  Bacon). General Don Bacon is my good friend and classmate.    Madam Speaker, I thank General Bacon for his words.   Madam Speaker, from Nebraska we have a true leader of the House and a  good friend.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.  Fortenberry).    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Fortenberry for his  compelling description of the damages that were suffered in Nebraska  and also of the response of those brave people.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Riggleman). Representative Denver Riggleman is my good friend and one  of the most outstanding members of the new class here in Congress.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Riggleman for his  words, and I know that his constituents are fortunate to have a man of  his rare abilities serving them at all times.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Dakota (Mr.  Johnson). Representative Dusty Johnson is another outstanding member of  the freshman class.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Johnson for his  description, his words, and also for his granular knowledge of his  district. I know that that is a benefit to everybody there.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Rutherford). Sheriff   John Rutherford is my good friend whose district  of Jacksonville, Florida, abuts mine on the east side.    Madam Speaker, I thank Sheriff Rutherford for his words. He  has been a stalwart ally and a great friend ever since we arrived here  on day one. He is a true friend to all of Florida.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  LaMalfa), one of the true leaders of our Conference.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank Representative LaMalfa for  his sincere words and his seasoned judgment and insights. Let us hope  that those words fall on fertile ground.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida's First District  (Mr. Gaetz), one of my dearest friends in the House. We were friends  for many years before we came to this House, and his talents are known  to all of us. He is an Olympian among his class.    Madam Speaker, it is always a pleasure to introduce  Representative Gaetz and hear his oratory. I thank him for his  brilliant words.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Rouzer). Representative Rouzer is a friend. He has visited my home. I  have visited his district. He truly knows what it is like to see other  districts and empathize with them and to reach out; and I am deeply  gratified to have him here speaking today.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative   David Rouzer for  those words. It is a sad story that the gentleman told, but it is a  story that needed to be heard and is one that is being lived out  through many of our districts; the end of generations of farming in  some families. It is a very sad story.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen), a  good friend of mine from our class. He is a great Congressman. We have  visited in his district. And let me say that it has been a pleasure to  work with him and his wife.    Madam Speaker, I wish to thank Representative Allen for his  words and his support.   Next, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), one of  the most senior and experienced representatives in the delegation from  Florida, a man who has been a personal mentor to me and a great model.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Bilirakis for his  leadership and for the personal generosity of his time spent with me  tonight.   Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?    Madam Speaker, next, I would like to introduce the third  and final Representative from Nebraska, a good friend and a good friend  of Nebraska. Thank you so much very much for being here.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Smith for his words.  It speaks to the disaster, what happened in Nebraska, that all three  Representatives showed up.   Madam Speaker, next, I would like to introduce and yield to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), my good friend.   We share more in common than most Representatives. Because of the  vagaries of redistricting, we ran in 2016 in the same 12 counties. He  was a great support, a great example, and cleared the way for me. I  want to say that I am deeply grateful for having Dr. Ted Yoho here  tonight.    Madam Speaker, let me say that I am deeply indebted to Dr.  Yoho. Our channel of communications went down after the storm in a way  that America has never seen. We lost cellphones, landlines. We lost  police radios. We were talking to each other by ham radios and runners.   When Dr. Yoho could not raise me or my office staff, he mounted a  rescue operation complete with food and supplies and took care of the  east end of my district. I will always be grateful to Dr. Yoho for  that, and I thank him so much.   Madam Speaker, for my final guest, I would like to introduce the  Representative from south Georgia, another good friend and a neighbor.  We don't quite abut districts, but we come pretty close. I spend a lot  of time in his neighborhood. He needs to spend more time down on my  beaches.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend, Representative  Carter, for his impassioned words. Obviously, he is echoing thoughts  that we have heard from the other speakers.   Seldom has a Special Order been so well subscribed. So many people  came to speak, so many people moved and hurt by the disaster.   It leaves me with very little time, but I want to say a couple  things.   I want to reiterate that this is an unprecedented event for timber.  Nobody has ever seen this much timber on the ground, 3 million acres of  timber. Think about what that does to the foresters, the loggers, and  the sawmills.   The military, we have lost an Air Force base, probably $4 billion to  $6 billion worth of damage to that. We will rebuild it. We will rebuild  it, and it will be great, but we need help from Congress to do that.   I have a Navy base in my district, $288 million in damage.   I have a Coast Guard base in my district that is particularly sad.  They have a single building standing. They were victims of the storm;  they were first responders to the storm. They were not paid, because  they are with the Department of Homeland Security, for a month. It is  shameful. These are fine people in the Coast Guard.    We have housing problems right now. Thirty percent of the homes in my  home county is uninhabitable. Fifty percent of the commercial real  estate is not usable.   We have special geography. We are 100 miles away from the next place  where there is multifamily housing. We need housing on the ground in  the affected areas.   Madam Speaker, I thank all the people who took time to come and tell  our story, which is a sad story, and I urge the Congress to come to our  rescue.   That picture, by the way, is not 6 months old. It is 2 weeks old.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
