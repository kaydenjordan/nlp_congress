 Mr. Speaker, 100 years ago, in 1918, President  Woodrow Wilson declared July 28 as a National Day of Prayer for the  Serbian people.   This was during World War I, the war to end all wars. American  doughboys and leathernecks had arrived on the western front, holding  the line against Germany's last offensive before it collapsed.   Meanwhile, the Serbian people were suffering under occupation by the  central powers, who had launched a brutal invasion of Serbia.   Mr. Speaker, during World War I, one in four Serbian people were  killed during that war. But the Serbian army had survived the invasion  and was fighting alongside our allies to liberate their home. They were  reinforced by many Serbian-Americans, who had returned to Europe to  help their brothers.   President Wilson wanted America to honor the sacrifices of the  Serbian people. In a speech marking the invasion of Serbia by the  central powers, he said of the Serbians:         Nobly did they respond. So valiantly and courageous did       they oppose the forces of a country ten times greater in       population and resources. . . . While their territory has       been devastated and their homes despoiled, the spirit of the       Serbian people has not been broken.    As a Texan, I admire such defiance against overwhelming odds.   On that special day, President Wilson ordered a rare recognition to a  foreign ally, by having the Serbian flag raised over the White House.  That recognition had only occurred one other time in American history.   The spirit of brotherhood between the Americans and the Serbians,  fighting shoulder to shoulder against tyranny, did not end there.   One of the most meaningful stories for Americans is the Halyard  Mission during the dark days of the Second World War. Despite being  under Nazi occupation, the Serbian people demonstrated their remarkable  bravery once again, saving the lives of hundreds of Americans in the  largest rescue operation of American airmen in history.   In 1944, American bombers were flying frequent missions to strike  Germany's vital oil supplies in Romania as a part of the allied advance  into Europe. The 15th Air Force led this effort by launching 20,000  sorties into Eastern Europe, with many of the missions flying over  Nazi-occupied Yugoslavia. As many as 1,500 pilots and airmen were shot  down during these air raids.   Serbians, who had been resisting Nazi forces since 1941, risked their  own lives to rescue American aircrews in Yugoslavia and hide them from  patrolling Nazis. These brave and noble Serbians cared for and  protected Americans and allied pilots.   In August of 1944, the allied forces, including the 15th Air Force  and the Office of Strategic Services, devised a daring operation to  evacuate hundreds of allied pilots being sheltered by the Serbian  resistance in Nazi-occupied Yugoslavia. American aircraft flew into  enemy territory and evacuated 500 airmen from the airfield built and  protected by local Serbians near the village of Pranjani.   For over 60 years, this operation was kept secret from the American  people. But now we can remember the courage of our Serbian friends and  their stand against the Nazis.   Here, Mr. Speaker, is a photograph taken by the Serbian resistance,  taking Americans who had been shot down in Serbia and taking them to  the airfield, where they would be returned back to the American lines.   George Dudich, the father of my chief of staff, Elaine Dudich Stolze,  when I was a judge in Texas, rescued many Americans who had been shot  down in occupied Yugoslavia.   All these years later, we remain committed to the cause of freedom  for both nations. We should work together to preserve each other's  security.   The United States is now working with Serbia to improve its  democracy, an independent judiciary, and fight corruption. A democratic  Serbia with a strong rule of law is in America's interests and  Serbia's.   We are united in keeping the hungry Russian bear from interfering in  domestic affairs in Serbia. Russian disinformation efforts are designed  to keep Serbia in its sphere of influence and poison our relationship.  Nevertheless, Serbia's integration to the west has continued to move  forward.   In 2006, Serbia joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program and, in  2015, signed an Individual Partnership Action Plan with the alliance to  strengthen cooperation. And recently, the European Union has announced  that Serbia would join the EU as early as 2025.   The prime minister and foreign minister of Serbia and numerous Serbs  are in the Capitol today to promote U.S. Serbian relations.   So on this 100th anniversary of President Wilson's speech about the  courageous Serbs of World War I, we reaffirm our joint partnership and  friendship and a quest for liberty.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to express my appreciation to  Bishop Irinej of the Serbian Orthodox Church for coming to lead the  opening prayer on this special day.   Mr. Speaker, 100 years ago, July 28, President Wilson declared a  national day of prayer for the Serbian people and their fight during  World War I.   Bishop Irinej has a long career of service, both to God and the  church, as well as the Serbian American community. His work has taken  him around the world. Formerly, he was a bishop of Australia and New  Zealand, and before that, he spent years serving the church in Serbia.   For most of his career, he has been a dedicated educator, teaching at  Loyola University in Chicago and as a member of the orthodox church's  theological faculty in Belgrade.   Perhaps most notably today is his work to improve the ties between  the Serbian diaspora and the Serbian state.   Bishop Irinej plays an important role in bringing us all together  with God's love. It was my honor to invite him to share his faith with  us today.   Thank you, Bishop Irinej, for that prayer, and may God bless Serbia  and the United States of America.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
