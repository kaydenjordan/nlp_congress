 Mr. President, I have one request for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                          Committee on the Judiciary    The Committee on the Judiciary is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Thursday, September 10, 2020, at 10 a.m., in  room 325 of the Russell Senate Office Building, to conduct a committee  executive business meeting.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today as a result of the horrific  pandemic and economic meltdown, the American working class is hurting  in a way that they have not been hurting since the Great Depression of  the 1930s. Tens of millions of our fellow citizens have lost their  jobs. They have lost their incomes. They have lost their health  insurance. They have depleted their life savings. They cannot afford to  pay rent. They cannot afford to put food on the table. And they are  scared to death that any day now they are going to get a knock on the  door from a sheriff, evicting them from their homes and throwing them  and their belongings out on the street.   This is the United States of America, the richest country in the  history of the world. None of us--no man, woman, or child--should go  hungry. None of us should have to live in fear of becoming homeless,  and no one should be denied the healthcare that they need--especially  during the worst public health crisis in 100 years. But that is  precisely what is going on all over our country as we speak this  evening.   Just the other day, National Public Radio, NPR, released a survey on  the unprecedented economic suffering facing the American people. That  should shock everyone in the U.S. Senate and in our Nation. And here is  what that survey found: 46 percent of Americans--over 150 million  people--are now experiencing serious financial problems.   Forty-one percent of Americans--over 134 million people--have used up  all or most of their savings. Their savings accounts are now depleted.  Thirty-three percent of American families have had someone in their  household who has either lost a job, lost a business, or has been  furloughed during the pandemic. This is an unprecedented moment in  American history, and the Senate needs to take unprecedented action to  improve the lives of the American people.   Yet in the midst of all of this pain and suffering, what has the  Republican-led Senate done over the last 5 months to address the  economic concerns of the American people? The answer is nothing except  pass a $740 billion budget for the bloated Pentagon and take an  extended vacation. That is not something that anybody in the Senate  should be proud of.   The Senate is now back in session. Senate Republicans have introduced  a so-called skinny relief bill that is totally inadequate in terms of  addressing the crisis we are facing today. The Senate Republican bill  provides nothing for rent, nothing for mortgages, nothing for food,  nothing for hazard pay, nothing for healthcare, nothing for public  transportation, and nothing to prevent the mass layoffs of teachers,  nurses, firefighters, and construction workers that will take place in  cities and States as cities and States struggle economically.   In other words, the same Republicans who had no problem voting for a  trillion-dollar tax break for the top 1 percent large corporations 2  years ago are now telling 40 million Americans who are struggling to  pay for housing that we cannot afford to help them pay their rent or  mortgage. The same Republicans who just voted to provide $740 billion  for the Pentagon and the military industrial complex to wage endless  wars are now telling 30 million workers who lost their jobs that we  cannot afford to continue the $600-a-week supplement they were  receiving in unemployment benefits. The same Republicans who slipped  $135 billion tax breaks for multimillionaires and billionaires in the  last coronavirus relief package are now telling 29 million Americans  who do not have enough food to eat that we cannot afford to help them  feed their families.   But if you are an executive in the coal industry, you are in luck.  The Republican Senate bill provides your industry with $161 million in  corporate welfare. That is right. The Republican Senate bill provides  no money for working families to feed their kids, no money to house the  homeless, no money to insure the uninsured--no money for them--but it  does provide $161 million in corporate welfare for the coal industry  during a climate emergency. That may make sense for the CEOs in the  fossil fuel industry who are destroying the planet with their product,  but it makes zero sense to me.   Further, under the Senate Republican bill, if you are a wealthy  business owner who forces employees to work in an unsafe and unhealthy  workplace, you are rewarded. The Republican bill will provide you with  the immunity you need from lawsuits if your workers get sick or die  from the coronavirus,  [[Page S5561]]  but if you are an essential worker during this pandemic, you get  nothing. The Republican bill does not provide a nickel more for hazard  pay or the personal protective equipment that you need and deserve.   Needless to say, I am strongly opposed to the Senate Republican bill  and am glad it was defeated earlier today.   Instead of listening to the needs of fossil fuel CEOs, we need to  listen to the needs of working-class Americans, the people who are  hurting. Instead of providing more corporate welfare to billionaires  and large corporations, we need to provide more economic relief to the  tens of millions of Americans who are hurting economically.   Nearly 4 months ago, the House of Representatives did its job by  passing the Heroes Act, a $3.5 trillion bill. In my view, the Senate  has to stand up and do its job and pass the Heroes Act or a bill that  is even better than that legislation   I received many, many thousands of letters, emails, and social media  from constituents in the State of Vermont and, in fact, all over this  country about how the economic crisis has negatively impacted their  lives and what that $600 a week in unemployment benefits that expired  in July meant to them.   Let me read you just a few of the many thousands of stories my office  has received. A constituent from North Chittenden, VT, wrote:         I was laid off in March. Since the end of the extra $600       I've been able to eat because of the food bank. I wasn't able       to get one of my prescriptions because even with insurance it       was $88. I saved as much as I could during the extra $600       period, but I'm almost out of money now. Literally enough to       make it about 10 days. Then what? I'm 65 [years of age].    An unemployed worker wrote:         We can't pay our rent including car payment and car       insurance, bills, feed our four kids, or buy necessities. We       desperately need the extra $600 to stay afloat. If we don't       get our money soon, we could lose EVERYTHING!    Another unemployed worker recently wrote:         My State benefit was $127 a week (I exhausted my available       State funds last week). My rent is $1,200 a month. Without       further congressional action, I will be unhoused within a       month or two.    A constituent from Danville, VT, wrote:         That moment the government stopped the $600 a week they       closed my benefits. I never saw anything other than that $600       and it went to bills and rent. Now I am behind on everything       again.    And on and on it goes. For millions of people, that $600-a-week check  was life and death.   Clearly, in the midst of this unprecedented crisis, the Senate must  act and act now, not with a skinny relief bill that does virtually  nothing to help working families in their time of need, but with  legislation that responds to the unprecedented economic pain and  suffering that the American working class is experiencing.   We need to extend the extra $600 a week in unemployment benefits for  the 30 million Americans who have lost their jobs--like the House  passed over 3 months ago. This is absolutely essential. During this  crisis, it would give families the income they need to live with it. We  need to make sure that every working-class person in America receives  $2,000 a month until this crisis is over so they can pay the rent and  put food on the table.   We need to expand Medicare to all the 92 million Americans who are  uninsured or underinsured. Nobody should be unable to go to a doctor  during this crisis because they don't have health insurance. In other  words, we need a coronavirus relief bill that benefits the working  families of this country and low-income people, not just the wealthy  and well-connected.   I know what my Republican colleagues will say--that it is too  expensive, and we can't afford it. Maybe, just maybe, our Republican  colleagues are so concerned about the deficit they might want to ask  their billionaire campaign contributors to pay their fair share of  taxes instead of giving them massive tax breaks.   In the midst of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression  and the worst public health crisis in more than 100 years, I think most  Americans would be shocked to learn that 467 billionaires in our  country have seen their wealth go up by $800 billion during the  pandemic. Let me repeat that: 467 billionaires have seen their wealth  go up by $800 billion during the pandemic. In my view, at a time of  massive wealth and income inequality and when so many of our people are  hurting, it is morally obscene for billionaires to use a global  pandemic as an opportunity to make outrageous profits.   Instead of more austerity for the working class of this country, we  need to impose austerity on the billionaire class and on Wall Street.  That is why I have introduced legislation to tax the obscene wealth  gains billionaires have made during the public health crisis. According  to the Americans for Tax Fairness, if we taxed 60 percent of the  windfall gains billionaires made during the pandemic, we could raise  over $420 billion. That is enough revenue to allow Medicare to pay all  of the out-of-pocket healthcare expenses for everyone in America in the  next 12 months. Yes, by taxing 60 percent of the wealth gains made by  just 467 people during this horrific pandemic, we could guarantee  healthcare as a right for an entire year for every man, woman, and  child in this country. Billionaires would still be able to pocket over  $300 billion in wealth gains during the worst economic downturn since  the Great Depression.   At a time of enormous economic pain and suffering, we have a choice  to make. We can continue to allow the very rich to get much richer  while everyone else gets poorer and poorer or we can tax the winnings a  handful of billionaires made during the pandemic to improve the health  and well-being of tens of millions of Americans.   It is time for the Senate to act on behalf of the working families of  this country who are hurting like they have never hurt before and not  just the billionaire class who are doing phenomenally well and have  never had it so good.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
