 Madam Speaker, when the Supreme Court overturned Roe  last summer, they took away hard-fought rights from millions of women  across our country.   Now women in Kentucky no longer have access to safe and legal  abortions, even in cases of rape and incest.   The country responded at the ballot box, and my district  overwhelmingly rejected a constitutional amendment to further restrict  reproductive rights in Kentucky.   So how do we respond here?   Last night the House Republicans' first order of business was to make  it even harder for women to receive abortions and for healthcare  professionals to provide them. These decisions are best left between a  woman and her doctor. But House Republicans have sent a clear message  that more legislative attacks against women's rights are on the  horizon.   I proudly voted against yesterday's attack on women and their  doctors, and I will continue fighting for reproductive rights.                            ____________________
