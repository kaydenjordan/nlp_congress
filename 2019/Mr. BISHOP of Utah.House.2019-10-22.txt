 Madam Speaker, this place is based predominantly  on precedent and procedure. To bypass this proven pathway is  predictably painful. So I pause to put a plea to the powers that be:   Our people deserve better.   The propaganda pushed upon the people is a political ploy as  perpetrators usurp the proven precedents of the past.   It is painful to be placed in a position to protest the pranks pushed  by Pelosi and her posse of players, but people have been pushed out and  put on the sidelines as Democrats plow ahead with this so-called  impeachment inquiry.   The impact of this pandering is the peeling away of the people's  trust placed upon us. As the past has played out, I have been perplexed  by the pontifications of people in positions of power who puff  themselves up in pretentious prominence when it is really petty  partisanship.   So I plead, as we push and pull for power, that we do so grounded in  prudence that protects the proven procedures of the past.                            ____________________
