 Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Brady for all of his work.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support for the SUPPORT for Patients and  Communities Act. It includes my bill, the Dr. Todd Graham Pain  Management, Treatment, and Recovery Act, that passed the House earlier  this week.   H.R. 6 is also vital for equipping those on the front lines with  important treatment and recovery initiatives. This includes people in  my district like Erin LaCourt at Victory Clinical Services in South  Bend. Victory provides comprehensive treatment for individuals with  substance abuse disorders, but H.R. 6 will help them expand those  services to include seniors.   This bill will also help Justin Phillips, who founded Overdose  Lifeline, which is dedicated to helping those affected by addiction,  assist even more Hoosiers on their road to recovery.   Solving the opioid epidemic requires every one of us to work  together. I want to thank Erin, Justin, and all the other hardworking  Hoosiers in my district who deserve recognition and to let them know we  have noticed all their hard work.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
