 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                   Congressional Baseball Practice Shooting     Mr. President, I rise to express my deepest sympathy for  the victims of this morning's shooting, including for my good friend,  Representative Steve Scalise. I pray that he, the congressional staff,  and police officers who were injured in this horrific event can recover  quickly.   Today is not a day to reflect on our differences but on our common  commitment to upholding the Constitution and doing the work of the  American people. This Chamber is often divided on matters of policy,  but in the face of tragedy, we are united as one. Today, we are  together, and together we recognize the local law enforcement officials  who responded quickly and professionally to this morning's attack.   Each and every day, police officers across this great Nation risk  their own well-being to ensure the safety of others, and they do so  with little fanfare or recognition. In light of today's events, I  recognize, in particular, the special sacrifice of our U.S. Capitol  police officers--the selfless men and women--who, each and every day,  assume significant risk to keep all of us safe.   I shudder to think of what may have happened this morning had it not  been for the quick action taken by Representative Scalise's security  detail. These courageous special agents returned fire to apprehend the  perpetrator of this senseless and appalling act of violence. Through  their heroic actions, they prevented a massacre and saved the lives of  dozens of elected Members of Congress and congressional staff. Today I  wish to pay special tribute to these humble heroes.   As far as I am concerned, our Capitol Police officers are the finest  professionals this Nation has to offer. We wave to them each morning as  we walk in to work, we say goodbye to them each night as we leave, and  we interact with them each day. Yet how often do we thank them for  their service? How often do we reflect on the weight of their work? How  often do we recognize them for their sacrifices? In my opinion, not  often enough. Because these police officers are such a common presence  here on Capitol Hill, I worry that all too often we take them for  granted, but we should never take for granted the men and women who  would willingly give up their lives to protect ours.   This morning's attack reminds us all of the thin line between peace  and violence, and our Capitol police officers are the first to respond  when that line is crossed. Today and every day, these selfless men and  women deserve our heartfelt thanks and appreciation.   In paying tribute to our Capitol Police, I would be remiss if I were  to fail to recognize the 23 members of my own  [[Page S3475]]  security detail who work around the clock to keep Elaine and me safe.  These men and women are like family to me. Over the past 2\1/2\ years,  I have built a special bond with each of them.   Today I would like to recognize each of them individually:   Supervisory Special Agent David Rib, who leads the detail with  assistance from team leaders Jason Marcello and Shane Powell; in  addition, Special Agents Eric Boggs, John Britto, Jacqueline French,  Eric Holzer, Eric Love, Paul Martin, Ronald Munar, Benjamin Odell,  Richard Philius, Luis Pimentel, Ryan Rayball, Austin Reinshuttle, Henry  Smith, John Whittle, Micah Harrison, Muhammed Khan, Gideon Maran,  Arnold Pierre, Robert Schultz, and Charles Snead.   In all of my years of public service, these are among the most  honorable men and women I have ever worked with. ``Greater love hath no  man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.''   The fact that these special agents are willing to put their lives on  the line to protect all of us speaks to their selflessness, their  bravery, and their love of this institution and of country. Elaine and  I love each of these special agents deeply, and we love their families  too.   In these photos, you can see one of the team leaders, Jason, hard at  work. Jason hates this photo, which is why I blew it up for national  TV. The other photo is of the trip I took to all five of Utah's  national parks last year. During this trip, my security detail was with  me every step of the way. These men and women never leave my side.   Today I wish to thank them with all of my heart for their service and  their sacrifice. These are really great people, and we have enjoyed  being together. At least, I have enjoyed being with them. I will put it  that way.   As Members of Congress, we stand united in the aftermath of today's  attack. Thanks to our brave Capitol Police officers, we also stand  protected from those who would do us harm. Because of them, we can  confidently carry on the work of the American people.   These are really great human beings--men and women--who literally  sacrifice a lot to serve us, back us up, strengthen us, and help us in  times of need. They are people whom I really, really admire. All I can  say is, I admire those who stood up this morning for Congressman  Scalise and the others who were there and especially for those who were  wounded.   This is a wonderful institution, and we have wonderful people working  with us--heroic people, people who care for this body, people who care  for our country, people who care for us. I think we ought to all thank  God every day that we have these good people around us and that we  ought to all take the time to be kind to them, to show them how much we  care, and to show them the friendship we truly have for them. I am  grateful that I know a number of these people--quite a number. I am  grateful for them and for what they do for all of us.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.
