 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and include any extraneous materials on the subject of this  Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I  rise today to coanchor this Congressional Black Caucus Special Order  hour, along with my distinguished colleague, Representative Sheila  Cherfilus-McCormick.   As we commence this CBC Special Order hour, we will dedicate the next  60 minutes to National Reunification Month, focusing on a deeply  concerning issue, the disproportionate separation of Black families by  foster care and welfare services. This critical issue is not just of  concern to the Congressional Black Caucus or Congress but a matter of  significance for all Americans. Let us shed light on these unsettling  realities and provide solutions and champion the reunification of  families across our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cherfilus- McCormick).   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative  Jonathan Jackson for yielding.   June marks National Reunification Month, allowing us to recognize the  importance of keeping families together and the long-term benefits that  come with stable family structures.   As we observe this month, we must find ways to support the growing  number of Black children who have been unnecessarily placed in foster  care systems. As elected leaders, we must ensure that this trend does  not continue in earnest.   Although the share of Black children in foster care is lower than  ever before, Black children are still drastically overrepresented in  the child welfare system. Across the country, 20 percent of children  entering foster care in fiscal year 2021 were Black, yet Black children  represent just 14 percent of the general population.   In my home State of Florida, it takes an extra 5 days, on average,  for Black children to exit out-of-home care when compared to their  White counterparts. This has been the status quo for far too long. From  2005 to 2021, 1 out of 125 children who identify as Black have been in  foster care at any given point in time. That pains me not only as a  Black American but as a parent.   There are several factors behind these glaring statistics, but they  stem in large part from a combination of historical trauma and  structural and systemic racism. Families of color are more likely to  live in communities marked by historic disinvestment. High poverty  rates have been exacerbated by poor housing conditions, limited access  to employment opportunities and healthy food, as well as other  components that are critical to raising children.   Through no fault of their own, many Black families have found it  difficult to meet basic family needs and raise their children in safe,  stable homes.   Our Nation needs to course correct. Research shows that children have  better outcomes in life when their own families safely nurture and care  for them. When a child must be removed from their parents, it is  profoundly distressing for the entire family.   This year marks the fifth anniversary of the passage of the Family  First Prevention Services Act. This law changed how we look at child  welfare, focusing on families as a whole. I also helped fund evidence- based, prevention-focused activities, like those that address mental  health needs and in-home parent skill-based programs. As we celebrate  its anniversary, we must continue to fund programs that keep our  children out of foster care and provide parents with the support they  need.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Cherfilus- McCormick for her great words.  [[Page H2985]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Honorable Gwen  Moore from Wisconsin, who so eloquently and passionately articulated  the plight of reunification and the challenges that lie before us.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Honorable   Donald  Payne, Jr., from the State of New Jersey for those eloquent words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cherfilus- McCormick).   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Caribbean American  Heritage Month, I rise today to recognize Dr. Judith Joseph, who has  helped shine a light on mental health issues and inspired countless  others to seek support.   Dr. Joseph immigrated to the U.S. from Trinidad at the age of 4.  After growing up in a religious community, with a father as a pastor,  Judith became interested in exploring the intersection of spirituality  and science.   Today, she leads a team of 10 talented women at the Manhattan  Behavioral Medicine, who are dedicated to developing and exploring  novel treatments for mental health conditions such as depression,  anxiety, and ADHD.   Dr. Joseph has shared her expertise with a wide audience, using  social media as a positive vehicle for change in a digestible and  accessible manner. I thank Dr. Joseph for her invaluable contribution  to mental health research and education.    Mr. Speaker, June is National Reunification  Month, an important designation that remains unknown to many, but one  that warrants wider understanding and greater attention. In the grand  tapestry of life, one universal truth weaves its thread throughout-- that none of us can journey far or aim high without some form of  familial structure to ground us. Family, in its various forms and  definitions, provides the anchors we all need.   As we turn our attention to the realities underscored by the data  from fiscal year 2021, a stark and uncomfortable picture emerges that  further emphasizes the urgency of the matter at hand.                                time  2015    Over the year, investigations of maltreatment involved a staggering  587,330 children in the United States.   Each of these represents a unique story, a child who has faced abuse  or neglect severe enough that allegations of maltreatment were  substantiated, and a life irrevocably scarred by these experiences.   Moreover, this vast number doesn't tell the complete story. Over  200,000 children were placed into the foster care system in that same  year, a heartrending reflection of the urgency and complexity of the  issues that we confront. While these numbers are staggering on their  own, the statistics take on an even darker shade when viewed through  the lens of racial disparities.   The overrepresentation of African-American children in the foster  care system is a disturbing trend that we can no longer ignore.   Despite representing only 14 percent of the general population,  African-American children accounted for 20 percent of the children  entering the foster care system in fiscal year 2021. This  disproportionate representation extends to multiracial children as  well, revealing a systemic bias that must be addressed.   In certain States, this disproportionality is even more pronounced,  spotlighting a deeply rooted racial bias that is pervasive and  detrimental. The repercussions of these disparities stretch far beyond  the immediate impact, creating a ripple effect that touches every  aspect of these children's lives, from their education and  [[Page H2987]]  mental health to their future economic opportunities.   Taking a broader perspective, if we look back over the span from 2005  to 2021, the data paints an even more troubling picture. During this  period, an alarming one out of every 125 children identifying as Black  or African American found themselves in foster care at any given point  in time. This points to a deep-seated systemic issue that transcends  temporal and geographical boundaries, further underscoring the urgent  need for reform.   Mr. Speaker, I stand before you today not just as an elected  Representative, but as a living testament to this profound truth. I am  an embodiment of the power of familial support and a witness to the  transformative impact it can have on a child's life. It is within the  secure confines of a loving family that a child can break free from the  constraints of financial, existential, and emotional insecurity, daring  to dream bigger, reach higher, and grow more fully.   A grim reality, however, casts a long shadow over our Nation--the  practice of unnecessary family separations. This is not a side issue or  a minor concern, but a grave matter that demands serious attention and  conscious action from each of us.   The current system as it stands is marred by prejudice and  arbitrariness, permitting the removal of children from their families  without the absolute justification of immediate harm. This is a  practice that we must challenge, question, and ultimately transform.   The era must come to an end when social workers and others were  permitted to pass judgment on a family's worthiness based on race,  economic status, or cultural and religious beliefs. A family's  integrity should not be a matter for prejudiced scrutiny but respected  as the bedrock of our society.   It is crucial to emphatically state that Black children, like all  children, need the nurturing care of their parents. They need to  experience life's joys and challenges within the safety net of their  own families, enriching their identity and strengthening their roots.   There exists a blatant contradiction when some claim to champion the  cause of families while simultaneously supporting policies that  splinter their very familial structures.   How can one profess commitment to family values while advocating for  policies that fundamentally undermine the very foundation of families?   Every family, regardless of their race, ethnicity, or geographical  origin, has an undeniable right to raise their children in an  environment free from undue governmental interference and unwarranted  judgment from uninvested bureaucrats. Be they Black, Hispanic,  indigenous, Asian, from the Appalachia, or from the South Side of  Chicago, every family deserves this opportunity.   Perhaps it is time to look inward and address the root issues that  plague our society. If we ensured a living wage for our workers, would  we not see a reduction in the number of children entering the foster  care system?   If we treated the root causes of addiction, would we not see fewer  children that would need to be separated from their families?   Moreover, if we could cease making assumptions based on racial  stereotypes about families different from our very own view, we might  prevent the stigmatization of countless children. We might stop  reducing them to mere cogs in the machinery of systemic racism and  bigotry and instead acknowledge their individuality, their potential,  and their dreams.   Today, I implore each and every one of us and you to present this to  the House and to lend your ears to the voices that often go unheard.  Listen to the stories of children and young people in the foster care  system, their struggles, their hopes, and their dreams. Remember the  dedicated caretakers who selflessly serve these children. Children who  have been placed in the foster care system, for reasons reckless or  legitimate, must never be rendered invisible or forgotten.   We must always remember that their lives matter. Their dreams are of  critical importance to the tapestry of our future. Their spiritual,  psychological, and emotional well-being is an essential cornerstone of  the America we aspire to become.   A child living with criticism--we have heard--learns to condemn. A  child exposed to hostility learns to fight. A child steeped in shame  learns guilt. However, if we raise a child in an environment filled  with encouragement, fairness, and approval, then they learn to be  confident, just, and to love themselves.   Our government's paramount responsibility is to the welfare of our  children. This responsibility outweighs any issues of national security  or economic superiority. It is the heart and soul of representative  government. Our constituents did not elect us to represent their vested  interests but to defend and advance policies that secure a brighter and  better future for their children.    Nobody sent us here to indulge in meaningless squabbles. We were not  elected to be rulers of insignificant territories. We were chosen to  represent their hopes and dreams and to make the task of raising and  keeping families together easier.   As we recently celebrated Juneteenth, we remember what formerly  enslaved Africans did after their emancipation. History bears witness  that they walked great distances in search of family members who had  been sold away and taken from them. They traversed the length and  breadth of the South, driven by an indomitable spirit and an unwavering  resolve to reunite their families. This is the spirit we should embody  as we observe National Reunification Month.   The Congressional Black Caucus members will not stand by and watch  families be torn apart in America again. No child should be thrust into  a system unless they are in immediate danger. This is our pledge, and  this is our solemn promise.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the life of my grandmother,  Gertrude Brown, who was a foster child who was orphaned at the age of  14. I represent her indomitable spirit.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the honorable gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs.  Cherfilus-McCormick).   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my co-chair,  Representative Jonathan Jackson, for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, in honor of Caribbean American Heritage Month, I rise  today to recognize Phyllisia Ross, whose prowess as a musician has  allowed her to create unique music that reflects her Caribbean  heritage. Since the age of 3, Ross has developed her craft of singing  and playing the piano. In 2006, Ross graduated from the world-renowned  A.W. Dreyfoos School of the Arts in West Palm Beach, Florida.   Throughout her career, she has been able to incorporate several  styles of genres in her music, ranging from classical to R&B, as well  as world music in several languages. Her hit single ``Konsa'' is  emblematic of her unique talents, paying homage to her Haitian roots in  its kompa production style.   Ross has brought her music around the globe--everywhere from the  Ivory Coast to Jamaica--touching audiences worldwide. In addition, Ross  also runs and operates her own independent music production company and  has helped mentor young artists.   I am proud to represent Ross and her extensive artistic contributions  to the Caribbean community and to the United States.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the Honorable Sheila  Cherfilus-McCormick for her remarks.   Mr. Speaker, you have heard from my distinguished colleagues about  family reunification.   I thank the Congressional Black Caucus chairman, Mr.  Steve Horsford.  I thank the Honorable Gwen Moore. I thank the Honorable   Donald Payne,  Jr. I thank my honorable colleagues who joined us today on all issues  of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus, our  constituents, Congress, and all Americans tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 24 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, June 21, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
