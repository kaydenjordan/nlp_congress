 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank the people of Michigan's 10th  Congressional District. I am honored to represent them and humbled by  their trust in electing me to the 115th Congress.   The weight of this office is not lost on me. As Majority Leader  McCarthy said:         If you walk on the floor of this House and you don't get       goosebumps, it's time to go home.    Standing here at this podium, I have goosebumps.   People often ask me why I ran for Congress. Put simply, I ran with  the goal of helping people achieve their American Dream. For too many,  the idea of the American Dream is just that: an idea, a fantasy, a  fairytale.    I believe in the American Dream because I have lived it. I was born  in South Boston to a working class family. Opportunity took my family  to Michigan when I was 11. My dad got a good job building trucks on the  line at General Motors, and my mom worked at the Salvation Army. My  parents worked hard to provide for me and my six younger siblings. I  learned the value of hard work at a young age watching my parents.   I was the first of my extended family to go to college and worked  full-time to pay for my education; and then I dedicated my career to  workforce training, helping people build the skills necessary to get  good jobs to begin their careers to support their families. There is  something about the pride that comes when someone gets a job. Their  whole world changes when they see what they are able to achieve and  what their work does for their families.   Over the last several years, failed policies and an unstable economy  have put the American Dream out of reach for many. Though overall  unemployment rates are down, long-term unemployment is high; labor  force participation rates have dropped dramatically, and wage growth is  anemic.                                time  1845    Instead of getting ahead, many Americans are just getting by.   In the November elections, Americans screamed for relief. My message  to the people of Michigan's 10th District is that your voices have been  heard. We are already working here in the House on measures to roll  back regulations to support families, businesses, and the economy, and  to breathe life back into the American Dream.   In order to make it possible for more people to achieve their  American Dream, we must give them the freedom and the tools to succeed.  This begins by stemming the extreme regulatory overreach, fixing our  healthcare system, and strengthening our workforce  [[Page H459]]  while restoring our critical infrastructure.   As we have learned in the last 8 years, we cannot regulate our way  towards a stronger economy. The opposite is true: government overreach  cripples our economy. From my years of running a business, I have  firsthand knowledge of how excessive regulations make it harder to  succeed. Time and resources that could be better spent on growing a  business and creating jobs are spent navigating a never-ending and  confusing maze of Federal regulations.   Many of those regulations have been imposed without a cost-benefit  analysis, placing costly burdens on families and businesses while  providing little benefit. Regulators have exceeded their authority by  placing undue burdens on those struggling to make the economy work.   The House has already acted by passing the REINS Act and the Midnight  Rules Relief Act. Each of these measures would put accountability where  it rightly belongs: with the people's elected Representatives in  Congress, not with unelected bureaucrats.   We are also reforming health care in American to prevent further harm  to families and businesses. Patients and doctors should be in charge of  their health care, not the government. Since the Affordable Care Act  was passed, patient choice and access to care has declined while costs  are ever increasing.   Despite all of the promises, many people who had plans or doctors  they liked could not keep them. Insurance carriers are forced to  severely narrow their networks to combat cost.   Our healthcare reform is a better way to increase accessibility and  patient choice, in addition to reducing cost. We will do that by  allowing purchase of coverage across State lines, authorizing  businesses and individuals to band together to increase purchasing  power and negotiate prices, allowing health savings accounts, and  expanding risk pools. Our plan focuses on putting power where it  belongs: with the people, with the patients.   Government overreach does not stop with our health care. I know that  surprises you. The one-size-fits-all approach to education legislation  in recent years has failed America's students. It is time to put  parents and individuals in control of their education and give them  options that will best suit their needs. I am eager to advance  solutions that will help students learn and be better equipped for  future jobs, to create flexibility for working families and prepare the  workforce for a modern economy.   In addition to a strong workforce, our modern economy requires a  robust infrastructure. It is essential that we protect and strengthen  America's infrastructure to keep Americans safe and create jobs, and I  plan to work with this House to do just that.   There is much work to be done, but I stand ready to work with my  colleagues in the House and Senate to revise the American Dream. It is  more than an idea. It should be more than a wish. I have lived it, and  I want every young person in America to have the ability to pursue  their American Dream.   Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for bringing that  passion for helping others, for bringing that passion to teach.   I have always said that I believe that those who want to get involved  in politics and run for elected office, there are two things that they  need to be a part of. Number one, they need to care for people deeply.  They need to make sure that they have people at the first and foremost.  They need to have alligator skin to let a lot of things roll off their  back, but they also need to have a heart that cares. They also need to  be willing to understand that our job involves teaching; and, Paul, I  appreciate you sharing that.   Our next speaker for the night, we share not only the privilege of  serving the people's House, but we also shared, up until just recently,  a common passion. We both served in the United States Air Force.  General Bacon distinguished himself in that regard, helping our airmen  all across the world, doing so with integrity and doing so with a  passion for this country that he will bring to this floor, and we are  excited about that.   He will take that passion for what is really the concerns of the  world and be a part of it. When I saw that in the Nebraska Home, when I  went out there and was walking with him and seeing and listening to him  talk, you could hear the desire to serve and to be a part of the  wonderful heartland of America.   I don't believe, Mr. Speaker, they could have sent a better witness  to not only blue proud Air Force values, but also American values. And,  hopefully, as we continue, all will see the Nebraska values shown in  General Don Bacon.   With that, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska's Second  Congressional District (Mr. Bacon).
