 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind Members  of the everyday faces being hurt by this government shutdown.   Mr. Speaker, 21 days into this crisis, the Central Valley has had  enough. I spoke to a woman from Modesto who drives 30 miles to work  every morning to serve our country as a TSA agent. She goes paycheck to  paycheck, supports her kids, pays her rent, healthcare, groceries. She  is not getting paid right now, and her daughter may have to drop out of  college because her mom can't afford her tuition.   What are we doing?   And it is not just Federal employees. Farmers in my district can't  apply for tariff relief because the Farm Services Agency isn't open.  Because HUD is closed, I have hundreds of families who won't be able to  pay their rent and are worried about being evicted.   This is an unnecessary crisis. The Central Valley--America--needs  this to stop. I urge everyone on this floor to put politics aside, to  work together, and to reopen our government.                            ____________________
