 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of my good  friend, Mike Falconite of Kentucky, who passed away on Friday, March  29, 2019, at the age of 62.   Mike was born to the late Joe Falconite and Betty Lou Falconite and  grew up in Cairo, Illinois. Mike's father owned and operated a heavy  equipment company, which Mike took control of and moved to Paducah with  his family in the 1980s.   Mike was a great friend of mine who will be remembered for his work  ethic, generosity, big heart, and passion for the outdoors.   Mike expanded his company to multiple States and employed hundreds of  people before selling it in 1995 and setting his sights on real estate  in Paducah, starting up Falconite Development. I admired Mike's vision  for Paducah and his enthusiasm for developing and expanding the  community.   Mike's motto was, ``The more you build, the more you learn.'' He  lived that motto in many aspects of his life.   When Mike was not looking for the next real estate venture, he  enjoyed boating at Kentucky Lake and hunting, which took him on many  adventures across the United States and other countries in search of  prized game.   He loved spending time with his family, including his two children,  Nicki Roof and Joe Falconite, plus seven grandchildren.   Mike was a humble, fair, and passionate man who was always willing to  help others in need. Giving the benefit of the doubt to anyone he  encountered, he will, undoubtedly, be remembered by those who loved him  as hardworking, charitable, and incredibly passionate. I join with all  of Mike's friends and family today in honoring his life, legacy, and  love for others.                        Congratulating Brandon Garnett     Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate Brandon Garnett of  Christian County for recently receiving the 2019 Friend of Agriculture  award.   Brandon Garnett has proved to be a strong advocate for agriculture  and the farmers of western Kentucky. He has facilitated a number of  important ag-related activities in the community, including the  Christian County Cattlemen's rodeo scholarships for local youth and the  soon-to-be ag expo center. Brandon is regional vice president for Farm  Credit of Mid-America and serves on several boards throughout the city  of Hopkinsville.   In receiving the Friend of Agriculture award, Brandon shared the role  his father played in shaping his outlook on being a friend to  agriculture and how ``to always know that agriculture was a way of life  and something that would always provide well if you put your heart into  it.''   I am proud to know we have individuals like Brandon who work  tirelessly to advocate on behalf of our agriculture community, serving,  teaching, and always offering a helping hand.   Again, I congratulate my good friend, Brandon Garnett, on being named  the 2019 Friend of Agriculture, and I look forward to his continued  success in Christian County and beyond.                            ____________________
