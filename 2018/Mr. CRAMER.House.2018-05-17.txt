 Mr. Chairman, not long ago, President Trump successfully  negotiated an agreement with Mexico to stop them from dumping illegally  subsidized sugar onto the U.S. market. This amendment would undo the  President's good work by reopening the floodgates to other foreign  countries to send us their subsidized sugar at below their costs of  production, further depressing the prices that my farmers receive.   Vote ``no'' on this amendment.
