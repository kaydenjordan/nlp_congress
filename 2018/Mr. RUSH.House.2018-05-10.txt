 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably absent in the House Chamber  for rollcall vote 178. Had I been present, I would have voted ``nay.''  Additionally, on rollcall No. 179, I was inadvertently recorded as  voting ``nay.'' I support H.R. 3053, the Nuclear Waste Policy  Amendments Act of 2017, and my vote should be recorded as ``yea.''                            ____________________
