 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following letter  from the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head Aquinnah expressing their concerns  about this legislation. I want to reiterate that I support this  legislation. However, I believe it is important that the concerns of  this sister tribe be included in this debate.                                                  Wampanoag Tribe of                                               Gay Head Aquinnah,                                                       Aquinnah, MA.      To: The United States House of Representatives, Honorable           Representatives      From: Chairwoman Cheryl Andrews-Maltais, The Wampanoag Tribe           of Gay Head Aquinnah (The Aquinnah Wampanoag)      Date: May 15, 2019      Re: H.R. 312    The Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head Aquinnah (Aquinnah Wampanoag Tribe)     Strenuously Opposes H.R. 312, Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe Reservation                             Reaffirmation Act         The Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head Aquinnah (Aquinnah       Wampanoag) strenuously opposes the above referenced Bill due       to the fact that it creates two classes of Tribes within the       same Wampanoag Tribal Nation.        H.R. 312 unfairly provides a pathway for economic       development for one Tribe (the Mashpee Wampanoag) while       simultaneously creating an obstruction to the other Wampanoag       Tribe (the Aquinnah Wampanoag) whose Tribal community also       lives within the same shared Ancestral territory of the       Wampanoag Nation.        The Bill sets forth a pathway for one Tribe (the Mashpee)       to acquire lands in trust outside of its original homeland       ``village site'' of the Town of Mashpee and does not provide       the same opportunity for the other Tribe (the Aquinnah).        H.R. 312 also removes all clouds of the applicability of       the Indian Reorganization Act (as Amended), and all other       laws enacted for the benefit of Federally Recognized Tribes       for one Tribe (the Mashpee) and not for the Aquinnah who is       of the same Wampanoag Nation and who was federally recognized       25 years earlier.        The Bill provides a remedy to the Department of the       Interior's (DOI's) egregious determination that the Wampanoag       are not eligible to have lands taken into trust for one Tribe       (the Mashpee Wampanoag), while  [[Page H3824]]       omitting the other Wampanoag Tribe (the Aquinnah Wampanoag)       from this remedy from which the Aquinnah Wampanoag are also       suffering.        The Aquinnah Wampanoag would support this Bill, H.R. 312 if       included as part of ``and for other purposes''. The simple       request is for a simple amendment to create fairness, equity       and parity for both Wampanoag Tribes within  Madam Speaker, of course I am reading from volume I, pages  22 through 24, inclusive.   ``Dozens of IRA employees were responsible for operating accounts and  personas on different U.S. social media platforms. The IRA referred to  employees assigned to operate the social  [[Page H3828]]  media accounts as `specialists.' Starting as early as 2014, the IRA's  U.S. operations included social media specialists focusing on Facebook,  YouTube, and Twitter. The IRA later added specialists who operated on  Tumblr and Instagram accounts.   ``Initially, the IRA created social media accounts that pretended to  be the personal accounts of U.S. persons. By early 2015, the IRA began  to create larger social media groups, or public social media pages that  claimed (falsely) to be affiliated with the U.S. political and  grassroots organizations. In certain cases, the IRA created accounts  that mimicked real U.S. organizations. For example, one IRA-controlled  Twitter account, @TEN--GOP, purported to be connected to the Tennessee  Republican Party. More commonly, the IRA created accounts in the name  of fictitious U.S. organizations and grassroots groups and used these  accounts to pose as anti-immigration groups, Tea Party activists, Black  Lives Matter protesters, and other U.S. social and political activists.   ``The IRA closely monitored the activity of the social media  accounts--redacted. By February 2016, internal IRA documents referred  to support for the Trump campaign and opposition to candidate Clinton.  For example,--redacted--directions to IRA operators--redacted. `Main  idea: Use any opportunity to criticize Hillary Clinton and the rest,  (except Sanders and Trump--we support them)'--redacted.   ``The focus on the U.S. Presidential campaign continued throughout  2016. In--redacted--2016 internal--redacted--reviewing the IRA- controlled Facebook book `Secured Borders' the author criticized the  `lower number of posts dedicated to criticizing Hillary Clinton' and  reminded the Facebook specialist, `it is imperative to intensify  criticizing Hillary Clinton.' IRA employees also acknowledged that  their work focused on influencing the U.S. Presidential election-- redacted.''    ``The IRA organized and promoted political rallies inside  the United States while posing as U.S. grassroots activists. First, the  IRA used one of its preexisting social media personas (Facebook groups  and Twitter accounts, for example) to announce and promote the event.  The IRA then sent a large number of direct messages to followers of its  social media account asking them to attend the event. From those who  responded with interest in attending, the IRA then sought a U.S. person  to serve as the event's coordinator. In most cases, the IRA account  operator would tell the U.S. person that they personally could not  attend the event due to some preexisting conflict or because they were  somewhere else in the United States. The IRA then further promoted the  event by contacting U.S. media about the event and directing them to  speak with the coordinator. After the event, the IRA posted videos and  photographs of the event to the IRA's social media accounts.   ``The office identified dozens of U.S. rallies organized by the IRA.  The earliest evidence of a rally was a `confederate rally' in November  2015. The IRA continued to organize rallies, even after the 2016 U.S.  Presidential election. The attendance at rallies varied. Some rallies  appear to have drawn few (if any) participants, while others drew  hundreds. The reach and success of these rallies was closely  monitored--redacted.''   ``Redacted.''   ``From June 2016 until the end of Presidential campaign, almost all  the U.S. rallies organized by the IRA focused on the U.S. election,  often promoting the Trump campaign and opposing the Clinton campaign.  Pro-Trump rallies included three in New York, a series of pro-Trump  rallies in Florida in August 2016, and a series of pro-Trump rallies in  October 2016 in Pennsylvania. The Florida rallies drew the attention of  the Trump campaign, which posted about the Miami rally on candidate  Trump's Facebook account (as discussed below).   ``Many of the same IRA employees who oversaw the IRA's social media  accounts also conducted the day-to-day recruiting for political rallies  inside the United States.''    Madam Speaker, I will be reading now from volume I, page  36.   ``Beginning in March 2016, units of the Russian Federation's Main  Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff (GRU) hacked the  computers and email accounts of organizations, employees, and  volunteers supporting the Clinton campaign, including the email account  of campaign chairman John Podesta. Starting in April 2016, the GRU  hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional  Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC).   ``The GRU targeted hundreds of email accounts used by Clinton  campaign employees, advisers, and volunteers. In total, the GRU stole  hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts  and networks. The GRU later released stolen Clinton campaign and DNC  documents through online personas, `DCLeaks' and `Guccifer 2.0,' and  later through the organization WikiLeaks. The release of the documents  was designed and timed to interfere with the 2016 U.S. Presidential  election and undermine the Clinton campaign.   ``The Trump campaign showed interest in the WikiLeaks releases and,  in the summer and fall of 2016--redacted. After--redacted--WikiLeaks'  first Clinton-related release--redacted--the Trump campaign stayed in  contact--redacted--about WikiLeaks' activities. The investigation was  unable to resolve--redacted--WikiLeaks' release of the stolen Podesta  emails on October 7, 2016, the same day a video from years earlier was  published of Trump using graphic language about women.''
