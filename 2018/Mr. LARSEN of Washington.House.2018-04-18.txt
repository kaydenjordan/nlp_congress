 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to express my  continued support of American maritime jobs through enforcement of the  Jones Act.   The Merchant Marine Act of 1920, more commonly known as the Jones  Act, was named for its primary sponsor at the time, Senator Wesley  Jones, of my home State, Washington State.   The Jones Act exists for good reason. It sustains and protects a  strong domestic maritime and shipbuilding industry. It creates jobs for  U.S. mariners, many of whom are veterans. It underpins U.S. maritime  defense policy and is essential to preserving national security  interests at home and abroad. The Jones Act requires the use of  American-owned and -operated vessels to move all waterborne cargo  between points in the U.S.   I have long maintained that the Jones Act ensures that domestic  industries can remain vibrant contributors in the global shipping  industry.   At its core, the Jones Act is a critical labor standard that helps  put U.S. seafarers to work and maintains important workplace rights. In  Washington State, approximately 60 percent of the State's ferries  employees working on vessels are Jones Act compliant.   In 2012, I called on the then-administration to protect American jobs  by adhering to the Jones Act in response to rising gas prices and the  proposed release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   Last year, I spoke up to support the Jones Act fleet in its heroic  response to the natural disaster that hit Puerto Rico and the U.S.  Virgin Islands.   As a member of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation  Subcommittee, I am committed to working with my colleagues to uphold  the longstanding tenets of the Jones Act to safeguard the important  role maritime industries play in our economy.   The Jones Act exists for good reason. We should use it to good  effect.                            ____________________
