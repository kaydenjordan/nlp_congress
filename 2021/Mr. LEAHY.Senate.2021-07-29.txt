 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as the distinguished Presiding Officer  knows from all his involvement and the negotiations that have been  going on, we do have an emergency security supplemental issue before  us. So I am speaking now to urge that the Senate take up and pass H.R.  3237, which is the Emergency Security Supplemental Appropriations Act  of 2021, which the House sent over, and we add a Leahy-Shelby  substitute amendment.   Let me describe a little bit for my colleagues what the Leahy-Shelby  substitute amendment is. It is the result of bipartisan compromise  between myself and Vice Chairman Shelby.   We have been working on this for weeks and weekends. Our staff has  been working late into the night. And I want to thank Senator Shelby  both for his hard work and his friendship.   This $2.1 billion package is designed to address the aftermath of the  violent insurrection that took place on January 6, is designed to heal  the remaining scars of the COVID pandemic on the Capitol Complex, and  provide the resources we need to ensure the safety of our Afghan  partners as we conclude our mission in that country.   Let me tell you why there is urgency in this. If we don't act, then  the Capitol Police will deplete salaries funding in literally a matter  of weeks. The National Guard all over the country will be forced to  cancel needed training to carry on their mission at home and abroad. We  all remember when we went out speaking to members of the National Guard  from most of our States who were here to help with the security of the  Capitol in January.   So if we did nothing, that would be sort of a security crisis  entirely of our own making in what it would do to the Capitol Police  and what it would do to our National Guard.   But by acting, we prevent that crisis. We provide the Capitol Police  with $70.7 million in resources for overtime pay, retention bonuses,  mental health services, and new equipment and training.   Let me tell you why this is necessary. Since January 6, 73 officers  have left the Capitol Police, and that is not sustainable. We have to  make a strong statement of support for those officers who defended this  building, and all it stands for, on that terrible day.   This week, the Nation is hearing the testimony of the officers who  fought the violent insurrectionist mob on that day, and their trauma is  real. Anybody watching their testimony knows it cannot be brushed  aside.   We also provide $521 million to fully fund the cost of the National  Guard deployment to Capitol Hill. From around the country, including my  own State of Vermont, the women and men of the National Guard responded  without hesitation to our call for help. We shouldn't hesitate to  reimburse those costs.   I remember during daylight hours and also late at night going around  thanking members of the National Guard, not just from my State but from  all the other States, for what they were doing. But I think it takes a  little bit more than just a thank-you. We basically told them we will  pay for this. Well, now we will.   But that is not all we need to do. We need to secure the Capitol  Complex. On January 6, the shattered windows and doors were broadcast  to the world, laying bare that our seat of democracy is not some  impenetrable fortress. We can't just replace the windows, fix the  doors, and say: OK. Everything is fixed. We need to secure the entire  complex, including the office buildings where thousands of public  servants work and countless constituents visit.   So our bill provides $300 million to harden accessible windows and  doors to the Capitol Building and the Senate and House Office Buildings  and to install new security cameras around the complex.   Our bill also fulfills our responsibility to support the dedicated  public servants who worked overtime, way overtime, to clean up the mess  left by a violent mob and diligently worked to ensure our safety during  the darkest hours of the pandemic.   We must support those who supported us. That is not just a political  or economic responsibility; that is a moral responsibility. That means  paying for the costs we have incurred protecting staff, the Members,  the entire Capitol community from COVID, including cleaning costs and  personal protective equipment, none of which has been paid for. Until  now, we covered the costs by robbing Peter to pay Paul. That is  unsustainable.   Our bill addresses this by providing $42.1 million to reimburse the  costs of cleaning, personal protective equipment, telework equipment,  and the salaries of employees and contractors who would have been laid  off in the height of the pandemic.   Finally, in the Leahy-Shelby legislation, we stand with the brave  Afghans who supported our mission through two decades of war. By now,  we have all seen the gruesome reports of men and women being summarily  executed in the street, sometimes in front of their families. Why?  Because they had supported us. And that slaughter is only going to  escalate.   We have to provide resources for additional special immigrant visas,  SIVs, for translators and other Afghans who worked with Americans over  the past two decades, as well as for additional humanitarian relief to  Afghan refugees.   Our bill does just that. It provides $1.125 billion to fulfill our  commitment to those brave Afghans.   Let me tell you what the funds will do. They will support emergency  transportation, housing, and other essential services to our Afghan  partners coming to the United States under special immigrant visas, and  humanitarian aid for the inevitable flood of Afghans fleeing to  neighboring countries. The United Nations has estimated that could  swell to 500,000 refugees in just the next few months.   We have also increased the number of Afghan special immigrant visas  by 8,000. We have made improvements to strengthen the program, expand  the reach of its protections.  [[Page S5154]]    The reason we have this in the Leahy-Shelby bill is that there is  bipartisan understanding that this is an urgent need, and we have, as  the United States of America, a moral responsibility to address it  immediately.   Now, some have said we should just do the bare minimum. Some will  say: Let's take care of the most pressing needs now and work on this  maybe later on--maybe. But I have served in the U.S. Senate long enough  to know that a promise to do something later is no promise at all. I  cannot accept a piecemeal approach to the urgent security needs facing  our Nation. They are facing us today, not sometime when we may think  about it a few months or years from now.   Vice Chairman Shelby has a proven track record of reaching bipartisan  compromise. I would note that this agreement does not include  everything I want. I am sure it includes some items that he would have  preferred to not be included. But it is a strong bipartisan bill. We  have come together to give the best piece of legislation possible for  the U.S. Senate.   A pandemic happened. A violent insurrection happened. And the  President announced the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.  The needs are urgent. We must address them now.   So I am urging all Senators to not only support the bill but actually  to pass the bill today because it still has to go back to the House of  Representatives this week. There is no time. There is no time left. It  is a good piece of legislation. It is a necessary piece of legislation,  and some would say, at least on the Afghan part, inevitable. Both  President Trump and President Biden said they wanted to withdraw our  troops this year. Well, they are withdrawing. Now we have to fulfill  our responsibility.   Mr. President, I know that Senator Shelby will be on the floor to  speak in a few moments, so I will suggest the absence of a quorum and  ask that Senator Shelby be recognized when we come out of the quorum  call.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment  and Senator Shelby's be called up.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act, I move to waive all applicable sections of  that act or any applicable budget points of order for purposes of the  pending amendment.   I ask unanimous consent to yield back all time.    I understand we are going to have a voice vote on the  Cotton amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 2124     I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to waive.    Madam President, I thank my colleagues for joining both  myself and Senator Shelby on the Leahy-Shelby amendment. There have  been weeks of negotiation, most of it quiet but weeks of negotiation  going on in this.   I am sure I can speak for both Senator Shelby and myself. We each  might not have gotten everything that we wanted, but on this specific  issue, we got what the country needed. We got the improvements for the  security of our Capitol, the symbol of our democracy. We showed what we  can do to help take care of the damage to the Capitol Police, what we  can do to help those who work so hard here in the Capitol, the men and  women throughout the Capitol and Capitol Complex facing the threat of  COVID.   And thanks to bipartisan efforts, we had the issue of people who had  worked with our military and our government in Afghanistan. And, now,  as we withdraw, something that both President Trump and President Biden  wanted to do within this timeframe--as we withdraw--they face  retribution from the Taliban. We had to show our commitment to protect  them and to save them, and there is money and laws that are in this  that will help.   All in all, it meant a lot of Republicans and a lot of Democrats had  to come together. I have been here longer than anybody else in this  body, and I have seen days when Republicans and Democrats come together  and we accomplish something, and I have seen times when we don't and  nothing gets accomplished.   I have also found, over these years, that nobody gets every single  thing they want, but you try and do things that will make the country  better, that will help the United States of America, that will help the  things that we stand for.   This bill, the fact that it has passed 98 to 0, is an example of  that. So I thank my colleagues.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further  remarks of mine, that I be able to add them to the Record, including so  many of the people who needed and should have been thanked for what  they have done, that they be added in the Record along with my earlier  statement.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           Chairman Leahy List for H.R. 3237 Staff for the Record         I would like to thank the staff of the Committee on       Appropriations on a bipartisan basis, for their significant       contributions on HR 3237, the Emergency Security Supplemental       Appropriations Act 2021, including Charles Kieffer, Chanda       Betourney, Erik Raven, Katy Hagan, Brigid Kolish, Drew Platt,       Jean Toal Eisen, Jennifer Eskra, Alex Keenan, Mike Gentile,       Jessica Berry, Hannah Chauvin, Tim Rieser, Sarita Vanka, Kali       Farahmand, Madeleine Granda, Jenny Winkler, Valerie Hutton,       Jay Tilton and Maddie Dunn, as well as Shannon Hines,       Jonathan Graffeo and David Adkins from Vice Chairman Shelby's       staff.     I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
