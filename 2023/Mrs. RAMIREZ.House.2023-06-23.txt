 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the new 56  citizens of our Nation in the city of Elgin, which I am proud to  represent in the Third Congressional District of Illinois. The city of  Elgin's New Citizen Recognition Ceremony is a cherished tradition and a  celebration that goes back 23 years.   Every single new U.S. citizen has a story. They took a journey that  has brought them to that citizenship ceremony. As their Congresswoman,  I couldn't be more proud of who they are, of their strength, of what  they have overcome, the sacrifices they have made, the changes, and the  geographical distances from their families.   I know it hasn't been easy, but they did it. I celebrate them and the  journey that has brought them to the United States.   They know that in Elgin, a city in Illinois' Third Congressional  District, they will always find a community with open doors and open  hearts.   ``Congratulations.'' ``Felicitaciones.''                            ____________________
