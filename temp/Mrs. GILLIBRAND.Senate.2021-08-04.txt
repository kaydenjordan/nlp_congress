 Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment.  It is a bipartisan amendment with Senator Wicker. And this is about  just giving basic safety regulations to those superlong, stretch  limousines.   The reason why Senator Schumer and I care about this, there was a  horrible, horrible incident in Upstate New York, in Schoharie, where 20  people were killed. In that 1 limousine, 17 passengers: 4 young women  from the same family--a mom lost 4 daughters--and 2 recently married  couples. They hired the limousine to go safely to a birthday party.   This cannot continue.   And I yield to Senator Wicker.
