 Mr. Speaker, I am here to recognize the Farmington High  School Robotics Team, an impressive group of students, known as the  Rogue Robotics, who exemplify the spirit of giving in Farmington.   About 5 years ago, the team received a message from Cillian Jackson's  father. Cillian is a young boy living in Farmington, Minnesota, who was  born with a genetic condition that makes it hard for him to get around.  His father reached out to the team to see if they would be interested  in building a custom wheelchair for him.   This talented robotics team took on the challenge and built a  wheelchair for Cillian. Over the past 5 years, they have built six more  custom wheelchairs free of charge for children with disabilities across  our community.   Each member of the Rogue Robotics team has used their talents and  expertise to serve our community, and I am tremendously impressed by  their talent, hard work, and dedication.   Our future in Minnesota is strong with these kids. I thank them for  showing us what selfless service looks like.                            ____________________
