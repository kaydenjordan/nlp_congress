 Madam President, I rise today to celebrate  Commissioner Candace Franks for all she has accomplished over her 40- year career with the Arkansas State Bank Department, ASBD. She will  retire as department commissioner in October, an especially significant  milestone given her appointment as the first female in this role and  her tenure as the longest serving commissioner in ASBD history.   Commissioner Franks' leadership at the ASBD has directly improved the  economic well-being of Arkansas communities and citizens by ensuring  safe, convenient, and competitive banking. The department was  established in 1903 to fulfill a simple yet essential role: regulate  Arkansas banks and bank holding companies. Since her arrival at the  department, she has worked tirelessly to achieve the mission of safe  and sound financial institutions that garner public confidence. An  impressive statistic demonstrates this dedication: When she began in  1980, the department oversaw institutions holding $7 billion in assets;  as she leaves in 2020, the institutions now hold over $123 billion in  assets.   She grounds herself in the notion that hard work, commitment, and  patience pay off. After completing three postsecondary degrees--two at  Arkansas State University in Jonesboro and one at the University of  Arkansas at Little Rock Bowen School of Law--she joined the ASBD as  general counsel in 1980. She held this position until she was promoted  to deputy commissioner and general counsel in 1995, before her  appointment to commissioner in 2007.   Commissioner Franks' ability to lead, guide, and better the State of  Arkansas extends beyond her critical role in the financial sector. From  2014 to 2015, she served as chairman of the Conference of State Bank  Supervisors, where she is now chairman emeritus. She currently serves  as chairman of the Arkansas Public Employees Retirement System after  being appointed to the board of trustees by Governor Asa Hutchinson in  2017. Additionally, she serves as a trustee on the Arkansas Teachers  Retirement System and the State Board of Finance.   It is with no surprise that Commissioner Franks has been repeatedly  recognized for her accomplished career and influence in Arkansas. For 3  consecutive years--1996, 1997, and 1998--she was honored by Arkansas  Business as one of the ``Top 100 Women in Arkansas.'' In 2010, she was  recognized by the same publication as one of 20 ``Women of Influence''  in Arkansas.   On behalf of Arkansas, our financial institutions, and the ASBD, I  thank Commissioner Candace Franks for her dedication to developing a  healthy banking system that improves the quality of life in Arkansas. I  wish her well in her retirement.                            ____________________
