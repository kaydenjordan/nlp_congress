 Mr. Speaker, I rise in memory of  Anand Nallathambi, who passed away on March 2. Mr. Nallathambi  epitomized the American Dream, rising from humble beginnings to become  the president and CEO of CoreLogic, a global company based in Irvine.   He led CoreLogic from its 2010 launch as a public company and  transformed it into a high-performing leader in the housing market,  employing over 5,000 Americans. Beyond his business leadership, Mr.  Nallathambi volunteered his time generously with many organizations,  including Operation HOPE and Cal State Fullerton.   He will long be remembered for his outstanding leadership, warm  personality, integrity, devotion to his family and faith, and service  to the community.   Please join me in celebrating the life of Mr. Nallathambi.                            ____________________
