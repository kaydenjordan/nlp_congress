 Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak on two  different subjects. The most important one is the first one: to thank a  lot of people who helped me to chair and oversee the confirmation of  Judge Brett Kavanaugh.   I should have given this speech 72 hours ago, but I was in a hurry to  get to the airport. So I am making up for lost time now.   As everyone knows, on Saturday the Senate confirmed Judge Brett  Kavanaugh as our newest Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. I  come to the floor to thank the Senate staff who helped to make that  confirmation possible.   Senators don't always recognize their staff as much as we probably  should, but I am proud of the work my staff accomplished over the last  3 months as we considered the nomination of Kavanaugh. They have worked  very diligently on this confirmation process of our new Justice, and  most of it was behind the scenes. They put in the long, long work hours  required, and they did it 7 days a week, if needed. The chairman's team  tackled the heavy workload before them, and I am tremendously grateful  for all they did to make this nomination a success.   First, on my staff, I would like to recognize my Judiciary counsel  staff director, Kolan Davis. Kolan's experience and sound judgment  keeps me out of a lot of trouble. I value his counsel today, just as I  have for the last 33 years that he has been on my staff.   By my side right here today is Mike Davis, the Judiciary Committee's  chief counsel for nominations and also an Iowan. He graduated from the  University of Iowa and Iowa Law. Mike brought the tenacity, diligence,  and everything else that was needed to lead Kavanaugh's confirmation.   The permanent nomination unit for the Senate Judiciary Committee,  working with Mike Davis, includes Lauren Mehler, Steve Kenny, Katharine  Willey, and Jessica Vu. Each of them worked incredibly hard. They have  worked hard on all nominations of lifetime appointments to the Federal  judiciary and over a long period of time, not just on Kavanaugh. Their  hard work is shown by the record number of judges the Senate has  confirmed this Congress. I think the number is 67 so far, besides 2  Supreme Court Justices. I believe there are 41 on the calendar right  now.   In addition to this team, Andrew Ferguson joined my staff to lead the  team of special counsels to specifically assist with the Supreme Court  nomination. Andrew led by example with his tireless work ethic and, of  course, his legal talent.   I also want to thank special counsels Tyler Badgley, Lucas Croslow,  Colleen Ernst, Megan McGlynn, and Collin White. This team read every  word of Justice Kavanaugh's more than 500,000 pages from his time as an  executive branch lawyer, the 307 opinions he authored on the DC Circuit  Court, and all other documents relevant to his nomination.   Rachel Mitchell was part of this special counsel team, offering her  expertise and many years of experience at a time when we needed extra  help when we had Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh before our committee for  a second set of hearings.   Law clerks Tim Rodriguez, Camille Peeples, Abby Hollenstein, Dario  Camacho, Elizabeth Donald, Michael Talent, Bob Minchin, Nathan  Williams, Sam Adkisson, and Asher Perez had the opportunity to  contribute and learn during this nomination. I thank them for their  hard work and service here in the Senate, on top of their rigorous  education. I thank the intern Jacob Ramer for his contribution as well.   Justice Kavanaugh's confirmation process resulted in a record number  of pages available to Senators, including questions for the record.  This team handled it all.   Over the course of my Senate service, I have established a reputation  for my oversight work. I am equipped with a permanent staff of  experienced investigators. When allegations of sexual assault were  brought to my attention on September 13, I was fortunate to have this  experienced and highly regarded division of my staff already on the job  [[Page S6713]]  to help run down every question and allegation we received.   I thank DeLisa Lay, Patrick Davis, Josh Flynn-Brown, Katherine Nikas,  Daniel Parker, and executive branch detailee Andy Hromyak for their  dedication to investigation, oversight, and accountability.   I also want to thank my talented communications team: Judiciary  Committee communications director Taylor Foy and Judiciary Committee  press secretary George Hartmann, as well as Michael Zona, Nicole  Tieman, and Alexa Den Herder for their hard work. October 6 will be a  memorable date for Taylor, marking both his wedding anniversary and the  day Justice Kavanaugh was confirmed.   I am thankful for my personal office staff, led by my chief of staff,  Jill Kozeny. She has been on my staff for 31 years. I have long  appreciated Jill's advice and all of her hard work on my behalf.   I am also grateful for Jennifer Heins, who makes a tremendous  contribution every day, and every staffer who was part of this  confirmation process, including Penne Barton, Zach Schultz, Katelyn  Schultz, Josie Wagler, and my State staff, who had to answer a lot of  telephone calls over a period of 3 months, just dealing with people for  and against the nomination of Justice Kavanaugh.   I very much appreciate the rest of my Judiciary Committee staff,  including my deputy staff director, Rita Lari, who took care of things  while I was on the floor and during the long hours in the hearing.   Finally, I appreciate the work of Leader McConnell's staff, most  importantly, John Abegg.                    Religious Freedom in China and Taiwan    Mr. President, tomorrow, October 10, is the 107th national day of the  Republic of China on Taiwan.   I would like to extend my congratulations to the people of Taiwan on  this very important occasion and to express my appreciation for the  U.S.-Taiwan relations. We were allies in World War II and have been  close strategic and economic partners for a very long time. However, as  the Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan has evolved into a  thriving free-market democracy that is today, our relationship has even  deepened and strengthened in a way that can only happen when two  countries share core values.   There are times when the economic or geopolitical interests of the  United States are aligned with those of another country that does not  fully embrace freedom as we do--whether that freedom is in the  marketplace of goods and services or the marketplace of ideas in a  democratic context. We can and should seek to engage with countries  that do not share our values where it is in our national interest, and  we do that.   Still, those relationships remain contingent on weighing economic and  security costs and benefits. On the other hand, with free-market  democracies like Taiwan, there is at the heart of our relationship a  very high degree of mutual understanding underpinning all of our  interactions. Our shared values mean that our long-term economic and  strategic interests are likely to remain aligned. For instance, market  economies are more likely to seek mutually beneficial free and fair  trade. Democracies tend not to seek hegemony but cooperation. In short,  our shared values provide the basis for an enduring and stable bond  that can only exist between free people.   One of those fundamental values that is dear to my heart is religious  freedom. I know my colleagues are aware of the disturbing reports out  of the People's Republic of China about the closing and destruction of  churches and the burning of Bibles. That is something we in the United  States just do not understand how anybody, any country, could take this  situation and think: Who is afraid of worshiping God? Well, it seems  they have some problem in China.    In Xinjiang Province, the Chinese Government has rounded up over 1  million Uighurs and Kazakh Muslims. Tibetan Buddhists and practitioners  of Falun Gong have also long had their freedom to practice their  beliefs suppressed. This should disturb all free people.   Of course, the Communist leaders of China have excuses for their  behavior. One of these is the need for sinicization of nonnative  religions. In other words, they think religions like Christianity as  freely practiced are somehow not compatible with Chinese society. Of  course, from our point of view, that is strictly nuts.   Just look at Taiwan. It has the same Chinese history, the same  Chinese language, the same Chinese culture as mainland China. Yet, on  Taiwan, Christians and other religious groups practice their faith  freely. No one gives even a second thought to whether this is  compatible with their history and tradition because it is a matter of  conscience, not a matter of undercutting the government. That is why I  don't understand why it is a problem for Beijing.   In fact, Taiwan has arguably preserved traditional Chinese cultures  better than on the mainland. Chiang Kai-shek was able to rescue and  bring to Taiwan some of the most valuable treasures from Chinese  history. Of course, these items in Taiwanese society, in general, were  spared the horrors of the cultural revolution. Of course, the cultural  revolution was when the Communist Party of China destroyed an untold  number of historical artifacts as well as cultural and religious sites.  Ancient Chinese texts were burned, and there were massive human rights  abuses.   Some have suggested that recent developments in China are the  beginning of a new sort of cultural revolution. I hope not because we  know what the results of that were 50 or 60 years ago.   Whatever the Communist Chinese Government is thinking, its actions  have shattered many illusions. The hope held by many in the United  States was that robust engagement with the People's Republic of China  on an economic and political level would help it to evolve into a free  market democracy. That hope has now dimmed significantly. Things seem  to be going quite in the opposite direction.   This is a bad sign, then, for U.S.-China relations. If the Chinese  leaders would like to correct their current course and improve  relations with the United States, just take the example of Taiwan. Just  look across the Taiwan Strait for that model: Chinese people, just like  they are in Beijing.   As the people of Taiwan celebrate their national day, I would like to  thank them for their friendship with our great country. The Republic of  China on Taiwan continues to be a strong partner in trade, security,  and human rights. In fact, I should note that a delegation from Taiwan  recently visited my home State of Iowa to increase their purchases of  soybeans, and I greatly appreciate that, along with 88,000 Iowa  farmers.   Finally, I would like to thank Taiwan for being a model of a free and  democratic society when it can have a mutually beneficial partnership  with the United States.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Colleen  Ernst, special counsel on my Judiciary Committee staff, be granted  floor privileges for the duration of today's session.
