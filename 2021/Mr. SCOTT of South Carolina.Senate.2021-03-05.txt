 Mr. President, I call up my amendment  No. 1030 and ask that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent  for 2 minutes of debate, equally divided.    Mr. President, I have been doing some  research as the ranking member of the Aging Committee. As of last  month, 40 percent of COVID-related deaths in this country were  residents or staff of long-term care facilities. Lawmakers are charged  with the responsibility of protecting the most vulnerable populations  in our country, and those numbers represent absolute failure.   Some States have underreported deaths in nursing homes, and some  public officials made this move intentionally, a clear effort to  deceive their populations into thinking the situation was not as dire.  Inaccurate information affects life-and-death decisions for  communities.   Requiring States to provide accurate data is common sense for anyone  who believes, as I do, that we should have a science-based, fact-driven  response to the pandemic. We should not offer more funding to States  that have mismanaged and then covered up their pandemic response. It  makes no sense.    I urge my colleagues to do the right  thing and vote in favor of this amendment.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent  to have 30 seconds to respond.    Thank you, Mr. President.   I would simply say that what my amendment does is it says that you  can't lie about the numbers. The bottom line, it simply says that it is  very important for us to have accurate information about the deaths in  nursing homes. The more accurate the information, the more likely we  are to have the best response.    Mr. President, I ask for 10 seconds to  respond to my good friend from Oregon.    Thank you, Mr. President.   I will just simply say that even President Biden himself has  suggested that investigations are warranted into this issue.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1030     I ask for the yeas and nays.
