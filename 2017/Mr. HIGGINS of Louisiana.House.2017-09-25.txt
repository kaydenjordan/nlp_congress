 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act. This much- needed legislation will drastically increase access to healthcare and  support services for our veterans.   Most importantly, this bill will help ensure continued access to  proven programs to address veterans' homelessness, healthcare, and  benefits. It also includes provisions to assist veteran caregivers,  husbands, wives, parents, and children of veterans who righteously  dedicate themselves to the care of their loved ones.   Veterans and their families have made the ultimate sacrifice for our  country, and we must uphold our promises to them. For too long,  Congress has ignored the needs of today's veteran population. It is  past time we focus on supporting our veterans, no matter when they  served. The Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act  addresses the priorities of today's population and ensures that the  money follows the veterans.    As a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and a cosponsor  of several of the stand-alone bills included in this package, I am  proud to see the committee and the House of Representatives come  together on behalf of these patriotic Americans who risked their lives  for our safety.
