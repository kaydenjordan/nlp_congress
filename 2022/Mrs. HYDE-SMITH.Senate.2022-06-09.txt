 Madam President, I am pleased to commend Mr.  Patrick Johnson, Jr., of Tunica, MS, for his service and contributions  to the State of Mississippi while serving as the 86th president of  Delta Council.   Organized in 1935, Delta Council plays an important role in uniting  agricultural, business, and economic development leadership to solve  problems and promote greater opportunities in the Mississippi Delta  region, which encompasses 19 counties in northwest Mississippi.   Mr. Johnson has worked tirelessly this year to advance the priorities  of Delta Council, including farm policy, economic development, flood  control, and education. As a partner in Cypress Brake Planting Company,  Tunica Air, Inc., and Buck Island Seed Company, he knows all too well  the challenges producers currently face with increased costs and  volatility in the agricultural industry. As a member of the Mississippi  Commission on Environmental Quality, he is dedicated to helping find  solutions to the Delta's groundwater and alluvial aquifer issues so  that future generations can continue to produce crops and enjoy the  recreation that is such a large part of the rich history of the  Mississippi Delta. Mr. Johnson also understands the importance of  economic development to the viability of the Delta and that, through  efforts like Delta Strong, the region will continue to successfully  attract new opportunities.   Mr. Johnson assumed the role of Delta Council president during a time  characterized by difficulties, such as the ongoing and disruptive  pandemic, rising inflation, and many other challenges. Patrick Johnson  has been a steady and calm leader over the past year and has  contributed his vast knowledge and service to many critical issues  during his tenure as president.   Outside of his time spent working on his farm and serving Delta  Council, Mr. Johnson contributes his time as a leader to many valuable  organizations. He serves as a Mississippi Department of Environmental  Quality commissioner, National Cotton Council Environmental Task Force  member, American Cotton Producers Farm Bill Task Force chairman, and  Tunica County Chamber of Commerce member. In addition to serving as a  member of Delta F.A.R.M., Mr. Johnson has also served on the Tunica  County Farm Service Agency Committee and is a past director of the  Tunica County Farm Bureau. Mr. Johnson and his wife, Emily, are members  of Tunica Presbyterian Church where he sings in the choir.   It is my pleasure to join the citizens throughout the Mississippi  Delta and the great State of Mississippi in offering congratulations to  Mr. Patrick Johnson, Jr., and sharing our appreciation with his wife  Emily Purifoy Johnson. His input over his year of service has  undoubtedly contributed to the overall continued success and influence  of this highly respected 87-year-old organization, Delta  Council.                            ____________________
