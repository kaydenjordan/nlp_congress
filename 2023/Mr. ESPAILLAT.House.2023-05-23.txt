 Mr. Speaker, ``There is no fair in life and death. If  it were, no good men would die young,'' said acclaimed author Mitch  Albom.   Eleven-year-old Alfa Barrie and his friend Garrett Warren, age 13,  vanished on Friday, May 12, in my district.   In what would become every parent's worst nightmare, their bodies  were recovered from the Hudson and Harlem Rivers late last week and  over this past weekend.   Our community is devastated and heartbroken over this tragedy. We  draw on our faith during times of tragedy such as this and seek comfort  and peace.   I extend my heartfelt condolences to Alfa's and Garrett's families,  friends, and all those who knew them.   Today, I stand on the House floor and ask for a full and thorough  investigation of this horrible event.                            ____________________
