 Madam President, on Friday, the day that thousands  of Federal workers in Nevada and across the country missed their first  paycheck of the Trump shutdown, I was in Reno meeting with two dozen  affected workers and families who work for our Federal Government.  These hard-working Nevadans who serve the American people in the U.S.  Coast Guard, the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Geological Survey,  the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Forest Service, and  government contractors told me about the struggles they are having,  their fears, and the very human consequences of the President's  decision to hold our government hostage.   These Nevadans shared how their finances and their whole lives have  been thrown into chaos by this reckless shutdown. Person after person  told me that without the promise of a paycheck, they are struggling to  pay their  [[Page S243]]  mortgage or rent, keep up with their other bills, and even put food on  the table for their families. Some are even cashing out their savings  while others consider taking out high-interest payday loans, risking  their good credit just to stay afloat.   It is not just Federal workers who were suffering. Entire families  have had the rug pulled out from under them because of this reckless  shutdown.   While I was in Reno, I had the opportunity to meet Brianna. She  talked to me about her family. She is a stay-at-home mom. She has two  beautiful daughters--as you can see--and her husband works in the Coast  Guard. He is a coastguardsman. Right now, he is reporting to work  without pay for the duration of this shutdown.   Brianna told me that without their sole source of income, her family  would struggle to make ends meet. She told me they are weighing the  decision to pull her oldest daughter out of school and to move in with  her parents until the shutdown is over. That is outrageous.   I can't tell you how many letters and emails I have also received in  the office. This is one from a veteran in Reno. He said:         I applaud you for standing up to Trump and not wasting       taxpayer money on a stupid wall that he promised Mexico would       pay for. However, as a Federal employee who is also a       disabled vet, I am asking that you support legislation to       assure that we do not lose pay and benefits because of this       shutdown. We are currently scheduled to receive our normal       pay on December 31, but after that, we have no more checks       coming until the shutdown is over. Despite what others on the       Hill have said, many Federal employees depend on those checks       and face real economic impacts when the government shuts       down. We are tired of being demonized by the right as       parasites and bureaucrats, and it is ridiculous that the       President wants to freeze our pay and stop all of our pay       raises. The Federal Government is the largest employer of       veterans, and we continue supporting our country throughout       our Federal service.    No family or individual in the United States of America should have  their life upended like this. So we ask that the Federal Government  reopen and that the majority leader bring the bill to the floor so we  can open this government on behalf of Federal workers not only in  Nevada but across the country.   I yield the floor.
