 Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate a remarkable milestone in  the history of the capital region of New York that I represent, the  135th anniversary of the YWCA of Northeastern New York.   From humble beginnings in 1888, this organization has grown into a  force in our community: transforming countless lives and promoting  empowerment, racial equality, and social justice in Schenectady and  well beyond.   For many years, the YWCA has stepped up to provide vital services and  resources for women and families in need, from affordable housing and  childcare to job training and counseling services.   Beyond that, the YWCA has long been a platform for the voices of  women, nurturing future leaders, and empowering individuals to stand up  for their own rights and the rights of others.   Through its commitment to eliminating racism, it has fostered  understanding and built bridges of solidarity across our diverse  community.   As we celebrate this momentous occasion, let us reflect on the  tremendous legacy of the YWCA of Northeastern New York.   Let us honor its accomplishments, and most importantly, let us  recommit ourselves to the principles of justice, equity, and  empowerment embodied by the YWCA.   Congratulations on this milestone, and here is to another 135 years  of transforming lives, strengthening communities, and building a  brighter future for each and every one.                            ____________________
