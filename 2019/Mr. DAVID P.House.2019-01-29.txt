 ROE of Tennessee. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Walker) for the work he has done as our past  chairman of the Republican Study Committee and now in leadership and  our Conference, and I appreciate the opportunity to be here tonight.   I remember, about 2 years ago, I was up late at night watching the  election returns, and then-President-elect Trump announced his  acceptance speech. He was not 3 minutes into his speech when he said  that he wanted to help our Nation's veterans.   It was very near and dear to my heart because I am a generation of  veterans. That was during the Vietnam war, and we were not so much  appreciated and treated rather shabbily by our country.   So I knew what was in President Trump's heart, and I wish he were  here tonight to be able to express that. Because every time I have been  in the room with him, he has appreciated the service of our Nation's 21  million living veterans.   Madam Speaker, 2 years ago, we had an opportunity to do something  about it, and, in a bipartisan way--and I do want to give thanks to  both sides of the aisle. This would not have happened without their  help. We started on a mission to really reform the way the VA provides  healthcare.   For those out there who don't know about our VA system, there are  over 150 VA medical centers, over 800 outpatient clinics that we have.   The VA is divided into, actually, three parts: It is healthcare, and  it is benefits, and it is cemeteries.   If you haven't visited a VA cemetery, you should, because it will  really make your heart feel good to see how we treat our Nation's  heroes.   We started, 2 years ago, with the idea that not all employees at work  at the VA are good employees and should be there. When I got to  Congress in 2010--I have been here, now, 10 years--there were 250,000  employees at the VA.   Now, the VA employs almost 370,000 people. But there were some  egregious acts that some of these folks had carried out, and they could  not be fired.   We passed a bill in a bipartisan way that allows us to terminate  poorly performing employees while maintaining the rights of those  employees who are there, 99.9 percent of whom are doing a great job for  our Nation's heroes.   The second thing most of us Congressmen hear about is disability  claims. When I got to Congress in 2009, there were a million backlogged  disability claims, veterans sometimes waiting until they died to get  their disability claim adjudicated. That number now is down to around  350,000--far too many.    We passed a bill at that point, about 18 months ago, the appeals  reform bill, and it has been piloted--called the RAMP program--which  has sped up.   Last Friday, I was in Nashville, Tennessee, going to our regional  office to  [[Page H1275]]  see how they were doing, and I ran into a gentleman who was using the  VA--just happened to be there, a veteran, about my age. He said: ``I  have been trying for 7 years to get my claim adjudicated, get taken  care of.'' In 90 days, with the new RAMP program--he had waited 7  years. In 90 days, it was solved.   That program goes live next month. The Secretary has approved it,  and, hopefully, now we can speed the claims and appeals process up.   A third bill that we passed, that I used in 1975 when I got out of  the Army and came back stateside from the Southeast Asia, is called the  GI bill. For those out there, it is an education bill, and it was  written, initially, by a World War II vet Harry G. Colmery. Mr. Colmery  wrote a bill and thought that we could really change our Nation by  educating veterans who were getting out of the military; and we did  just that, and it changed our Nation.   I am still appreciative, to this day, of the $300 a month that my  country invested in me when I had a young family, when I went back to  finish my education at the University of Tennessee, College of  Medicine. I was able to use that money to help me finish my training  and my education. But that terminated at 10 years. If I didn't use it  within 10 years, it went away.   Today, we passed a bill, fully paid for, that allows a veteran to use  their GI bill the rest of their life. And we know if someone is 23 when  they get out, when they are 40, maybe they might need retraining. Well,  now, they can get that.   The second thing we did in that bill--again, very personal to me--is  some veterans hadn't served long enough. If they earned a Purple Heart,  they didn't get the full benefit because they hadn't served enough  time. Now, if you shed blood for this Nation, you get the full GI bill,  and it should be that.   We also improved payment for our Gold Star families and others, and  we have added time for technical training. We know those courses  sometimes take longer.   We also funded, what is called the Veterans Choice Program three  times during the last Congress, and that is how veterans get care  outside the VA. We know that most VA hospitals can't provide everything  to everybody, and many veterans have to travel long, long distances to  see a doctor, to see a specialist.                                time  1600    I was visiting Oregon a couple years ago and found out that one  congressional district in Oregon had more square miles than the State  of Tennessee did. We had to develop a bill that allowed veterans in  rural areas to see a doctor and veterans in urban areas to do so.   We passed the VA MISSION Act, which was signed into law,  appropriately, on June the 6th of 2018, 74 years after D-day.   What this bill will do is the following. It will revise how veterans  get their care outside the VA. It has a second very important part  called the VA caregiver bill. Catastrophically injured, post-9/11 GIs  who were injured in battle now can have a caregiver given a stipend to  stay home so that they can stay out of the hospital.   But that did not apply to pre-9/11 veterans, Vietnam-era veterans  like I am, Korea, and World War II. We now provide that benefit for  those veterans.   Thirdly, we are looking at what is called an asset review of the VA.  This is something that really surprised me when I looked at the data.  The actual number of patients in hospital beds peaked in 1981. The  population has grown 40 percent, and we actually have 10 percent fewer  people in hospital beds than we did almost 40 years ago.   So medicine is changing, and the VA needs to change. It needs to go  through a self-evaluation, get right-sized, and get the VA healthcare  out where the patients live, where the veterans are.   We know that patients are moving, veterans are moving, from the  Northeast to the South and West, so we need to put those assets there.  That is what the VA bill will do.   There are a few other small things, Madam Speaker, that we did that  might not be big to some people but were huge to me, because my  Scoutmaster was killed in 1965 in Vietnam. His name was Thomas E.  Thayer. He was a first sergeant in the 101st Airborne Division, a great  man with four children.   When we have Gold Star families that sign a lease, let's say--and we  had this happen where they signed a lease. One was in North Carolina,  and the person would not release that woman from her lease, and she had  to pay that.   Now, if you lose your husband or your wife in combat, you can get out  of those. We also did the same thing for cable TV, for internet, and  for cell phones. If you are deployed, you can't use those things, so  you can get out of those long-term contracts.   The Veterans' Affairs Committee passed over 80 bills. Almost 50 of  them were signed into law to help our Nation's veterans.   We did have one very disappointing failure to me, and I have already  dropped a bill this term. It is called the blue water Navy bill. Just  to let our audience out there, the folks viewing this, know what it is,  there are veterans who served on surface ships in the territorial  waters just off Vietnam, off the coast. Actually, Agent Orange was used  in Korea, where I was. If you put your boots on the ground, then you  are given the presumption for certain diseases for disability benefits.  That does not occur for those men and women who served on surface  ships.   We passed it 382-0 in the House and could not get it moved in the  Senate. We are going to give them an opportunity to do the right thing  this next Congress.   Madam Speaker, it has been a privilege for me to serve for 10 years  on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, and we are committed in that  committee to continuing to serve our Nation's heroes and to give them  the benefits they have earned that allow us to be free.   I thank Mr. Walker for allowing me a few minutes to come down and  share these few things we did for our Nation's heroes.
