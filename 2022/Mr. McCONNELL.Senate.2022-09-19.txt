 Last week, the American people received yet another  absolutely crushing--crushing--inflation report. More than a year after  Washington Democrats' policies set off the worst overall inflation in  40 years, the prices of some of the most essential items for working  families are skyrocketing at their fastest rates in a generation.   Electricity costs are rising faster than they have since 1981, and  grocery inflation has eclipsed a high from 1979. Parents trying to put  food on the table are now contending with annual price hikes of 16.2  percent for a loaf of bread, 17 percent for a gallon of milk, and 40  percent more for a dozen eggs.   Now, the very same day this painful news broke, just a few hours  later, Washington Democrats threw a party for themselves on the White  House lawn, celebrating their economic policies.   You really can't make this stuff up.   The official numbers had just confirmed that American families have  seen the single worst year for both food and electricity inflation  since the fallout from Jimmy Carter. And the Democrats' response was to  throw themselves a party--a party--for spending hundreds of billions of  dollars more, raising taxes, and making working-class Americans pay off  the loans of doctors and lawyers.   You might think the Biden administration couldn't possibly get any  more out of touch. You would think that kind of display would have to  take the cake. But alas, last night, on ``60 Minutes,'' President Biden  gave an almost comically out-of-touch interview on the inflation  crisis.   The President argued--with a straight face--that the American people  ought to be grateful for last month's terrible inflation report because  it could have been even worse. Here was a quote:         Guess where we are? We're in a position where, in the last       several months, [inflation] hasn't spiked.    Struggling Americans are supposed to be grateful that we have  plateaued at a steady ongoing inflation rate of more than 8 percent?  The President wants a round of applause for steadily clocking month  after month after month of the worst inflation in 40 years?   The inflation rate plateauing does not mean that prices themselves  have leveled off. It means that prices are  [[Page S4810]]  still steadily climbing all the time, at a historically fast pace, the  worst in a generation.   Month after month after month, Democrats' policy failures are  continuing to add inflation on top of inflation. The inflation rate  plateauing above 8 percent does not mean that families are catching a  break. It means exactly the opposite. It means that families are  continuing to see prices go up and up and up all the time.   Simply surviving, just getting by, in Washington Democrats' economy  costs 8.3 percent more than it did a year ago, but remember, the 12- month numbers now dramatically understate the damage the Democrats have  done because it only looks back 1 year, when Democrats' inflation  spiral was already up and running.   Here is the number that really matters. Since the day that President  Biden was sworn in, since the day that this one-party Democratic  government took power, our country's inflation rate has been--listen to  this--13.2 percent. And according to President Biden, if you are angry  about that, if parents are upset, if workers are frustrated, they just  aren't putting things in proper perspective.   Considering the American people give President Biden a 38-percent  approval rating on his handling of the economy, I would say it is the  White House that needs to get some perspective, not the working people  of this country.   And get this: When President Biden was asked how we can avoid a  recession, since Democrats' policies have forced the Fed to raise their  rates sharply, the President doubled down on his fantasyland. He  suggested:         [W]e're growing the economy . . . it's growing in . . . a       way that it hasn't in years and years.    But, of course, that is complete nonsense. You measure real GDP  growth after inflation. From early 2017 until the beginning of the  COVID pandemic, Republican policies had the economy humming along with  robust growth, low unemployment, and low inflation--a great trifecta  for the American people.   But now, with President Biden's policies in place, we have seen two  consecutive quarters of real GDP actually falling. Once you account for  the inflation that Democrats have caused, our economy is not growing at  all. It is, in fact, shrinking.   Families talk about the term ``shrinkflation'' at the grocery store  or the big-box store. That means not only have prices gone up, but the  size of the package has gone down so you are both paying more and  getting less. Like the size of a bag of chips or a box of cookies or  the number of sheets in a roll of toilet paper or the weight of a bag  of fertilizer--higher prices, smaller quantities.   And this is basically what President Biden and Democrats have done to  the entire U.S. economy. Everything costs more, even as the GDP is  shrinking in real terms. Just like American families have seen their  real wages plummet after inflation, the same thing has happened to the  country as a whole for two quarters and counting.   So the President might want to talk to a couple of working Americans  who are trying to survive under his policies before he sits down for  his next TV interview.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
