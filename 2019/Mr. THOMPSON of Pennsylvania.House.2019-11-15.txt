 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  the Counseling for Career Choice Act, a bill I cosponsored with my  fellow Career and Technical Caucus co-chair, Congressman  Jim Langevin.  The Counseling for Career Choice Act aims to empower students by  providing effective counseling resources to learners of all ages.   Unfortunately, many students go to college without being fully aware  of their education and career opportunities and options. According to  the Coalition of Career Development, about one-third of high school  graduates do not go to college right away and often struggle to find  meaningful work.   Additionally, a business roundtable survey found that more than 90  percent of CEOs agree the skills gap is a significant threat to their  organizations. There are approximately 7 million unfilled jobs in the  United States, but equipping students with the necessary tools to  succeed will help us close this gap.   With increased counseling opportunities, students can take control of  their professional futures with confidence. Whether students choose the  traditional college route or apprenticeships and trade schools, proper  counseling can make a positive impact in the lives of students of all  ages.                            ____________________
