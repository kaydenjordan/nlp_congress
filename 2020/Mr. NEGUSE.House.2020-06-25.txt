 Madam Speaker, I want to extend my condolences to my good  friend and to the Speaker for her recent loss.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the George Floyd Justice in  Policing Act, a powerful and transformative bill that will ultimately  help save lives.   In the wake of the tragic deaths of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd,  Elijah McClain, Michael Marshall, and so many others, it is critical  and it is our duty to act. As a multicultural and multiracial movement  sweeps our Nation and as communities across the country plead for  change, it lands on each of us to act.   This bill will ban chokeholds. It will bring transparency by standing  up the  [[Page H2466]]  first ever national database of civilian police encounters, and it will  provide additional tools to the Department of Justice and State  attorneys general for pattern or practice investigations.   We must enact these reforms. We must stand up on the side of justice  and equality. We must act.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
