 Mr. Speaker, I don't even know if I need 2 minutes.   Look, this bill has some good things in it. Everybody admits that. It  does. Like every bill I have ever voted on, there is some good, there  is some bad. But this bill has more bad in it than good.   It has some good philosophy that I won't agree with the details. I  agree we should do something about repetitive loss properties. I think  everybody agrees with that, but not the draconian measures taken in  this bill.   We all agree that we need to help make it a stable fiscal platform,  but not what this bill does. That is the problem here. This is not a--I  have seen worse bills. As a matter of fact, I have seen worse flood  insurance bills, so this, I will have to admit, is an improvement over  the last horrendous flood insurance bill. But it is not even close yet.   And the problem here, this is a missed opportunity. Flood insurance  doesn't need to be partisan. It doesn't need to be based on  philosophical purity. This is a necessity to many Americans, many  middle class Americans, and there is no doubt, without winning or  losing any votes at home, we could work this out if the majority wanted  to. But you don't.   You don't want any Democratic votes. Apparently, you don't want all  the Republican votes. Why? I don't know. Maybe lighting candles at the  altar of certain philosophies.   When this bill--not if--when this bill fails in the Senate, you are  going to find a lot of people over this side who continue to want to  work with you to come up with a bill we can all embrace. I know that  will happen, and I look forward to that day.   This bill isn't it, and everybody here knows it.
