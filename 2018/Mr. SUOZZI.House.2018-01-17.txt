 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman so much for having us  here tonight. Based upon what he was just talking about, I am going to  talk about my father first. I am a first-generation American.   My father was brought to the United States by his mother when he was  4 years old. His father was already here. He came from Italy. His  father was already here working. He had joined the U.S. Army during  World War I and got his citizenship because of that, and my father was  naturalized as a citizen because of that. He was the first one in the  neighborhood to go to college, and he then fought in World War II and  got the Distinguished Flying Cross with three oak leaf clusters as a  navigator on a B-24.   He came back after the war, and he went to Harvard Law School on the  GI Bill. Imagine that, an Italian immigrant going to Harvard Law School  on the GI Bill in the 1940s.   He was discriminated against as an Italian American at the time--the  gentleman was just talking about that--and he couldn't get a job at a  big law firm. So he went back to our hometown of Glen Cove, Long  Island. He teamed up with another Italian guy. He started a law  practice. He ended up running for city court judge, and he became the  youngest judge in the history of New York State, at 28 years old.   My father really lived a great American success story. He was a man  who would proudly say ``what a country'' all the time.   My father died 2 weeks before my election in 2016. As I went through  his papers, I saw his yearbook from St. Dominic High School, when he  was 18 years old. They asked all the students: What's your goal in  life? Most people would talk about I want to become a lawyer or a  doctor or an engineer, or I want to do some sort of exotic travel. My  father wrote: ``My goal is to be a real American.''   Now, I had seen that when I was a kid, and I thought: Boy, I can't  believe how patriotic my father was as an 18-year-old.   But he died in 2016, in the middle of the Presidential campaign. A  lot of the rhetoric that we are hearing now was really hot then as  well. I realize that my father was 18 years old in 1939 and Mussolini  had teamed up with Hitler, and Italian Americans here in the United  States of America were viewed as fascists or mafioso, and that  discrimination was rife.   But the good people of this country and people in this body and  people like my father held on to the basic, fundamental concepts of  what makes America work. What makes America great are these basic,  fundamental ideas.   So, in dealing with the question of DACA and with immigration, we  have to look at some basic, fundamental American concepts. Let's first  remember that all immigrants, whether they are documented or  undocumented, are human beings and are entitled to be treated with  human respect and dignity.   The most fundamental concept in America is that all men and women are  created equal--not all men and women with a green card are created  equal, not all men and women who are citizens are created equal, not  all men and women from a particular country are created equal. All  human beings are equal and should be treated with human respect and  dignity.   I am concerned that the rhetoric that we are facing right now, that  the negativity that we are facing right now, that the uncertainty that  we are facing right now, that the outright assaults that we are facing  in some cases right now are causing so much anxiety in our country, and  it is diminishing our status as a beacon of hope to the world.   That is the great thing about America. That is what makes America  great is that we are a beacon of hope to the world. That beacon is  being diminished by the rhetoric and by our failure to address this  immigration crisis.   This is not a new phenomenon. This started in the 1980s when death  squads and civil wars and abject poverty  [[Page H462]]  forced people to flee from El Salvador over the border into the United  States by the tens of thousands. Starting with President Reagan,  through President Bush and President Clinton and on, we haven't  enforced our borders for that entire time, and now 11 million people in  this country are suffering with this uncertainty because we failed to  enforce our borders.   I am all for securing our borders, but let's return to being a beacon  of hope to the rest of the world, and let's stop the suffering and the  anxiety as we push people underground and we treat them as nonhuman  beings, entitled to human respect and human dignity.   I believe that this is the greatest country on Earth, and I believe  that my dad knew that. He also knew that a central part of our being  the greatest country on Earth is being that beacon of hope to so many  people, that said to the tired and the poor yearning to breathe free:  Come to our shores.   If we really want to make America great again, we have to reclaim  that mantle of being that beacon of hope.   I agree with all the wise comments that have been made by my  colleagues here today that the votes do exist in this House to resolve  this issue if we could get a bill put on the floor. There are so many  groups, so many Democrats, so many Republicans meeting throughout this  town on a regular basis to try to find a compromise to solve this  problem--Democrats and Republicans--but because there is nothing on the  floor, we can't get the votes presented in a public way. If it was put  on the floor, it would pass. We would have DACA. We would have the  Dream Act. We would have solutions to border security.   We need to recognize that we are all in this together, and we need to  rise up to the challenge to be the beacon of hope that we once were and  still should be to the world.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Castro for giving me the opportunity to  speak.                                time  1900     Mr. Speaker, I want bring up one thing I forgot to  mention.   I was the young mayor of the city of Glen Cove in 1994, and we had  day workers from Central and South America gathering on the street  corners seeking work. The community was divided. This was 1994. Just  think how long ago this is now, 23 years ago.   One group saying: Get those people out of here. And other people  saying: These poor guys are trying to live the American Dream the same  as your family did.   I ended up setting up the first day-worker gathering spot anywhere on  the East Coast of the United States of America in 1994. It was one of  the first things I did as mayor. We ended up bringing them indoors. If  you didn't get hired for the day, you could learn a skill, you could  learn to speak English, you could learn about the cultural norms of our  community. We said: If you play by the rules, we are going to help you.  If you break the rules, you are going to get in trouble.   The same guys that were on the street corners now have their own  businesses, they own their own homes, and their children go to school  with my children. That is the American Dream.   We have so much potential in this country if we could unleash it for  people who want to work 6 days a week and go to church on Sunday, if  only we could remove this anxiety and this threat that we are pushing  people underground and forcing them into an underground economy and  underground communities. If only we could lift this back up again, we  could accomplish so much.    Think about it. You are a kid going to school, you are  worried about taking tests. You are working every day, you are worried  about your job. You are worried somebody is sick in your family. You  are worried you don't have enough money to pay your bills. The normal  concerns of life. Heap on top of that a national debate that is  treating you as a pariah and creating such anxiety to rip families  apart. Think about how challenging that must be for those individuals,  those families that are facing that type of threat.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership.
