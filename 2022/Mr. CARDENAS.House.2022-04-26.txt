 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3525 to  commission a study for the creation of a National Museum of Asian  Pacific American History and Culture Act.   Asian Americans have been contributing to the fabric of our United  States of America from its earliest days, helping to build, shape, and  defend our great country.   This long-overdue museum will serve as a gateway for everyone to see,  feel, and understand the countless true stories of Asian Americans,  stories of perseverance, dedication, and beating the odds to achieve  their dreams. Those from trailblazers like Larry Itliong, a Filipino- American labor leader who organized with Latino civil rights leaders  like Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta.   My father worked in the fields, and I remember when I was a little  boy, he told me once, ``When I worked in the fields, I wanted to work  harder than everyone else. The people who always worked as hard as me  and challenged me were my Filipino colleagues working in the fields.''  I quoted him in English, although my father spoke to me in Spanish.   Or people like Constance Wu, Awkwafina, and Ali Wong, whose  contributions to the arts have positively impacted millions of  Americans. These stories and so many more deserve to be told and  understood.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this bill. I can't wait to see the  day this museum is on The Mall with the National Museum of the American  Latino, the American Women's History Museum, the National Museum of  African American History and Culture, and the National Museum of the  American Indian.   I would also like to take a point of privilege to say thank you to  Grace Meng, who at one time was the only Asian-American legislator in  the legislature in New York. Not the first one, but she was there by  herself, and she was a caucus of one, and she is now in the United  States Congress, serving our community proudly and representing her  community proudly as well.
