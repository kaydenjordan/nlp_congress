 I just don't even know why there aren't       uprisings all over the country. Maybe there will be.        President TRUMP. My administration will always stand       against violence, mayhem, and disorder.         We can impeach him every day of the week for       anything he's done.    Mr. Counsel SCHOEN. That same hatred and anger has led House managers  to ignore their own words and actions and set a dangerous double  standard.   The House managers spoke about rhetoric, about a constant drumbeat of  heated language. Well, as I am sure everyone watching expected, we need  to show you some of their own words.   (Text of video presentations.)          I just don't even know why there aren't       uprisings all over the country. Maybe there will be.         You've got to be ready to throw a punch.        We have to be ready to throw a punch.         People will do what they do.         Our mission is to fight. That is the guiding       purpose of House Democrats.        Fighting.        He has never forgotten who he is fighting for.        March and fought.        And we just have to fight.        But this is a fight for our country.         I just don't even know why there aren't       uprisings all over the country. Maybe there will be.        Unidentified Speaker. It was a violent night in St. Louis.       They shot and killed David in cold blood.        Ms. Hannah-Jones. Destroying property, which can be       replaced, is not violence.        Unidentified Speaker. This is an apartment complex on fire.       It just collapsed.        Unidentified Speaker. The building just collapsed.        Unidentified Speaker. I don't know where to go now. These       people did this for no reason.        Unidentified Speaker. This is just a snapshot of some of       the damage people will be waking up to.         Heartwarming to see so many people turn out       peacefully.         There are still legitimate concerns over the       integrity of our elections and of ensuring the principle of       one person, one vote.         But constantly shifting vote tallies in Ohio       and malfunctioning electronic machines which may not have       paper receipts have led to an additional loss of confidence       by the public. This is their only opportunity to have this       debate while the country is listening, and it is appropriate       to do so.    Mr. Counsel SCHOEN. House Manager Castro no longer has to try to  imagine it thanks to the distinguished Senator and others. It didn't  have to be this way. The Democrats promised unity. They promised to  deliver the very COVID relief, in the form of $2,000 stimulus checks,  that President Trump called for. They should have listened to their own  words of the past. I leave you with the wise words of Congressman Jerry  Nadler.   (Text of video presentation of 12-11-1998.)          I just don't even know why there aren't       uprisings all over the country. Maybe there will be.         We gotta be ready to throw a punch.        You have to be ready to throw a punch.         People will do what they do.         And we just have to fight.         I just don't even know why there aren't       uprisings all over the country, and maybe there will be.        President TRUMP. My administration will always stand       against violence, mayhem, and disorder.
