 Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, I stood on this very House  floor and I voted to condemn violence at crisis pregnancy centers. A  vote that was difficult to make, not because I think it was wrong to  condemn violence, I don't.   Rather, it was difficult as an American to watch this governing body  politicize the ideas of civility and decency that should be undoubtedly  woven through every last one of us.   Mr. Speaker, I stand before you to condemn violence again, this time  at an abortion clinic. I stand before you to acknowledge the violent  attack at the Planned Parenthood in Illinois last week. The cowardly  arson attack, a firebomb, damaged the building just days after abortion  protections were signed into law in Illinois.   Let there be no mistake, this was clearly intended to terrorize  women, girls, their families, and the medical professionals who serve  them from exercising reproductive freedoms.   Now, I ask my Republican colleagues to join me as I have joined them  in condemning violence and this violent attack. From this day forward,  I invite all Americans to unequivocally say that we must restore  civility and decency in every corner of our Nation because violence is  never the answer ever.                            ____________________
