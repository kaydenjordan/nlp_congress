 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight  the efforts the House is undertaking this week to combat our Nation's  opioid crisis. We will consider dozens of bills this week that are  aimed at fighting the crisis next door that affects our families, our  friends, and our loved ones.   Mr. Speaker, as you know, there is a nationwide epidemic of heroin  and prescription drug abuse that is resulting in drastic increases in  addiction rates, overdose deaths, and incarceration. No zip code in  this country is immune from this crisis.   Heroin and pain pill addiction does not discriminate on age, race,  gender or socioeconomic class. Your neighbor could be using heroin, or  so could their high-honors high school student. It is the public health  crisis of this generation.   As a senior member of the House Education and the Workforce  Committee, I want to highlight some of the work that we have done to  help combat this pandemic. The committee has collaboratively worked in  a bipartisa manner to introduce and support the following bills:    H.R. 5889, which requires Health and Human Services to provide  resources to early childhood care and education providers, as well as  professionals working with young children, on ways to properly  recognize and respond to children impacted by trauma related to  substance abuse.   H.R. 5890, which calls on the HHS to re-evaluate plans under the  Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to ensure the safe care of  infants affected by prenatal substance abuse.   H.R. 5891 establishes interagency task forces to effectively and  efficiently assist families who have been impacted by substance abuse  disorders.   H.R. 5892 establishes an Advisory Committee on Opioids and the  Workplace to advise the Secretary of Labor on actions the department  can take to address the impact of opioid abuse on the workplace.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of all these bills, and I urge my  colleagues to support them as well.   Mr. Speaker, the House is working to not only address this crisis,  but combat it and overcome it. We will do so through treatment and  recovery, through prevention, by protecting our communities, and by  fighting fentanyl and other ever-changing synthetic or foreign illicit  drugs.   No person can beat addiction alone, and overcoming this epidemic will  not only take a community-wide effort, but a nationwide effort, and  that is what we are prepared to do.

Each year on June 14, we celebrate the Stars and Stripes, which the  Second Continental Congress designated as a symbol of our Nation on  this day in 1777.   Since our founding, our flag has flown across the country and the  world. It has flown during both our most tragic moments and our  greatest triumphs. It has also been a glorious symbol of hope for our  brave servicemen and -women, who salute it, defend it, serve it, and,  in some cases, die for it to protect our freedom and liberty.   Yesterday, I was proud to join Secretary of the Army Mark Esper, Army  Chief of Staff General Milley, and the Sergeant Major of the Army to  celebrate the rich history of our Army.   Without the Army 243 years ago, we would not be the great Nation that  we are today. And today, we celebrate two great symbols of freedom, our  Army and our flag, which both symbolize America being the land of the  free and the home of the brave.                            ____________________
