 Madam President, I hope the country has heard what the  distinguished senior Senator from Maryland said. He sees this every  day. He sees it when he goes home to Baltimore. He sees it when he  talks with his neighbors. He sees it when he is in the grocery store.  He sees it at the temple. He sees it everywhere because these are the  people who are among our finest government workers, and they are out of  work. They are not being paid. I suspect he also sees it with the  contractors and subcontractors and those who are not on the Federal  payroll but who would lose their jobs if the Federal Government is  closed. So I compliment him for doing this.   I also appreciate what he said about the Appropriations Committee.  The distinguished Presiding Officer is one of the hardest working  chairs of the Appropriations subcommittees. I realize she cannot  respond in her position as Presiding Officer, but I note that she moved  her bill through. She did it in a way that got enormous support from  Republicans and Democrats across the political spectrum, which is the  way we are supposed to do it. It certainly has  [[Page S496]]  been the way we have seen it done with people from her State. We did it  with her father. We did it with my dear friend, Senator Stevens, when  he was chair of the Appropriations Committee. We did it when the  distinguished senior Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, was chair of  the overall committee. We got this done.   It is a lot of work. It is tremendous work for our staffs on both  sides of the aisle--a lot of late nights and weekends--but it is done  because the American people want the U.S. Government to work.   For a month now, much of the Federal Government has been closed for  business while the President of the United States rants and raves about  his personal obsession, the centerpiece of his extreme, anti- immigration agenda--a wall on our southern border.   For a month now, hundreds of thousands of dedicated public servants  have gone without a paycheck, even while many of them showed up for  work every single day. Many can no longer pay their bills. They worry  about how they are going to put food on the table. Many are looking for  temporary work. Many are standing in line at food pantries. These are  professionals. They are trying to figure out: How do we pay for  childcare or healthcare? How do we pay our student loans? How do we pay  for our mortgage?   It is not just the individuals. It is also our institutions. Our  Federal courts are running out of money. Our Federal courts are running  out of money. TSA agents are calling in sick in droves after weeks on  the job without pay. What is that doing with air traffic, especially  during the winter, in America?   Thousands of people who are trying to buy new homes, which boosts our  economy, with a Federal Housing Administration loan told: Come back  later.   Come back when?   Well, we don't know. Whenever President Trump ends the shutdown, come  back.   Small businesses and farmers cannot get federally backed loans. This  is after this body--under the leadership of the distinguished  Republican, Senator Roberts, and the distinguished Democrat, Senator  Stabenow--put through a 5-year farm bill, which brought almost all of  us together. We voted for it, but now farmers can't use it. They don't  even know what the new rules are because nobody is there to answer  their questions.   We scaled back on food inspections. We are not enforcing our clean  air and clean water rules. Our national parks are being vandalized and  permanently damaged as they remain open to the public, but they are not  staffed.   As a former prosecutor, here is something that sends a chill down my  spine. The FBI Agents Association says criminal investigations are  being stymied, grand jury subpoenas are going undelivered, and  confidential sources are being lost. It is quickly becoming a national  security threat.   This is America? This is the country I am proud to serve?   Either the President does not understand the harm his shutdown is  causing, or he does not care. But the country is suffering. Our economy  is suffering. The American people are suffering.   The Trump shutdown makes us look foolish and weak to the rest of the  world. This is the leader of the free world we are seeing as weak and  incompetent. However, over the weekend, the President addressed the  country from the White House, and he laid out his price to stop the  shutdown. Calling it a compromise, he made vague promises for  protections for DACA recipients and those who receive TPS, or temporary  protected status. We could end this shutdown, he said, and all U.S.  taxpayers had to do was fund his wall--a wasteful monument to himself  that he just wants the taxpayers to fund, even though he gave his word  to all Americans, over and over, that Mexico would pay for it. He did  not tell the truth then, and now he wants the American taxpayers to  bail him out.   It was a transparent attempt to look reasonable on national  television, while simultaneously holding the Federal Government and  millions of Americans hostage to a shutdown that harms our economy and  our communities every day. But as for offering temporary protections  for vulnerable immigrants--protections that he unilaterally chose to  strip, in the first place--in exchange for a permanent, ineffective  wall, nobody can call that reasonable. It is hardly reasonable to hold  the well-being of our Federal workforce or the services upon which many  in America rely as hostages to fund a pet project. The President cannot  bargain with something that he broke.   On Monday night, Senate Republicans unveiled the President's plan in  more detail. It became clear that what seemed like a disingenuous ploy  to seem reasonable to stop his slide in the polls was really a much  more cynical attempt to implement his hard-lined, anti-immigration  agenda, using the harm of the Trump shutdown as leverage.   The McConnell bill before us reads like an A-through-Z immigration  wish list for President Trump and those in his anti-immigrant inner  circle. First, the bill provides $5.7 billion for a wasteful monument  to the President's ego--a wall that most experts say would do little to  address the real problems on our southern border.   The bill, ultimately, dramatically increases the number of  Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or so-called ICE, detention beds  to 52,000 and ICE enforcement agents by 2,000. Even as I give these  numbers, I think of walking through these rooms with cages that  children are being kept in. Every one of us who has children or  grandchildren and every one of us who has gone through a school yard  and has seen young children has heard that the decibel level is  outstanding. They are laughing. They are playing. They are talking with  each other. When you go through these cages--these cages holding these  young, innocent children--there is dead silence--no laughter, no  talking with each other, no joking. There is dead silence.   This is America. What are we showing the rest of the world?   The Trump administration has repeatedly proven it does not know how  to prioritize its immigration enforcement resources. In the first 14  months of the Trump administration, ICE's arrests of immigrants with no  criminal convictions--no criminal convictions--spiked by 203 percent  over the last 14 months of the previous administration. So it shows  that President Trump has not deployed resources to round up, as he  said, ``bad hombres'' or threats to our national security. He is  deploying his enforcement resources to strike fear into the hearts of  all undocumented immigrants.   This administration's enforcement policies are driven by the cruel  desire to scare undocumented immigrants into believing that they or  their disabled children or their elderly parents could be next. Until  the Trump administration changes its dragnet approach to immigration  enforcement, Congress should not fund an expansion of his detention and  deportation force.   I would ask anybody to walk past those cages with the children in  them. I never thought I would see this in America. I have seen it in  war zones and other countries, but not America--not in the America I  love.   The bill also contains provisions that serve as fig leaves to fix  problems the Trump administration brought about in the first place. It  would provide 3 years of temporary protection to 700,000 individuals  currently involved in DACA--protections that are only required because  of the President's own decision to terminate the DACA Program. It would  not provide a path to citizenship for these Dreamers or any protections  to the nearly 1 million more individuals who are eligible for DACA  protections. Similarly, the bill would provide 3 years of temporary  protection to TPS recipients from a few countries with TPS designation  the Trump administration terminated in the first place.    If you provide permanent funding for a wall in exchange for  provisions that temporarily clean up messes of the Trump  administration's own making, that is not a compromise. It is taking  hostages on top of hostages. That is a nonstarter. Stripping away  protections from Dreamers and TPS recipients and then treating them  like pawns by suddenly offering them temporary reprieve--this is not  compassion. It is callous. It is wicked. It is evil.   Finally, the bill seeks to dismantle our humanitarian asylum system  as we  [[Page S497]]  know it. It contains provisions that would effectively bar any asylum  applications from Honduran, Guatemalan, and Salvadoran minors that are  not made from a designated processing center somewhere in Central  America. In other words, thousands of vulnerable children fleeing the  horrors of torture, murder, and rape in the Northern Triangle and  arriving at our border would be categorically barred from applying for  asylum and be subject to immediate removal proceedings.   The entire point of asylum is to provide an opportunity for those who  have fled from persecution and violence to seek refuge in our country.  Our asylum system would become distorted beyond recognition if,  instead, we punish these desperate children--punish them for the very  act of fleeing for their lives.   It is remarkable that the man whose name is on the book called ``The  Art of the Deal'' would think that Democrats would accept what amounts  to a deal breaker. This Democrat will not.   I welcome a debate on the need for immigration reform. I would remind  Senators that in 2013, when I was chairman of the Senate Judiciary  Committee, I issued a bipartisan bill to reform the immigration system  and secure our border through the committee. We held dozens of  hearings. We considered hundreds of amendments. We often met until late  at night. Then, when we brought it before the Senate, it got 68 votes  here on the Senate floor. Republicans and Democrats joined together to  give it a supermajority. So it shows it can be done, but not while the  President holds hostage all Americans, including hundreds of thousands  of Federal workers and their families.   I remind the Senate that on December 19, when Republicans controlled  the House and Republicans controlled the Senate, the Senate passed a  bipartisan bill to fund the government by a voice vote. In other words,  the Senate was for keeping the government open--until President Trump  changed the mind of our Republican leader.   The President and Senate Republicans should reopen the government  now, without any further foot-dragging. Congress and the Senate are a  coequal and independent branch of government. We have bipartisan bills  before Congress right now to do that. My friend the majority leader has  refused to bring them up while the country pays the price. This has to  end. I hope he will pull up the bipartisan bills. I hope he will let us  vote.   Again, I would say that we are looking weak to the rest of the world.  We are looking foolish to the rest of the world. But what hurts the  most are the people--not only Federal employees but contractors,  private industry, and everybody else in every one of our States--who  are suffering and watching our economy sink further as a result.   I see the distinguished majority leader on the floor, so I yield the  floor.                            ____________________
