 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a new friend I  made last week as I was traveling through the 22nd Congressional  District: April the Giraffe.   April is a resident of the Animal Adventure Park in Harpersville, New  York; and many of you may already know April as the star of the Giraffe  [[Page H5421]]  Cam which garnered worldwide attention this spring. The Giraffe Cam  captured April giving birth to her baby calf, Tajiri. The live video  was watched by more than 1 million viewers worldwide.   I am happy to report that April and I had a great meeting and that  Tajiri is growing and doing very well in the Animal Adventure Park. I  also had the unique opportunity to pose for a selfie with April from  high atop a perch. She was much obliging, especially since I had some  carrots to offer her.   Most importantly, during my visit to Animal Adventure Park, which is  a beautiful preservation of wild animals from around the world, I  learned that over the last 30 years the giraffe population numbers have  declined by over 40 percent, and giraffes are now listed in the  category of ``vulnerable to extinction,'' an important reminder that we  can all do more to preserve wildlife and to protect precious wild  species such as April and her darling baby, Taj, that share the planet  with us.                            ____________________
