 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Dr. Burgess, the chairman of  the Subcommittee on Health, for his fine leadership on this issue,  along with our colleagues, Mr. Mullin and my friend from Oregon and  colleague, Mr. Blumenauer, who put a lot of work into this. I commend  my colleague from Oregon for his strong statement in support of this  legislation.   Combating the opioid epidemic has been a top priority of all of us in  this Congress and especially on the Energy and Commerce Committee,  which I chair.   We have committed the last year and a half to examining the ways we  can respond to save lives, to help people in our communities, and to  end this deadly, deadly epidemic.   During that time, I have heard a lot of stories, both at the hearings  here in the Nation's Capital and back home in Oregon, where I have held  multiple roundtables and meetings in the communities about what we need  to do to help the outcome of patients; our neighbors, our friends, in  some cases family members, who are dealing with these addictions.   An extraordinary array of people, including patients, parents of  those suffering with addiction, the Oregon Hospital Association, Oregon  Governor Kate Brown, physicians, and substance use disorder treatment  providers, have all told me and our committee that existing Federal  confidentiality regulations and statute known as 42 CFR part 2, or  simply part 2, are working against--working against--patients and  making it harder to effectively treat addiction. There is hardly anyone  in the healthcare sector that we have not heard from on this issue.   One story that really comes to mind is that of Brandon McKee.  Brandon's brother, Dustin, testified before our Health Subcommittee  when we reviewed a near identical version of this legislation back in  May.   Tragically, Brandon had died of an opioid overdose at just 36 years  of age. He left behind three young children.   Speaking about his passing, his brother Dustin told the subcommittee:  ``Brandon's death was preventable. However, in part because of the  antiquated provisions contained within 42 CFR part 2, the medical  professionals that prescribed him opiate-based pain medications were  not able to identify him as a high-risk individual.''   You see, Brandon was prescribed opioids after back surgery on two  separate occasions despite his history of substance use disorder.  Within a few months of his second surgery, Brandon fatally overdosed on  heroin. That is why this bill is so important.   Health records for substance use disorder are the only--only--records  that are siloed in this way, preventing physicians from seeing the  complete picture of a patient they are treating. The doctors don't  know.   All other protected health information for every other disease falls  under HIPAA. The Overdose Prevention and Patient Safety Act will help  align Federal privacy standards for substance use disorder treatment  information more closely with HIPAA so that our doctors and our  addiction specialists can provide the highest and safest level of  treatment.   In short, this bill will improve coordination of care for patients  suffering from substance use disorder and save lives by helping to  prevent overdoses and dangerous drug interactions.   Now, I fully respect and understand the privacy concerns that some  still have, and the sensitivities about the idea of making changes to a  statute that has been in place since the 1970s, long before HIPAA. That  is why Representatives Mullin and Blumenauer worked in a bipartisan  fashion to include strong unlawful disclosure penalties, discrimination  protections, and breach notification requirements in this bill.   Doing so, H.R. 6082 will actually improve the ability to penalize  those who illegally disclose a patient's information. This isn't about  using this information for any other purpose than treating that patient  safely.   To be clear, there is no legal way for a patient's substance use  disorder treatment information to be used against them under this bill.  This bill, instead, expands protections for individuals seeking  addiction treatment above and beyond existing law, and it will help us  turn the tide on the opioid scourge.   I want to thank Mr. Mullin and Mr. Blumenauer once again for their  work, and the other Members on the committee. This bipartisan bill will  save lives. It is critically importantly to our efforts to combat the  opioid crisis, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6082.    Mr. Chair, I want to thank my colleague Mimi Walters and  those who have worked so closely with her on this really, really  important legislation. That is why I am here to support it, H.R. 5797,  the IMD CARE Act.   This is really commonsense legislation, and it will make a meaningful  change to the way Medicaid covers opioid use disorder for its  beneficiaries. In other words, low-income people in America who get  their medical assistance through Medicaid are going to get another  option and more help to deal with their addiction.   We are discussing this bill because a severely outdated policy limits  Medicaid's coverage in an institution for mental disease--that is what  an IMD is, institution for mental disease--for just 30 days. It is old.  It is antiquated. It doesn't work with today's treatment regimens.   This exclusion has been in place for decades--decades--certainly long  before the opioid crisis ever hit our country, and it is now a barrier  to critical care for low-income people on Medicaid when this vulnerable  population needs help with their addiction the most.   Representative Walters' thoughtful bill will allow State Medicaid  programs, from 2019 through 2023, to remove this antiquated Federal  barrier to treatment for those on Medicaid, age 21 to 64, with an  opioid use disorder, through a State plan amendment. In doing so,  Medicaid would pay for up to 30 total days of a beneficiary's care in  an IMD during a 12-month period, year.   So this is limited in scope. It is in partnership with the States. It  is low-income people getting more help from Medicaid to pay for this  extraordinarily important treatment.   This bill also collects much-needed data on the process. After taking  up this option, States will have to report on the number of individuals  with opioid use disorder under this plan, their length of stay, and the  type of treatment received upon discharge. This will help inform better  programs down the line.   As a Congress, we have been focused on combating the opioid crisis  for quite some time. This is not our first legislative attempt to help  people not only avoid this addiction, but overcome it. It will not be  our last. We will legislate; we will evaluate; we will legislate; we  will evaluate, as Republicans and Democrats have been doing for some  time.   It is an important step, this bill, that can help get people a vital  treatment to which they now don't have access. The American Hospital  Association, the National Governors Association, Republicans and  Democrats, hospitals and Governors across the country, have said:  Please do this. This is a need that is unmet. Please help us change  this antiquated Federal law.   Many stakeholder groups, including the National Association of State  Medicaid Directors, the people who run the Medicaid programs in States;  the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors, the  people who know what is needed most to overcome these situations; and  many others have talked to us in the committee. They have talked to me  personally. They are pleading with Congress to get rid of this barrier  to care, this outdated law, and to help people get treatment,  especially the low-income among us.   We have an opportunity to deliver, to help. We have an opportunity to  save lives. It is our responsibility, and we need to pass this  legislation.   Mr. Chair, I commend the gentlewoman from California for bringing  this issue to the committee and shepherding it through. It is so  important to pass this legislation. Let's help these people get the  care they need and want.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, though I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the Rush amendment to H.R.  5797, the IMD CARE Act. Earlier today, I spoke in support of the  underlying bill. It will make a meaningful change to the way Medicaid  covers opioid use disorder for its beneficiaries.   The amendment offered by my friend and colleague from Illinois,  Representative  Bobby Rush, will expand on that definition. It will  allow Medicaid to provide coverage for individuals seeking treatment  from cocaine and crack cocaine usage.   Looking at just 2016, opioids and cocaine caused 82 percent of all  drug overdose deaths in the United States. Cocaine alone kills more  than 10,000 Americans a year. News outlets have also reported fentanyl  being mixed in with cocaine, further complicating this tragic opioid  crisis.   This is an issue that Mr. Rush has passionately led on in the  committee, on the floor, and at home in his community.                                time  1415    We discussed it in the hearing room and at length in private while  working to fine-tune this legislation so that the best possible version  can become law.   So I want to thank Mr. Rush for this amendment, and I want people to  know that it really will improve and expand the scope of this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment and  support the underlying bill, which will dramatically aid in our  response to the opioid epidemic for all Americans, wherever they live.   Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the ranking Democrat on the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I conclude my comments by expressing my  disappointment that I have yet to persuade my friend from New Jersey to  support the underlying bill, although I appreciate his support of the  Rush amendment.   We know that our Governors, we know that our State Medicaid  directors, and we know those most involved in helping those with  addiction have pled with us to change this antiquated law so that  people of all colors, of all backgrounds, from anywhere in this  country, especially the low-income, can get access to meaningful,  modern, and helpful assistance to overcome their addiction. That is  what this bill does.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment, and  I encourage them to support the underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Fitzpatrick and his team for  agreeing to work with us on this issue. Unfortunately, this well- thought-out amendment would significantly alter the quality standards  we have built into the base bill, and such a change would require more  substantial vetting with key stakeholders than we have time for at this  point.   Because of that, we are not in position of being able to accept the  amendment at this time. However, we do feel that Mr. Fitzpatrick has  made a good start, so I will have our team do a comprehensive vetting  of the language and work with stakeholders to see if this is something  we could add as we move into conference with the Senate.   Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for his work and I look forward to  continuing to work with him on this and other issues and with the  Senate as we continue work on this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Texas, the  vice chairman of the Energy Subcommittee, who has just been a real  leader on energy issues across the country and around the globe.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to talk about the shale revolution and what  it has really meant not only for jobs and growth in America, but energy  worldwide. The shale revolution and the dramatic increase in domestic  oil and natural production has really been remarkable. American  innovation did this. Technological advancements did this. It  transformed the United States from an importer of natural gas to a  major exporter.   The positive effects, the enormous effects are being felt around the  globe. OPEC and the established gas suppliers like Russia, they all bet  against the United States. And guess what. They have lost.   Now, as American energy exports reach world markets, they are losing  their stranglehold on supply and prices. U.S. LNG exports are going to  markets across Asia, North America, Europe, and, yes, to even some of  our allies in the Middle East.   The rise of the U.S. as a global energy superpower means that energy  markets are more open. They are more transparent and competitive than  ever before. And we are creating great American jobs here. We really  are. If you look at these regions where these finds have been  discovered and now are being developed, people are getting good wages,  good jobs. They are building out, and it makes us stronger.   President Trump didn't want to say, ``We want to be energy  independent''; he wanted to say, ``America is going to be energy  dominant.'' And that is what we are becoming. That is a good thing.   By the way, as we find this new natural gas and we build out more  generating facilities, we are also reducing our carbon emissions. We  are below the 1995 levels. I don't think there is a country on the  planet that has reduced emissions more than the United States during  this period, so we are making progress there, too.   The increase in LNG exports around the globe over the past 2 years  will help us and is the result of continuing expansion in the U.S. LNG  export capacity. Two LNG projects, Sabine Pass in Louisiana and Cove  Point in Maryland, have been online since 2016. That has increased the  U.S. LNG export to 3.6 billion--that is with a B--cubic feet per day.   There are four more projects scheduled to come online in the next  couple of years: Elba Island LNG in Georgia and Cameron LNG in  Louisiana in 2018, and Freeport LNG and Corpus Christi LNG in Texas in  2019. Once completed, U.S. LNG export capacity is expected to reach 9.6  billion cubic feet per day by the end of 2019. That is the end of next  year.   Meanwhile, in my home State of Oregon, work continues on the Jordan  Cove LNG export facility in Coos Bay.   As export capacity continues to increase, the United States is  projected to become the third largest LNG exporter in the world by  2020, following closely behind Australia and Qatar.   As chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I have prioritized  a progrowth, proconsumer, all-of-the-above, and, frankly, all-of-the- below approach to energy that includes a focus on natural gas. We have  held a number of hearings.   We have looked into the overall impacts of natural gas development,  the enormous number of new jobs, good family wages, middle class jobs  and economic growth, the increased use of natural gas for power  generation, the reduction in carbon emissions, the need for new  infrastructure, and the advantages for domestic manufacturing and  global competitiveness.   We have looked at all of that in the Energy and Commerce Committee,  and my colleagues, many of whom you will  [[Page H5351]]  hear from tonight, Mr. Speaker, have really led on this. My colleague  from Texas (Mr. Olson) has really been a fine leader on the Energy  Subcommittee.   I encouraged our Members to work across the aisle. Growing American  energy and great-paying jobs should be a bipartisan effort. We need to  improve the regulatory process so we can solve some of the challenges  that may prevent us from reaching our full American potential.   This is our century. This is the American century, and we are seeing  great progress. We cut taxes. We are growing a million jobs and have  the lowest unemployment rate in decades. We have more job openings than  people to fill them, and a lot of that has to do with energy.   For example, members of the Energy and Commerce Committee have  introduced and the House has passed legislation that would modernize  the permitting processes for interstate and cross-border natural gas  pipelines and LNG export facilities. These bills all passed the House  on a bipartisan basis, Republicans and Democrats getting together,  getting things done. I am encouraged by the support they are receiving  in the Senate, too.   While these bills have not yet been signed into law, the Trump  administration is very receptive to our approach to improve  coordination and permit reviews and dedicate a single Federal lead  agency. Part of the swamp back here is there are so many people, so  many agencies, and so many duplicative processes that have been  accumulating for decades.   And if you are the innovator who wants to do something new, if you  want to grow jobs in your community, your State, your region, you have  got to navigate this morass of red tape and regulation and permitting.  About the time you think you have got it done, some other agency shows  up, and then somebody else and then somebody else, and your enormous  investment languishes out there for years and years and years.   We can do better than that. You can maintain all of the important  environmental law, but if we have a lead agency, we can find some  efficiency.   I think the vice chairman would agree that we might be able to find  efficiency in the Federal Government. I think it is possible. And I  think with the lead agency, we can.   This one-agency, one-decision process is now being rolled out because  of the Trump administration, with a goal to cut down permitting time to  2 years or less. I think you can probably do it faster than that, but,  hey, we will take 2 years or less. That is a big win.   Our energy security is stronger today than at any point in America's  history, due in large part to natural gas. Natural gas has contributed  to jobs and economic development both here in America, here at home,  and it is improving the efficiency of our power generation fleet. It is  increasing the competitiveness of our manufacturers who use it as both  a fuel and a feedstock. It is strengthening our hand diplomatically,  and it is creating jobs, jobs, jobs, good-paying jobs. It is a win-win  across the board.   And so I appreciate the vice chairman's leadership on this special  time for us to come to the House floor and share the great progress of  the Energy and Commerce Committee and the country, the bipartisan work  we are doing, and the great innovative future that lies before us.
