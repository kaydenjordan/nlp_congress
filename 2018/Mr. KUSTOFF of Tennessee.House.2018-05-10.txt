 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a great  American and good friend of mine, Lawrence J. Laurenzi.   After 36 years of service to the Department of Justice and the  Western District of Tennessee, Larry is retiring from his post as the  first assistant United States attorney. Larry Laurenzi has served under  6 Presidents, 11 Attorneys General, 9 United States attorneys; and on  four separate occasions, he has acted as the United States attorney  during times of vacancy.   During my time as the United States attorney, I saw firsthand Larry's  strong work ethic and his dedication to making west Tennessee a safer  place and defending the United States of America. Without a doubt,  Larry Laurenzi is a true public servant.   While Larry soon will no longer be a Federal prosecutor, I know that  he will never stop working to make his community a better place. I will  always be grateful for the time that we worked together. I wish Larry;  his wife, Pam; and their whole family the best as they begin their next  exciting chapter of life.   Congratulations, Larry                            ____________________
