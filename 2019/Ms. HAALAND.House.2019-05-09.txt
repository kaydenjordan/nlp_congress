 Madam Speaker, I rise today to stand in solidarity with  families suffering from this administration's inhumane policy of  separating children from their parents.   Earlier this week was the 1-year anniversary of this administration's  family separation policy, and today hundreds of families are still  separated. That means hundreds of children will not be with their  mothers on Mother's Day.   This week, I visited a Families Belong Together art installation  outside the Capitol by Paola Mendoza. It depicted a mother reaching out  in anguish for her child who was in a cage. That is the reality for  these families, and they will feel this trauma for the rest of their  lives.   Native Americans know all too well the long-lasting trauma of  government-enforced family separation. Our communities still struggle  with the impact that cruel assimilation policy has had.   This trauma cannot be undone. We cannot let this administration  forget the chaos it created in so many people's lives, and we must stop  the racist policies it continues to push.                            ____________________
