 Madam President, first, let me thank the Senator from  Florida for his steadfast actions in the Senate for many years  protecting Florida's waterways, which are not only a treasure to  Floridians but to all of us in America. He deserves to be congratulated  on that.                        Nomination of Brett Kavanaugh    Madam President, last night, in the wake of extremely serious and  troubling allegations about Supreme Court nominee Judge Kavanaugh,  Chairman Grassley announced he would hold a hearing of the Judiciary  Committee next Monday to examine the allegations. I want to salute the  six Republican Members who I believe changed Senator Grassley's mind  and Leader McConnell's mind. Their first instinct was, of course, to  rush it through, have this ridiculous phone call with Republican staff  and both of the now witnesses. That made no sense. But because a good  number of our Republican friends said there ought to be a hearing and  testimony, Senator Grassley and Senator McConnell backed off the  position of no hearings, and we will have one.   It is a good thing that we will have hearings, and they have to be  done right. There must be an agreement on witnesses, and the FBI should  be given time to reopen its background check investigation into Judge  Kavanaugh to speak to any potential witnesses or other relevant  individuals and update its analysis. That way, Senators will have the  necessary information and expert analysis at their disposal at the  hearing, making it much less likely that it will devolve into a he  said, she said affair.   Many say: Well, they have done background check investigations  several times on Judge Kavanaugh. That is true, but none of those  background investigations brought up this specific incident that  Professor Ford says happened. I believe that it did. Because the FBI  didn't know of these allegations before, reopening the background  investigation into these specific allegations, interviewing Judge  Kavanaugh, Professor Ford, Mr. Judge, and all other relevant witnesses,  is necessary.   We have two diametrically opposed stories. In my view, Professor Ford  is telling the truth. But if you don't want the hearing to be just a he  said, she said affair, an independent investigation--a background  check--by the FBI is essential.   This is not a criminal investigation. It has nothing to do with the  statute of limitations. It is simply what the FBI does for all  witnesses. When there are new and troubling allegations that emerge,  there is nothing wrong--in fact, it is fundamentally right to reopen  the background investigation so  [[Page S6201]]  that the FBI can query the witnesses involved, more so now than ever  because there are two diametrically opposed stories. It will make the  hearing far more valuable because once the Members see what the  witnesses have said to the FBI, they will be able to ask much better  questions, and they will be able to get at the truth. I think every  American wants the truth--Democrat, Republican, liberal, or  conservative. Instead, there is still an instinct from Leader McConnell  and Chairman Grassley to rush these things through.   The hearings must be done right, not rushed, fair to both sides,  respectful to both parties, and as dignified as possible under the  circumstances. Senators and witnesses need time to prepare testimony,  and Senators who are not on the committee need time to review and  consider that testimony once given. There must not be a hearing on  Monday and then a possible vote on the nominee a day or two after.   This morning, Chairman Grassley said there would be only two  witnesses. That is simply inadequate, unfair, wrong, and a desire not  to get at the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The minority has  always been able to request a number of witnesses to provide context  and expert opinion to the committee.   In this case, it certainly makes sense for one witness to be Mr. Mark  Judge, who was named in the Washington Post as present during the event  in question. How could we want to get at the truth and not have Mr.  Judge come to the hearing and be asked questions? If the majority will  not call him as a witness--as they should if they are really interested  in getting the whole truth--the minority must be able to do so. The  minority has always had a right to call witnesses.   But the bigger issue is that the committee must be able to call more  than two witnesses in total. We must not repeat the mistake of the  Anita Hill hearings. They were rushed and were a debacle. Do we want to  repeat that mistake? We cannot let these hearings be even more rushed  than the Anita Hill hearings.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are so hypocritical.  Leader McConnell delayed the nomination of Merrick Garland to fill the  seat of the late Justice Scalia. Leader McConnell delayed the filling  of Justice Scalia's seat for 10 months, and now they are saying we  can't take an additional 2 weeks to get to the truth of a very serious  allegation? What hypocrisy. What a 180-degree turn, depending on who is  charge and who is making the nomination. What a shame in this Senate.   Let's not rush the hearings. Let's not repeat the mistake that was  made in the Anita Hill hearings. Let's call all of the relevant  witnesses, not just two selected by Chairman Grassley, who didn't want  to call the hearing to begin with. Let's do this fair and full and  right, and whatever the outcome, the American people will at least  think this Senate took a fair shot at getting to the truth.   One additional point, Madam President. Much of the focus these past  few days has been on the nature of the allegations themselves, but  there is another focus that is equally important, and that is Judge  Kavanaugh's credibility.   Dr. Ford has made an exceptionally specific allegation, one she made  years ago--I think 6 years ago--to a family therapist, long before  Judge Kavanaugh was nominated for the Supreme Court. She volunteered to  take a lie detector test, which she passed. Judge Kavanaugh, meanwhile,  has ``categorically and unequivocally'' denied the entire story. There  is no wiggle room in that denial. He didn't say he didn't remember. It  is a whole and complete denial. Someone is not telling the truth.  Someone is not telling the truth.   Now, here is what President Trump said about sexual assault  allegations, quoted in Bob Woodward's book:         You've got to deny, deny, deny and push back on these       women. If you admit to anything and any culpability, then       you're dead. . . . You've got to be strong. You've got to be       aggressive. You've got to push back hard. You've got to deny       anything that's said about you. Never admit.    So the question looms, Is Judge Kavanaugh taking a page from  President Trump's playbook? Are the people advising Judge Kavanaugh  telling him to follow President Trump's dishonest strategy? We don't  know the answer, but it is certainly an important question.   If the facts of Dr. Ford's allegations prove to be true, as bad as  they are, they bring up a second point that is equally damning--that  the nominee is not credible. I can't understand why, but there are some  who say: Well, it happened 40 years ago; we should ignore it. These are  not typical things that happened to people 40 years ago; these  allegations are very serious stuff. But even if people want to dismiss  it--and I hope they will not--there is the issue of credibility.   It wouldn't be the first time questions were raised about the judge's  credibility. Facing a confirmation vote for the DC Circuit in 2004,  Brett Kavanaugh told Senator Feinstein that the White House didn't know  about any potential judicial nominees' views on abortion in the vast  majority of cases. Recently released emails show that wasn't entirely  accurate. Judge Kavanaugh repeatedly denied knowledge of the Bush  administration's policy on detention and interrogation, but recently  released emails show that wasn't accurate. Judge Kavanaugh denied  working on the controversial nomination of Judge William Pryor, but  recently released emails show that wasn't accurate either.   In the case of Dr. Ford's allegations, the Senate and the American  people must ask themselves, once again: Is Judge Kavanaugh's complete  denial credible? Both can't be true. What Dr. Ford is saying and what  Judge Kavanaugh is saying cannot be true. That is why we need hearings,  that is why we need a bunch of witnesses, and that is why we need the  FBI to continue its investigation--because there is an issue of  credibility here. When you are nominating someone to the highest Court  in the land, their credibility should be unimpeachable.                            Mueller Investigation    Mr. President, now on another matter, last night, President Trump  ordered the declassification of documents related to an ongoing  investigation into his own campaign and administration, which seems to  be a transparent attempt to give his legal team a sneak peek at the  government's investigative materials against this campaign. Just on its  face alone, the action by President Trump is an abuse of power and a  direct slap in the face of the rule of law and even more troubling  because President Trump regularly abuses power.   Even more troubling, law enforcement officials have informed Congress  that some of the disclosures will put at risk the most sensitive  sources and methods of our Nation's law enforcement and intelligence  professionals. There are thousands of Americans risking their lives as  informants in our intelligence services. If they can be exposed on the  whim of a President for political purposes, what does that say to them?  What does that say to future recruits, to the CIA, to the NSA, and so  many of these other agencies that are so important to our national  security?   It is a disgrace that the President did it. I have to say, it is an  equal disgrace that our Republican leadership in the House lets a small  band of House renegades, led by Chairman Nunes of the Intelligence  Committee, help undermine our intelligence agencies and the brave men  and women who risk their lives for us for his political purpose.   It is just like the infamous memo prepared by Representative Nunes  and the fake wiretapping scam. President Trump and a handful of his  water carriers in the House are willing to go to any length to cherry- pick, distort, and invent materials to discredit the Mueller  investigation, even when our national security and the safety of the  millions of Americans protected by the men and women in our  intelligence agencies are on the line.   This latest disclosure by President Trump is a blatant abuse of  power. It is the action of a dictator in a banana republic. It is not  politics as usual. It is not just Democrats and Republicans bandying  things about. It has never really happened before. It will make America  less safe.   I yield the floor.
