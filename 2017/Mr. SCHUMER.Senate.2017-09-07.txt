 Mr. President, first, let me thank my friend from  Florida for his kind words.   During these troubled times in the State of Florida--and we hope and  pray that Irma will not do too much damage, although signs point in the  other direction--the people of Florida could not have a stronger, more  effective, more compassionate advocate than the Senator from Florida,  Mr. Nelson. He knows how to get things done, and he knows how to inform  people about what is going on. He is able to reach across the aisle, in  a bipartisan way, to help in all times but, particularly, in times of  need.   The people of Florida are lucky to have him as their Senator,  particularly at this moment, I would say to my dear friend Bill Nelson.                            ____________________     Mr. President, yesterday, the congressional leadership  and the President reached a bipartisan deal on three crucial issues:  short-term aid for the victims of Hurricane Harvey, the debt ceiling,  and government funding.   Alongside the aid package for Texas and Louisiana, the Senate will  take up and pass an extension of government funding and the debt  ceiling, both to December 15, although that may be modified to December  8, as I understand it. We all agreed to work together to avoid a  default in December as well.   This is a good agreement for the American people, and everyone should  breathe a huge sigh of relief. This agreement takes the threat of a  shutdown and default off the table this month and will help us quickly  get resources to FEMA and other agencies that are helping with rescue  and recovery in the wake of Harvey and that will, in all likelihood, be  needed in the wake of Irma as well.   The Nation has been clamoring for bipartisanship--for the two parties  to work together to do the country's business--rather than to engage in  needless brinksmanship. Yesterday's agreement was a ray of hope for  both parties coming together on the big issues. Also, let it be a ray  of hope that both parties can come together to help the Dreamers.   We Democrats have said from the very beginning of this Congress that  we are willing to work with our Republican colleagues and the President  for the good of the country so long as we do not sacrifice our  principles. We have never been for obstruction for obstruction's sake,  and we will never be for that. This agreement is a reminder that we do  not always have to wait until the eleventh hour--risking shutdown,  risking default--in order to compromise and do the right thing.  Importantly, this agreement gives Congress a way forward on what are  some of the thorniest issues this month, allowing us to move to other  vital work.   The 3-month agreement is a compromise. In the past, so many of our  colleagues have said: ``If the other party is President, we are not  going to do anything to help.'' We did not want to say that. We did not  want to say: ``It is all on you.'' We wanted to compromise. A  compromise is just that--not dictating what should happen but working  together. I give the President credit for understanding that in the  Oval Office when Leader Pelosi and I made the compromise suggestion. I  thank him for it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, since President Trump's decision to end  DACA on Tuesday, it is absolutely necessary that Congress move forward  to pass a clean Dream Act while 800,000 Dreamers anxiously await action  by this Congress. There is no reason to wait. Let's put a clean Dream  Act on the floor, which I believe would pass by a significant margin,  and tell these hard-working Dreamers that they belong in this country,  too--the country they want to be part of desperately. If the majority  leader and Speaker do not offer a clean Dream Act, we Democrats will  find other legislative vehicles to attach it to until it passes.   Let me say this. I spoke once again to the President this morning. He  called and said that he wanted to help with the Dream Act. There are  many ways to help, and here are two. One is to persuade other  Republican Senators to cosponsor the bill that has been introduced by  Senators Durbin and Graham. We now have four Republican cosponsors, and  we need more. There are many in the Senate who seem to be sympathetic  to the Dream Act. Maybe the President can help them get to cosponsor.  The second is to urge my friend, the Republican leader from Kentucky,  and the Speaker of the House, Mr. Ryan, to put the Dream Act on the  floor ASAP. We can get this  [[Page S5026]]  done and get it done quickly. We can end the anguish of so many  Americans and make sure that our economy continues to move forward so  that it is not needlessly ripped apart.   There is other work that we have to do in healthcare to shore up the  marketplaces, particularly by guaranteeing the cost reduction programs.  Discussions in the HELP Committee between my good friend, Chairman  Alexander, and our great ranking member, Patty Murray, are proceeding  in a bipartisan way in, perhaps, the new spirit of the moment--maybe  longer than a moment, we hope and pray. I am hopeful that the full  Senate, this month, will be able to take up and consider bipartisan  legislation that emerges from the committee in order to stabilize and  improve our healthcare system.   In a similar vein, we must consider a multiyear reauthorization of  CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program. Chairman Hatch and  Ranking Member Wyden--again, in a bipartisan action--are having a  hearing on CHIP today in the Finance Committee, and that should be  another matter of immediate priority for this Senate.   Of course, as the people of Florida brace for Hurricane Irma, and the  people of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have gone through it  now, the Senate must be prepared to quickly respond to that storm just  as we are doing with Harvey. We also have to take into account some of  the other disasters that are occurring in States like Washington,  Oregon, California, and Montana. Wildfires are raging out of control.  They, too, will need disaster assistance. Because of the immediate and  strong impact of Harvey and, it seems, Irma, we should not forget that  our friends in the West will need disaster relief and will need it soon  as well.   The deal we reached with Republican leaders and President Trump  yesterday will allow Congress to work on all of these important items  this month and in the following months without there being a looming  specter of a shutdown or default on our debt. It should help to bring  both sides together to, ultimately, get another deal on sequester  relief, lower healthcare premiums, the Dreamers, and many other items  in December. That is good for this Congress, and that is good for the  American people--a ray of hope, as I said.   The majority leader has already filed cloture on this package. I hope  that we can proceed quickly--hopefully, today--to ensure its passage.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.                            ____________________
