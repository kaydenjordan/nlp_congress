 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, October is National Farm  to School Month. It is time when we celebrate food education, school  gardens, and lunch trays filled with healthy, local ingredients.   Farm to School brings healthy foods from local farms to  schoolchildren nationwide. The program teaches students about the path  from farm to fork and instills healthy eating habits that can last a  lifetime by introducing children to real food.   At the same time, use of local produce in school meals and  educational activities provides a new direct market opportunity for  family farmers in the area and lessens environmental impacts of  transporting food long distances.   More than 31 million children eat a school lunch 5 days a week, 180  days a year. If school lunch can taste great and support the local  community, everybody wins. In the early 1990s, there were merely a few  Farm to School programs, and today there are thousands.   Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee, it is  encouraging to see this program grow and our schoolchildren's diets  improving. A lifelong love of healthy, locally grown food from your  local farmer is something we can all support.                            ____________________
