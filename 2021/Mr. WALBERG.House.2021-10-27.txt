 Mr. Speaker, the cost of living keeps getting more  expensive, and we are reminded of that every time we fill up our cars  and trucks. Gasoline prices, at a 7-year high, are putting a strain on  family budgets.   When asked about surging gas prices, President Biden said, ``I don't  have a near-term solution.'' Well, Republicans do, with bills  languishing in committee. His lack of solutions is of little comfort to  struggling families.   Meanwhile, the President's $5 trillion tax-and-spending plan advances  extreme policies that will increase consumer costs and undermine  American energy. That includes imposing a new tax on home heating  bills, as well as an arbitrary drilling moratorium on Federal lands.   Banning domestic energy production will only increase reliance on  foreign energy sources, and motorists everywhere will pay with higher  prices at the pump.   Let's stop this reckless spending spree and attack on American energy  before it is too late.                            ____________________
