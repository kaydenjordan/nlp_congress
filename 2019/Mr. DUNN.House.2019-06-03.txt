 Mr. Speaker, today, this Congress will finally finish its  work on a disaster supplemental. For my district, this bill comes  almost 8 months after Hurricane Michael destroyed 12 counties in  Florida.   For 8 months, I have hammered this Congress about the devastation and  desperate needs in my communities. Month after month, one political  excuse after another has been used to delay the emergency disaster  supplemental, which had always been prompt and never been politicized.   But not this time. This time, my neighbors, my communities, and my  friends were left to wonder why Washington doesn't care about them.   Whatever became of Americans helping Americans?   To my colleagues who have unnecessarily delayed this bill, and who  may even today vote against it, I ask why. Some colleagues will say  their principles required a recorded vote, even though the content of  this bill has been known for months and debated for months. In fact, we  had a chance to vote on the amendments to it just 2 weeks ago.   For those upset at the cost, okay, spending in Washington is a  problem. But are they willing to make an empty gesture about balancing  the Federal budget on the backs of Americans who have lost everything?  Are they willing to force the airmen at Tyndall and the marines at Camp  Lejeune to halt work to repair their bases because they ran out of  money over a month ago? How about the foresters in the timber industry  who grow a commodity not covered by Federal crop insurance or any other  program? Are they willing to bankrupt them? A ``no'' vote today does  exactly that.   I would like to close with a simple thought for those who would think  about voting ``no'' on this bill: There but for the grace of God go I.   If this happened in their districts, would they be willing and  prepared to vote against their neighbors in the face of a disaster that  literally destroyed their homes and businesses? Would they look them in  the eye and vote ``no''? I rather doubt it.
