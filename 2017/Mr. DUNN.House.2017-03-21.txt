 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Alabama,  for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1101, the Small Business  Health Fairness Act.   As a surgeon in north Florida, I witnessed, firsthand, the disaster  that is ObamaCare. After ObamaCare was passed and implemented, small  medical practices across the country were faced with new, crippling  regulations that threatened their very existence.   I ran a small urology practice in Panama City and faced the very  devastation that these new regulations on small business imposed.  Thankfully, I was able to work with several other small practices to  create the Advanced Urology Institute, a 45-physician practice with  over 400 employees and offices throughout north Florida. Cooperation  and pooling of our resources allowed our practice to reduce costs and  to better serve our patients.   My experience underscores why the Small Business Health Fairness Act  is so crucial. The Small Business Health Fairness Act allows small  businesses to operate under the same principle when purchasing health  insurance for their employees.   By joining together across State lines through associations, small  businesses can achieve the economies of scale enjoyed by big businesses  and unions when purchasing health care. It will empower small  businesses to purchase better plans at a lower cost, which means  working families can get the care they need at a price they can afford.   It is time to put small business employees on a level playing field  with those of large businesses and those in unions. The health  insurance market and this bill does just that.
