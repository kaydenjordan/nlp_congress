 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a national champion  from my district, the Brick City Lions. Brick City is the nickname of  Newark, New Jersey, and the football team, the Brick City Lions, beat  the Arizona Far West Jets 34-24 to win the 2019 Pop Warner Division I  Junior Varsity national championship last month.   Lions coach Nasir Gains should be very proud of the work of his team.  He founded the Lions, also known as the Newark Youth Athletic  Foundation, in 2012. In that short time, his teams have succeeded at  every level.   But Coach Gains wants them to excel in the classroom as well. He  provides reading and math tutors plus standardized test classes to all  his players. He wants to build teams with character, confidence,  comradery, and brotherhood. Clearly, he is succeeding on and off the  field and deserves this recognition.   Coach Gains and his teams represent the best of Newark, and they are  a point of pride in our community.                            ____________________
