 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  the Dr. Lorna Breen Act.   My wife, Priya, is a physician. Like her colleagues, she has worked  tirelessly during the pandemic. During the pandemic, people have  referred to these healthcare workers as heroes, but as you know, our  heroes are human. They struggle with the trauma of losing colleagues  and patients, and they expose themselves to the daily risks of COVID.  They suffer from burnout, depression, and suicide.   In fact, before the pandemic, one physician every day committed  suicide. That rate has gone up significantly during the pandemic.   I am reminded of the situation of Dr. Scott Jolley in Utah. He would  sometimes work until 3 a.m. as the only physician on duty at his  hospital in Utah. By November 2020, he was diagnosed with PTSD, and by  February 2021, he had committed suicide.   These tragic losses and stories from medical professionals are  unending. Today, in honor of one of these heroes, Dr. Lorna Breen, the  Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Provider Protection Act was created and  will expand access to mental and behavioral health resources to help  our heroes, to help them cope with the stresses and anxieties that they  face every single day.   Unfortunately, some of those stresses and anxieties will continue  after this pandemic. That is why this act is so important. I look  forward to passing this necessary piece of legislation today.
