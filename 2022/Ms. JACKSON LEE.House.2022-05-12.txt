 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of this committee  and the ranking member on the floor, and let me express my appreciation  for his acknowledgment and recognition that we should do something. I  know he wants to do something. I am going to try to encourage him to do  something to alter his position and to stand with this legislation.   I want to take a moment to present tribute and accolades, as should  be, though he never asked for such, to our chairman. I cannot remember  a day that he did not gather us to meet with the transportation  security officers, the American Federation of Government Employees, and  others, over a decade maybe, as I chaired the Transportation Security  Committee of the Homeland Security Committee, where he has not worked  without ceasing, we have not joined him without ceasing, to be able to  rectify this injustice. That is what it is. It is a plain and simple  injustice.   I stand on this floor, in the name of Gerardo Hernandez, from the Los  Angeles airport, who died in the line of duty as a TSA officer. We met  his family. We mourn with them. We mourn with those who suffer.   We mourn with those who lost their lives in the pandemic, front line,  really front line, because before this was even diagnosed, there were  COVID patients or COVID-infected persons going through airports, and  our TSOs had no experience, protection, and they were becoming infected  by the dozens, and many died.   So breaking news today. This is a breaking news story. This  legislation now comes to remedy and solve the problem we have needed to  fix, really since 9/11 and the creation of the Department of Homeland  Security.   Specifically, the bill within 180 days eliminates personnel  authorities of the  [[Page H4885]]  Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Transportation  governing the conditions of employment of TSA employees, thus making  TSA employees subject to the personnel management system applicable to  other Federal employees.   Justice, fairness, the removal of injustice, sets forth transition  rules that protect the pay rates, leave rights and other rights of TSA  employees, and requires DHS to consult with the labor organizations  certified by the Federal Labor Relations Authority to carry out the  conversion of such positions.   Let me be very clear: Those persons sitting at desks may wind up in  some airport in the midst of crisis. How do I know? During Hurricane  Harvey, tens upon tens of TSA and TSO officers flew into Houston  because our officers were desperate, suffering from this catastrophic  flood and rain.   So it should be across the board. It is fair. It should be no  different from other Federal employees. The bill directs the TSA to  consult with public and private entities associated with the Federal  air marshals to address concerns regarding Federal air marshals,  including mental health and suicide rates. Absolutely imperative.   I went to the office of the Federal air marshals when they were under  stress, and they thought that they were imploding. The atmosphere of  flying, the hours, and the lack of sensitivity of those hours, drove  mental health cases among the Federal air marshals. We went to tell  them that they were important and that we were going to work on this.   How long must we wait? This bill prohibits TSA employees from using  or installing the social media video application TikTok on U.S.  Government-issued mobile devices, cleaning things up; requires DHS to  prioritize the hiring of veterans, including disabled veterans; and  directs the TSA to ensure its employees are provided proper guidance  regarding prevention and protections against the coronavirus.   But what it also does is retention. Do you know how much rotation  goes on with these TSOs? We bring them in young. Every time I go to  airports across America, they are the ones that I stop and talk to.  ``How long have you been here?'' I applaud them when they say: ``We  came in one year after.'' ``We came in the same year.'' I say: ``You  are lifers. Thank you for your service.''   We try to encourage younger persons to understand that they are on  the front lines saving lives, because as our chairman said, every day  they are picking up guns and various other things that can be a danger  to the traveling public. It is crucial that we recognize this.     Mr. Speaker, I acknowledge, again, the shooting  incident of Gerardo Hernandez, who became the first officer killed in  the line of duty. There was the machete attack at the Louis Armstrong  New Orleans International Airport that resulted in injury to Senior  Transportation Security Officer Carol Richel.   This bill represents longstanding priority. It is breaking news. I  stand with TSOs, and I stand with the TSA. It is long overdue. They  saved us after 9/11. They came in and stood in the gap. We must fix the  morale. We must get rid of the allegation of mismanagement and wasteful  procedures, retaliation against whistleblowers, low morale, and  security gaps within the agency. This will do that.   So I ask my colleagues to support it. I am on the Budget Committee,  and it is paid for. This is going to be the pathway of professionalism  at the airport, saving lives, protecting the public, and ensuring that  we have a professional, young, and growing team that is going to be  part of America's front lines. I ask my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 903, Rights for the TSA  Workforce Act, which bill modifies the workplace rights, protections,  and benefits applicable to Transportation Security Administration (TSA)  personnel.   Specifically, the bill:   Within 180 days, eliminates personnel authorities of the Department  of Homeland Security (DHS) and theDepartment of Transportation  governing the conditions of employment for TSA employees, thus making  TSA employees subject to the personnel management system applicable to  other federal employees;   Sets forth transition rules that protect the pay rates, leave rights,  and other rights of TSA employees; and   Requires DHS to consult with the labor organization certified by the  Federal Labor Relations Authority to carry out the conversion of such  positions.   The bill also:   Directs the TSA to consult with public and private entities  associated with the Federal Air Marshal Service to address concerns  regarding federal air marshals, including mental health and suicide  rates;   Prohibits TSA employees from using or installing the social media  video application TikTok on U.S.government-issued mobile devices;   Requires DHS to prioritize the hiring of veterans, including disabled  veterans; and   Directs the TSA to ensure its employees are provided proper guidance  regarding prevention and protections against the coronavirus (i.e., the  virus that causes COVID-19).   I view the work of the TSA as vital to our Nation's homeland  security.   The agency mission is to protect the Nation's transportation systems  to ensure freedom of movement for people and commerce.   The Committee on Homeland Security provides the needed policy  guidance and funding to ensure that the TSA has what it needs to create  and sustain the most effective transportation security as a high  performing counterterrorism organization.   The work of the TSA is a front-line Department of Homeland Security  and it is not easy--it can, in fact, be very dangerous.   Like many of my colleagues, I recall the shooting incident at LAX  that killed Gerardo Hernandez, who became the first TSA officer killed  in the line of duty; and the machete attack at the Louis Armstrong New  Orleans International Airport that resulted in injuries to Senior  Transportation Security Officer Carol Richel.   These incidents only highlight the difficult work that the men and  women of the TSA must perform each day to keep our Nation's airports  and flights safe.   The bill represents a longstanding priority, since the time I chaired  the Homeland Security Committee Subcommittee on Transportation Security  to extend to TSA employees the same rights and protections afforded to  all federal government employees. The legislation curtails TSA's broad  authorities to create and control its personnel systems, instead  requiring TSA to abide by the provisions of title 5 which regulate  personnel systems for most Federal agencies.   The bill would provide TSA employees with the workforce protections  and benefits available to most other Federal workers.   The bill sets forth transition rules to protect the rate of pay and  other rights of TSA employees during a transition to title 5.   The bill also requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to consult  with the appropriate labor organizations to carry out the transition.  This bill does not affect prohibitions against disloyalty and asserting  the right to strike against the federal government.   The bill also extends the timeline for the transition from 60 days to  a more realistic 180 days, and it contains language to protect  employees with grievances or disciplinary actions pending during the  transition.   Following terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, there was urgency  to have a whole of government response to secure the Nation's  commercial aviation.   On that day, nearly 3,000 people were killed in a series of  coordinated terrorist attacks in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.   The attacks resulted in the creation of the Transportation Security  Administration, which was designed to prevent similar attacks in the  future by removing the responsibility for transportation security from  private entities.   The Aviation and Transportation Security Act, passed by the 107th  Congress and signed on November 19, 2001, established TSA just 2 months  following the September 11, 2001 attacks.   The urgent need to provide a response to the available security  threat was facing meant that much of the work to provide administrative  structure and integration measures that would have woven in the civil  service protections now be added did not occur at that time.   The urgency of establishing TSA created another type of federal  employee with no job security, worker rights, and ability to advance  within the federal workforce.   The consequences of these shortcomings is high turnover, low morale,  and higher costs for training and retaining personnel that is  undermining the security we need for air travelers.   It is past time to make the changes provided by H.R. 1140, so the TSA  workforce is treated equally to other federal employees with the power  to advance and expand their opportunities as government employees.   Allegations about mismanagement, wasteful procedures, retaliation  against whistleblowers,  [[Page H4886]]  low morale, and security gaps within the Agency are causes for concern.   TSA has consistently struggled with low morale across the workforce,  ranking 303 out of 305 government agencies in 2016.   Low morale has a nexus to the high turnover rate within the ranks of  Transportation Security Officers (TSOs).   TSOs represent 70 percent of the TSA workforce, yet have been denied  full collective bargaining rights, whistleblower protections, and  opportunities to effectively raise issues in dispute to an independent  third party, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board.   Additionally, TSOs are subject to a pay and performance system that  does not track with the General Services (GS) wage system, the primary  wage system for Federal workers.   In order to move the workforce forward and see the necessary changes  envisioned, it is imperative for TSA's frontline personnel receive  these critical protections.   This is an essential bill that must be sent to the President's desk  because it will strengthen transportation security by removing barriers  that are undermining retention and professional development at the TSA.   I ask that my colleagues join me in voting in favor of HR. 903.   Thank you.    Madam Speaker, it is not often that America seems to  be stunned by an action of this Government. They may be disappointed,  they may disagree, but I can assure you they may not be stunned.   In the leak of the Supreme Court decision, America overall, over 70  percent, are stunned by the idea that women no longer are equal in this  Nation, they do not have women's rights, human rights, or reproductive  rights.   The tragedy for those of us who are lawyers, who understand the  Constitution, is that when settled law has been announced, that is your  belief. To see that that is no longer the standard of the highest court  in the land, we are stunned and, yes, we are frightened.   Roe v. Wade must be codified, reproductive rights must be protected,  and the anti-vigilante stalking bill, to stop individuals from stalking  women who are simply seeking healthcare and abortion, should be passed  by the House of Representatives. We must stand for human rights and  women's rights.                            ____________________
