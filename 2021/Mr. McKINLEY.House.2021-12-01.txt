 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida.   Madam Speaker, today the Supreme Court will hear a case that could  determine the future of unborn children. For nearly 50 years, the  Federal decision of Roe v. Wade has threatened the lives of the unborn.  This is a decision that should be left to the States.   In 1973 Justices were told that unborn babies could not live on their  own until the 28th week. But since then, there have been major advances  in medicine. We now know that as early as 5 weeks unborn babies have a  heartbeat and their brains are beginning to develop; by 10 weeks the  babies have legs and arms that can kick; and by 15 weeks babies can  taste, yawn, suck their thumb, and, more importantly, they can feel  pain. They are living, breathing, and feeling human beings who deserve  a chance to live.    Jeremiah and Isaiah said in the Bible that the Lord spoke to them in  the womb: ``Before you were born, I set you apart.''   Both these prophets were trying to tell us something: Every life is  precious. Therefore, Congress has a moral obligation to protect the  lives of our vulnerable, unborn children and to be their voice.   Today I hope the Supreme Court will agree.
