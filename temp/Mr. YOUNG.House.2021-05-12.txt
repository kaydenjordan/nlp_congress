 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the compliment. I  have been called a lot of things on this floor, including dean.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this legislation. I thank  my friend, Representative Gallego, for introducing it.   This is a good bill. It improves a bill which I passed 30 years ago,  and it is long overdue to make sure that it is running right.   As has been said, it establishes a new National Indian Resource  Services Center, which was created over 30 years ago. We are  reauthorizing these programs, making sure they work.   It is badly needed because of actions across the country with  indigenous people. We hope the victims will have better service than  they have in the past.   I congratulate the author of the legislation. I am a sponsor of the  legislation also. This is a good bill, and I urge the passage of this  bill.   All of my colleagues who understand, let's do the job we were told to  do when we became trustees of the indigenous people of this great  Nation of ours.   Again, I thank the chairman, the author of the legislation, and the  ranking member for all the work they have done.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member, chairman, and the  sponsor for this legislation.   It is a strange thing. If you hang around here long enough, you keep  seeing the other end of your tail. We introduced these bills, and there  was never any intention to exclude these two Tribes, never.   When Mo Udall and I started the gaming law, everybody thought we were  nuts. It has worked. But never were these two Tribes to be excluded. In  fact, this legislation rectifies that problem.   Mr. Speaker, I am happy to be a sponsor of the legislation, who  worked with you to try to get this done. This will be justice served to  all.
