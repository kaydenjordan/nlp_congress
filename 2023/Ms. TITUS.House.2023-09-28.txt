 Mr. Chair, I join my colleagues in support of this vital  amendment to avert more widespread harm to civilians in areas  contaminated by unexploded ordnance. We should ban these cluster bombs  and the transfer of them to other countries.   Thousands of communities across Southeast Asia, the Caucasus, and  Eastern Europe face lingering dangers from landmines and explosive  remnants of war dating back to World War II, the Vietnam war, and the  Indochina wars. Many Pacific island nations are still contaminated by  unexploded ordnance following World War II battles between Japan and  the Allied forces.   Cluster munitions have continued to be lethal decades after they were  originally deployed. Laos, the most heavily bombed country per capita  in history, has suffered an estimated 50,000 civilian casualties from  explosive remnants of war since 1964. Cambodia and Vietnam have seen  over 64,000 and 105,000 casualties since 1975, respectively.   If you have visited these countries, you may have encountered little  musical groups on the streets of the victims  [[Page H4836]]  of these cluster bombs. As you heard, what is really tragic is about  two-thirds of those who are injured or killed are children.   The land in Ukraine that has been contaminated by explosive ordnance  has increased tenfold and now takes up 30 percent of the country,  representing an area the size of Florida or twice the size of the  entire country of Portugal.   There is a reason why a vast majority of the international community,  our allies, have banned cluster bombs. It is time for the U.S. to  follow suit.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased to support this amendment, and I thank my  colleagues for bringing it.
