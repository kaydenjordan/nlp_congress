 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Today I rise in opposition to H.R. 4863. The bill we are debating  today encapsulates so much of what is wrong in Congress today.   This is a partisan bill to reauthorize what a bipartisan group  supports, and it is a failure of legislating. That is why we have a  partisan bill on the House floor to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.   This bill passed the House Financial Services Committee by three  votes, with Republicans all in opposition and a few of my Democratic  colleagues in opposition, as well. To say this is disappointing,  though, is an understatement.   Earlier this year, Chairwoman Waters and I joined together to  introduce a bipartisan Ex-Im reauthorization bill, and it is here in  the House known as H.R. 3407. It included sensible reforms for Ex-Im  that both parties could support.   The chairwoman and I spent hours negotiating this package, but,  unfortunately, she didn't have the support from her fellow Democrats to  bring that to markup, and that is a sad thing. It is a sad thing  because, in that bill, we took on the generational challenge that is  incumbent upon us as American policymakers to be sensible about, which  is the threat and aggression of China, both the economic and military  aggressiveness of that regime.   The bill that we negotiated would have served as the most  comprehensive and the longest extension to an authorization of the Ex- Im Bank, and it had a chance to get the President's signature and  actually be legislated in the Senate, as well.   Sadly, the Democrats walked away from that agreement because it  limited Ex-Im's subsidies to some businesses owned by the Chinese  Communist Party. The Democratic majority stripped out all the reforms  we had agreed to, and what we are left with in this bill text is a  restatement of current law and current practice by the Export-Import  Bank on this list of Chinese businesses that the Bank cannot do  business with. They don't do business with them, and that creates  another glaring hole for abuse.   The President has a Statement of Administration Policy just issued  from the White House, and it says the President would veto this bill,  so it is not going to get signed into law.   Moreover, the Senate majority leader said this morning: ``'We're not  going to pass the House bill,' McConnell said.'' We do not want that  bill. ``We do want to extend Ex-Im. A logical place to do that would be  on the CR,'' on the continuing resolution, which will happen. That is  what is going to happen.   So those watching, those listening here, this is all a show; and at  the end of the day, this won't make it into law. We are going to have a  clean extension of this Bank, which is an important economic tool for  us.   In our bipartisan agreement, though, the most important compromise we  had reached is that provision to limit Ex-Im's support for the Chinese  Communist Party.   As we all know, Beijing poses a strategic threat to our national  interest through its economic and military aggression. We know about  the Chinese Government's shocking abuse of human rights. We see this in  Hong Kong and the suppression of freedom there.   We know the Chinese Government's true motives for the Belt and Road  Initiative and the Made in China 2025 initiative, and that is to extend  China's global dominance.   They are not a strategic ally; they are a threat. And if we are savvy  to this, we will ensure that we don't take an important tool of our  government and subsidize Beijing. If we want to counter Beijing's  ambitions, we shouldn't use Ex-Im to provide cheap financing for the  Chinese Communist Party.   To compete with Beijing, we cannot subsidize Beijing. It is bad  policy for Americans, and we should agree on that. And, in fact, we did  in the bill that Chairwoman Waters and I filed.    To be clear, Republicans support selling American goods and services  around the globe and in China. That is why we support the reset of the  trade arrangement with China that the President is negotiating. It is a  very important thing.   We also know that the Chinese Communist Party sits on $3 trillion of  dollar-denominated reserves. This debate is not about commerce; it is  about financial assistance. Why use a mechanism of our government to  subsidize the Chinese economy? Why would we do that? That is not sound  policy. That is not good policy.   And when we marked up this bill, the Democrats raised two interesting  counterarguments to this view. The first one was--amazingly and, I  think, absurdly--that the Financial Services Committee should not weigh  in on any international matter, even though at Ex-Im's creation, the  focus was on Marxist-Leninist countries and Soviet aggression  internationally. We wanted more trading partners to us in selling  American goods. Well, I think, likewise, we have a similar challenge  with China this day.   Even though Ex-Im has been used as a tool of foreign policy from the  very beginning, this argument was made in committee.   We also have important work that we do with oversight of the World  Bank, the International Monetary Fund, a number of global institutions  coming out of the financial services arena. All of these things fall  under the Financial Services Committee's purview, and Democrats on this  committee shouldn't opine that Ex-Im can't get into this. Ex-Im, at its  creation, got into it and continues to get into it; and that is the  nature of Ex-Im financing: to have more allies with us in opposition to  other regimes around the globe.   The second argument the Democrats put forth is that their partisan  bill has limits on China anyway because it bars Ex-Im from financing  the People's Liberation Army, which current law prevents American  companies from doing that directly. So it is a restatement of policy,  existing law.   It says that companies on the Department of Commerce's entity list  are banned from financing. Well, the joke's on that argument because  those people on the entity list, we can't do commerce with them--not  even a question of who subsidizes it or not.  [[Page H8847]]    So it is all a complete kabuki dance. And it is of no surprise to  folks watching or listening to this debate that Ex-Im doesn't provide  financial products to the submarine force of the Chinese Navy. Nice  try, very cute, but we don't do that.   However, Ex-Im does provide financing for companies that the Chinese  military can control to achieve Beijing's strategic objectives. In the  language of this bill, we will have a handy-dandy chart that no one at  home can read. We have a massive chart. It doesn't matter. We have a  long list of entities that Ex-Im could still subsidize that this bill  doesn't affect, does not touch.   So the Democrats put in this bill meaningless language for political  cover rather than to do something right and real for the American  economy. They don't have a response for the deep questions of Chinese  aggression.   Ex-Im does provide financing to companies like AsiaSat, which is  controlled by the Chinese Government and has helped Chinese security  forces crack down on protesters in western China. Again, the Democrats'  bill would do nothing to stop any of that, as one example.   And, of course, the Democrat bill does nothing to stop Ex-Im from  financing government-controlled companies that are acting contrary to  our national interests but which may not happen to be on this entity  list of the Commerce Department.   Take Huawei, for example, which Ex-Im had authorized transactions for  before the company was put onto the entity list in May. This is a  recent example.   Under the Democrats' bill, Ex-Im subsidies for Huawei were perfectly  fine in April, but in May were unacceptable. That is ridiculous. And it  is bad policy for the American taxpayer to subsidize Chinese  aggression.   By the same token, under the Democrats' bill, Ex-Im would safely  finance Chinese Government-controlled ZTE Corporation up until April 15  of 2018, when it was put on the Commerce's Denied Persons List. At that  point, Ex-Im would no longer be able to finance ZTE, except that it  could finance ZTE just 3 months later when it was taken off the list.   Is anyone confused? Yes, you should be confused. This is the type of  incoherent nonsense that this partisan bill has in it. It is not good  for our national security. It is not smart policy. It is not good  policy.   So, as a reminder, ZTE is China's second largest producer of  telecommunications equipment, and it was involved in violations of our  export control and sanctions laws with respect to Iran and North Korea.  According to the Democrats' bill, taxpayer assistance should be flowing  through Ex-Im Bank to ZTE. I don't think that is really what they want,  but that is what their legislative text does.   These are just a few of the many examples of companies controlled by  the Chinese Communist Party that the Democrat majority wants the  Export-Import Bank to cater to under this bill.   Again, we can't let that happen. We should not let that happen. That  is not good policy. It is not commensurate with where we are as a  nation with this rising threat of China.   I want to reiterate my support of an extension of the Ex-Im Bank's  authorities to ensure that the Bank remains open to support U.S. jobs  and exports and job creation around the globe, but with a caveat that  we should not be doing it in China to fund their aggression.   So I urge a ``no'' vote on this bill. We will have an extension of  the Bank. It will happen. It will be a bipartisan vote.   This, though, is a bad bill that does not deserve to pass the House  of Representatives. And even if it does pass the House of  Representatives, it is going nowhere in the Senate. And even if it  passes the Senate, the President says he is going to veto it.    So let's think calmly and rationally about it. Let's not waste the  people's time here in the House of Representatives with a needless  debate on something that is going to go nowhere. Let's actually work on  something that could take us somewhere.   We had a bipartisan bill. Sadly, the majority walked away from it.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, let me restate that, as I said in my opening statement, to  be clear, the bill that Chairwoman Waters and I filed, H.R. 3407, is a  7-year extension of the Export-Import Bank.   It is clear by my cosponsorship of that with Chairwoman Waters that I  support reauthorizing the Bank. And as I said in my opening statement,  I support the Bank staying open through the continuing resolution or  the appropriations vehicle, whatever it is that is going to become law.  So I will restate that to both my colleagues so they can hear.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Huizenga), the ranking member of the Investor Protection,  Entrepreneurship and Capital Markets Subcommittee.     Mr. Chair, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), the ranking member of the Oversight and  Investigations Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on National  Security, International Development and Monetary Policy.    Mr. Chair, if I may inquire of the Chair how much time  remains on both sides.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H8853]]         Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would assure my colleagues that when the President says that he is  going to veto the bill, as he put out with a Statement of  Administration Policy, he intends to veto this bill if it hits his  desk. That is number one.   Two, the Senate majority leader says: ``We are not going to pass the  House bill.''   They also say they are going to take this up as a part of the CR, and  I think that is important. We don't want this Bank to lapse.   I would also commend for my colleagues that--it is a bit rich, a bit  thick, because people voted for Ex-Im and against Ex-Im in the past,  including Chairwoman Waters, who voted against reauthorization in 2002.  So times change, issues change, and our votes reflect those changes in  time.   I would say that the majority leader, in his speech, does outline  that he is a strong advocate for the Bank. He absolutely is. That is  why I have great assurance when this bill passes or doesn't pass that  we will have an extension of the Bank, and we are going to have a  functioning bank. It is important.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Stivers), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on National Security,  International Development and Monetary Policy, a great advocate for the  Ex-Im Bank, to talk through his position on Ex-Im.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.  [[Page H8855]]     Mr. Chairman, I would commend for the House that, yes,  there is an opportunity for bipartisanship. I think that will be on the  CR to extend the Export-Import Bank. It is an important institution. At  its height, it supported almost 2 percent of American exports. It is a  small amount of global trade, but it is important. We want to make sure  the Bank continues to function, but this is not the bill to do that. We  will take care of that in another vehicle, and I am hopeful we can have  a bipartisan vote there.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Tipton), my colleague.    Mr. Chair, this is what we are trying to not fund for  American taxpayers. We are having American taxpayer dollars go to  subsidize Chinese companies to perpetrate the violence that is  happening in repression of the Chinese people and the folks in Hong  Kong. This is what we are trying to stop, and their bill does nothing  to stop this type of subsidization of our goods, our American tax  dollars going into the harm that is perpetrated there.   So you can make a nice political case that you have done something,  but in reality, in terms of legislative text, you don't do squat. And  that is a huge problem. That is the reason why there is opposition over  here.   I would also commend to my colleagues that every Republican voted for  the bipartisan bill that I negotiated with Chairwoman Waters in  committee.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Gonzalez).    Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close. May I inquire if  there are further speakers on the other side.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, this is a failure of bipartisan policymaking, and this is  a sad day.   I am not angry. I appreciate Chairwoman Waters attempting to strike a  bipartisan deal. In fact, we had a deal, and we filed that bill. It is  H.R. 3407 that encouraged Members to sign the discharge petition so we  can actually support something that was a bipartisan negotiation, not  this bill before us today that doesn't take on the important work of  banning Chinese state-owned enterprises from accessing our export  credit agency. That is what this is about.   So I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this very important measure  of international export activities, and I yield back the balance of my  time.                                time  1530     Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition, though I am not  opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, Republicans unanimously voted to support the  Waters-McHenry bipartisan bill to strengthen the bank and combat  Chinese aggression but will not support this partisan bill.   And, while I am not opposed to the Torres amendment, I would simply  note that there is a point where additional reporting requirements and  other mandates can burden agencies to the point of diminishing returns.   I think it is important, though, that Ex-Im be focused on American  businesses, especially those in need and that have great capacity like  Tribal businesses do.   So, it is a good amendment. I support it.   What I would also mention to this body is that the negotiation on the  Waters-McHenry bill took the small business mandate for the bank and  raised it so that Ex-Im would make small businesses more of a priority  for this reauthorization than it previously had been; and, instead, we  have a bill before us today that delays that raise for 10 years, until  the last year of the authorization of the bill before us.   I think this is a missed opportunity. It is bad for small business,  bad for Tribal export businesses, which would qualify as a small  business, most of them--almost all of them, in fact--under the purview  of the Ex-Im Bank and the designation of Ex-Im Bank.   So that small business mandate shows that that was not a priority for  the Democrats who wrote this bill. And that is a sad thing. It is a bad  thing. It is not helpful to American business and not helpful to the  bank.   Mr. Chair, I support the Torres amendment, the Torres-Cole amendment,  commend the gentlewoman for offering it, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I seek time in opposition, but I am not  opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, let me say this: Republicans unanimously  voted to support the Waters-McHenry bipartisan deal in committee to  strengthen and combat Chinese aggression, but we are not going to  support this partisan bill that is before us.   This amendment, in my view, is a very simple one. It is a restatement  of  [[Page H8861]]  existing law. You cannot do business with sanctioned individuals.  American businesses cannot do business with sanctioned individuals or  entities. It is American law.   So, if American businesses can't do business with sanctioned  entities, what this amendment says is they also cannot get subsidized  by the Ex-Im Bank to do that business that they can't do.   So, fine. I don't oppose the amendment, but what this looks like to  me is cover to Democrats for gutting important national security  provisions in the Waters-McHenry bipartisan Ex-Im reauthorization bill.   In that legislation, Republicans sought to restrict Ex-Im assistance  for Chinese government-controlled entities in light of Beijing's  suppression of freedom of speech, freedom in Hong Kong, its political  repression of religious and ethnic minorities, and other actions  inconsistent with our national interests.   Rather than support those provisions, Democrats have decided to  parrot China, this China language, and, well, quite frankly, take  Republicans' intellectual property here and talking points, if you  will, and try to cover it. And that is what this amendment is.   So, American businesses cannot do business with sanctioned entities.  What this says is that they also can't get Ex-Im financing for the  business that they can't do.   Fine. Great. Fine. We will let it go. It is fine. But, news flash to  anyone: You can't finance something that doesn't actually happen.   So this amendment, it is fine. It checks the box, covers a little  political cover. I got it. It is fine. So we will just let it go, but  that is really what this does. It is a political cover vote rather than  actually anything of substance. So I will let it go. I will let it go  by a voice vote.   But I think what will happen is that the Democrat majority will call  a rollcall vote so their Members can show they have a vote to do  something that gives them political cover. It is good. It is great. It  is fine. But I am not going to participate in that charade.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Again, let me state this: If you are a sanctioned individual or  entity, under American law, American businesses cannot do business with  them.   We have an amendment here that says they also can't get subsidized  financing from Ex-Im to do that business that they are prevented from  doing.   Okay, fine. I get this. It has language about human rights, but we  already have that limitation in law, in fact. If we wanted to do  something real and substantive when it comes to sanctioned individuals,  we would have gone a step further, including the China provisions in  the bipartisan Waters-McHenry bill.   All this does is restate existing law. It is not a good amendment. It  is not a bad amendment. It is a political cover amendment. It is a sad  thing that, instead of doing things of substance and having real  impact, we are doing this.   So, fine. Vote for it. Add it to the bill. It doesn't matter. The  bill is not going to become law.   We are restating existing policy here, existing law. American  businesses cannot do business with sanctioned entities. If they do,  they become potentially sanctioned under American law. We have a  provision of law already for this. Now you are saying Ex-Im can't  finance something that can't happen. Okay, fine.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, let me say first that Republicans unanimously  voted to support the Waters-McHenry bipartisan deal to strengthen the  Bank and combat Chinese aggression, but we are not going to support  this partisan bill here on the floor today.   This amendment is a fine one. This amendment, as with some other  amendments that the Democrats are offering today that the Rules  Committee made in order--as I understand it, they made in order 19  Democrat amendments and two Republican amendments, so that is quite a  ratio, but I think there is a point where additional reporting  requirements, as I said earlier, and other mandates can burden an  agency to the point of diminishing returns.   If you want the Export-Import Bank to be effective, it is often  better to advocate for initiatives within the Bank,  [[Page H8866]]  like the Waters-McHenry bill, and make the Bank focus on priorities.   This is one area, with opportunity zones, that we support in a  bipartisan way to get investment in disadvantaged communities across  the country. Those opportunity zones are a part of now tax law.   That standalone bill was a bipartisan one last Congress and the  Congress before that had great consensus. So what the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib) is advocating here matches up quite nicely with  that to ensure that the Bank is focused on those same areas that have  been historically disadvantaged or economically left behind.   Some of those areas are in my district, some are in her district, but  they are throughout the country.   So, as I said, I do not oppose the amendment, I support the  amendment, and I think it is important for the Bank to focus on  important communities across the country, but especially those that are  economically disadvantaged.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would say, Mr. Chair, to my colleague from Michigan, under the  opportunity zones provision of the tax bill we passed last year,  governors designate those census tracks. So if the gentlewoman has a  problem with the census tracks designated in Michigan, that is a  problem with the Governor of Michigan, not the underlying important tax  law.   Mr. Chair, I would also commend my colleague, this is her first term  in Congress, two Congresses ago this was a bipartisan bill, it had wide  bipartisan support, and we had a similar number of Republicans and  Democrats support the opportunity zone legislation. And I think it is  really important, powerful legislation, important law now that is going  to have a strong impact on those economically disadvantaged  communities, many in my district and those across the country. I think  it is going to have a very positive effect over the long-term.   Mr. Chair, I would say again, I support this amendment, will not  oppose, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, let me say first, Republicans unanimously  voted for the Waters-McHenry bipartisan deal to strengthen the Bank and  combat Chinese aggression, but we are not going to support this  partisan bill.   I would note that the amendment offered here clarifies the definition  of minorities under the section of the bill that was a priority for the  chair of our committee, Chairwoman Waters, which is the Office of  Minority and Women Inclusion, which is referred to as OMWI.   I would just note that in this bill, the Democrats have prioritized  OMWIs over the global economic and national security threats posed by  China and even Russia.   OMWIs are important. That is fine. We included that in the bipartisan  bill, and that was part of the tradeoff of a bipartisan bill, including  something that was a priority for Chairwoman Waters, but also in that  agreement were provisions that were tough on China. I thought it was a  fair trade in order to get a bipartisan bill.   OMWIs and being tough on China are not mutually exclusive ideas, but  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle felt that they needed to  prioritize, and so they chose OMWIs as opposed to a rational stance  against Chinese aggression or even Russian actions.   To the extent that Mr. Case's amendment clarifies language that will  have no impact and will not be enacted anyway, I don't oppose it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1630     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, I would say to my colleague, yes, it is important that  we have robust global trade. Ex-Im, at its height, at its strongest  year, supported just shy of 2 percent of American exports.   I don't want to diminish a little less than 2 percent, but most  export is done through the private sector without a government program  like Ex-Im.   I would also say that, as a matter of our national interest, we  shouldn't be subsidizing Chinese foreign policy with One Belt, One  Road. We shouldn't be subsidizing their island-building in the Pacific.  We shouldn't be subsidizing their actions in Hong Kong. That is what we  negotiated with the Waters-McHenry bipartisan bill.   I am disappointed that we are not dealing with that policy. Instead,  the majority decided to go the partisan route, which the Republican  majority leader of the Senate has already said is dead on arrival. The  President said he is going to veto this bill.   We could have gone a bipartisan route with a bipartisan outcome, but  they chose a different route.   Look, the majority is the majority. They have the votes to go do what  they want to do. But that means I don't need to vote for bad policy  just to get along. That is why I tried to negotiate a good bill, and  that is why we had a good bill.   Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, though I  am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chairman, let me say first that Republicans  unanimously voted in the Financial Services Committee to support the  bipartisan bill that Chairwoman Waters and I negotiated to strengthen  the Bank and combat Chinese aggression, but we are not going to support  this partisan bill on the floor today.   It does seem strange that the sponsor needs to spell out that energy  storage, which already appears in the text, refers to batteries. I  think it is a good thing, a fine thing, but energy storage is the  broader terminology that we had discussed, in terms of the negotiations  between Chairwoman Waters and I.   We both share, as I do with the amendment sponsor, the need for more  options in the marketplace, including better batteries for cars and for  mobility purposes, for sure. So I would commend the sponsor's interest  in electric vehicles and related infrastructure. I think it is a good  thing. I think we have nice bipartisan support, actually growing  support among Republicans, for some sensible policies that would have a  positive impact on our environment and, at the same time, have more  options in the marketplace for consumers so they can choose how they  seek to power their homes, their cars, and their lives.   What Chairwoman Waters and I negotiated is in H.R. 3407. That bill  pushed Ex-Im to devote no less than 20 percent of its authority to  technologies of tomorrow. This was a priority of mine, and that was in  that bill that is not in the bill before us today. That is a huge  missed opportunity. That included energy storage and energy-efficient  technologies.    Those provisions, I think, would have had a really strong impact. I  am saddened that Chairwoman Waters rejected that, in terms of the bill  that she filed and brought before us today.   The energy sources and technologies of tomorrow are going to have the  most powerful impact on reducing carbon emissions, making sure that the  globe is safe and sustainable for generations to come. It is those  technological breakthroughs that we should prioritize, not just for  carbon reduction, but for powering our economy.   I think there is opportunity for us to legislate in a bipartisan way.  I commend Ms. Speier's amendment. Unfortunately, I don't think this  bill is going to become law, so I don't think it is going to have the  impact that we need. But I think, on separate legislation, I would like  to work with the sponsor of this amendment on those technological  breakthroughs that we have to have for our environment, for my children  and the children and grandchildren of current Americans so they can  have a safe and sustainable environment and have jobs at the same time.  It is the technological breakthroughs that are going to take us there  that I am so passionate about and that are so impactful.   Mr. Chairman, I commend the amendment sponsor, and I support its  adoption.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, and I am  opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment not  because its goals are necessarily objectionable. The gentleman is right  to focus on exports, especially given the economy of his district and  his State, and his State's and district's importance to the Nation and  the national economy.   The reason why I am opposed to it is because it doesn't appear based  on any empirical study of Ex-Im resource needs and may hinder the Bank  from working effectively.   To start, the amendment would allow up to 3 percent of Ex-Im's  surplus to be used for administrative expenses, on top of the resources  that it already has. I am unaware of any concerns by Ex-Im that it is  unable to cover its administrative expenses, currently.   Traditionally, excess funds from the Bank's surplus are supposed to  go back to the Treasury, where it can reduce the deficit, something  that both Republicans and Democrats have long supported and, I hope,  will continue to support.   In addition, the amendment seems to only provide for this during half  of the reauthorization period. So what happens in the second half of  Ex-Im Bank's reauthorization under the bill, and would it leave Ex-Im  without recourse to the funds? We need to consider this carefully.   Finally, the amendment would require that at least one-third of the  new surplus funds devoted to administrative expenses be used to expand  regional finance centers. Regional finance centers are fine, but what  is the budgetary need?   Mr. Chair, I think a little more work needs to be done. We didn't  have this discussion during the markup or in the single hearing we had  about Ex-Im, and since the one-third requirement in the amendment would  fluctuate from year to year, it is divorced from Ex-Im's actual  assessment of needs for its regional operations.   There are a couple of technical issues here. I appreciate the  gentleman for offering the amendment and his interest in serving his  constituents, but for these reasons I have outlined, I am opposed to  the amendment.   Since I am in opposition, I do believe I have the right to close and  am willing to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   On this amendment, in 1 year, this would be hundreds of millions of  dollars, and, in other years, it would be zero. So to finance these  regional finance centers, you probably want to have more stable funding  than that fluctuation.    That is the technical problem, in my view, on this, not that these  regional finance centers are a bad idea. They are not a bad idea. In  fact, I think it is important that Ex-Im focuses on small businesses  and does more outreach with small businesses.   The bill that I negotiated with Chairwoman Waters actually raises the  small business mandate. This bill fails to do it until the 10th year.  That focus  [[Page H8870]]  on small businesses would require Ex-Im to deploy their resources more  effectively across the country. That is something Chairwoman Waters and  I agreed to, on that need for greater outreach from just a couple of  urban centers where they are currently planted, as has been said.   So while I support the laudatory goal of this, the functionality of  it is not workable. I would like the Bank to actually work. Of course,  that is not part of the debate that I would actually have that view,  but I actually do want the Bank to work and be effective for American  businesses. It is really just the technical problem of how the  gentleman allocates the resources here, and that is why I oppose it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
