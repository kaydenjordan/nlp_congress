 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1170, I  call up the bill (H.R. 2543) to amend the Federal Reserve Act to add  additional demographic reporting requirements, to modify the goals of  the Federal Reserve System, and for other purposes, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks on H.R. 2543 and to insert extraneous material thereon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2543, the Financial  Services Racial Equity, Inclusion, and Economic Justice Act, landmark  legislation focused on promoting racial and economic justice.   This bill was introduced by Financial Services Committee Chairwoman,  the Honorable Maxine Waters, and it includes several provisions  authored by members of the committee. Unfortunately, Chairwoman Waters  couldn't  [[Page H5568]]  be here today, but I would like the Record to reflect not only her  authorship of this bill but also her unwavering commitment to achieving  equity and inclusion on behalf of communities of color.   Today's House consideration of H.R. 2543 is historic in that for the  first time in our Nation's history, the U.S. House of Representatives  is voting on a comprehensive package of legislation to finally address  inequity with equity and inclusion in terms of financial access,  economic mobility, and fair treatment.   Today, I boldly and proudly say that this would not have been  possible without the Honorable Chairwoman Waters' leadership. This bill  is needed because racial disparities in lending, homeownership, and  wealth creation are all too real.   For some, invidious discrimination, Mr. Speaker, is only a phrase.  However, for too many others, it is a fact of life. According to the  Brookings Institution, the racial wealth gap between White and Black  households is more than $10 trillion. The onerous wealth gap is  perpetuated by the toleration of ongoing discrimination, redlining, and  systemic barriers to accessing financial credit and services.   Some of my colleagues across the aisle may say that the House  shouldn't address this important issue. They may say that the House  should ignore these very real, well-documented disparities and focus on  getting inflation under control, to which I say, this bill deals with  the very real inflationary pressures that people of color experience in  their daily lives. Too often, Mr. Speaker, consumers and businesses  from low-income communities and communities of color suffer invidious  discrimination as they struggle to access capital and credit.   Chairwoman Waters said it best, and I was there to hear her say it,  when she spoke before the Rules Committee this week. She noted that  this type of discrimination is a form of inflation in communities of  color. She indicated that when you add up inflated fees in tandem with  inflated interest rates, simple loans cost more for people of color  than others taking out the same loan in a different community.   This, of course, assumes that you are lucky enough to qualify for the  loan in the first place. If you are not, then your options to build  wealth are severely limited because you can't buy a home or start a  small business. In fact, your only option for credit might be an  inflated predatory payday loan that leaves you worse off, not better.   This is inflation that people of color experience each day, and we  should be just as outraged and concerned about these needlessly  inflated high costs as we are about the general inflation we are  experiencing during the pandemic. And I would further argue that  addressing this form of inflation will bring down costs for everyone  because, as my colleagues across the aisle are fond of saying, a rising  tide lifts all boats.   We also know that general inflation disproportionately hurts people  of color, which is why this bill directs the Federal Reserve, as it  carries out its duties to rein inflation in and promote full  employment, to also consider racial disparities so that all people--all  people--will benefit from the Fed's dual mandate.   Members of the LGBTQIA-plus community also face discrimination in  lending. This is why it leads to higher costs for them as well. We  shouldn't stand for this during any time of the year, but I am pleased  to be among those fighting for LGBTQIA-plus justice during Pride Month.  This is why H.R. 2543 includes my bill H.R. 166, the Fair Lending for  All Act, which furthers fair lending by clarifying that lending  discrimination is prohibited not only on the basis of race, Mr.  Speaker, but also on the basis of gender identity, sexual orientation,  and geography. This bill enhances supervision and establishes criminal  penalties for fair lending violations.    Let's take a closer look at fair lending at this time. Every person  who purchases a home should be able to read and understand their  mortgage documents. This is why common sense should prevail. However,  that is not the reality for many home buyers in our country today. This  is why the bill includes robust language, robust language to access the  requirements for a mortgage, and these mortgage conditions should be  made clear in languages that people understand. It requires servicers  to expand and preserve the dream of homeownership for borrowers with  limited English proficiency. Chairwoman Waters' bill will also support  the efforts of community development financial institutions, or CDFIs,  and minority depository institutions, or MDIs, that fill a historic  lending gap in underserved communities across this country. And it  would mitigate banking deserts by allowing credit unions to serve areas  that banks have ignored or abandoned.   Moreover, this legislation includes another bill of mine, H.R. 2516,  the Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in Banking Act, which would  require Federal banking regulators to evaluate policies and procedures  banks and credit unions have to promote diversity and inclusion.   I thank Chairwoman Waters for her continued leadership, her bold  leadership, as well as my colleagues and members of the Financial  Services Committee for their tireless work, including Representatives  Meeks, Cleaver, Beatty, Garcia of Texas, Torres, and Auchincloss.   Mr. Speaker, the pandemic has exacerbated and exposed many truths  about our Nation's inequitable housing and financial systems, as well  as its outsized impact on low-income families and communities of color.  It is incumbent on this Congress to finally address these disparities,  and that is precisely what Chairwoman Waters' bill will do.   Hence, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2543, the  Financial Services Racial Equity, Inclusion, and Economic Justice Act.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Meeks), my dear friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H5570]]    Mr. Speaker, we are witnessing now why we have the invidious  discrimination that exists in this country. Not one word has been said  about the invidious discrimination, the high cost in loans that people  of color suffer. Not one word is being said about it. Rather, there is  always an effort to deflect. This has been going on for centuries, but  not today. It ends today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs.  Beatty).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I will read from an article entitled: ``Examining the Black-White  wealth gap'' from the Brookings Institution dated February 27, 2020.  ``A close examination of wealth in the U.S. finds evidence of  staggering racial disparities. At $171,000, the net worth of a typical  White family is nearly 10 times greater than that of a Black family  ($17,150) in 2016. Gaps in wealth between Black and White households  reveal the effects of accumulated inequality and discrimination, as  well as differences in power and opportunity that can be traced back to  this Nation's inception.''   And this is why it continues, because people on that side of the  aisle are willing to tolerate invidious discrimination. They will talk  about anything but invidious discrimination. They have no remedies.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr.  Cleaver), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, inflation does care about your race if you happen to be  a person of color and you are applying for a loan.   Inflation does care about your race if you happen to have fees added  on that you shouldn't have simply because you are a person of color.   People of color have to deal with general inflation and the specific  inflation associated with invidious discrimination, and it is the  intolerance by my colleagues across the aisle through the centuries  that has perpetuated this level of inflation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 20 seconds to  the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   People of color are constituents. People of color are Americans.  People of color deserve the opportunity to have equality of  opportunity.   Hundreds of years have gone by, and this is what we are getting as a  result of those who would ignore the concerns of Americans of color.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts  (Mr. Auchincloss), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, the Brookings Institution indicates that the Black and  [[Page H5572]]  White wealth gap reflects a society that has not and does not afford  equality of opportunity to all of its citizens. This is evidenced today  by the responses that we are getting.   No effort to deal with the centuries of inequality. No desire to deal  with invidious discrimination. Always a reason why we can't get to it  right now. I have been in Congress for years--never addressing this  problem.   Mr. Speaker, today is a day of reckoning for all of those who have  been hiding behind other issues. Today they have to confront the truth.  There is invidious discrimination in America, it impacts the LGBTQ- plus, it impacts people of color, and women as well, and today we have  legislation because of the Honorable Maxine Waters' efforts that can  deal with these issues.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, people of color are clobbered every day by higher  interest rates. They are clobbered every day by loans that have fees  that are higher than loans for people of a different hue. These are the  things that are being perpetuated when they tolerate this kind of  behavior. For centuries they tolerated it.   Now we have the opportunity to do something about it. Let's eliminate  these costs for some people so that we can deal with the costs for  everybody. Until that is done, we have to have this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, we have just heard a great recitation on how to do  nothing; how to maintain the status quo; how to be proud that you can  stand up in the House of Representatives and defend the status quo for  some 300 years.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and I  am prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, it is painful to hear a Member of Congress talk about  reckless spending when that spending is what was necessary during the  pandemic.   Is it reckless spending to allow people to receive some sort of help  when they couldn't go to work, Mr. Speaker?   My colleagues across the aisle would not have helped the American  people who were out of work during a pandemic because it would be  reckless spending.   Is it reckless spending to keep people in their homes and not allow  them to be foreclosed on?   My colleagues across the aisle would have allowed people to be  evicted and their things thrown in the streets because to them, helping  people in a time of crisis is reckless spending.   Is it reckless spending to put food on the table of people who can't  go to work?   Is it reckless spending to make sure babies and children who are  going to school get proper schools that can protect them during a virus  and a pandemic that was killing people worldwide?   We put money into schools. We put money into police departments and  fire departments. But that is reckless spending to my colleagues across  the aisle.   They are the best on the planet at doing nothing. Do-nothing politics  is what that is all about. They find clever ways to find an opportunity  to do nothing by saying things that mean nothing to the people who need  help.   Reckless spending. How dare they call it reckless spending when  people are suffering and need help.   Now, let me continue with the Brookings Institution with my final  minutes.   This is from the Brookings Institution: ``Efforts by Black Americans  to build wealth can be traced back throughout American history. But  these efforts have been impeded in a host of ways, beginning with 246  years of chattel slavery and followed by congressional mismanagement .  . . `'   Let me repeat that: by congressional mismanagement.   `` . . . of the Freedmans Savings Bank, which left 61,144 depositors  with losses of nearly $3 million in 1874, the violent massacre  decimating Tulsa's Greenwood District in 1921, a population of 10,000  that thrived as the epicenter of African-American business and culture,  commonly referred to as Black Wall Street, and discriminatory policies  throughout the 20th century including the Jim Crow Eras `Black Codes'  strictly limiting opportunity in many Southern States . . . . `'    Mr. Speaker, today has been the best evidence we need of why  invidious discrimination exists in this country, because there are  people across the aisle who will tolerate it and who will come to this  floor and talk about Americans as though you have to be White to be an  American, as though people of color don't count, as though the LGBTQ- plus community doesn't count, and that women don't count. To them, Mr.  Speaker, if you are a White man, you are an American.   But what about the rest of the people in this country who suffer?   Mr. Speaker, it is a sad day to hear my colleagues across the aisle  speak of reckless spending when people were suffering.   I thank God that we have the courage to help people in a time of  need. If I could do it again, I would do it because I saw the  suffering. Perhaps they don't see the suffering that I see. But I saw  it, and I was prepared to do something about it.   I believe that in the final analysis, those who refuse to tolerate  the kind of invidious discrimination that we suffer each day in this  country, they will be vindicated. They will be vindicated.   I am grateful for the time, Mr. Speaker, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House  Resolution 1170, I offer amendments en bloc No. 1.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the 23 amendments offered in this en bloc are a terrific  example of a working legislative process, a process through which well- considered legislation is further strengthened by the intellect,  experience, and values of the House Democratic Caucus.   These amendments broaden this package's commitment to equity by  ensuring that information is gathered regarding loans made to veterans,  people with disabilities, and the LGBTQ-plus community, which will help  reveal unfair or discriminatory practices against these communities.   We also have amendments that will ensure economic data are  disaggregated within racial and ethnic groups, in recognition of the  lived experiences across different communities.   The package is further bolstered by timely and necessary reporting  ensuring that communities of color and low-income communities have  access to wealth-building opportunities, including purchasing their  first home and accessing capital.   Furthermore, this package includes amendments that will help us to  better understand and address the country's growing affordable housing  and homelessness crises that have disproportionately affected people of  color.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support these amendments  being considered en bloc.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 15 seconds.   Mr. Speaker, this is not another mandate. This is simply a  requirement that the Fed fulfill its two mandates, the dual mandates to  all of its people, to make sure that all people have price stability.  This is what it is about.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Velazquez).    Mr. Speaker, how much time do we have remaining?  [[Page H5580]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Ohio (Ms. Brown).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, according to a recent National Bureau of Economic  Research report, the racial wealth gap is on track to grow wider in the  coming decades. It is estimated that the White-to-Black wealth ratio  will increase from 5.6 to 1 in 2019 to 8.4 to 1 by 2200.   The time to act is now. These amendments will help ensure that  everyone will have a fair chance, and in too many instances, a first  chance at economic opportunity.   I thank our colleagues for offering their amendments, and I urge my  colleagues to vote in support of these amendments because these  amendments are principally about transparency.   If you have nothing to hide, you celebrate transparency. If you have  something to hide, you want to eschew transparency.   These amendments seek to provide transparency so that we can get a  better understanding of how we can better cure the invidious  discrimination that has plagued our country for centuries.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, pursuant to section 3 of House  Resolution 1170, I offer amendments en bloc No. 2.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Republican amendments presented here today stand as  a testament to Republican values; namely, a tolerance for wealth  inequality and racial discrimination.   Let's be clear. The amendment from Mr. Timmons will strike large  portions of the bill and make no attempt to improve it.   As for the amendment from Mr. Davis, it will strike provisions  requiring the reporting of small business lending data, effectively  allowing banks to continue to hide the extent to which they are denying  small business owners of color access to affordable credit.   According to a Fed survey, 46 percent of Black-owned firms that  applied for financing received none of the financing they sought  compared to just 22 percent of White-owned firms. We need more granular  data on these trends to root out discrimination in lending once and for  all.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time,  and I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, what we have been witnessing today is the behavior of  persons who chose not to help the American people in a time of need.   When the American people were being evicted from their homes, they  chose not to help. When schools were plagued by a virus and needed  funding so that they could secure our children from the virus, they  chose not to help. When people were out of work and needed help to put  food on the table, fuel in their cars, they chose not to help.   Because they chose not to help, they have to call any help that was  given reckless, and they have to call it bad policy.   But the truth is, if you do nothing, you put yourself in a position  such that you cannot appreciate the suffering of people who are in the  midst of a worldwide pandemic. They chose not to help. We choose to  help, and we continue to help.   Mr. Speaker, it is a sad day when people will call saving homes and  keeping children safe from a virus reckless policy.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
