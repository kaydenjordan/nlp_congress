 Madam President, it has been a long, hot, dry summer in  Montana. That is why I rise today to honor the brave men and women in  Montana who are fighting wildfires throughout our great State, the  families who are facing devastating losses due to drought and fire, and  to call on Congress to do their job and help these folks.   Due to the drought and high temperatures, Montana has turned into a  tinderbox. Unfortunately, fires have sparked all across our State, some  24 of them--which changes by the hour, I might add. Across Montana,  over one-quarter million acres have already burned, and many of these  fires continue to rage. Montana is burning, and our heroic firefighters  are protecting lives, our lands, our homes, our way of life.
