 Mr. Speaker, more than a year after it happened,  Americans still have not heard the truth about President Biden's  disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. It seems this administration  would rather pretend the whole affair never happened.   The disastrous, ill-executed withdrawal cost the lives of 13 American  servicemen. Despite this horrific failure, not one person in the State  Department, military, or any Federal agency that planned and executed  the withdrawal from Afghanistan has resigned in disgrace. No one has  apologized. No one has owned up to their mistake.   Now, the State Department is ignoring a congressional subpoena from  the House Foreign Affairs Committee. The American people sacrificed  blood and treasure in Afghanistan for almost two decades. They deserve  the truth about what happened, but trying to hide requested information  by the State Department is preventing the accountability that we should  demand.   Mr. Speaker, we have to get to the bottom of how the withdrawal from  Afghanistan went off the rails, so our Nation does not repeat such  things in the future.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time this evening. Thank  you to my colleague from Michigan for leading us on this and for being  a fighter in the trenches on what we are talking about.   Indeed, we are talking about the Nation's debt issues, the necessary  measure we have of having to extend the debt limit as the dollars have  already been committed. They have already been spent. We have to pay  for them.   The Limit, Save, Grow Act is, indeed, a responsible way to try and  turn the tide on what had been much spending over the last few years  that has extended our national debt to just unthought of numbers; over  $31 trillion.   In this measure that we are speaking of this evening here--really,  since January, the Democrats and the President have tried to claim  falsely that Republicans have no plan.   We have been talking about a plan the whole time. The difference is  they don't want to sit down and talk with us about how to meld their  ideas with ours.   This week we released our plan, and today we passed it. As always,  House Republicans have consistently argued for reasonable, responsible  debt limit increases, coupled with spending reductions in order to move  toward eventually balancing this budget.                                time  1830    It is absurd that the Democrats now demand unilateral increases to  our Nation's debt and balk at Republicans for asking for something in a  negotiation.   Our plan, the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023, saves American taxpayers  $4.5 trillion over the next decade. It will limit Federal spending to  fiscal year 2022 levels, which our government operated on just 4 months  ago. It does allow for 1 percent annual growth in Federal spending over  the next 10 years. For those that want to spend more, it is still built  in but at a flatter rate, flattening the curve on spending. If we had  been able to hold that for the last 10 years, we would be really close  to a balanced budget.   Also included in the bill are important clawbacks for $60 billion in  unspent COVID funds. When people see that these unspent COVID funds are  sitting there, then they covet them. You get everybody coming in asking  if they can shift these COVID relief funds to some other pet project.  That is not what was intended at the time we had a crisis, however much  of that crisis might have been exacerbated by false information or what  have you, but indeed, the opportunity to take $60 billion of unspent  funds and pull them back, and indeed, have better conversations in a  budget and appropriation process, not an emergency as was COVID, it  would be much better for all of us.   As we know, the pandemic is over. This money has not been spent, and  it should be rescinded without delay. That is what we did today in this  piece of legislation, the Limit, Save, Grow Act.   Also included in the bill is our Lower Energy Costs Act, which has  already passed this Chamber with bipartisan support previously. It  lowers energy costs for American families and modernizes our outdated  permitting process.   The House Republicans' plan is economically sound, financially wise,  and allows for a debt limit increase of $1.5 trillion to pay our bills.  It is a reasonable, responsible plan that will benefit all Americans.   This body deliberated on the merits of this legislation and has  passed this legislation. The U.S. responsibly did its job on a debt  ceiling to pay its already incurred bills. The profligate spending of  the past years cannot become the permanent way of business of this  House or of Washington, D.C.   We cannot afford even more high-speed debt on bills pretending to be  COVID fixes about infrastructure that actually isn't infrastructure, or  masquerading as a fix for inflation.   It is now on the Democrats in the Senate and the White House to meet  with House Republicans at the negotiation table to actually come to a  solution.   The stall tactics by Senate Leader Schumer and President Biden to run  out the clock and do a last-minute crisis debt limit bill with a  Christmas tree of goodies that will only cause more crushing debt  cannot be the way of doing business here.   Never before in our Nation's history has a debt ceiling been raised  without spending reductions to go along with it. It is a negotiation.  This time should be no different. We must demand that the Senate come  to the table and the White House negotiate.   By us getting legislation out of this body here now, the ball is in  their corner. It is time for them to look at our document and come up  with their ideas and sit down and do as these bodies are supposed to do  in front of the American people, not on Zoom, not behind masks, not  remotely, but in front of everybody and make a product that we can all  be proud of and at least live with and move towards balancing our  budget longer term.   This is what House Republicans are trying to do, not all the  caterwauling we heard about, how it is going take away from this and  that and the poor and every other group you can name here. It doesn't  even touch all that. We have already spent the money. We have to have  the debt ceiling increased and be responsible with the spending  reductions as we go along.   What could be wrong with that?   I appreciate the effort of my colleagues, our leadership, and Speaker  McCarthy to get this thing through and get everybody at the table on  our side and hopefully be successful with the Senate and the White  House to see the logic of what we are trying to do here.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Bergman for leading us here, and I am  actually fairly excited and optimistic that we can get this document  out.
