 Today the Senate will vote to confirm the President's  choice to serve as Secretary of the Interior. As I have discussed this  week, David Bernhardt is no stranger to the Department. He has served  twice before. In fact, this body has confirmed him twice before. Each  time his professionalism and dedication proved us right. As Solicitor  and as Deputy Secretary, Mr. Bernhardt has offered capable leadership  and a firm grasp on the complex policy environment surrounding our  Nation's public lands.   His expertise has not gone unnoticed. Praise for Mr. Bernhardt has  poured in from a list of more than 40 stakeholder organizations; from  agriculture, trade, conservation, and Native American organizations.   They describe him as a leader whose ``experience is sorely needed.''  They laud his commitment to ``make the lands he manages accessible to  the recreating public.''   So we have before us an opportunity to confirm a well-qualified  steward of our Nation's public lands and resources. Yesterday, a  bipartisan majority of our colleagues voted to end debate on his  nomination, and I hope each will join me in voting yes once more later  today.  [[Page S2400]]    Of course, confirming Mr. Bernhardt will be just the latest in a  series of many Executive Calendar accomplishments. Following on the  heels of last week's turn back toward the Senate's historic tradition  concerning nominations, we have been able to approve a number of the  President's nominees at a much more reasonable pace in the last several  days.   I have noted, with particular interest that, for all the breathless  warnings my Democratic colleagues issued about the kinds of people we  would be confirming, these unobjectionable nominees have actually  mostly coasted through on a bipartisan basis.   We saw support from both sides of the aisle for Roy Altman to the  U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, and for  Daniel Domenico to the District of Colorado.   We saw an overwhelming bipartisan vote in favor of confirming GEN  John Abizaid to serve as Ambassador to Saudi Arabia and a voice-voted  confirmation for Jeffrey Kessler to serve as Assistant Secretary of  Commerce.   These are not lightning-rod people whom my Democratic colleagues  would have eagerly debated and investigated for an additional 30 hours.  They are the kind of thoroughly qualified public servants who used to  sail briskly through the Senate without opposition.   Now, even as my Democratic colleagues continue to require us to file  cloture on individuals whom they actually go on to support, we are able  to fill out the President's team at a more reasonable clip. There are  still many empty seats left to fill, but this week's progress marks a  great new beginning not just for the administration that needs its  personnel but for the health of this institution.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  postcloture time on the Bernhardt nomination expire at 1:45 p.m. today.  I further ask that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table and the President be immediately notified of the  Senate's action.    Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.
