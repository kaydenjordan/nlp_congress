 Madam Speaker, in the dark of night in January 2020,  my constituents near the Watson Grinding and Manufacturing Company were  awakened by a catastrophic explosion around 4 a.m. in the morning.  Unbeknownst to these working families, this particular manufacturing  building had propylene, and there was a leak, and there was a seismic  explosion.   Four hundred homes have been damaged to the extent that people cannot  return. Tragically, two employees were killed. Due to the fact that the  shift had not started, there wasn't a catastrophic killing of  employees, innocent employees. A truck was blown from one part of the  street to the other.   We now cannot find the owner of this particular company. Homes are  still destroyed. Businesses are destroyed. There is no one to call.   I will be introducing legislation that insists that companies have  the responsibility to report to local jurisdictions the dangerous  flammable and toxic materials that they are holding.   We are still fighting to get relief for these innocent victims, and  we are asking Mr. Watson to stand up and do what he said he would,  which is to take care of all of these persons. Well, he is doing it by  filing bankruptcy.   We will not rest until all of these homes and homeowners find a way  for relief. I ask Members to join me in the legislation that will  protect communities across the Nation.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentleman from  Nevada for his great leadership and the importance of this moment  tonight to honor 150 years of the passage of the 15th Amendment, our  right to vote, and to be joined by my colleagues, Congresswoman Lee and  Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, and we thank our chair,  Congresswoman Bass.   The Congressional Black Caucus is the conscience of this Nation and  always stands in the gap for the very important leadership on this  issue.   Might I also thank our colleague, whom we are so blessed to have  amongst us. I think the gentleman takes the title of singularly being  the conscience and the heart of the Congress. That is the Honorable    John Lewis, who works with us and has always been our guide as relates  to the question of the Voting Rights Act.   Many of you are reminded of the fact that, as that Voting Rights Act  was fought for and rejected and thought it was too dangerous to pass in  the 1960s, moving up to 1965, it took the march across the Edmund  Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, when   John Lewis, among others, was  beaten almost to death and bloodied on that bridge by horsemen from the  Alabama State Police. What a bloody and horrific scene. None of us can  imagine what   John Lewis went through.   He has continued in his service in the United States Congress to  stand steadfast with us and to remind us that it is better to do the  right thing, regardless of the consequences. When I think of him and  this 150th year, I am reminded of how we should stand and fight and be  reminded, again, that the precious right to vote can be one that can be  quick and fade in the night and be taken away in the twinkle of an eye,  as has been attempted over the years.   President Johnson addressed the Nation before signing the Voting  Rights Act, and said: ``The vote is the most powerful instrument ever  devised by man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible  walls which imprison men,'' and women, ``because they are different  from other men,'' and women.   It is important to remind the Nation of the history of African  Americans, the descendants now of enslaved Africans, to remind this  Congress that, for nearly 250 years, the peculiar institution of  slavery fed into the Nation's booming industries and facilitated its  boundless growth.   We were the economic engine of this Nation--slave, brutal labor. And  as this country prospered, enslaved people were denied the fruits of  their labor: no workers' compensation, no life insurance, no days off,  no weekends. They were brutalized without vote, without presence,  without even the dignity of being one person.   They were denied a voice in America's fledgling democracy and only  began to see that change as the attempt came to make a difference by,  in 1869, passing the 15th Amendment over impassioned opposition.   The 13th Amendment had been passed. As my recollection serves me,  President Lincoln was not able to see the final passage of that, but  that was passed--and how horrific that was--to be able to finally have  slavery denied.   In 1869, the lameduck Congress passed the 15th Amendment over  impassioned opposition, but, Madam Speaker, it did not last long.   In 1876, this thing call Reconstruction, the many African Americans  who were in the Senate and House were stricken out because of the 1876  compromise to take the priority of the South over the rights of human  beings. And then came the horrors of poll tax, literacy tests,  violence, Jim Crowism, the brutality against anyone who wanted to vote.   Even when the 19th Amendment came in 1920, it was not Black women who  received the right to vote. So this is a worthy honoring.   My predecessor, the Honorable Barbara Jordan, my mentor and someone  who encouraged me in the position I am now in, indicated, with her  leadership in 1975, she was wise enough to include the State of Texas  by adding to the Voting Rights Act Mexican Americans. She said:         There are Mexican American people in the State of Texas who       have been denied the right to vote, who have been impeded in       their efforts to register and vote, who have not had       encouragement from those election officials because they are       brown people.    By adding the Mexican American population community, Texas was added  to the Voting Rights Act, and, lo and behold, we have suffered even  with that addition because we have had poll tax ourselves. We have had  the onslaught of the voter ID bill. The purging has been enormous in  the State of Texas: the moving of polls, lights being out, electricity  being out, machines not working.   I recall in the 1940s, there were only 30,000 African American  voters, and a small percentage of them throughout the South were  registered to vote. We are back where we were.   The State of Texas, as we come up on this election, has taken away a  tool that has been used for decades, and that is the right to push a  straight ticket. They know that the success of the 2018 election came  about through young voters and elderly voters and diverse voters who  knew how to do that one vote with these long ballots, and they took  away that very right.   The people could choose if they wanted to vote for one party or  another. We are looking at whether or not that is violating the Voting  Rights Act. It takes away a choice.   Let me conclude my remarks by indicating the importance of this  legislation and, again, take some words from President Lyndon Baines  Johnson: ``Presidents and Congresses, laws and lawsuits can open the  doors to the polling places and open the doors to the wondrous rewards  which await the wise use of the ballot. But only the individual Negro,  and all others who have been denied the right to vote, can really walk  through those doors, and can use that right, and can transform the vote  into an instrument of justice and fulfillment.''   Lyndon Baines Johnson didn't realize that counties and cities and  States across America would find ways to stop those on the basis of  race and color and some other form of discrimination. He didn't realize  that his job had not ended with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and as we  reauthorized it just a few years ago. He did not realize that people  would still be stopped from voting, those who have been incarcerated,  mostly people of color.   Today, I pay tribute to my colleague who is leading this and pay  tribute to the colleagues who are bringing us to recognize the 150  years. It is good to recognize, but the fight still is maintained.   If their vote at the ballot box is going to be the change agent of  this Nation so homeless persons will not still be homeless, people who  are hungry will not still be hungry, small businesses that want to open  their doors will not be denied because of the present leadership and  administration, our vote counts, and the honor and tribute that we can  give to those who were enslaved for 250 years is to use the precious  right to vote.   As they do so, our colleagues on the floor of this House will pay  tribute to them by passing, as well, H.R. 40, which is a commission to  study reparations and proposals.   Use your vote for a reason to enhance and uplift.   Use your vote to save those who cannot speak for themselves: the  hungry and those who need access to medical care.   Use your vote. That is the challenge for all of us.   Honor the 150th year by your action, by your vote, and by your  commitment to this Nation.   Madam Speaker, 150 years ago this month, the 15th Amendment to the  Constitution was ratified and because of that Amendment, and the Voting  Rights Act it authorized and President Lyndon Johnson signed into law,  I stand before you as Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, who in 2017  became the first African American woman to attain the position of  Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism,  Homeland Security, and Investigations.   Madam Speaker, I rise today not just to commemorate the landmark  achievement of 150 years ago but to inform our colleagues and the  nation of the need to redouble and rededicate our efforts to the work  that remains to be done to protect the right of all Americans to vote  free from discrimination and the injustices that prevent them from  exercising this most fundamental right of citizenship.  [[Page H1006]]    On August 6, 1965, in the Rotunda of the Capitol and in the presence  of such luminaries as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rev.  Ralph Abernathy of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; Roy  Wilkins of the NAACP; Whitney Young of the National Urban League; James  Foreman of the Congress of Racial Equality; A. Philip Randolph of the  Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; John Lewis of the Student Non- Violent Coordinating Committee; Senators Robert Kennedy, Hubert  Humphrey, and Everett Dirksen; President Johnson addressed the nation  before signing the Voting Rights Act:   The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by man for  breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible walls which  imprison men because they are different from other men.   Madam Speaker, for nearly 250 years, ``the peculiar institution'' of  slavery fed into the nation's booming industries and facilitated its  boundless growth.   Even as the country prospered, enslaved people were denied the fruits  of their own labor.   They were also denied a voice in America's fledgling democracy.   This only began to change in the middle of the 19th century.   At the close of the Civil War, the nation wrangled with the future of  nearly 4 million Black people who, until the adoption of the 13th  Amendment, had been held captive in the South.   On the heels of the 13th Amendment, which formally ended slavery,  Congress passed the 14th Amendment to guarantee Black people  citizenship and equality under the law.   But suffrage was an entirely separate question.   As lawmakers mapped out plans to reunify the country, extending the  right to vote was hardly a priority in the North but in the South,  however, Black people were voting.   In some states--Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina--the  African-American electorate outnumbered its white counterpart because  in 1867, when Congress passed the Reconstruction Acts, the new laws  established, among other things, conditions for the former Confederate  states' return to the Union.   Perhaps the most important stipulation was that the readmitted states  had to draft new constitutions that guaranteed suffrage to citizens  regardless of their race.   It didn't take long for Lincoln Republicans in Congress to recognize  that for Reconstruction to have a chance, African Americans would have  to be able advocate for themselves in elections.   So in 1869, the lame-duck Congress passed the 15th Amendment over  impassioned position.   The amendment, which was ratified in less than a year, made it  illegal to ``deny'' or ``abridge'' the right to vote ``on account of  race, color, or previous condition of servitude'' and gave Congress the  power to enforce the new law.   Soon, Black people began voting not only in the South but throughout  the country.   They were elected to statewide office and were even sent to  Washington to represent Americans in both houses of Congress.   That it all ended in 1876 when the Hayes-Tilden Compromise resolving  the 1876 presidential election ended Reconstruction.   The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was critical to preventing brazen voter  discrimination violations that historically left millions of African  Americans disenfranchised.   In 1940, for example, there were less than 30,000 African Americans  registered to vote in Texas and only about 3 percent of African  Americans living in the South were registered to vote.   Poll taxes, literacy tests, and threats of violence were the major  causes of these racially discriminatory results.   After passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, which prohibited  these discriminatory practices, registration and electoral  participation steadily increased to the point that by 2012, more than  1.2 million African Americans living in Texas were registered to vote.   In 1964, the year before the Voting Rights Act became law, there were  approximately 300 African Americans in public office, including just  three in Congress.   Few, if any, African Americans held elective office anywhere in the  South.   Because of the Voting Rights Act, today there are more than 9,100  black elected officials, including 46 members of Congress, the largest  number ever.   The Voting Rights Act opened the political process for many of the  approximately 6,000 Hispanic public officials that have been elected  and appointed nationwide, including more than 275 at the state or  federal level, 32 of whom serve in Congress.   Native Americans, Asians and others who have historically encountered  harsh barriers to full political participation also have benefited  greatly.   The crown jewel of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 is Section 5, which  requires that states and localities with a chronic record of  discrimination in voting practices secure federal approval before  making any changes to voting processes.   Section 5 protects minority voting rights where voter discrimination  has historically been the worst.   Since 1982, Section 5 has stopped more than 1,000 discriminatory  voting changes in their tracks, including 107 discriminatory changes  right here in Texas.   And it is a source of eternal pride to all of us in Houston that in  pursuit of extending the full measure of citizenship to all Americans,  in 1975 Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, who also represented this  historic 18th Congressional District of Texas, introduced, and the  Congress adopted, what are now Sections 4(f)(3) and 4(f)(4) of the  Voting Rights Act, which extended the protections of Section 4(a) and  Section 5 to language minorities.   During the floor debate on the 1975 reauthorization of the Voting  Rights Act, Congresswoman Jordan explained why this reform was needed:         There are Mexican-American people in the State of Texas who       have been denied the right to vote; who have been impeded in       their efforts to register and vote; who have not had       encouragement from those election officials because they are       brown people.        So, the state of Texas, if we approve this measure, would       be brought within the coverage of this Act for the first       time.    When it comes to extending and protecting the precious right vote,  the Lone Star State--the home state of Lyndon Johnson and Barbara  Jordan--can be the leading state in the Union, one that sets the  example for the nation.   But to realize that future, we must turn from and not return to the  dark days of the past.   We must remain ever vigilant and oppose all schemes that will abridge  or dilute the precious right to vote.   Madam Speaker, I am here today to remind the nation that the right to  vote--that ``powerful instrument that can break down the walls of  injustice''--is facing grave threats.   The threat stems from the decision issued in June 2013 by the Supreme  Court in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 193 (2013), which  invalidated Section 4(b) of the VRA, and paralyzed the application of  the VRA's Section 5 preclearance requirements.   According to the Supreme Court majority, the reason for striking down  Section 4(b) was that ``times change.''   Now, the Court was right; times have changed.   But what the Court did not fully appreciate is that the positive  changes it cited are due almost entirely to the existence and vigorous  enforcement of the Voting Rights Act.   And that is why the Voting Rights Act is still needed.   Let me put it this way: in the same way that the vaccine invented by  Dr. Jonas Salk in 1953 eradicated the crippling effects but did not  eliminate the cause of polio, the Voting Rights Act succeeded in  stymieing the practices that resulted in the wholesale  disenfranchisement of African Americans and language minorities but did  eliminate them entirely.   The Voting Rights Act is needed as much today to prevent another  epidemic of voting disenfranchisement as Dr. Salk's vaccine is still  needed to prevent another polio epidemic.   However, officials in some states, notably Texas and North Carolina,  seemed to regard the Shelby decision as a green light and rushed to  implement election laws, policies, and practices that could never pass  muster under the Section 5 preclearance regime.   My constituents remember very well the Voter ID law passed in Texas  in 2011, which required every registered voter to present a valid  government-issued photo ID on the day of polling in order to vote.   The Justice Department blocked the law in March of 2012, and it was  Section 5 that prohibited it from going into effect.   At least it did until the Shelby decision, because on the very same  day that Shelby was decided officials in Texas announced they would  immediately implement the Photo ID law, and other election laws,  policies, and practices that could never pass muster under the Section  5 preclearance regime.   The Texas Photo ID law was challenged in federal court and  thankfully, just yesterday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth  Circuit upheld the decision of U.S. District Court Judge Nelva Gonzales  Ramos that Texas' strict voter identification law discriminated against  blacks and Hispanics and violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.   Madam Speaker, protecting voting rights and combating voter  suppression schemes are two of the critical challenges facing our great  democracy.   Without safeguards to ensure that all citizens have equal access to  the polls, more injustices are likely to occur and the voices of  millions silenced.   Those of us who cherish the right to vote justifiably are skeptical  of Voter ID laws because we understand how these laws, like poll  [[Page H1007]]  taxes and literacy tests, can be used to impede or negate the ability  of seniors, racial and language minorities, and young people to cast  their votes.   Consider the demographic groups who lack a government issued ID:   1. African Americans: 25 percent;   2. Asian Americans: 20 percent;   3. Hispanic Americans: 19 percent;   4. Young people, aged 18-24: 18 percent; and   5. Persons with incomes less than $35,000: 15 percent.   And there are other ways abridging or suppressing the right to vote,  including:   1. Curtailing or eliminating early voting;   2. Ending same-day registration;   3. Not counting provisional ballots cast in the wrong precinct on  Election Day will not count;   4. Eliminating adolescent pre-registration;   5. Shortening poll hours; and   6. Lessening the standards governing voter challenges thus allowing  self-proclaimed ``ballot security vigilantes'' like the King Street  Patriots to cause trouble at the polls.   Specifically, I call for the passage of H.R. 4, the Voting Rights  Advancement Act, of which I am an original co-sponsor, which repairs  the damage done to the Voting Rights Act by the Supreme Court's Shelby  decision.   This legislation replaces the old ``static'' coverage formula with a  new dynamic coverage formula, or ``rolling trigger,'' which effectively  gives the legislation nationwide reach because any state and any  jurisdiction in any state potentially is subject to being covered if  the requisite number of violations are found to have been committed.   Madam Speaker, before concluding there is one other point I would  like to stress.   In his address to the nation before signing the Voting Rights Act of  1965, President Johnson said:         Presidents and Congresses, laws and lawsuits can open the       doors to the polling places and open the doors to the       wondrous rewards which await the wise use of the ballot.        But only the individual Negro, and all others who have been       denied the right to vote, can really walk through those       doors, and can use that right, and can transform the vote       into an instrument of justice and fulfillment.    In other words, political power--and the justice, opportunity,  inclusion, and fulfillment it provides--comes not from the right to  vote but in the exercise of that right.   And that means it is the civic obligation of every citizen to both  register and vote in every election, state and local as well as  federal.   Because if we can register and vote, but fail to do so, we are guilty  of voluntary voter suppression, the most effective method of  disenfranchisement ever devised.   And in recent years, Americans have not been doing a very good job of  exercising our civic responsibility to register, vote, and make their  voices heard.   Madam Speaker, for millions of Americans, the right to vote made  possible by the 15th Amendment and protected by the Voting Rights Act  of 1965 is sacred treasure, earned by the sweat and toil and tears and  blood of ordinary Americans who showed the world it was possible to  accomplish extraordinary things.   So on this 150th anniversary of that landmark amendment, let us  rededicate ourselves to honoring those who won for us this precious  right by remaining vigilant and fighting against both the efforts of  others to abridge or suppress the right to vote and our own apathy in  exercising this sacred right.
