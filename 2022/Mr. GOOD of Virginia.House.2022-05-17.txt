 Madam Speaker, Democrats believe that the  government should control everything: what kind of car you drive,  whether you have to get a vaccine, how or if you get to heat or cool  your home, if you can keep your job, and if you can open or operate  your business.   Republicans, on the other hand, believe that Americans should control  their own lives, their purchasing decisions, their healthcare  decisions, and even their businesses and apprenticeship programs.   Businessowners across the country try to utilize apprenticeships to  develop the skilled employees that they need to succeed and grow.  Sadly, this Democratic bill only funds government-approved  apprenticeships that are registered with the Department of Labor, not  those designed by businessowners who have the audacity to think that  they know more about their business than those with no business  experience, like President Biden and the progressive activists that  make up his administration.                                time  1530    Why would anyone trust Joe Biden to run their business? He has no  private sector experience, but he is now the proud owner of the worst  economic record in modern history--so there is that.   Why would anyone trust Democrats in this Congress or this  administration to run their business? These former educators, lawyers,  community organizers, and progressive activists have ruined the  outstanding economy that they inherited in January of 2021.   House Democrats demand that you have your apprenticeship program  designed by unelected bureaucrats in the Department of Labor because,  of course, Washington knows best when it comes to everything.   Look what they have done with inflation, supply chains, rising crime,  the open border, and everything else. They are a picture of success. If  Washington truly knew best, then one in four businesses would not have  closed permanently in my home State of Virginia due to Democrat COVID  restrictions.   Employers in my district often ask me: Why do they have to submit to  government control to be eligible for funding for their apprenticeship  program? Who could do a better job developing apprenticeships than the  people who, you know, actually create the jobs; despite Washington's  best efforts to prevent them from doing so? That question was  rhetorical, please don't answer.   My amendment would actually let employers run their own  apprenticeship programs and help them educate their workers the way  they need to so they can expand their workforces.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.
