 Mr. Speaker, this month we observe the 50th anniversary  of the coup in Chile. It is important to note the role that the House  played in declassifying documents relating to the United States' role  in the coup of Allende and the Presidency of Pinochet.   I rise to pay tribute to our former colleague, Maurice Hinchey, who  in 1999 introduced legislation to declassify documents related to the  coup in Chile. Following his leadership, I took his legislation to the  House Intelligence Committee conference.   In our markup of the conference report of the Intelligence  Authorization Act for fiscal year 2000, I was successful in getting an  amendment passed in committee that mirrored the Hinchey legislation.  This language was sustained on the floor and when the FY 2000  Intelligence bill was signed by President Clinton, it became law.   The legislation stated that no longer than 270 days following  enactment--we wanted a shorter period of time, they wanted a longer  period of time. This was the compromise--270 days following the  enactment, the CIA had to submit a report on all of its activities in  various events in Chile in three categories: the assassination of  President Salvador Allende; the ascension of Pinochet to the  Presidency; and the violation of human rights committed by the henchman  of President Pinochet.   In 2001, therefore, the CIA prepared 16,000 documents for  declassification. Since then, thousands more documents--maybe up around  23,000 documents--have been declassified.   During the debate on the FY 2000 legislation, it was argued that the  search for documents related to human rights violations in Chile--now,  we are talking about murder, disappearances, imprisonment, torture;  that is what we are talking about--directed by the National Security  Council was sufficient. They said we did that. It is sufficient. They  said nothing further was needed and raised the question of how much  money will this cost and how much time will it take for the Director of  Central Intelligence to produce an adequate report.   However, Maurice Hinchey argued, in these words: ``It is time that  the Central Intelligence Agency accounted for its role in the military  coup that toppled the democratically elected government of Salvador  Allende and led to his death. The American people need to know how our  government supported the rise of Augusto Pinochet, a ruthless dictator  who systematically murdered and tortured his enemies.''   In May 2016, I had the privilege of leading a strongly bipartisan  congressional delegation to Chile. When we visited the Museum of Memory  and Human Rights--and I would recommend that if you get to Chile you  certainly see that--it was emotional and gratifying for some of us to  see the documents that we had declassified under Maurice Hinchey's  leadership helping bring the truth to light.   To this day in Chile there is still great sadness about the loss of  life and other crimes against humanity perpetrated by Pinochet's  henchman. Last week was the 50th anniversary, and at the observance--an  event marking 50 years since the coup--President Gabriel Boric spoke  eloquently about the importance of reconciliation and democracy.  Democracy--he said it again and again. Thankfully, the President had  also called for a plan to find the nearly 1,500 people who are still  missing or unaccounted for, for their families.   It is my hope that this spirit will lead to more revelations and  accountability.   As we mark 50 years since the coup, I salute the leadership of  Maurice Hinchey. He was a champion of justice; not only in Chile but in  Argentina and in other countries suffering under similar despotic  regimes, including those affected by Operation Condor.   Operation Condor was how all these vicious dictators coordinated  their activities. Maurice Hinchey saw the connection and coordination  among the dictatorships in the death and violence in their countries,  and in relentlessly speaking out against it, he made a difference.   His family is still active in the civic life of New York State. He  passed away on November 22, 2017, but his leadership in the fight for  truth and justice continues to be an inspiration to us all.                            ____________________
