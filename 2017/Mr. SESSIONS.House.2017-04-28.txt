 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 289 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 289         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 99) making further continuing appropriations for fiscal       year 2017, and for other purposes. All points of order       against consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The       joint resolution shall be considered as read. All points of       order against provisions in the joint resolution are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       joint resolution and on any amendment thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of       debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Appropriations;       and (2) one motion to recommit.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my friend, the ranking member of the committee, pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule. It is  a fair rule that enables this body to continue working in a bipartisan  fashion to get our work done for the American people. Essentially, it  is to fund the government for one more week as final preparations are  made and as the Appropriations Committee finalizes its work. It enables  us to continue to serve our constituents. It enables the American  people to have confidence not only in what we are doing, but to provide  the necessary resources so that this Nation can continue to protect  itself also.   I also rise in support of the underlying legislation that is in this  rule. This short-term CR, while being far from ideal, is exactly what  we need to do so that we can allow our colleagues in the House, as well  as the Appropriations Committee and this body, to move forth a bill  that will find its way to the United States Senate and to the  President's desk.   For months now, our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee, under  the great work of our brand-new chairman, Chairman Frelinghuysen from  New Jersey, have been working towards funding a government agreement  while they are trying to reach a long-term bridge.   Yesterday at the Rules Committee, the young chairman, along with the  ranking member, Mrs. Lowey from New York, came and spoke to the Rules  Committee not only with great confidence about the work that they are  doing, but with great confidence about how they worked well together.  It was once again another opportunity for Members of Congress in the  performance of their duties to have confidence not only in their  working relationship, but in the product that they would wish to move  forward.   The Rules Committee was quite blunt to them that, while we were  pleased to see them, we wanted to see them get their work done a week  from now. I think the American people feel the same way. I think they  are willing to take the time to do it right, but it is now time to feel  a little bit of pressure towards completing the work that needs to be  done.   Mr. Speaker, today we are going to have one of the most distinguished  members of the Rules Committee who will speak with us. He shares a role  not only as vice chairman of our committee, but he also has an  opportunity to sit on the Appropriations Committee; a person  responsible as a cardinal for a massive part of not only the Federal  Government spending, but the authority and responsibility for the  Federal Government to deliver in so many areas in support of the  American people.   I will be introducing the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) in just  a few minutes, who will also provide detail and information not only in  support of the great work that is being done, but why we are doing that  for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I am confident that my colleagues on the Appropriations  Committee are going to continue their work. We are asking this body  today to consider this rule to move forth legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman, my friend from  Massachusetts, for his words of wisdom about the direction we ought to  be going. That is what we are going to do; we are going to continue  moving.   I find in my job, as I perform my duties, that I have a chance to  really interact with a lot of people in government. Over Christmas, I  had a chance to visit our troops around the world and look at them and  give them the confidence that what we do in Washington will allow them  to keep working for freedom and to represent us.   Dr. Francis Collins at the National Institutes of Health, an  enormously brilliant man who helped with the genome project, who keeps  NIH up and working; and at the National Eye Institute, Dr. Paul  Sieving; and so many others who do count on us getting it right,  whether it be the United States military, whether it is our border  patrol, whether it is our health and human services, but the person who  knows these characteristics of what it takes to get agreements is also  on the Rules Committee. He is a valuable member of our Rules Committee.  He is the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole).   Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Cole), vice chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services,  Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, also I want to recognize the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) for another birthday today. The gentleman from  Oklahoma was very silent last night at the Rules Committee. He didn't  let us know, so we didn't say anything. But today is his birthday, and  I congratulate him for that.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, last night at the Rules Committee, we had  a debate where we focused our attention not only on the legislation,  but also on the need to get this done.   I appreciate the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor), the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole), and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern) and their attention to the ideas that they have. They do have  ideas, and they do have decisions that would help make this process  even better. We are here today for the right reasons.    I would advise the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern) that I  do not have any further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time  pending his close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts. I want to thank the  gentlewoman from Florida and the gentlewoman from Texas for their  comments about trying to focus us on the activities that perhaps they  would want or not want.   Mr. Speaker, today we are here because Chairman Frelinghuysen and  Ranking Member Lowey came to the Rules Committee yesterday and asked us  to please consider the offer that they were laying on the table, and  that is to fund the government for 1 more week, with an assurance that  they needed 1 more week to complete their work.    You heard the gentleman, the Honorable Tom Cole, distinguished  gentleman from not only Oklahoma, but a gentleman from the  Appropriations Committee, reinforce how important the work is.   We have heard from our colleagues on the Democratic side how  important the NIH is, Francis Collins, the work that he does there; the  United States Military; Secretary of Defense Mattis; the men and women  that protect us; those people that are in Homeland Security. That is  what we are going to do, so that is what we are going to focus on, and  that is just the way it is.   So, Mr. Speaker, I would urge all my colleagues to support this rule  and the underlying legislation.   I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question  on the resolution.   The previous question was ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 235,  nays 178, not voting 17, as follows:                               [Roll No. 235]                                 YEAS--235       Abraham      Aderholt      Allen      Amash      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Black      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Bridenstine      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Chabot      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Costa      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Crist      Culberson      Curbelo (FL)      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      Dent      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Estes (KS)      Farenthold      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Franks (AZ)      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garrett      Gibbs      Gohmert      Goodlatte      Gosar      Gottheimer      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
