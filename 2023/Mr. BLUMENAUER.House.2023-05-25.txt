 Madam Speaker, we have heard claims from Republican  leadership that they passed a bill to lift the debt ceiling.   That is laughable. What they did was pass a wish list to reassure  their most extreme Members. Make no mistake: They have no plan.   I just consulted with the distinguished ranking member of the  Appropriations Committee. They haven't even agreed on the top-line  numbers for this year's appropriations process, let alone move forward  to implement the extreme cuts that they imagine are going to happen.   I just left a Trade Subcommittee hearing where a parade of witnesses  from both parties said we need to invest more in Customs and Border  Protection to protect Americans from fentanyl.   Without a plan, they will continue to target the poor and protect the  privileged and get nothing done.   America deserves better. Let's pass a clean debt ceiling proposal and  get back to work.                            ____________________
