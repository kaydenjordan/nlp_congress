 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, there are all kinds of reports swirling  around Washington, and we are hearing from those reports that the Trump  administration is about to give a huge, early Christmas present to the  oil industry. The reports are, the Department of the Interior is  preparing to unveil a new 5-year plan for offshore oil and gas  drilling--one that would open up the entire Atlantic coast of the  United States to drilling. This new 5-year plan, which would go into  effect in 2019, would replace the current 5-year plan that was  finalized just last year and doesn't expire until 2022.   Why is the Department of the Interior in such a rush to waste  taxpayers' money to write a new one? The answer is, the oil industry  wants to start drilling in these areas now, and the Trump  administration is going to let them do it. While it hasn't been  released yet, we are hearing that the administration's new plan will  open up the entire Atlantic coast to offshore drilling--from Maine to  as far south as Cape Canaveral. Let me show you why that is a problem.   This is the east coast of the United States. This is Maine. This is  Florida. This is Cape Canaveral. This is Fort Pierce, FL. Look what  happens on the Atlantic coast off the eastern continental United  States. These are all military testing areas. Every one of these  hatched areas--every one of these blocks--is of a place that has  limited access because of military testing.   Take, for example, all of this area off the east coast of Florida.  There is a place called the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. There is  a place called the Kennedy Space Center. We are launching commercial  and military rockets, and within another year and a half, we will be  launching American rockets with American astronauts that will go, just  like the space shuttle before them, to and from the International Space  Station and will carry crews as well as the cargo they already carry.   When you are launching to the International Space Station or, in 2  years, when we launch the largest rocket ever from the Kennedy Space  Center--the forerunner to the Mars Program, taking humans to Mars, or  in the case of the new Mars rocket, called the SLS, the Space Launch  System--where do you think it will drop its solid rocket boosters? It  will drop them precisely out here, which is exactly why you cannot have  oil rigs out here.   All of the commercial rockets that come out of Cape Canaveral right  now put up a host of communications satellites; that is, a  constellation of satellites. How do you think we get our pinpoint GPS  here on Earth? Many of those rockets are coming right out of the Cape  Canaveral Air Force Station, and, increasingly, there is commercial  activity at the Kennedy Space Center, which is collocated with the Cape  Canaveral Air Force Station.   What about all of those scientific satellites that are out there that  give us precise measurements on what is happening to the climate so  when we then track hurricanes, we know precisely and have such great  success in predicting the path and the voracity of a hurricane? All of  those rockets are coming out of Cape Canaveral. They have first stages,  and when the first stages burn up, they have to fall someplace. You  cannot have oil and gas production out here.    It would be the same off of Norfolk, VA. They also have a launching  point there for NASA--Wallops Island. Yet, in the Norfolk area, all of  the military does its training out in the Atlantic, and you are going  to have a whole disruption.   Take, for example, all of the military assets--spy satellites--that  go into orbit and are rocketed out of Cape Canaveral. Those first  stages, when burned up, have to fall. That is why we have a location  like the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. It launches from west to  east in order to get that extra boost of the Earth's rotation and,  therefore, needs less fuel to get into orbit.   This is a prime location. You cannot put oil and gas out here. You  cannot have oil rigs off of Cape Canaveral, where all of these  military, NASA, and commercial rockets are going, as well as  governmental payloads that are not military.   We have heard the loud opposition from the Department of Defense, the  chambers of commerce, fishermen, and coastal communities all along the  Atlantic that have weighed in against the administration's plan to  allow drilling off their coasts.   We thought we had put this puppy to bed last year when the Obama  administration backed off its plans to have these drilling areas. They  backed off because of the opposition. They also backed off when it came  to Florida. Why? Florida has more beaches than any other State. We  don't have as much coastline. Alaska has the greatest coastline, but  the last time I checked, Alaska didn't have a lot of beaches. The one  that is blessed with the beautiful beaches is Florida. When it comes to  beaches, that means people want to go to the beach, and that means  there is a significant tourism-driven economy there. We learned what  happened with just the threat of there being oil on the beach. Remember  the Deepwater Horizon oil explosion off of Louisiana? Let me show you  so you don't get confused with all of these colors.   In essence, all of this yellow over on the other side of Florida, in  the Gulf of Mexico, means this area is off-limits. It is in law, and it  is a good thing because when the Deepwater Horizon spilled off of  Louisiana, the winds shifted, and that oil started drifting to the  east. It got as far as Pensacola Beach, and it completely blackened the  white, sugary sands. That photograph went all over the world. Pensacola  Beach was covered up in oil, and the winds kept carrying it forward.  Some of it got into Choctawhatchee Bay and the sands of Destin, and  some of the tar balls went as far east as the Panama City Beach. Then  the winds shifted and carried it back, and that was the extent of the  oil on the beach.   For 1 solid year--a tourist year--the tourists did not come to the  west coast of Florida because they had seen the pictures of what had  happened to Pensacola Beach, all of the way down the west coast--the  Tampa Bay area, Sarasota, the Fort Myers area, Naples, Marco Island.  The tourists did not come.   Now let's go back to the Atlantic. When you start to do this, you are  now threatening the lifeblood of Florida's economy, its tourism-driven  economy. It is not only a threat to the environment, but it is a threat  to the multibillion-dollar, tourism-driven economy.   In 2010, we lost an entire season, as the tourists did not come to  the west coast of Florida. That is why, when I gave the list of all of  those entities, including the U.S. Department of Defense, they don't  want it. It is because  [[Page S7958]]  of the military areas. I also mentioned the chambers of commerce. They  have awakened to the fact that oil on beaches is a killer of our  economy. When this plan is announced later today, probably, it will not  be unusual to see local governments spring into action, like the  Broward County Board of Commissioners, which has already sent letters  that oppose drilling off of Florida's coast.   Floridians understand this issue. That is why, in the past, we have  had such bipartisan agreement all over Florida--Republicans and  Democrats alike--to keep drilling off of our coast, but if Big Oil gets  its way, every inch of the Continental Shelf is going to be drilled. We  saw what happened less than a decade ago. The scientists would say we  are still uncovering, for example, the full extent of that BP oilspill  and its damage.   I urge our colleagues to take up the bill that was filed earlier this  year by this Senator, Senator Markey, and others that would block an  attempt by the administration to open up our coast to oil drilling.   The stakes are extremely high for the economy of our States all along  the eastern coast. Georgia has a substantial tourism-driven economy.  You know South Carolina has Myrtle Beach. What about North Carolina?  What about Virginia's tourism-driven economy and especially with all of  the military concentration there? You can go right on up the coast. The  stakes are exceptionally high. We simply can't risk it.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
