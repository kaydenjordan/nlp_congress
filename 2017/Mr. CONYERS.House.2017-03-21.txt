 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in qualified support of H.R. 372, the Competitive  Health Insurance Reform Act, but I do not endorse the majority's  exaggerated claims regarding the bill's impact on the affordability and  availability of health insurance.   H.R. 372 would partially repeal the limited Federal antitrust  exemption for the business of insurance established by the McCarran- Ferguson Act in 1945. Specifically, the bill only permits Federal  antitrust enforcement with regard to the business of health insurance.   Now, House Democrats have long supported a full repeal of McCarran- Ferguson's antitrust exemption for all insurers, not just for health  insurers. In 2010, under a Democratic House majority, we passed  legislation to repeal the McCarran-Ferguson exemption for health  insurers by a vote of 406-19, even though House Republicans had not  previously supported moving any version of a McCarran-Ferguson repeal  bill.   But let me be clear. Enacting H.R. 372 would in no way be a  substitute for the many health insurance guarantees of the Affordable  Care Act. The two things are completely separate. To begin with,  enacting H.R. 372 would not significantly improve healthcare  affordability or coverage. According to the Congressional Budget  Office, H.R. 372's effect on health insurance premiums would probably  be quite small, and enacting the bill would have no significant net  effect on the premiums the private insurers would charge for health or  dental insurance. That is according to the Congressional Budget Office.   The Consumers Union observes that the application of the antitrust  laws to some health insurance activity, by itself, is simply not enough  to create a vibrant insurance market because our long experience shows  you can't expect a healthcare system to run effectively on competition  alone. That is the Consumers Union.   Likewise, the majority's claim that enacting H.R. 372 would create  major new competition by allowing cross-State insurance sales is  unavailing. Current law, including the Affordable Care Act, already  allows States to agree with each other to allow cross-State insurance  sales.   Enabling Federal antitrust agencies to police certain forms of  anticompetitive conduct will not, in and of itself, incentivize health  insurers to offer products across State lines beyond the incentives  that already exist for offering such products. It just won't happen by  itself. Whatever the incentives for health insurers to offer such  products, they have little to do with Federal antitrust law or  enforcement.   Finally, enacting H.R. 372 would not ensure that the Affordable Care  Act's prohibitions against discrimination and limits on premium growth  would remain in place. H.R. 372 only applies to certain anticompetitive  conduct and does not preserve or enhance existing protections for  consumers of health insurance. For instance, it does not prohibit  discrimination by health insurers on the basis of preexisting  conditions, nor does it reduce premium growth or require health  insurers to be accountable for price increases.   Repeal of the antitrust exemption for health insurance is a  complement to and not a replacement for the Affordable Care Act's many  consumer protections. This is not an either-or situation. We need H.R.  372 and the Affordable Care Act to be in place to maximize benefits,  improve quality, and lower costs for consumers.   So while I support the bill with some reluctance, I take issue with  the majority's rhetoric. It is very important that we set the record  straight here.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H2269]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), who is a distinguished  leader of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In closing, I want to reiterate my support for this measure, H.R.  372. Now, I don't know what is happening on the other side, but many of  its leaders voted against a substantively identical version of this  bill in 2010, and that was including Speaker Ryan, Health and Human  Services Secretary Tom Price, Committee on Ways and Means chairman  Kevin Brady. They voted against a substantively identical version of  this bill. I don't want to impugn motives that I don't know about, but  maybe if you support H.R. 372, you are going to be making the  Affordable Care Act, ACA, better. So I want to thank my friends on the  other side for helping us out. This is great. We passed something like  this a few years ago, and we were very proud that it was an  overwhelming vote.   This is a very important step forward. The Affordable Care Act is not  going to be affected in any kind of negative way, and that is why I am  eager to join with those who are going to be voting for H.R. 372. I  thank my friends on the other side for supporting H.R. 372 as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
