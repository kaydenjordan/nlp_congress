 Madam President, I am glad to hear the distinguished  Senator, my colleague and friend, speak about the problems on the  southern border.   I feel for President Biden because he inherited a horrible mess from  his predecessor, a man who said that he would build a wall, which he  didn't--a wall that would stop illegal immigration, which it didn't-- and that he would build it, saying he would get the money from Mexico,  knowing that he would not get 1 cent from Mexico, but he repeated that  falsehood hundreds of times around this country. He also actually took  money away from housing for families on our military bases, from  families living in substandard housing. It was money that Congress had  voted for to repair the housing to make it safe, to remove lead, mold,  and so on. He took that money to build a wall that he claimed, as I  said, Mexico would pay for.   When I was the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we passed by  about a 2-to-1 margin, after months and months and months of debate and  work, an immigration bill here in the  [[Page S1743]]  Senate. Republicans and Democrats voted for it, and it certainly could  have solved all of these problems.   When it went over to the House of Representatives, there were enough  votes to pass it there, but it would not be with a majority of the  Republicans. The Republican Speaker said that he could not bring up the  bill, even though it had passed, because it was violating a rule very  sacred to them, a rule named after Dennis Hastert, a former Speaker,  and they could not violate the great respect they had for Dennis  Hastert and his rule. So, even though it had passed, they did not bring  it up. Of course, subsequent to that, Dennis Hastert went to prison for  child abuse.    I yield the floor.
