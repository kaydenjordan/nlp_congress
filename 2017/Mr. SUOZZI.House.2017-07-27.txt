 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 8, line 23, after the dollar amount, insert ``(reduced       by $34,734,000)''.        Page 14, line 13, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $34,734,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Suozzi) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak in support of a  bipartisan amendment that I am offering with Congressman Peter King and  Congressman Paul Cook.   Amendment No. 10 under the rule is to division A of the Defense  Appropriations bill. The purpose of the amendment is to match the $34  million in funding for the Navy's Environmental Restoration Account,  authorized unanimously in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act,  but was not included in the appropriations process.   In my district, for almost four decades, the people of Bethpage and  the surrounding areas have been dealing with an environmental crisis.  Groundwater pollution, stemming from the Navy and defense contractor  activity, has resulted in an underground plume of contaminated water  that is moving south through Long Island's sole source of drinking  water, towards Congressman King's district.   While costly remediation efforts ensure the water is safe to consume,  it doesn't change the fact that residents deserve to have this cleaned  up before it spreads any further.   The contamination, known as the Navy-Grumman Plume, is one of  thousands of sites at hundreds of locations that have experienced  environmental degradation because of defense-related activities.  Congressman Peter King, Congressman Paul Cook, and I have submitted  this bipartisan amendment that will increase funding for the Navy's  Environmental Restoration Account, which helps fund cleanup and  remediation efforts for these sites.   This is not a partisan issue. The funding levels sought by this  amendment received bipartisan support in the NDAA. Chairman  Thornberry's mark and my amendment together, which was joined by  Congressman Cook and Congresswoman Hanabusa, increased the authorized  amount by $42 million.   The amount sought here, $34 million, will match the appropriated  amount with the authorized funding levels. Our colleagues on both sides  of the aisle supported that effort because this funding will help clean  up sites from Maine to Hawaii, from Florida to Washington State, and  were provided for with the appropriate pay-for.   I ask for my colleagues' support for this bipartisan amendment so we  can help fund efforts across the country to help clean up environmental  contamination in our districts. People in my district and regions  across the country deserve to have these sites fully cleaned. It is  commonsense, bipartisan, and the right thing to do. I urge my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would just like to point out to the  gentlewoman, respectfully, that it will cost billions of dollars to  clean up these sites in the United States of America. The increase that  we are seeking here, in a bipartisan fashion, is $34 million to simply  match the amount of money that was authorized in the NDAA.   In addition, this percentage increase that we are seeking is  commensurate with the overall percentage increase in the overall NDAA  budget this year from last year. So we are just simply seeking the same  commensurate amount increase in this portion of the budget that there  is in another portion.   We are looking to have the pay-for to come from the operations and  maintenance defense-wide account, of which there is over $33 billion.  We are looking for $34 million just to try to advance some of these  cleanups.    I yield to the gentleman from Indiana.    Mr. Chairman, I would just like to close by saying that I  do appreciate the hard work that has been done by so many on both sides  of the aisle in this particular area. We all appreciate how important  the cleanup of these environmental sites are. The people in my district  have been suffering with this for 40 years, and we are trying to bring  attention to the issue and trying to get the resources focused on this.   We have met with people from the Navy, from the Army Corps of  Engineers, from the EPA, from the DEC, and from local State officials  in the State of New York that are interested. Congressman Peter King  and Congressman Paul Cook both understand how important it is that we  try and send the signal that we are trying to have a commensurate  increase in this account with the overall increase in the budget.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York  will be postponed.       Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. Brendan F. Boyle of Pennsylvania    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12  printed in part B of House Report 115-261.   Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I have an  amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 8, line 23, after the dollar amount insert the       following: ``(reduced by $60,000,000)''.        Page 14, line 13, after the dollar amount insert the       following: ``(increased by $30,000,000)''.        Page 15, line 8, after the dollar amount insert the       following: ``(increased by $30,000,000''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 478, the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle) and a Member opposed each will  control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.   Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, this is a bit of  a complex issue, so I will do my best to explain. It is, unfortunately,  an issue that my constituents and a number in the suburban Philadelphia  area have been dealing with now for the last 2\1/2\ years.   The chemicals with the acronyms PFOS and PFOA are part of a class of  manmade, highly fluorinated chemicals that are highly persistent in our  environment.   In the 1970s, the Department of Defense began using a firefighting  foam with the acronym AFFF. Unfortunately, that firefighting foam to  extinguish petroleum fires contained these chemical compounds. These  chemicals have subsequently been linked to problems in liver, thyroid,  and pancreatic function, as well as changes in hormone levels.   Some studies have shown developmental issues in children, decreased  fertility, increased cholesterol, immune system deficiencies, and an  increased cancer risk. Production of AFFF has ceased, but stockpiles  remain.   Today, the Department of Defense is evaluating and testing the  drinking water systems of hundreds of communities nationwide due to  PFOA and PFOS contamination on or surrounding these defense  installations across the country that used AFFF.   So far, water contamination has been found near 27 military bases in  16 States. This includes the community that I represent and that my  colleagues share in representing. In my district alone, families  surrounding Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Willow Grove, as well  as the Horsham Air Guard Station, suffer from the uncertainty of  wondering whether their child's or their spouse's illness is caused by  the military's contamination on the base in their local community.   They have paid for endless stockpiles of bottled water and higher  utility fees, as their communities have taken steps to reduce the water  system's exposure. I commend the steps the military has taken to date,  but more can and must be done.   I know that our communities in the Philadelphia area are, sadly, just  the tip of the iceberg. This past year alone, since the EPA tightened  its lifetime health advisory under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the  Department has completed testing of 480 drinking water systems at  locations where the Department supplies drinking water. It continues to  conduct preliminary assessments and site inspections under CERCLA to  identify sites where PFOA and PFOS may have been released by the  Department of Defense.   The Department spent approximately $200 million just last year in  response to PFOA and PFOS contamination nationwide. This funding has  been used to conduct preliminary assessments and site inspections, test  drinking water systems, and provide mitigation such as bottled water or  drinking water filtration systems where water system tests indicated  PFOA and PFOS are above the EPA advisory levels.   Unfortunately, though, the Department has been funding this response  using existing funds that were originally programmed for other response  actions.   In order to support near-term outreach and engagement in local  communities that have this impacted drinking water system and  adequately prepare for long-term remediation of what is likely to be  billions of dollars' and many years' worth of response, I worked with  the House Armed Services Committee to increase its authorization for  the Navy and Air Force environmental remediation accounts by an  additional $30 million each in the NDAA the House passed earlier this  month. My amendment would bring the  [[Page H6499]]  appropriation in line with that authorization.   This funding is a necessary response to an ongoing environmental  issue that is only going to get worse and more expensive for the  Department, not to mention the countless innocent communities impacted  across the country, both in Republican and Democratic districts.                                time  1500    I want to thank my Republican neighbors Pat Meehan and Brian  Fitzpatrick for working with me on this issue in a truly bipartisan  manner. I hope the House comes together in a similar manner today to  strengthen our Department of Defense's response to drinking water  contamination it is causing in the communities we represent.   Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 15 seconds  remaining.   Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I yield the balance  of my time to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), my  neighbor and colleague from Bucks County.
