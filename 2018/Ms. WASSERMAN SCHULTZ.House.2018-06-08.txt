 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, in 2017, the VTP program transported a total of 557,331  veterans, of which 103,704 were disabled veterans.   The VTP office is the authoritative source for all veteran-related  travel initiatives. Its core mission is to assist in the improvements  of access to care and assist veterans in overcoming transportation  barriers to accessing VHA services.   VTS has established a network of transportation options for veterans  through joint efforts with VA's Office of Rural Health and veterans  service organizations.   This is a valuable program that has clearly been recognized and  highlighted by the gentleman from California, that helps veterans who  are visually impaired, elderly, or immobilized due to disease or  disability, and particularly those living in remote and rural areas, to  get to their medical appointments.   At a time with the VA where we are struggling to make sure both in  terms of time that veterans have to wait to get an appointment and the  difficulty in getting through a long distance to get that service, this  is an important amendment.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman from California's contribution  and I strongly support it.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I support the efforts by the gentleman from Massachusetts to combat  opioid abuse, which really has been a scourge in every region of this  country and has left almost no region in this Nation untouched.   The rates of prescription opioid misuse and overdose continue to  increase sharply, and prescription opioids are now a leading cause of  death in the United States. In fact, Mr. Chairman, we are about to  reach the third year in a row that life expectancy in the United States  will have gone down. That is the first time that has happened since all  the way back to World War I, and it can be directly attributed to  opioid abuse and the resulting deaths that has caused.   So I agree with my friend from Massachusetts that the VA should have  a toolkit similar to the mental health toolkit and that it could save  lives. I support the amendment.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, pain management education for  the prescription of opioids in the VA could help with opioid abuse;  that is clear. The VA already has guidelines regarding the management  of opioid therapy for chronic pain and provides clear and  comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations incorporating current  information and practices for practitioners throughout the DOD and the  VA healthcare systems.   Mr. Chairman, these guidelines are provided to minimize harm and  increase patient safety in patients who require opioid therapy, but  these guidelines only work if the prescriber is adequately trained. And  that is why the gentleman from Massachusetts' amendment would be so  helpful, because we all know that the key to making sure that we can  reach people and maximize the effectiveness of the program is to ensure  that the appropriate and significant training is done so that we can  achieve those goals. So I support this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition,  even though I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman from Texas has  identified a very important issue, one that was brought to my attention  in sharp relief by my own hospital association just yesterday.   In Florida, we are now the third-largest State in the Union, and the  hospitals in my home State are owed at least $134 million in payments  that have not been paid by the VA.   I mean, I don't care how big your operation is, that is a tremendous  amount of money, and prompt payment is a critical issue because we need  to make sure that the resources that are appropriated to our healthcare  system and the revenue that we need generated to contribute to our  economy and the care that we need provided is done so promptly.   What we don't want to have happen is healthcare providers deciding  not to provide services outside the VA to VA patients. And my  discussion with them yesterday was that there are healthcare providers  in our State that are starting to decide not to take VA patients  anymore, and that would be a travesty.   The gentlewoman is absolutely correct. Waiting 2 or 3 years for  payment--that is the kind of length of time we are talking about here-- can have a devastating impact, particularly on small business.   It is not a new issue at the VA. For example, former Secretary David  Shulkin started rapid response teams whose goal was to settle the most  substantial outstanding bills as quickly as possible.   Mr. Chairman, the issue of prompt payments must be addressed as more  veterans seek services outside of the VA. It is a tremendous problem,  and I am really pleased that the gentlewoman has brought it to our  attention, raised the issue, because we need to know the full scope of  VA delinquent payments. So I support this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  even though I am not in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, you just can't make this stuff  up. The committee members have been to the D.C. VA Medical Center, and  they put on a nice show when I first became ranking member. They leave  a good impression. But the documented issues at the D.C. VA Medical  Center are well known, and I want to just walk our colleagues through a  few of them because this is how egregious it is. The gentleman's  suggestion through this amendment to make sure that the IG takes a very  close look at what is going on at this medical center is critical.   The D.C. VA Medical Center was found to have paid exorbitant amounts  for supplies and equipment, including $300 per speculum, which could  have been purchased for $122 each, and $900 each for a special needle  that was available for $250. In one case, the medical center rented in- home hospital beds for three patients for 3 years at a total cost of  $877,000. The medical center could have bought the three beds for  $21,000.   A review of 124 veteran patient records found problems with supplies  or instruments in 74 of the cases between 2014 and 2017.   One surgery was canceled after the patient was already under  anesthesia because a retractor was unavailable because it had not been  sterilized since its previous use a week earlier.   A surgeon had to improvise when a tool used to prepare a skin graft  was broken and the graft failed. A surgical staff member had to run to  a private sector hospital across the street to borrow mesh to repair a  hernia midprocedure.   Investigators received more than 1,300 boxes of unsecured records  from two warehouses, the hospital basement, and a large trash dumpster  in April 2017. Of those records, 81 percent contained confidential  patient information, including medical scans and records dating back to  the 1970s. This facility is failing the veterans in the Metro D.C. area  who deserve better.   This is an important amendment, and making sure that the VA takes  care of its patients and is not negligent or derelict in its duties at  every single place that those veterans are serviced is critical.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the gentleman deserves credit for  bringing this to the House's attention. The outrage at this medical  center speaks for itself, and I look forward to making sure that the IG  has the resources that are needed to be able to get to the bottom to  help fix this problem.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition,  although I do not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, the committee opposed the  Department's tentative decision last fall to convert almost a billion  dollars of funding for homeless programs from special purpose funding  to general purpose funding.   This action would have been a fundamental change to the manner in  which medical care funding is allocated to the field, and I support  giving more local flexibility to Veterans Integrated Service Networks  and medical center directors.                                time  1015    However, I strongly support transparency when it comes to changing  the levels that Congress sets for VA programs.   We are the appropriations institution. We are the ones that make  those decisions. The proposed realignment by VA would have potentially  risked funding for essential programs such as the Supportive Services  for Veteran Families Program.   Thankfully, after numerous discussions with the committee and public  outrage, the Department decided not to move forward with its proposal  in FY18. We fully expect for the VA to comply with the levels that we  set for programs; and if the levels need to be adjusted, then the VA  must consult with Congress before making changes.   I thank the gentleman from California for his amendment, and I  believe it sends a strong message to the Department that it must  respect congressional priorities.   I urge all Members to support the gentleman's amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I do oppose this amendment. I, like  many Members, have concerns and share the gentleman's concerns about  another round of BRAC. I realize that this is a complex issue for all  Members of Congress, especially those with military facilities in their  district.   I know that previous rounds of BRAC have ended up being far more  expensive and expansive than we were initially led to believe. However,  I have concerns about maintaining the infrastructure that the  Department of Defense doesn't need. For example, the estimate of excess  capacity for the Army is 22 percent. The Air Force's estimate of excess  capacity is roughly 30 percent.   I can tell you that, since I became the ranking member of this  subcommittee, when I have traveled around the world, almost to a  person, when we have spoken to a leader on a military base, they raise  the issue of needing to go through another round of BRAC. Both the Army  and the Air Force are strong supporters of another BRAC round.   While this amendment has no real effect, it does send a message that  Congress is unwilling to tackle a tough issue. This amendment is an  abdication of our duties as Members of this House to ensure taxpayer  resources are being used in a wise and fiscally responsible way.  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and have a  serious conversation about another BRAC round.   While I am not suggesting that we support another BRAC round, we  should not be tying our hands by taking it off the table.   Mr. Chair, I urge Members to oppose the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, just to reiterate, we shouldn't be  taking any method that gives us an opportunity to be fiscally  responsible and save money off the table.   Our friends on the other side of the aisle consistently talk a good  game about being fiscally responsible, blow holes in the deficit by  passing massive tax scam legislation of a $1.5 trillion deficit  expansion, and include amendments like this one that prevent the  military, who have asked repeatedly to be able to at least engage in a  discussion about another BRAC round, to save millions of dollars and  close facilities that are no longer needed. Yet, the last several  years, the majority has refused to make the tough decisions and at  least have a discussion about this.   It is not responsible. Certainly not fiscally responsible. Mr. Chair,  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, as the designee of Ranking Member  Lowey, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the chairman of  the full committee and our ranking member, Mrs. Lowey, for the  incredible work that they have done to get us to this point.   While in the minority we have had some concerns about the process,  the opportunity to work closely side by side with our colleagues, the  opportunity that I had to work with Chairman Dent and looking forward  to working with Chairman Carter, is really an example of how we should  be working together throughout the entire legislative process.   I want to thank our staff for doing a remarkable job on this work  product, and I look forward to continuing to conference.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
