 Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce along with  the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Graham, the Strengthening Coastal  Communities Act of 2022.   The Strengthening Coastal Communities Act of 2022 amends the Coastal  Barrier Resources Act and codifies maps to update and add units to the  Coastal Barrier Resources System. Congress first passed the bipartisan  Coastal Barrier Resources Act in 1982, due in no small part to the hard  work of former Congressman Tom Evans from Delaware. Today, the Coastal  Barrier Resources System consists of 588 system units, which are areas  of low and undeveloped coastal land along the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico,  Great Lakes, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico coasts. There are  also 282 otherwise protected areas in the system, which are used  primarily for conservation and recreation purposes. Together, this is  3.5 million acres of land and associated aquatic habitat. These units  and areas are important not only because they protect habitat vital to  our Nation's wildlife but because conserving sensitive coastal habitats  also protects our coastal communities--our homes, businesses, and  infrastructure--from flooding.   The Strengthening Coastal Communities Act represents a proactive step  toward more resilient coastlines across our Nation. We need to  prioritize the protection of our coastlines ahead of the next storm  instead of in response to it. Doing so will make our coastal  communities better able to withstand extreme weather events in the face  of a changing climate.   The legislation I am introducing today would codify 195 updated or  new maps that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has transmitted to  Congress for the Coastal Barrier Resources System. This bill also  includes some minor amendments to the Coastal Barrier Resources Act to  improve Agency implementation of the Act. In addition, the bill  authorizes $5 million in appropriations annually for the Coastal  Barrier Resources Act for fiscal years 2023 through 2027. This increase  from the last appropriation authorization of $2 million is well- justified by the long-term coastal resilience value generated by the  program. This program also saves taxpayer dollars by restricting the  use of Federal funding in the sensitive areas that comprise the Coast a  Barrier Resources System. This reauthorization has clear benefits for  our environment and economy--a win-win for Delaware and our Nation.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this important  legislation this Congress. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the  bill I am introducing today be printed in the Record following my  statement.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 5185         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

The Strengthening Coastal Communities Act of 2022 amends the Coastal  Barrier Resources Act and codifies maps to update and add units to the  Coastal Barrier Resources System. Congress first passed the bipartisan  Coastal Barrier Resources Act in 1982, due in no small part to the hard  work of former Congressman Tom Evans from Delaware. Today, the Coastal  Barrier Resources System consists of 588 system units, which are areas  of low and undeveloped coastal land along the Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico,  Great Lakes, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico coasts. There are  also 282 otherwise protected areas in the system, which are used  primarily for conservation and recreation purposes. Together, this is  3.5 million acres of land and associated aquatic habitat. These units  and areas are important not only because they protect habitat vital to  our Nation's wildlife but because conserving sensitive coastal habitats  also protects our coastal communities--our homes, businesses, and  infrastructure--from flooding.   The Strengthening Coastal Communities Act represents a proactive step  toward more resilient coastlines across our Nation. We need to  prioritize the protection of our coastlines ahead of the next storm  instead of in response to it. Doing so will make our coastal  communities better able to withstand extreme weather events in the face  of a changing climate.   The legislation I am introducing today would codify 195 updated or  new maps that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has transmitted to  Congress for the Coastal Barrier Resources System. This bill also  includes some minor amendments to the Coastal Barrier Resources Act to  improve Agency implementation of the Act. In addition, the bill  authorizes $5 million in appropriations annually for the Coastal  Barrier Resources Act for fiscal years 2023 through 2027. This increase  from the last appropriation authorization of $2 million is well- justified by the long-term coastal resilience value generated by the  program. This program also saves taxpayer dollars by restricting the  use of Federal funding in the sensitive areas that comprise the Coast a  Barrier Resources System. This reauthorization has clear benefits for  our environment and economy--a win-win for Delaware and our Nation.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this important  legislation this Congress. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the  bill I am introducing today be printed in the Record following my  statement.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 5185         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
