 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of the following nominations en bloc:  Calendar Nos. 46 through 52, No. 82 through No. 107, No. 110 through  No. 113, No. 133 through No. 139; that the nominations be confirmed en  bloc; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions  be in order to any of the nominations; and that the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.     Mr. President, I think this is now the fifth time that I  have been out here with the Senator from Alabama. We started this off  some time ago, and we obviously have a profound and fundamental  disagreement here. You know, I am deeply worried about this because I  don't think this is actually about the Senators who are here. It is  about people serving in our Armed Forces. It is about people living in  the United States of America, and it is about some really fundamental  things that have changed in the United States.   The Senators on the other side of the aisle, tonight, have been  talking about a 40-year consensus about the funding of abortions by the  Federal Government, which is not actually even at issue in this  discussion because that is not part of the rules that have been  changed.   I think that even the Senator from Utah's language here suggests that  he knows that about the rules that have been proposed by the Department  of Defense.   But the reason we are on this floor again is that the Senator from  Alabama has said he will never compromise, and there is nothing that  can convince him to change his mind, that he will be out here as long  as it takes.   And let's ask the question: What is he defending? What is he  defending? His position is that we shouldn't pay a travel allowance for  members of the armed services who are going from a State that banned  abortion to a State where they can get reproductive healthcare. He is  against that, so he is holding up every single flag officer in the  United States of America as a result of that--a tactic that has never  been used in the history of the U.S. Senate in 230 years or more than  that. That is what he is using because he is so offended that people  can have their travel covered for this procedure.    He has never come here to object to the fact that people can get  their travel covered for all kinds of medical procedures, even though  none of those procedures are written into the underlying statute by the  U.S. Congress because that is not our job. We delegate that to the  Department of Defense.   So he is going to be out here, and he is going to fight this until  there is no travel allowance for people who need to travel. They have  to cover it on their own dime, just like they have to cover that  reproductive surgery or abortion on their own dime, despite what the  Senator from Alabama said. He is going to be out here until it all  freezes over, until he ensures that--you just heard him say it--anybody  who leaves has to take paid leave.   Let's be precise about it. Women who leave to travel to another State  where an abortion is legal, under his scenario, will have to pay for  that travel themselves even though we pay for that travel for all kinds  of other things. He will be out here fighting this, making sure that  not a single flag officer can ever be promoted in the Department of  Defense, no matter who it is, no matter how important it is, until he  is assured that women in the Defense Department are stripped of the  ability to have a little bit of extra time to talk to their commanding  officer when they are confronting one of the most difficult decisions  anybody can make.   Those are the three rules that are at issue here--travel that is paid  for, a little bit of extra time, and some paid leave.   Why are we having this debate? We are having this debate because for  the first time in the history of the United States since  Reconstruction, we have lost a fundamental freedom, we have lost a  fundamental right, and that is the result of the Dobbs decision.   People come out here, and they are talking about a 40-year consensus  on this or that. We had a 50-year consensus in this country about a  woman's access to abortion. We had a 50-year consensus among the courts  and among the American people about what a woman's right to choose  looked like. And we had a 40-year campaign, year after year after year,  to create a U.S. Supreme Court--a majority of whom subscribe to, in my  opinion, the mythological legal doctrine of originalism--to strip the  American people of that right, to strip the American people of that  freedom, because if it wasn't a freedom in 1868, it is not a freedom  today. That has dramatically upset the expectations of the American  people, including those who serve in uniform.  [[Page S1670]]    Tragically, in my opinion--and this is one of those things where  people can have fundamental moral disagreements and fundamental  religious disagreements and fundamental positions that are totally  different from one another, which I completely respect. I resolved  these things in my own mind with the idea that this is a decision a  woman should be left to make with her doctor. That is what I believe.  But in the wake of this decision that was fought for for so long by so  many politicians in America--50 years or more than 50 years--we have  now lost that fundamental freedom. We have now lost that fundamental  right. It is no longer a choice between a woman and her doctor.   In the wake of the Dobbs decision, there are 18 States that have now  banned abortion--18 States. There are nine States--I just got a thumbs- up on the other side from the staff--there are nine States that have  banned abortion without any exception for rape or incest.   The Senator from Alabama's State is a State that has banned abortion.  It is a State where there is no exception for rape or incest. It is a  State where, if you are a doctor and you have performed an abortion,  you could go to jail for 99 years.   My State is totally different from that. My State is the first State  in America, I think, that codified a woman's right to choose before Roe  was even decided, in our State. In the aftermath of the Dobbs decision,  we are the first State to say that we believe this should be a choice  between a woman and her doctor.   We are going to fight that out in the country. A majority of people  support the position that Colorado has taken. Fifty-five percent of the  people in Alabama support the ability of women to be able to make this  choice under some circumstances. Yet the Senator from Alabama has  decided that his remedy can force his view of morality and of  principle. His perspective is that he is going to do something that no  Senator has done for 230 years, which is to hold up every flag  officer's promotion in the Department of Defense.   Last week, seven former Secretaries of Defense, Republicans and  Democrats, said that this block is ``harming military readiness and  risks damaging U.S. national security.'' I am not saying that. I am not  saying that. Seven former Secretaries of Defense have said that.   Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that the letter be  printed in the Record so everybody can see that it is both Republicans  and Democrats who are saying that about the unprecedented hold being  put here by the Senator from Alabama.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       Letter From Seven Former United States Secretaries of Defense                                                        May 4, 2023.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Senate Majority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Minority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Leader Schumer and Leader McConnell: As former       Secretaries of Defense, we strongly urge the Senate to act       expeditiously on the nearly 200 nominees for general and flag       officer who are being blocked from Senate confirmation.        The blanket hold on the promotion or reassignment of these       senior uniformed leaders is harming military readiness and       risks damaging U.S. national security. Because the Senate is       required to confirm every general and flag officer for       promotion or for reassignment, this practice has       traditionally been a pro-forma exercise, except where there       have been specific concerns about individual nominees, which       were then handled separately.        The current hold that has been in place now for several       weeks is preventing key leaders from assuming important,       senior command and staff positions around the world. Some are       unable to take important command positions, such as leading       the 5th Fleet in Bahrain and the 7th Fleet in the Pacific,       which are critical to checking Iranian and Chinese       aggression, respectively. Others include the next military       representative to NATO, a post essential to coordinating       allied efforts in support of Ukraine, as well as the future       Director ofintelligence at U.S. Cyber Command. Leaving these       and many other senior positions in doubt at a time of       enormous geopolitical uncertainty sends the wrong message to       our adversaries and could weaken our deterrence.        Moreover, if this blanket hold is not lifted, nearly 80       three- and four-star commanders who are ending their terms in       the coming months will not be able to be replaced. Worse,       this will impact certain members of the Joint Chiefs of       Staff, including the Chairman of the JCS.        There are also real-world impacts on the families of these       senior officers. Most cannot move and resettle their       families; their children cannot enroll at their next schools       on time; and spouses cannot start new jobs at the next duty       station. We can think of few things as irresponsible and       uncaring as harming the families of those who serve our       nation in uniform.        We appreciate that Senators can have sincere and legitimate       concerns about a Pentagon policy, including as it may relate       to broader domestic or social issues. These lawmakers also       deserve timely and thorough responses to their questions.       However, we believe placing a hold on all uniformed nominees       risks turning military officers into political pawns, holding       them responsible for a policy decision made by their civilian       leaders.        Rather, senators should leverage the numerous means       available to them to challenge and change DOD policy, such as       introducing legislation, conducting oversight hearings, or       amending the annual National Defense Authorization Act.        We, therefore, strongly urge the Senate to ensure the       continued readiness of the U.S. armed forces by lifting the       blanket hold and promptly voting to confirm these uniformed       nominees.            Sincerely,      Hon. William J. Perry,        Former U.S. Secretary of Defense.      Hon. William S. Cohen,        Former U.S. Secretary of Defense.      Hon. Robert M. Gates,        Former U.S. Secretary of Defense.      Hon. Leon E. Panetta,        Former U.S. Secretary of Defense.      Hon. Chuck Hagel,        Former U.S. Secretary of Defense.      Hon. James N. Mattis,        Former U.S. Secretary of Defense.      Hon. Mark T. Esper,        Former U.S. Secretary of Defense.     I also want to say finally, and I will stop, that the  rules the Department of Defense has had to put in place in the wake of  the Dobbs decision stripping women of this fundamental freedom,  stripping women of this fundamental right--these rules don't do what my  colleagues are saying they are going to do.   Once again, it is a travel allowance. It says you can take paid  leave. It says you can have a little bit more time to notify your  commanding officer. That is all it is saying. My colleague from Alabama  has unleashed the equivalent of this procedural nuclear weapon because  that offends his principles, that offends his sense of what is right.   I am not here to debate with him his sense of what is right, but I do  believe that it is right that people who are serving in the Armed  Forces of the United States of America, people who have enlisted to  defend this country, who do not have the right to pick and choose which  State they are going to be in and serve in, whether it is--of all  people in this country, of all people in this country--I have heard  people say--in fact, I even heard the Senator from Utah say this; I  have read him saying this--that one of the great things about living in  America is that you can move from State to State. That is one of the  great things of our federalist system, is you can take advantage of the  laws that are consistent with your values and get away from the ones  that are not. That is not true for our men and women in the military.   This is one of the practical consequences that the Dobbs majority  never grappled with because they applied their view of originalism to  the fundamental--to the issues we are facing today as a country.   The very first call I got after that decision was made--almost the  first call--was from a woman who had served as an officer in the Air  Force who told me a personal story that she had been through. She said  to me: Michael, they have no idea what the effect of readiness is going  to be on our Armed Forces. They have no idea.   I don't think they would have ever believed that it would have been  Members of the U.S. Senate who would have affected the readiness in the  wake of Dobbs the way that it is being done tonight.   So I would ask respectfully for the Senator from Alabama to withdraw  his  [[Page S1671]]  hold, to allow the Senate to move forward, as it has done for the last  230 years, to approve these candidates who have themselves signed up to  serve and themselves done the work to get promoted. Let's have the  argument that we need to have as a nation--that we need to have as a  nation--about this fundamental freedom and about this fundamental right  without holding our Department of Defense hostage.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, the hour is late, and I am conscious that  we are supposed to get off the floor. I know the staff needs to go  home. So I won't belabor this.   I will say that I will put to one side, and I am sure that my  colleague, my friend from Utah, would agree, that we are not talking  here about a drunken frat party and the fortunes or misfortunes of an  ungrateful student and their rich uncle. We are talking about people  that, in real life, are having to make decisions that are the most  fundamental decisions that any individual can make.   They have had 50 years' worth of expectations about what those  decisions are going to look like, and those expectations have been  completely upset by the Supreme Court, first, when this originalist  majority ruled that if it wasn't a freedom in 1868, it is not a freedom  today. It is something that, when I was in law school, I never imagined  that I would ever have read out of a Supreme Court opinion, certainly  not on something of this magnitude.   But then in the wake of it, 18 States banned abortion. In the wake of  it, nine States banned abortion without exceptions for rape or incest.  In the wake of it, in Alabama, they are saying that if doctors use  chemicals for abortion, they can be prosecuted with a statute that was  written to attack fentanyl or methamphetamines. And in the wake of it,  Members of the U.S. Senate come to this floor and use a procedure that  has never been used before in the history of America to hold up every  single flag promotion just to make sure they can make it harder for  somebody who is facing the most difficult decision that they can ever  make; to make it harder for them to decide when they are going to talk  to their superior officer; to make it harder for them to travel  somewhere where, yes, they have to pay for that abortion out of their  pocket; to ensure that you have to use paid leave to do it; that that  is such an injustice that we are going to come out here and hold up  every flag officer's promotion.   Some people, after this ruling--I never heard the Senator from Utah  say this, and I am not ascribing this to him. But there were people  after that ruling who said: Don't worry about this. You don't have to  worry about this. This is just States' rights. It is the laboratory of  the States. It is going back to the States.   And 18 States have banned abortion, and many of those States are  States where people in the armed services serve. They have no choice  over where they serve.   I am not the originalist on this floor tonight, but I can read the  plain language of those regulations, and I could see from that plain  language that there is nothing in there that pays for abortion.   There was no objection out here on this floor when somebody at the  Defense Department put in procedures, as the Senator from Utah says,  for appendicitis or for bunions or for whatever is on his list. There  was no objection. There was nobody coming here to the floor indignantly  saying that their rights as a Senator had been somehow stripped as a  result of that rulemaking--far from it, because people recognized that  in order for the Department of Defense to function just like any other  administrative Agency, they have to be able to make decisions based on  delegated powers from the U.S. Congress. And in the face of what has  happened with the Dobbs decision, the Defense Department is trying to  get to a place where there is a reasonable outcome for people who have  to make this decision.   I think there is a lot of benefit to federalism, but one of those  benefits ought to be that, if you are serving in the Department of  Defense and the Department of Defense assigns you, as is the Department  of Defense's right, without your permission or without your say-so,  without your OK, that it is reasonable for the Department of Defense to  notice when you are living in a State that has banned abortion with no  exceptions for rape or incest. It is reasonable for the Department of  Defense to notice that you are living in a State where, if you are a  doctor and you performed an abortion, you could go to jail for 99 years  or, if you are living in the ``Republic'' of Texas, where they have  actually put a bounty of $10,000 or $20,000 so that, if a neighbor or a  friend turns you in for pursuing reproductive healthcare--an abortion-- you can get that money because you let somebody know that you have done  that.   I mean, I admit this has all changed because of Dobbs, and now we are  trying to grapple with that. We are all trying to grapple with that,  and we all have differences of opinion about that.   But I think what we are saying is, don't make a difficult situation  even harder for the people who have signed up, volunteered to be at the  Department of Defense; don't create more uncertainty at the Department  of Defense by holding up these flag promotions just to get your point  of view, just to be able to make sure that it is harder, not easier,  for people to access reproductive healthcare.   And I think that is why, when the Senator from Alabama says that  nothing is going to convince him, that he is going to be doing this as  long as it takes, I am really worried that that is going to take  forever because the majority, certainly, of the American people are not  going to agree that we should make it harder for people who are in this  position.  [[Page S1673]]    And by the way, just on the other point about what the Federal law  actually says here: We voted, I think, the other day, if I am not  wrong, on a CRA--or whatever those administrative things are around  here--because the Senator from Alabama was angry that the VA had  changed the exceptions for providing abortion from just the life of the  mother to situations where there is rape or incest. He was so angry at  that, he came out here to address that.   So don't think this isn't about that subject, that this isn't about a  woman's right to choose. That is exactly--that is why these guys are  out here. I am not saying the Senator from Utah. That is why this  objection has been made.   So I think the American people need to understand--I hope they  understand--who is standing up here on this floor tonight for a woman's  right to choose, for that fundamental constitutional and human right,  and who is opposing. And I know that there are significant  disagreements, as I said earlier, in our country about those two  issues.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I hope we will bring this to a close, but  I would first of all say that--stating the obvious--neither the Senator  from Utah nor I are a woman, and I am not going to suggest that I know  how people who are women in the military necessarily feel about this.   I suspect, far less often than the person whom the Senator from Utah  is concerned about, which is somebody who feels like they are somehow  discriminated against because they are going to carry a child to term  versus somebody who is going to face this really hard, hard, hard  choice, that a much more likely feeling and sense of harm will be the  complete loss of any sense of privacy that they are going to have as a  result of Dobbs and the effect of Dobbs and the effect of what these  people are arguing tonight on the floor of the Senate about: making it  harder to travel; about saying that, no, you can't have more time to  talk to your commanding officer about a decision that you have to make;  no, the entire unit is going to know what it is that you are going to  have to confront because, unlike every other medical procedure that we  are dealing with, when it is abortion, then everybody is going to know,  and your right to privacy has been eviscerated.   I guarantee you, for every single person who feels the way that the  Senator from Utah suggests that some people feel, like somehow they are  being discriminated against because they are  [[Page S1674]]  not in the position to have to deal with the most difficult decision  that anybody could make, that the number of people who are concerned  about what this has done to the right to privacy--and this not just in  the Department of Defense but in our country--is far greater, is far  greater.   And I would also just say that if States' rights were of such  paramount importance, that there wouldn't be people in this country  right now trying to make it illegal for States to allow people to use  chemicals to perform abortions, even though that is how a majority of  abortions in this country are performed.   And I don't agree with the Senator from Utah that we should have a  military where I can just decide, as an individual, that I am not going  to serve in a State because the laws of that State are ones that I  don't agree to or I don't subscribe to or I morally disagree with. That  is not how the military is supposed to work.   I would argue that is a lot more important than what the Constitution  has to say about weights and measures.   I suspect there is also a reason why no Senator in the history of  America, on any issue of profound importance, as this issue is, has  held hostage every single flag officer promotion of the Department of  Defense.   I suspect there is a reason why that has never happened before-- because we know the damage this is doing, and we know that sometimes,  once you put yourself into a cul-de-sac, it is really, really hard to  get out of it, especially when the majority of the American people  don't agree with you on the substance and don't agree with your tactic.  But that is where we are tonight.   I yield the floor.    I wrap just by saying this: I think that the choice that  has been made is a practical choice that has been made in the wake of a  fundamental freedom and a fundamental right being stripped from the  American people, and we are not going to solve that disagreement  tonight.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record  names of people and the positions of these ranking officers who are not  going to be promoted all around the world as a result of what the  Senator from Alabama has done. That is why we are here tonight.   With that, I yield the floor.    Let's do it.    Mr. President, I would ask my colleague, addressing the  Senator from Utah through the Chair, where in the rules there is  language that says the Department of Defense will pay for an abortion.  Where is it? Because it is not in the plain text, you know, and that is  the basis for this objection. That is the basis for the moral  objection, if there is one, and that is the basis for the offense that  the Senators have taken from the idea that the Department of Defense  would steal from the Senate the ability to make these judgments on  their own. I can't find anything in the plain text that says it. We  checked--my office has checked again, as we have every night that I  have been out here--and are assured that if a servicemember goes to  another State to seek abortion services, that abortion is not paid for  by the Department of Defense or by the Federal Government.   So I would ask again the Senator from Utah to show us--he can do it  off the floor--where the language is that is in these rules that  explicitly says that.    I appreciate the gloss that the Senator from Utah has put  on the plain language of this statute, which clearly does not allow--if  it did, he would have shown us that language.   I wish that Justice Alito and the other members of the Supreme Court  who applied the originalist view that determined that because it  doesn't say a woman's right to choose in the Constitution, there must  not be such a fundamental right--I wish they had used the sort of  statutory interpretation my colleague from Utah has chosen this  evening. Similarly, with the approach to federalism, you know, it all  depends on what the underlying issue happens to be.   With that, I yield the floor.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                            Military Nominations                               IN THE AIR FORCE         Exec.
