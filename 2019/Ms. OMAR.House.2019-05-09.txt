 Reading from Volume II, page 157: The ``investigation found  multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue  influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian- interference and obstruction investigations. The incidents were often  carried out through one-on-one meetings in which the President sought  to use his official power outside of usual channels. These actions  ranged from efforts to remove the special counsel and to reverse the  effect of the attorney general's recusal; to the attempted use of  official power to limit the scope of the investigation; to direct and  indirect contacts with witnesses with the potential to influence their  testimony. Viewing the acts collectively can help to illuminate their  significance.'' Volume II, page 157.
