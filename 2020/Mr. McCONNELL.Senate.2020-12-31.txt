 I move to proceed to Calendar No. 480, S. 3985.    Madam President, yesterday, the Senate was finally  able to proceed to this year's National Defense Authorization Act. A  few of our Democratic colleagues have pulled out all the stops to hold  back this crucial bill, but last night, a big bipartisan majority of 80  Senators voted to proceed.   There should be nothing controversial about giving our brave men and  women in uniform the tools and training they need to stay safe. There  should be nothing controversial about continuing the work of rebuilding  and modernizing our capabilities. It should be a nonpartisan  proposition that America should keep pace with Russia and China rather  than slip behind.   We have enacted an annual NDAA for 59 straight years and counting. In  the next few days, the easy way or the hard way, we are going to do our  job once again. This body will fulfill our responsibility to the men  and women who protect our country. The Senate will be here until we  finish this bipartisan legislation.   Now, for several days, we heard some Senators say Congress must send  more cash to high-earning households that haven't seen any income  disruption during COVID-19. Our colleagues who purport to be the  champions of vulnerable Americans now say that what struggling people  really need is for Congress to stop focusing on targeted relief for  them specifically and, instead, to send thousands of dollars to people  who don't need the help.   Experts from across the political spectrum agree that our colleague  from Vermont is dead wrong on this. Socialism for rich people is a  terrible way to help the American families who are actually struggling.  Let me say that again. Borrowing from our grandkids to do socialism for  rich people is a terrible way to get help for families who actually  need it.   Washington Democrats took President Trump's suggestion and skewed it  so the checks would benefit even more high-earning households.   Imagine a family of five where the parents earn $250,000 per year and  have not seen any income loss this past year. Speaker Pelosi and  Senator Sanders want to send them $5,000 from Uncle Sam. They make a  quarter of a million dollars, nobody is out of work, but our so-called  progressive friends say the household needs ``survival  [[Page S7986]]  checks.'' In fact, they believe a family of five should have to earn  $350,000 before the spigot of government money would stop entirely.   Socialism for rich people. That is what Speaker Pelosi and Senator  Sanders have sketched out. A terrible way to help those who need it,  and experts across the political spectrum agree.   The liberal editors of the Washington Post have blasted so-called  progressives demanding a nontargeted giveaway that would give ``huge  amounts'' to ``perfectly comfortable families.''   Larry Summers, who ran the Treasury Department for President Clinton  and the National Economic Council for President Obama, says there is  ``no good economic argument'' for more nontargeted checks with no  linkage to need.   The liberal New York Times reported this morning that a majority of  the households that get nontargeted checks do not end up spending them  on urgent needs but rather just add it to their savings. ``We know  where the pockets of need are,'' said one economist, and ``putting  [money] there would be a much more efficient use.''   Fortunately, though some of our colleagues seem to have forgotten,  that is exactly what we did only a week ago. It has been less than 5  days since President Trump signed into law another historic bipartisan  rescue package targeted to Americans who actually need the help.   We passed an entire second round of PPP loans to save small business  jobs, targeted to the hardest hit. We renewed multiple kinds of  additional benefits for unemployed workers, including an extra $300  supplement every week. There are billions for targeted food assistance,  billions for targeted rental assistance, and many billions of dollars  for vaccine distribution so we can finally beat this virus and reopen  the economy in full.   These are the kinds of targeted emergency programs that directly help  the most vulnerable, and we just poured almost another trillion dollars  into them, less than 5 days ago, along with more direct checks that are  already arriving in households' accounts. That is what we did just 5  days ago.   This crisis has not affected everyone equally. The data show that  many upper middle-class Americans have kept their jobs, worked  remotely, and remained totally financially comfortable. On the other  hand, some of our fellow citizens had their entire existence turned  upside down and continue to suffer terribly.   We do not need to let the Speaker of the House do socialism for rich  people in order to help those who need help. Our duty, both to  struggling Americans and to taxpayers, is to focus on targeted relief  that will have the maximum impact and help the people who need it the  most. That is what the experts say we should do. That is where there is  broad bipartisan support, and that is exactly what we did less than 1  week ago, when nearly $900 billion in more targeted relief was signed  into law for our people                            ____________________     Madam President, I object.
