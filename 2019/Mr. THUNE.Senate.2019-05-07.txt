 Mr. President, before I begin, I want to take a moment to  say how sorry I am that the Senate will be losing Senator Mike Enzi at  the end of next year.   During his 20-plus years in the Senate, Mike has been a leader on so  many issues, including healthcare and the budget. As the chairman of  the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, he oversaw major  pension reform. As the chairman of the Budget Committee, he was an  indispensable part of the effort to comprehensibly reform our Nation's  outdated Tax Code and put more money in the American people's pockets.  As always, he has been a powerful voice for small businesses during  that process, not to mention a powerful voice for the West throughout  his entire career.   The Senate will be a lesser place without Mike Enzi, but he has  earned some more time with his wife Diana, their three children, and  his four grandchildren.   I am grateful to have served with Mike and grateful that Senators  will  [[Page S2662]]  have a little time before his well-deserved retirement to continue to  draw on his wisdom and expertise over the course of the next year and a  half.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski).    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from Alaska (Ms. Murkowski).
