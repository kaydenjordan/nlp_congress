Healthcare    Mr. President, first, on the issue of healthcare, since I last  addressed this Chamber, the bipartisan agreement reached by Senators  Alexander and Murray has amassed enough cosponsors to guarantee its  passage. It now has 12 Republican cosponsors and 12 Democratic  cosponsors. That is as bipartisan as it gets. I believe all 48 Members  of my caucus will support the agreement, which means it has the  necessary 60 votes. Even Leader McConnell has made it clear that he  will put the Alexander-Murray bill on the floor as soon as President  Trump supports it.   Let me make a direct appeal to the President.   Mr. President, come out and support the Alexander-Murray bill. You  called it ``a very good solution'' already. Announce that you will  support it, and it will pass through the Senate soon after.   The President's only stated concern was that the Alexander-Murray  bill ``bails out insurance companies.'' I can assure the President that  Senators Alexander and Murray took great pains to make sure the  insurance companies would not get one extra penny from this deal. I  have read the language. I have worked with them. It is good. It is  strong. They have included provisions in the bill to prevent insurance  companies from double dipping on the cost-sharing program and ensure  that the money goes precisely where it is intended: to keep premiums  and other out-of-pocket costs down for low-income Americans.   If the President wants even greater assurances, we can work to move  back the start of enrollment 1 month. He may be able to do that  administratively, but if not, that is something both Senator Alexander  and Senator Murray wanted to do, which would ensure that there would be  new applications, and the rates would be looked at as if cost sharing  were happening, but the White House blocked it. If the White House and  the President want to make it even stronger--I think it is strong  enough already--then we can do that. From what I understand, the  President might be able to do that administratively.   This idea that the President isn't supporting this because he doesn't  want the insurance companies to make money on this--well, it is wrong.  There is some other reason he doesn't want it done. Maybe he doesn't  want a bipartisan bill. Maybe it is because he wasn't involved. Maybe  it is because on issue after issue the hard-right Freedom Caucus people  say don't do it, and he is afraid, because he is not showing much  leadership when they stand up to him.   The only reason the President shouldn't support this bill is that he  wants to continue intentionally hurting Americans. He has talked about  that. He almost seems gleeful: ObamaCare will fail--even though he is  trying to make it fail.  [[Page S6706]]    The President should know that premiums have shot up 30 percent in  Pennsylvania because of the President's decision to end cost sharing.  Premiums for silver plans will rise 20 to 25 percent if cost sharing is  not restored. It is time for the President to stop the sabotage. He  created the problem by for the first time not renewing cost-sharing  payments. Now we have a solution that will renew them, but Democrats  will have to give. Copper plans have never been our favorite. He should  go along with the good compromise.   The President has told me repeatedly that he wants to work in a  bipartisan way. He told me that he wants to work in a bipartisan way on  healthcare. Well, on this one, I am from Missouri. Shows us. Show me.   It is time, Mr. President, to turn the page on healthcare and pass  the Alexander-Murray bill. We have other pressing healthcare issues to  grapple with. For the first time in history, again due to lack of  leadership from that White House, the authorization for the Children's  Health Insurance Program has expired. That must be reauthorized, too,  and soon. Kids across America are depending on it.   President Trump, please stop the games. Stop the zigging and zagging.  You are for it one day and against it the next. Stop coming up with  fake excuses. Declare your support for this bill so we can move forward  in a bipartisan way to improve our Nation's healthcare.                          The Budget and Tax Reform    Now, Mr. President, on taxes, last week the Republican majority  jammed through one of the worst budgets in history. That is not  hyperbole; this is one of the worst budgets in history. They should  hang their heads in shame. It increases the deficit by $1.5 trillion,  slashes Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion, and sets up the same  partisan process the Republicans used for healthcare.   Now it goes to the House for their approval, where many conservative  House Republicans will have to rationalize voting for a bill that  dramatically increases deficits. For many in the conservative wing of  the House Republican caucus, the debt and deficit have been their No. 1  focus in Congress, their raison d'etre. Many campaigned on the singular  promise--made with almost religious fervor--to lower our Nation's debt  and deficit. They rhapsodize fiscal responsibility. They hold  themselves up as the guardian of preventing the debt from being passed  on to our grandchildren. They evangelize constitutional amendments  requiring a balanced budget. They were willing to risk default on our  Nation's credit for a spurious talking point.   The budget resolution will be a true test of the principles the  Freedom Caucus and the hard right in the House have espoused about the  evils of deficits for the better part of the last decade, because those  same Members of the Freedom Caucus must now vote to approve a budget  that increases the deficit by $1.5 trillion. The House bill didn't do  that. The Senate bill clearly does. Yet, so far, we haven't heard a  peep from the Freedom Caucus. The most scolding deficit hawks have  morphed into deficit doves, eschewing principle for political  expediency.   With respect to the deficit, any economist will tell you that a  dollar less in revenue due to a tax cut is the same as a dollar less in  spending. Yet the Freedom Caucus and deficit hawks only harp on the  deficit when it is about spending cuts: Get rid of Medicare. Get rid of  Medicaid. Slash them--programs every bit as popular and as important as  any.   As Representative Walker, a conservative of the House, lamented,  ``[The deficit] is a great talking point when you have an  administration that's Democratic-led. It's a little different now that  Republicans have both houses and the administration.'' Really? So you  are a deficit hawk only when it is politically expedient,  Representative Walker?   Well, the Freedom Caucus still has a chance to change the course of  their budget when we vote this week. When the Freedom Caucus came out  against the Republican healthcare bill, the Republican majority was  forced to make concessions to them. If they were real deficit hawks,  honest deficit hawks, consistent deficit hawks, nonpolitical deficit  hawks, they would do the same thing here.   Let's see how Representative Walker and his fellow Members of the  House Freedom Caucus vote on a GOP budget to increase the deficit by  $1.5 trillion.   Another point on the GOP tax plan. The Republicans are so wedded to  their desire to give a massive tax break to big corporations and the  superrich--which will blow up the deficit even in their fake math  models--that they are searching for new ways to sock it to the middle  class to make up the difference.   First, Republicans debated eliminating the mortgage deduction, then  they included the provision to eliminate State and local deductibility,  and recently there have been reports that some Republicans want to cap  Americans' pretax contributions to their 401(k)s. That is one of the  few provisions we have to encourage middle-class families to start  saving for an early retirement. President Trump tweeted this morning  that we are not going down that road. The fact that Republicans were  even considering raiding American's retirement savings to pay for giant  tax cuts for corporations shows just how backward their plan is.   The Tax Policy Center estimated that while the wealthiest 1 percent  of America would reap 80 percent of the benefits under the GOP plan, it  would also raise taxes on nearly a third of middle-class workers. That  statistic reveals the rotten core at the center of this tax plan: The  Republicans are so eager to give tax cuts to the rich, they are willing  to explore many different ways of raising taxes on the middle class to  pay for them. Each time, they bring up different methods--mortgage  interest deductions, State and local deductibility, capping pretax  401(k)s--and then back off when they see the political and popular cost  to each proposal. That shows you the dilemma they are in.   The fact is, there is no way the Republicans can avoid raising taxes  on a good number of middle-class families if they are going to cling to  such massive tax cuts for the rich and powerful and still make the  numbers work, even with fake math.   Instead of capping middle-class deductions or pilfering retirement  savings, how about Republicans drop their proposal to repeal the estate  tax? Repealing the estate tax would cost the government hundreds of  billions. Why are Republicans looking at middle-class deductions  instead of merely scrapping the estate tax repeal, which goes only to  estates of over $5 million--only to estates over $5 million. The number  who benefit is tiny. It is in the thousands. Their estates get huge,  huge benefits. Get rid of that instead of hurting the middle class. The  logic is confounding, and our Republican colleagues will not even talk  about it.   This plan is so rotten at its core that it has our Republican  colleagues turning themselves into pretzels and jumping through hoops,  and they can't really say what they believe--trickle down works. The  only rationale for this entire plan is that if you give tax breaks to  the wealthy and the big corporations, there will be a lot of job  growth. It didn't happen when George Bush's tax cuts occurred. It  didn't happen when Kansas dramatically cut its taxes. The Koch  brothers' center, Kansas--they did just what the Koch brothers wanted.  It was a disaster. Growth was much less than the national average even  though the taxes were slashed. Although they don't state it, it is  contrary to what our Republican colleagues believe.   I respect the Republican Member who comes up and says: Trickle down  works; that is why we are doing it. Tax cuts for the very wealthy is  what would fuel the economy.   No one else believes it anymore. History disproves it. It is fake. It  is a fig leaf so that they don't have to admit what they want to do-- give huge tax cuts to the wealthiest of their contributors, the people  who have sort of set up the sinew of this Republican Party with their  think tanks and op-eds and so many other things, the Koch brothers  network.   The American people should know that the money to pay for that giant  tax cut for the rich is coming from somewhere, and it is likely to be  coming from their pocketbooks.  [[Page S6707]]                       Steel and Aluminum Imports Investigations    Finally, one final topic: steel and aluminum. Recently and  shockingly, Commerce Secretary Ross has said he is waiting for the  Republican tax plan before completing critical investigations into how  steel and aluminum imports are impacting the capacity of steel and  aluminum U.S. producers to supply our defense needs. I am not sure why  the Republican tax plan has anything to do with this national security  investigation, which could finally lead to some relief from the  predatory trade practices from China and other countries. The two are  entirely unrelated.   Secretary Ross's comments smell like an excuse for further delays-- and a bad one at that. I would like to see him explain his decision to  the thousands of steelworkers whose jobs are on the line because their  companies aren't competing on a level playing field because China  repeatedly subsidizes, doesn't play by the rules, and cheats.   It is another classic example of the Trump administration promising  one thing and doing another. President Trump has promised many times to  crack down on China, and still, 10 months into his administration, his  Commerce Secretary is once again needlessly delaying a preliminary step  in that effort.   I have known him for 30 years. He is a New Yorker like I am. Every  time I see Secretary Ross, I say to him: When are we going to do  something on China?   Oh, we are going to do something tough.   Each time, there is a different excuse. This should have happened in  the first 2 months of the administration. It hasn't.   Because of the Republican inaction, because of the President's  unfulfilled and rapidly becoming broken promise on being tough with  China, Senate Democrats will be sending a letter to President Trump and  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross demanding that the administration keep  its promise to crack down on China's unfair and predatory trade  practices. We are asking that they continue these investigations and  expeditiously complete them. These trade investigations have nothing to  do with tax reform, and there is no need to delay them.   One more thing on China. Today I read that Tesla--our great car  manufacturing company--will be relocating to China.   When you want to sell cars and many other advanced products in China,  you have to do one of two things: set up a joint ownership company  which lets them steal our intellectual property or face huge tariffs.  That is based on the fact that the WTO was poorly negotiated and China  was regarded as a developing country. That was the fault of President  Bush and President Obama; neither did enough to stop China.   Based on his campaign rhetoric, one would think President Trump would  be tougher as China steals our family jewels. It is no longer clothing  and furniture; it is our best industries. They steal our intellectual  property by these joint ventures. Sometimes they do it by cyber theft-- a lot of times they do it by cyber theft--and it is hurting the good- paying jobs that might be available to our children and grandchildren.  Based on campaign rhetoric, one would think President Trump would be  tougher on China, but so far it has been a lot of talk and not very  much action, and the delay in these investigations is another example.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Ernst). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________
