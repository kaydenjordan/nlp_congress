 Mr. Speaker, 9 years ago, Continental Flight  3407 crashed in western New York, killing all aboard and one on the  ground.   The National Transportation Safety Board found that the cause of the  crash was pilot error and poor training.   Prior to the enactment of flight safety laws, there were two levels  of safety: one more stringent for the commercial carriers that we are  all familiar with, and one considerably less stringent for the ones  that we are less aware of. There were two levels of safety.   Now there is only one because of the courageous work of the families  of the survivors who came to Congress and helped Congress enact very  strict safety regulations. We have not had a commercial crash that  ended up in fatalities since that time.   It is important that we not roll back these safety standards, as they  are based on the National Transportation Safety Board's findings and  the work of this Congress.                            ____________________
