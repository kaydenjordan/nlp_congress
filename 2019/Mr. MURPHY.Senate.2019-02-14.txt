 I thank the Presiding Officer.   Mr. President, from time to time, I come to the floor of the Senate  to share with my colleagues stories of the victims of gun violence. I  had hoped the statistics that consistently show this country has a gun  violence rate that is 10 to 20 times higher than those of other similar  high-income nations--data that shows this continuing epidemic of mass  slaughter during which we average a mass shooting almost every day-- would have compelled my colleagues to action. It hasn't. So I have  tried to come down to the floor as often as I can to explain who these  people are and to explain the genius that has been lost from this world  when lives are cut so short by gun violence--gun violence that is  largely preventable in this country.   I come to the floor with an unusually heavy heart because I want to  talk about some of the lives that were lost a year ago today at the  shooting in Parkland, FL, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It  was a year ago that I was actually walking to the floor to give a  speech on immigration when I learned of another mass shooting. It hits  hard for those of us who represent Connecticut because we are still  working through the ripples of grief that never ever disappear in a  community that has been shattered by an episode of catastrophic gun  violence--in our case, in Sandy Hook, CT.   In February of last year, 17 students and teachers were gunned down  in their classrooms at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. One of  them was Peter Wang.   Peter was 15 years old. He was a U.S. Army Junior Reserve Officers'  Training Corps cadet. He was getting ready to celebrate the Chinese New  Year with his family. His two younger siblings and many other friends  called him a natural leader.   When the shooter entered the high school, Peter had a choice to make:  He could run and protect himself or he could try to help his fellow  students in need. He chose the latter. He chose to hold a door open to  help his classmates escape. He saved other people's lives while he lost  his own.   Classmate Jared Burns said: ``For as long as we remember him, he is a  hero.''  [[Page S1355]]    ``He yanked open a door that allowed dozens of classmates, teachers  and staffers to escape,'' officials said.   His middle school basketball coach said that he was just a ``joyful  person.'' His sacrifice, according to his coach, ``just made perfect  sense'' because he was that selfless.   Peter was posthumously accepted to the U.S. Military Academy at West  Point for his heroic actions on that day.   Alex Schachter was a freshman who played the trombone and baritone in  the marching band, and he loved to play basketball. He loved music so  much that in middle school, he took two band classes so that he could  get ready to join the marching band in high school, which was his  dream. His Eagle Regiment Marching Band actually won the State  championship in Tampa.   His dad said that he was just a sweetheart of a kid. He said that he  just wanted to do well to make his parents' happy.   His dream was to attend the University of Connecticut. He told  everybody. He was only a freshman, but he knew where he was going to  college. He wanted to go to my State, to Connecticut. He wore a UConn  sweatshirt almost every single day to school. His favorite song was an  old one by Chicago, ``25 or 6 to 4,'' which is kind of an odd choice  for a 14-year-old. Yet UConn's band actually chose to play that song at  halftime at one of UConn's football games, and UConn admitted Alex  posthumously because his dream was to be a UConn Husky.   Helena Ramsay was full of laughter and had this infectious smile. She  was 17 when she was shot that day. She loved all kinds of music,  although she was mostly into K-pop. She had all sorts of other  interests too. She was interested in human rights and the environment.  She joined the school's United Nations Club and the Christian faith- based First Priority Group. She was always looking out for her friends.   One of her friends said: ``When I was stressed out from my chemistry  lab that I thought I was going to fail, she calmed me down and told me  that it was going to be OK.''   One of her best friends said that she was ``one of the kindest people  I've ever met.''   When the gunman walked into her classroom, she turned to her friend  to make sure that her friend was safe and told her to shield herself  with books. People described it as a ``moment of bravery in the face of  horror.''   Another hero that day was Aaron Feis. He was an assistant football  coach, and he was a security guard. He threw himself in front of his  kids. That is how he died that day.   The football program's spokesperson said:         [Aaron] died the same way he lived--he put himself second.       . . . He was a very kind soul, a very nice man. He died a       hero.    One of his football players who had been going through leukemia  treatments remembered that Aaron had guided him through those  treatments.         He would send me prayers. He would send me Bible scripts       and just stuff to cheer up my day.    Aaron died while protecting the kids at that school.   These 4 stories are amongst those of the 17 people who died at  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Yet 93 people die every day from  gun violence. Most of those are suicides. A bunch of them are  homicides. Others are accidental shootings, but they are all  preventable.   As we remember today the mass shooting at Parkland, it is important  that even on those days on which nobody puts up on cable news a mass  shooting, there are still somewhere around 90 people who die every day,  and I will tell you about one of them.   Corey Dodd was 25 years old when he died last month in Baltimore, MD.  That morning, he told Marissa, his wife, to stay home and rest with  their 3-year-old and their 3-week-old while he took the 5-year-old  twins to school. After he dropped the twins off at school and pulled up  outside their home, he was shot to death. The 3-year-old was inside.  Marissa had to tell her kids that Daddy wasn't coming home.   She said:         I've told the kids that Daddy is done. He's not coming       back.    Their family was planning to move because Corey was looking for work,  and they were going to move to wherever he found work. He had recently  finished a program to earn his commercial driver's license. Things were  looking up for Corey and Marissa and their four kids.   I didn't know Corey, but I know something about his death because I  happened to be in Baltimore on that day. I happened to be at Corey's  kids' school at the moment he was shot. I was inside that school when  an announcement came over the loud speaker that there was a code green.  I didn't know what a code green meant. A few minutes later, I found out  that it is what happens inside schools in Baltimore when there is a  shooting in the neighborhood. They locked down the school and our  classroom and pulled down the shades, and we turned off the lights. A  few minutes later, the police notified us that the scene was clear,  that the school was safe, and that the day could go on. Yet,  unbeknownst to me, just down the hall from me inside that school were  two twins whose father had been shot blocks away from that school.  Their lives will never be the same.   Part of the reason we care so much about this epidemic is that it is  not just the victims; it is also about the people who are left behind.  Imagine going to an elementary school in which you fear for your life  when you walk to and from school and where parents of your friends are  shot at 10:30 in the morning. It changes their brains, the trauma these  kids go through in a school like that. It makes their little, tiny,  developing brains unable to learn. There is a biological process that  actually happens to these kids. That trauma is what Parkland has been  going through for the last year, and that trauma is what kids in  Baltimore, New Haven, Hartford, Chicago, and New Orleans go through  every single day. We are ruining millions of children all across this  country because of an epidemic that we could choose to solve, that we  could choose to do something about.   This week, the House of Representatives had a hearing and a meeting  to move forward with a universal background checks bill that is  supported by 97 percent of Americans. It will pass the House of  Representatives, with Republican and Democratic support, with flying  colors. Do you know what that tells us? It tells us that the most  important thing we could do to save lives, to cut down on the 93 people  who are killed every day, is to pass that universal background checks  bill. In States that have universal background checks, there is about  30 percent less gun crime and fewer gun homicides than in States that  don't have those universal background checks.   As we remember 1 year since the massacre at Parkland and as we strive  to understand that this is an epidemic that takes 90 people every day,  know that it is within our power to do something about it. We can't  eliminate every single gun death. We can't stop every suicide or every  homicide, but with commonsense legislation that is supported by 97  percent of Americans, we can make a big difference, and we can send a  signal to would-be shooters who are contemplating violence that they  should not interpret our silence as a quiet endorsement. It is up to  us.   I yield the floor.
