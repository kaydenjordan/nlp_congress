 Mr. President, I have the opportunity to chair the U.S.  Helsinki Commission.   I am taking this time--I understand there is a break in the action in  regards to the underlying bill. If I am wrong on that, I will yield the  floor to someone in regards to moving us forward, but I understand that  we are not ready for the next issue yet.   So with that in mind, let me just take this time as the Chair of the  U.S. Helsinki Commission representing the U.S. Senate. In the Helsinki  Commission, my Republican counterpart is Senator Wicker. Senator  Wicker, by the way, is the vice president of the Organization for  Security and Cooperation in Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, and I am  the Special Representative on Anti-Semitism, Racism, and Intolerance.   The Helsinki Final Act speaks very clearly against all forms of  intolerance and discrimination. And we have seen in recent months  current events trigger latent bias in our community.   We go back to 9/11, where we saw the uprise of hate against the  Muslim community, which was translated into violence against Muslim  Americans.   We saw during COVID-19 latent bias against the Asian-American  community. As a result, we saw a rise of hate, of anti-Asian activity,  bias, and violence, and this body took action.   And, once again, as a result of recent violence in the Middle East,  we see a rise of anti-Semitism here in the United States and around the  world.   I mention all of that because we need to speak out whenever we see  the rise of intolerance in our community. So let me just talk about  anti-Semitism and what has happened recently.  [[Page S3840]]    A 29-year-old Jewish man was punched, kicked, and pepper-sprayed last  week in New York in broad daylight, as a group of men yelled anti- Semitic statements. People in cars began throwing bottles and yelling  anti-Semitic slurs, including words like ``dirty Jew,'' at a dinner  party in Los Angeles. In Skokie, IL, someone shattered a window at a  synagogue. In Bal Harbour, FL, men yelled, ``Die Jew,'' at a man in a  skull cap, and then threatened to rape his wife and daughter.   These instances are compounded by an uptick in anti-Semitic speech  online, with the Anti-Defamation League finding 17,000 tweets between  May 7 and May 14--1 week--with some variation of the phrase: ``Hitler  was right.''   These attacks follow the January 6 Capitol insurrection earlier this  year, where White Supremacist and extremist groups displayed anti- Semitic and racist symbols and recited conspiracy theories blaming Jews  for the pandemic. These conspiracy theories have proliferated alongside  anti-Semitic stereotypes and images being mainstreamed by some  political leaders and public figures.   While these events are shocking, perhaps we should not be surprised.  The ADL Global Index on Anti-Semitism, updated in 2019, found that more  than 1 billion people--nearly 1 in 8--around the world harbor anti- Semitic attitudes.   Over 30 percent of those surveyed said it was ``probably true'' that  Jews have too much control over financial markets; that Jews think they  are better than other people; that Jews are disloyal to their country;  and that people hate Jews because of the way Jews behave. A full 41  percent think Jews are more loyal to Israel than the country they live  in.   Such sentiments too often translate into violence, leaving 40 percent  of European Jews to report in 2018 that they live in daily fear of  being physically attacked. Here at home, Jews make up fewer than 3  percent of the American population, but the majority of reported  religious-based hate crimes targeted Jewish people and institutions.   I strongly agree with ADL's CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, who said last  week:         [W]e are witnessing a dangerous and drastic surge in anti-      Jewish hate. . . . To those who choose to indulge in age-old       antisemitic tropes, exaggerated claims and inflammatory       rhetoric, it has consequences: attacks in real life on real       people targeted for no other reason than they are Jewish.       This is antisemitism, plain and simple. And it's indisputably       inexcusable in any context.    In 2004, I had the opportunity to represent America at the Berlin  Conference on Anti-Semitism, where we developed an action plan to stand  up against anti-Semitism. The very first recommendation coming out of  the Berlin conference is that leaders must speak out against anti- Semitism in any form; that leaders need to be heard. They cannot be  silent. So I was very pleased when our President, Joe Biden, stated  this past week:         The recent attacks on the Jewish community are despicable,       and they must stop. I condemn this hateful behavior at home       and abroad--it's up to all of us to give hate no safe harbor.    Thank you, President Biden.   I was proud of our colleague Senator Mazie Hirono, a leader in the  Asian-American community, who posted on social media:         I've said it before and I'll say it again--an attack on one       of us is an attack on all of us. We all must condemn the       recent surge of antisemitic attacks in our country. Each of       us needs to stand up, speak out, and confront this hatred.    At my last in-person OSCE meeting before COVID-19, I hosted an event  with my European colleagues entitled ``Lessons From the Past,  Leadership for the Future,'' where we spoke about the lessons from the  Holocaust, including early warning signs from the past--some of which  have been rising to the surface again. These early warning signs  include the rise of populist leaders, demonizing of minorities,  propagandizing of hate, and the neglect of refugee protections, which  ultimately became the factors that resulted in genocide.   This month, I chaired a Helsinki Commission hearing on preventing  mass atrocities with Professor Timothy Snyder and the U.S. Holocaust  Memorial Museum's Center for the Prevention of Genocide director, Naomi  Kikoler. This Center's Early Warning Project provides an innovative  risk assessment tool using quantitative and qualitative methods to  spotlight countries where mass atrocities have not begun, but where the  risk of such violence is high.   The warning signs are there. My colleagues, we are painfully reminded  of our past. The OSCE has repeatedly reaffirmed that hate crimes pose a  threat to the security of individuals and society, given their  potential to lead to conflict and violence on a wider scale. The spread  of hateful ideology and recent acts of hate crimes and extremism across  the OSCE region attest to this.   In response, I have called for a plan of action to address violence  and discrimination across the OSCE region, including here in the United  States, so that we may have a more strategic and cross-border approach  to addressing hate. I have also supported the OSCE initiatives that  address security concerns of Jewish communities, including by improving  relationships between law enforcement and justice institutions and  vulnerable communities, educating communities on anti-Semitism and how  to counter it, and building alliances with other communities to counter  hate.   Over the past decade, I have also worked to ensure that the State  Department's budget annually includes funding to fight anti-Semitism  globally by creating civil society partnerships between the United  States and Europe to work as allies to fight against anti-Semitism,  racism, xenophobia, anti-Muslim bigotry, hostility to the LGBTQ-plus  community, and other forms of hate. The United States should be a  global leader in fighting such intolerance.   It would be hypocritical for us as a nation to preach to the world  against hate if we let it fester and grow here at home. Like a virus,  as we all know too well, if hate exists in one country, it has the  capacity to spread around the world.   Therefore, I ask all my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting  these efforts at home and abroad to achieve safe and just societies for  all. Hate takes many forms, but none of them should be acceptable here  in the United States of America or anywhere else in the world.   With that, I yield the floor   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
