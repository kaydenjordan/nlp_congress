 Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from California for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, Americans famously complain about taxes. Who can then  blame residents of the District of Columbia, where 40 percent claim the  SALT deduction, among the largest number of taxpayers in the country?  By allowing at least a $10,000 deduction, the 2017 Republican tax law  concedes that it imposes double taxation.   The Republican tax law was particularly nefarious because it  virtually targeted blue states, whose top taxes support values like  funding for local public education. We cannot, of course, protect  Americans from taxes, but ever since the passage of the Federal income  tax law in 1913, we have protected them from being taxed on dollars  already taxed by State and local governments. The Restoring Tax  Fairness for States and Localities Act ensures that wisdom.
