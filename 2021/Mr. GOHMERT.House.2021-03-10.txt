 Mr. Speaker, we have been told that 90 percent of  Americans support this bill. Well, that is because 99.99 percent of  Americans have not read this bill.   And we are told, yet again, that this will save lives. And, yet,  there is not one single mass killing that has been brought up here  today that would have been prevented by this bill.   And yet over and over we have people come in here, usually they mean  well; look, this will protect people when the fact is that they can't  point to any of these mass killings they talk about that would have  been prevented.   So let's talk about lives that would be saved. Think about the people  that are shot every day and would their situation be different if they  were not finding it so difficult to legally get a gun?   I mean, we had thousands of felony cases that came through my court,  and we tried a lot of those cases. Over and over you hear, the  criminals are not obeying the law. They are not going to follow the  law. They got their guns illegally. And this will not change at all any  of those people we tried and convicted for getting guns. They steal  them. They buy them from other people that stole them. They don't obey  the law. That is why they are criminals. So quit penalizing the  American people.
