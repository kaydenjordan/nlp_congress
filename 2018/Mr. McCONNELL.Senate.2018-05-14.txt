 Mr. President, I had an opportunity yesterday to visit  our friend John McCain. It was in a beautiful location, Sedona. It is  about a 2-hour drive from Phoenix.   John and Cindy and I had a chance to sit on the back porch and  reminisce about our friendship and all we had shared over the last 30  years. We had some laughs. We mainly reminisced about the battles.  Sometimes we were on the same side, and sometimes we were not. Yet one  thing about our colleague John McCain is you would rather be on his  side than not. For 10 years, we had a very vigorous debate about an  issue he and I both cared about, and we were on opposite sides. It  ended up going all the way to the Supreme Court. He won and I lost, and  we worked hard to establish a new relationship after that vigorous  battle of a decade.   We all know his story all too well--that of a genuine American hero.  We admire the tenacity and the grit it took to survive those 5\1/2\  years in the Hanoi Hilton and the way he refused to go home early, as  he certainly could have, given the prominence of his father's position  in the Navy. It is pretty hard to think of any serious issues that face  our Nation without recalling the role John played in so many things  that are important to our country.   Over the last few years, I am sure the Presiding Officer would agree  with me that we saw him as the shadow Secretary of State during the  Obama years as he traveled the world--sometimes on a long weekend--to  some of the least desirable places to visit. I avoided those trips, but  for those who took them, it was a little bit like the Bataan Death  March. Junkets they were not. He was an important foreign policy and  defense voice for our country. He was also passionate in working to  take better care of our veterans. No one, with the possible exception  of Senator Isakson, spent more time working on veterans' issues and  trying to take care of them, as they richly deserve, than John McCain.   At this point in his life, he, obviously, has a little time to sit  and rest and reflect under the desert sky and to simply take in the  beautiful, peaceful Nation he has worked so hard and so long to protect  and pass on to all of our children.   One thing we all know about John--and it remains the case today--is  that he doesn't have a relaxed bone in his body. He still has plenty to  say about work, I assure you. He misses his colleagues, and he would  rather be here. I told him we miss him, too--all the great jokes, the  smart-alecky comments. He was a joy to be around.   I didn't want to miss the opportunity to tell him how much his  friendship has meant to me, so that is why I was out there this  weekend. While I was there, I said I was confident I was speaking for  everybody in the Senate in conveying our deepest respect to him for all  he has done for this country during a truly extraordinary life.    Yes.    I thank my friend from Maine.      70th Anniversary of Israel's Independence and the Opening of the                       American Embassy in Jerusalem    Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, today marks 70 years  since Israel declared its independence on May 14, 1948. Ever since,  this brave nation has shown as a beacon of democracy in a troubled  region and has stood as a valued friend of the United States.   It is fitting that another historic event took place just today. This  morning, an American delegation, including top administration officials  and several of our own colleagues, were on hand in Jerusalem, Israel's  capital, to officially open the new American Embassy in that city.   I am proud the administration sent this clear signal on behalf of all  Americans. We recognize the fact that Jerusalem is Israel's capital,  plain and simple. That is where our Embassy belongs. Now, thanks to the  President's decision, that is where it will be.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of the following nomination: Executive  Calendar No. 715.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the  nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; that no  further motions be in order; and that any statements relating to the  nomination be printed in the Record.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  May 15; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour  be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and morning business be closed. I further ask that following leader  remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Carson nomination under the previous order.  Finally, I ask that the Senate recess following disposition of the  Nalbandian nomination until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly  conference meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:45 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, May 15, 2018, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
