 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and submit extraneous materials on the bill, H.R. 79, to clarify the  definition of general solicitation under Federal securities laws, and  for other purposes.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hultgren). Is there objection to the  request of the gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 33 and rule  XVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House  on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 79.   The Chair appoints the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost) to preside  over the Committee of the Whole.                                time  1408                        In the Committee of the Whole    Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the  Whole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill  (H.R. 79) to clarify the definition of general solicitation under  Federal securities law, with Mr. Bost in the chair.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Clay) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 79, the Helping Angels  Lead Our Startups Act, also known as the HALOS Act.   I remind all Members that the House passed this bill just a few  months ago with overwhelming support from both Republicans and  Democrats by a vote of 325-89, Mr. Chairman, almost 4 to 1. It is hard  to get more bipartisan than that.   It has received overwhelming bipartisan support because then and now  the HALOS Act will help create needed jobs and grow our economy. I  think we all know, Mr. Chairman, from listening to our constituents,  jobs in the economy continue to be the number one issue of concern of  the American people.   I commend the bipartisan sponsors of this bill, Mr. Chabot, the  chairman of the Small Business Committee, who we will hear from soon,  and Ms. Sinema, who serves with me on the Financial Services Committee.  I also thank the six Republicans and four Democrats who joined them as  original cosponsors.   These Members reached across the aisle and produced legislation that  is especially important to America's small businesses. Let's remember,  Mr. Chairman, that half--half--the people who work in this country earn  or work at small businesses, which historically create two-thirds of  all the new jobs in America. So small business--small business--is the  job engine of America.   Our economy clearly works better for working Americans when small  businesses thrive and they can focus on creating jobs rather than  navigating bureaucratic red tape, red tape that disproportionately  hurts the small businesses and startup companies that we are counting  on to create jobs for our constituents.   Burdensome regulations make it harder for entrepreneurs to access  startup capital, and they place credit out of reach for many who wish  to start up a small business. Many of these harmful regulations arise  from complicated laws, like the Dodd-Frank Act. Overall, small business  loans are at a 25-year low, in large part due to regulatory burdens on  our community banks and credit unions.   Even the former Director of the Small Business Administration,  appointed by President Obama, admitted as much when she said: ``Small  banks have been laden with excessive costs and confusion from  overlapping regulations, which are getting in the way of their ability  to make small business loans.''   We simply must not allow our security laws to inhibit the free flow  of investment capital to Main Street. The HALOS Act provides an  important regulatory solution to make it easier for small businesses to  attract investments and put both the ``open for business'' and ``we are  hiring'' signs on their front doors.   The bill provides a clear path for startups to connect with angel  investors and allows investors to make their own informed decisions.  Angel investors, Mr. Chairman, have a huge impact on economic growth.  Famous companies like Amazon, Costco, Google, Facebook, and Starbucks  were all first funded by angel investors. That is just how important  this matter is. Today, approximately 600,000 employees earn their  paychecks from working for these specific companies.   Unfortunately, when Washington bureaucrats get involved, we often see  the dreaded ``unintended consequences'' of red tape. Five years ago,  Congress passed the bipartisan JOBS Act to make it easier for business  startups to gain access to critical capital. But the Securities and  Exchange Commission instead issued regulations on angel investors that  have the complete opposite effect. This is a problem Congress can  easily fix by passing a bipartisan HALOS Act, which will ensure that  funding from angel investors remains available to small business  startups.   Mr. Chairman, you cannot have employees, unless you first have  employers. You cannot have jobs without job creators. And that is what  this bill is all about--jobs. It is about helping small businesses  overcome misguided Washington red tape so they can create jobs.   I urge all Members to support this commonsense bipartisan bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say  that hearings have been held in a markup in the last Congress on this  bill and the 10 new Republican Members are anxious to vote on this. I  am unaware of any new Democrat Members having been appointed to our  committee as of yet.   I am now very happy to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Chabot), coauthor of the HALOS Act, a champion for small business  because he is, indeed, the distinguished chairman of the Small Business  Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the distinguished chairman of the Capital  Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee of the  Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman.
