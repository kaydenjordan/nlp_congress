 Madam Speaker, every single constitution in the whole  world written since 1959, including Afghanistan, for example, has the  equivalent of the equal rights amendment, but the United States of  America does not.   Though my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and President  Trump's Department of Justice may tell you otherwise, we need the equal  rights amendment, and we need it now.   The requisite number of States have now voted to ratify the equal  rights amendment. Last year my home State of Illinois was the 37th  State to ratify, and this year Virginia brought us to that number of  38.   Today I will proudly vote ``yes'' to show my grandchildren--my  granddaughters and my grandsons--that women are not only strong,  powerful, and resilient, but also equal citizens under the law.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand with us.
