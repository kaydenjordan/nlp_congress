 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dan Carson from  Norwich, New York, who started an adaptive baseball program for  individuals with physical and intellectual challenges.   Seven years ago, Dan Carson started the Baseball Buddies game at the  Norwich Little League field behind the middle school, and now it has  grown into a huge community event.   The program recently hosted its annual game, where about 25 past or  present players from the Norwich Purple Tornados were paired with  special needs students. For these kids, the game is about more than  baseball. The players and buddies form lifelong friendships and learn  valuable lessons from each other.   Most students with special needs do not have the opportunity to  participate in team sports in high school, but this game is an  exception.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in thanking Dan for all his work that he  has done to create a place where, regardless of ability, children can  participate in the great American pastime. I know I speak for everyone  when I say, ``Play ball.''                            ____________________
