 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to  complete my remarks.    Madam President, I rise today to speak on a topic of  global importance and mounting urgency, and that is Russia's continued  aggression toward Ukraine.   After months of shifting tens of thousands of troops and military  equipment, some from its easternmost military district, Russia has  built up a military presence around the northern, eastern, and southern  flanks of Ukraine. Russia has also amassed forces in Belarus under the  guise of joint military exercises.   Unfortunately, there are no indications that the situation with  Ukraine and Russia has taken any steps toward deescalation. If  anything, Ukraine and our European partners are beginning to accept the  U.S. assessment that Russia's buildup is continuing on a trend to  permit a well-resourced and supported attack in mid- to late February.   As the cost of his deployment adds up and the so-called exercises in  Belarus come to an end on February 20, Vladimir Putin will reach a  decision point. I say this not to provoke alarm but to emphasize that  the United States and our security partners must do what we can while  we can. It is critical to demonstrate that there will be a unified  response from the West, including when it comes to sanctions and  providing military equipment to Ukraine, so that we send the message to  Putin that an attack would be a severe miscalculation on his part.   Is an attack from Russia truly imminent?   Well, so far, Putin's demands are nonstarters. Russia demanded that  NATO deny Ukraine or any other free nation in Eastern Europe the  ability to join this defensive alliance. Russia also demanded that NATO  revert to its 1997 posture and capabilities.   These aren't serious demands, and the administration rightly rejected  both. Unfortunately, at this point, Putin would likely find it  humiliating to back down from such a costly military buildup without  getting any concessions from the West. Many fear that he has backed  himself into a corner where he may feel like his best option is to  attack, as disastrous as that would be.   Now, the Ukrainians will say: How can Russia start a war with  Ukraine? We have been at war for 8 years.   That is a critical point to remember, particularly when Vladimir  Putin and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov are accusing the  United States and NATO of stoking tensions and assuming a threatening  military posture.   Think about it: Russia has illegally occupied Crimea and backed  separatist forces in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine for 8 years  as of this month. Yet Russia has the temerity to call NATO, which is a  defensive alliance, and Ukraine--a free country that wishes to join  that defensive pact--the aggressors. I should add that this is not a  case of NATO's moving east, as the Russians will claim, but of  independent countries seeking, of their own volition, to cast off old,  imperialist Soviet influence and align with the West.   Make no mistake about it. Russia is the aggressor here, and we know  that Putin wants to destabilize an independent Ukraine and bring it  back into Russia's sphere of influence, similar to what he has done  with Belarus, and that includes making it unthinkable for Ukraine,  Georgia, or any other nation to seek or join NATO.   There are many possible scenarios for a Russian attack, including an  attempt by Russia to try to solidify control of eastern Ukraine, pick  up territory along the coast, or connect a land bridge to Crimea. Any  Russian attack would also surely include cyber and information  operations--behavior which we have already seen. Russia could overwhelm  Ukrainian defenses and strike command, control, and communications  centers in an opening salvo before crossing the border, but its long- term course of action remains less certain.   Ukrainians of all ages are showing their renewed willingness to put  up a fight and to determine their own future, and Putin has to weigh  any possible gains against the risk of high casualties or an  insurgency.   Putin could also threaten Kyiv and try to force concessions  elsewhere, but his calculus must already include the likely response of  crippling sanctions and isolation, not to mention driving other nations  like Sweden and Finland to align more closely with NATO.   There have also been reports that Putin, whether by military attack  or his little green men, could seek to overthrow President Zelenskyy.  Russia has, of course, denied the claim, but Putin would certainly  prefer a puppet regime to that of President Zelenskyy.   The uncertainty surrounding what Putin could do does not lower the  threat of a Russian attack on Ukraine. And the latest indicators  suggest Russia is still pressing forward to prepare for an imminent  attack. Reports show that Russia is moving blood supplies, medical  materials, and more fuel tankers to its west and to Belarus. Blood  supplies are especially not required for a so-called exercise with  Belarus; they are meant for casualties.   We need to take these developments seriously, pursuing a diplomatic  deescalation, while making sure Ukraine can put up a fight and that  NATO is ready and able to defend against any direct Russian  aggressions.   On the diplomatic side, the United States and Russia have traded  negotiation letters. As I noted earlier, Vladimir Putin is demanding a  ransom for Ukraine's safety--a permanent ban on Ukraine's inclusion in  NATO--and demanding that NATO, a freely associating defensive alliance,  take steps to weaken its own security. These aren't serious demands.   So with no resolution in sight, the United States and its allies  continue to move security assistance to Ukraine, including ammunition,  missiles, and rockets, while preparing to reinforce NATO troops in  border states.   The Javelins and Stingers the West is sending Ukraine may do little  to stop Russian long-range fires or airstrikes, but they could still  impose a significant cost if Russia tries to hold significant  territory, especially in urban areas. Ukrainians are prepared to put up  a fight, and we should provide them with the arms that they need to dig  in.   I hope the administration and the majority party will take this  threat to Ukraine seriously, utilize any remaining levers of American  influence to deter a renewed attack, and, if Putin proceeds, make him  immediately realize that it was a miscalculation.   This will take coordinated, lethal military assistance and strong  sanctions, including against the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline.   It will be critical that Democrats come to realize that Nord Stream 2  is one of Putin's top geopolitical priorities. When this administration  waived sanctions on the pipeline, despite the overwhelming opinion that  the pipeline will make Europe more reliant on--and  [[Page S507]]  vulnerable to--Russian energy and will be an economic blow to Ukraine,  Putin saw that he wouldn't be challenged.   This is a crisis of Putin's making, but we didn't get here overnight.  Waiving sanctions in Nord Stream 2 is one of the many missed  opportunities to signal strength against Putin. We first saw Russia  amassing troops on Ukraine's border last April. Yet here we are,  roughly 10 months later, scrambling to deliver lethal defensive  military aid.   The Biden administration has been too slow to respond to the mounting  crisis and is now playing catchup. Exhibit A is that the administration  just this Monday named its pick to serve as Ambassador to Ukraine. Of  all the times to have a top diplomat in a country to prove that we are  taking its situation seriously and to coordinate assistance, this is  it. This follows a year of the administration slow-rolling assistance  to Ukraine and seemingly springing to action only after the United  Kingdom and others began overtly equipping Ukraine.   It is essential that we present a credible threat to Putin, but,  unfortunately, I think he has pegged our President as a benign  counterpart. Putin can look at America and see an unpopular President  as risk-averse and spinning his wheels on a polarizing and flailing  domestic agenda, not to mention that he can look at President Biden's  botched withdrawal from Afghanistan and the risk to our defense  modernization efforts from another continuing resolution and conclude  that Democrats and the President pose little threat to Russia's  ambitions.   Given the Biden administration's record, I have concerns about the  President's willingness to stand up to Russia, but I very much hope  these concerns are unfounded. We simply cannot afford to fail in this  situation.   This is Ukraine's fight, but the implications of an attack will go  far beyond its borders. We cannot accept that one nation can simply  attack and subjugate another. And we cannot be so naive to think that  Russia would stop with an invasion of Ukraine. The bear would still be  in the woods, and Putin would love nothing more than to challenge or  break the credibility of NATO or the United States. We cannot accept  that scenario or allow Russia to dictate our own security posture with  respect to NATO.   The only way to reject that future is by standing with our partners  and staring down Putin's open aggression. Shoring up our NATO presence  and putting troops on high alert are steps in the right direction. I am  sure Ukraine currently feels surrounded and outgunned, but we need to  make clear to Ukraine and to Vladimir Putin that Ukraine is not alone;  that the free nations of the West will stand with Ukraine against  Russian aggression and that the United States will make good on its  NATO commitments.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), the Senator from Montana (Mr. Daines),  and the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. Hoeven).
