 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the historic  bipartisan legislative package introduced this week to address the  United States' urgent maternal health crisis. I am referring to the  Black Maternal Health Momnibus.   Each year, 700 women in our country die from pregnancy complications,  but 3 in 5 of those deaths could be prevented.   The United States' maternal mortality rate is exponentially higher  than that of any other developed country, and Black women are three  times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications than  White women, a glaring disparity that we cannot ignore.   In my community, organizations like The Foundation for Delaware  County and the Maternity Care Coalition have stepped up to address this  crisis, but we must do more.   I am proud to join Congresswomen Lauren Underwood and Alma Adams,  Senator Kamala Harris, and other congressional leaders in introducing  the Black Maternal Health Momnibus.   The momnibus provides a comprehensive approach to maternal health,  and particularly Black maternal health, by funding community-based  organizations, investing in social determinants that influence maternal  health outcomes, and growing and diversifying the prenatal workforce.   I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation for all  our families.                            ____________________
