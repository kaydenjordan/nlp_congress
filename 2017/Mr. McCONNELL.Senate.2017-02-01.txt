 Madam President, last night President Trump announced  an outstanding nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch of  Colorado. While Judge Gorsuch has a significant legacy to live up to as  the nominee for the seat left vacant by the loss of Justice Scalia, I  am confident his impressive background and long record of service will  prepare him well for the task ahead.   Like Justice Scalia, Judge Gorsuch understands the constitutional  limits of his authority. He understands that a judge's duty is to apply  the law evenhandedly, without bias toward one party or another. He  understands that his role as a judge is to interpret the law, not  impose his own viewpoint or political leanings.   He has also been recognized from people on both sides of the aisle as  a consistent, principled, and fair jurist. Judge Gorsuch has a stellar  reputation and a resume to match, with degrees from Harvard and  Columbia, a Ph.D. in legal philosophy from Oxford, and just about every  honor, award, and scholarship you can possibly imagine.   When he graduated from law school, Judge Gorsuch did not just clerk  for one Supreme Court Justice, he clerked for two. They were Justices  nominated by Presidents of different political parties--Anthony  Kennedy, a Reagan appointee, and Byron White, who was nominated by JFK.   Judge Gorsuch received a unanimously ``well qualified'' rating by the  American Bar Association when he was nominated to his current position  on the court of appeals. He was confirmed without any votes in  opposition. That is right--not a single Democrat opposed Judge  Gorsuch's confirmation, not Senator Barack Obama, not Senator Hillary  Clinton, not Senators Joe Biden or Ted Kennedy. In fact, not a single  one of the Democrats who still serve with us opposed him, including the  ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Feinstein, and the  Democratic leader himself, Senator Schumer. In the coming days, I hope  and expect that all Senate colleagues will again give him fair  consideration, just as we did for the nominees of newly elected  Presidents Clinton and Obama.   This is a judge who is known for deciding cases based on how the law  is actually written, not how he wishes it were written, even when it  leads to results that conflict with his own political beliefs. He  understands that his role as a judge is to interpret the law, not  impose his own viewpoint. Here is how Judge Gorsuch himself put it: ``A  judge who likes every result he reaches is very likely a bad judge,  reaching for results he prefers rather than those the law compels.''   Some of our colleagues and some others on the left see the role of a  judge very differently. In last year's Presidential debate, our former  colleague, Secretary Clinton, stated her view that a Supreme Court  Justice--now listen to this--ought to look more favorably on certain  political constituencies than others; that it was the job of the  Supreme Court to ``stand on the side'' of this group or another over  that one. Some of our current colleagues seem to share this view. The  assistant Democratic leader said that what is important to him are the  political views of a Supreme Court nominee, what or perhaps whom they  are going to stand for.   The problem with that approach is that it is great if you happen to  be the party in the case whom the judge likes; it is not so great if  you are the other guy. Justice Scalia believed this to his very core.  He was an eloquent champion of the Constitution who was guided by  important principles like applying the law equally to all, giving every  litigant a fair shake, and rulings based on the actual meaning of the  Constitution and our laws, not what you or your preferred political  constituency wished they meant. These principles  [[Page S542]]  helped guide Justice Scalia for many years. The record of Judge Gorsuch  indicates that he will continue this legacy of fair and impartial  justice.   Now, of course, that does not much matter to some over here on the  far left. Despite his sterling credentials and bipartisan support, some  on the far left decided to oppose Judge Gorsuch before he was even  nominated. We already know what they will say about him as well. It is  the same thing they have been saying about every Republican nominee for  more than four decades. They said Gerald Ford's nominee, John Paul  Stevens, ``revealed an extraordinary lack of sensitivity to the  problems women face.'' They said Reagan's nominee, Anthony Kennedy, was  a ``sexist'' who would ``be a disaster for women.'' They said George  H.W. Bush's nominee, David Souter, was a threat to women, minorities,  dissenters, and other disadvantaged groups. So it is not terribly  surprising that they would say it again this time. What is  disappointing is that leading Democrats in the Senate would adopt the  same rhetoric. The ink was not even dry on Judge Gorsuch's nomination  when the Democratic leader proclaimed that Judge Gorsuch had--you  guessed it--demonstrated a hostility toward women's rights. I hope our  colleagues will stick to the facts this time around.   We know that Justice Scalia's seat on the Court does not belong to  any President or any political party; it belongs to the American  people. When it became vacant in the middle of a contentious  Presidential election, we followed the rule set down by Vice President  Joe Biden and Democratic Leader Senator Schumer, which said that  Supreme Court vacancies arising in the midst of a Presidential election  should not be considered until the campaign ends. It is the same rule,  by the way, that President Obama's own legal counsel admitted she would  have recommended had the shoe been on the other foot.   I have been consistent all along that the next President, Democrat or  Republican, should select the next nominee for the Supreme Court. I  maintained that view even when many thought that particular President  would be Hillary Clinton. But now the election season is over and we  have a new President who has nominated a superbly qualified candidate  to fill that ninth seat. So I would invite Democrats who spent many  months insisting we need nine to join us in following through on that  advice by giving the new President's nominee a fair consideration and  an up-or-down vote, just as we did for past Presidents of both parties.    Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on  confirmation.    Mr. President, I move to table the motion to  reconsider, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I move that the reading of the Journal  be waived.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I move that the Senate proceed to  executive session to consider Calendar No. 11, Elisabeth DeVos to be  Secretary of Education.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, for the last 8 years, the Obama  administration has pushed through a number of harmful regulations that  circumvent Congress, slow growth, shift power away from State and local  governments toward Washington, and kill a lot of jobs. Even on the way  out the door, the former administration's regulatory onslaught  continued as they pushed through more midnight regulations. These  nearly 40 major regulations, which were pushed through by the Obama  administration since election day, would cost Americans a projected  $157 billion, according to one report.   Fortunately, with a new President, we now have the opportunity to  give the American people relief and our economy a boost. One of the  most important tools we have is the Congressional Review Act, which  allows Congress to provide relief from heavyhanded regulations that  hold our country back.   The House just took an important step by sending us two pieces of  legislation that will reassert congressional authority and make a real  impact for the American people.   One of those resolutions will address a regulation that puts U.S.  companies at a competitive disadvantage to private and foreign  companies. Passing this resolution will allow the SEC to go back to the  drawing board so that we can promote transparency, which is something  we all want, but to do so without giving giant foreign conglomerates a  leg up over American workers. We will take it up soon.   The other resolution, which we will take up first, will address an  eleventh-hour parting salvo in the Obama administration's war on coal  families that could threaten one-third of America's coal-mining jobs.  It is identical to the legislation I introduced this week and is a  continuation of my efforts to push back against the former  administration's attack on coal communities.   Appalachian coal miners, like those in my home State of Kentucky,  need relief right now. That is why groups like the Kentucky Coal  Association, the United Mine Workers Association, and 14 State  attorneys general, among others, have all joined together in a call to  overturn this regulation.   The Senate should approve this resolution without delay and send it  to the President's desk. The sooner we do, the sooner we can begin  undoing the job-killing policies associated with the stream buffer  rule. This is not a partisan issue; this is about bringing relief to  those who need it and protecting jobs across our country. I hope our  friends across the aisle will support our Nation's coal miners and join  me in advancing this resolution.   After we address these regulations, both the House and the Senate  will continue working to advance several other CRA resolutions that can  bring the American people relief.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I now move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.J. Res. 38.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
