 Madam President, I come to floor today in complete  support of Senator Inhofe, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services  Committee, and I come in support of the National Defense Authorization  Act. I come to speak to that, and I am so grateful for the Senator from  Oklahoma and for his ongoing, determined leadership in making sure that  our Nation remains safe and secure and free. And it is because of the  work done by Senator Inhofe and his committee and this body and this  legislation that we will be voting on. I am so grateful for the  leadership of the chairman, and I want to talk, specifically, about the  reason I think it is important that we do pass the legislation that the  committee has worked so hard on.   So the Presiding Officer knows, as a member of that committee, that  this critical national security legislation lays out America's defense  and national security priorities, as the Senator from Oklahoma just  made up, for the years to come. It sets the policies to defend our  Nation, and it supports America's service men and women here at home,  as well as those abroad.   I was honored to spend Thanksgiving, again this year, with Wyoming  National Guard troops, members of our Air National Guard, and they are  serving at this time in Qatar, in the Al Udeid Air Force Base in the  Persian Gulf. And when I think of the National Defense Authorization  Act, this legislation before us today, I think of them. I think about  the members there--Charlie Med, doing medical evacuations and medical  transport.   First, I will tell you that, in terms of these Wyoming soldiers who  are there, if you are in need of medical care or medical transport, you  would be in very capable hands. You also know they have what they need  to be able to do the job. I think of them, and I think of their  families--the sacrifices that are being made by the families at home,  because the families play a significant and important role in this as  well   You know, it is interesting, with so many deployed overseas right  now, some of them have found that their deployments have been extended.  Because of coronavirus, they are unable to do the transports of moving  people back to the United States for the holidays and then back into  the fields, so that they have many who felt that they would be home for  the holidays who are going to find that they are not able to be home  for the holidays. So I think it is very important that the Senate send  a strong message that we have their backs, just as they have ours.   This is an incredibly bipartisan piece of legislation--one of the  most bipartisan pieces of legislation every year when it comes to the  floor of the Senate. It reflects equal input from Republicans and from  Democrats. The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted 229 bipartisan  amendments before it approved the NDAA this summer by a vote in the  committee, on which the Presiding Officer also sits, of 25 to 2.   It is also in line with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019. It  supports $741 billion in defense funding for the 2021 fiscal year.   The NDAA is really a proud tradition of this institution and of our  Nation. This is the 60th year in a row that the Senate has taken up the  NDAA, and it has passed this body every year. We need to make sure this  year is no exception. The world may be distracted by other things that  are going on--certainly, the issue of a coronavirus pandemic--but, make  no mistake, China and Russia still have global ambitions, and they pose  grave threats to our Nation's security.   The Chinese military has actually stepped up its aggression against  its neighbors, and we see it in the South China Sea. Russia is using  energy as a weapon against its neighbors, and it continues cyber  attacks against governments and institutions around the globe. This  legislation will help keep China and Russia in check.   It maintains our high-tech edge, as the chairman of the Armed  Services Committee has just said. It modernizes our nuclear weapons  system with funding for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent. It  invests in new technologies--hypersonic weapons, biotechnologies,  artificial intelligence, cyber security--all of which are designed to  help keep us safe and free.   It implements the National Defense Strategy to promote a strong  military deterrent and to strive for lasting peace, and it delivers a  well-deserved pay raise for our troops, along with high-quality  housing, healthcare, and childcare for military families at home, as  well as abroad.   So I do want to thank Senator Inhofe and Ranking Member Senator Reed  of Rhode Island for their work in bringing this bill to the floor.  Democrats have a history of opposing sometimes stronger defense  funding, especially during the Obama-Biden years, but this makes longer  term funding uncertain, and it becomes even more important to do what  we need to do now to stand up against our adversaries.   No, we can't afford to slow our Nation's critical defense investments  now. This NDAA will protect American leadership and values all around  the world, and it will give our Nation what we need to confront the  aggressors that I mentioned, like China and Russia. This legislation is  strategic, and this legislation is strong. It is smart, and it supports  our troops, and it stands up to our enemies. The Senate needs to pass  this, the 60th National Defense Authorization Act.                                 Coronavirus    Madam President, I would now like to take a moment to discuss another  topic, and that is coronavirus relief for American families.   Increasingly, we are seeing communities across the country asking for  a clear path forward--a path forward to put the virus behind us and to  help us grow our economy. The takeaway from last Friday's job report is  we really have no time to waste. For the first time since we passed the  CARES Act, the jobs report showed signs of a slowing recovery-- recovery, yes, but not as rapid as planned.   The sectors hardest hit at the beginning of the pandemic are now hard  hit again--retail and food services. The Republican-led CARES Act  secured the swiftest, strongest economic recovery in our Nation's  history. It added more than 12.3 million jobs in the last 7 months. It  has been a great American comeback.   At the end of this month, provisions of the CARES Act are expiring-- things like sick leave, unemployment benefits, and tax provisions. We  need to extend those. For small businesses, I believe we need to  reestablish and refurbish the popular Paycheck Protection Program. The  money has gone. I talked to small businesses in Wyoming, talked to  county commissioners last night, and talked to our Wyoming stock  growers yesterday. We need to replenish the Paycheck Protection  Program.   We need to reallocate unused funds for immediate needs now.  Republican priorities are American priorities in terms of relief from  coronavirus.   We want to make sure, certainly, to fund the distribution of the  vaccine, which is ready to go. We need to provide relief for  individuals and small businesses, and we need to get kids back into the  classroom safely so they don't fall further behind.   The job we need to do is significant, it is serious, and relief is  necessary. We need to get a bridge to the point where people have  either received the vaccine or there is immunity in communities.  Republicans are offering a path forward. We are doing it legislatively.   What we have heard from the Democrats are hard lines, all-or-nothing  demands. We have heard them for the last 7 months. Democrats have  offered no new proposals for COVID relief. They passed their $3  trillion Fantasy Island bill in May and never lifted a pen after that.   In the last 6 months, Democrats have blocked relief that we have  offered on the Senate floor four different times. Last week, Speaker  Pelosi said--admitted--that she had held up all those  [[Page S7391]]  6 months of coronavirus relief for the American public for political  gain, for politics. And we heard it from the minority assistant leader  just yesterday, admitting the same, punishing the American people for  politics. It is a sad commentary on where that party has been as the  American people are asking for relief. Democrats don't have a plan.  They played politics with the pandemic.   Again, our path forward is to do the things that we know need to be  done: distribute the vaccine, provide Americans with relief, and get  Americans' lives back on track. What we hear from Democrats are more  lockdowns, more taxes during a pandemic, and more special projects for  the far left. It is sad. The Democrats' policies don't meet the moment.  We need to get relief to the public now. Democrats are ignoring where  we really are in terms of the cost the Americans have borne and the  progress that we have made in the recovery, and they have done it for  political purposes.   Scientists and researchers are within several days of approval of the  vaccine and a distribution nationwide. The country is soon going to  have several highly effective vaccines distributed to every State.   In Wyoming, we are looking forward to 5,000 vaccines as early as  Monday and 15,000 by the end of the month. I talked to the head of the  intensive care unit at the Wyoming Medical Center just the other day-- the hospital where I had been chief of staff, where there are  increasing numbers of patients in the intensive care unit on  respirators, where the staff is exhausted. They say: We need the  vaccine for the staff, for the frontline workers, for the healthcare  workers, for the elderly, and for the nursing home patients so they  don't end up in the hospital and on ventilators.   These are the healthcare heroes of the day, the doctors and nurses  taking care of these sick patients. We are going to administer vaccines  to them, to the nursing home patients, and to those at high risk. Over  the next 3 months, over 1 million people will be vaccinated.   Relief is necessary. In our State, we have lost 299 citizens to  coronavirus--a number that I would have thought would not have  occurred. This is with people trying to social distance, people trying  to do the kinds of things in terms of wearing masks--a behavior that we  know, with hygiene, would minimize the spread--but still the disease  continues to spread.   The vaccine is the solution, but between now and the time the people  can get vaccinated, help is needed, and it is up to this body to act.  We still have work to do on behalf of the American people. I hope that  the Democrats will join us in this effort this holiday season to get  that relief to folks who need it. In the meantime, I say let's continue  to do the things that we know work so we can stay safe and our  businesses and our country can stay open.   With that, I thank you.   I yield the floor   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have 4 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
