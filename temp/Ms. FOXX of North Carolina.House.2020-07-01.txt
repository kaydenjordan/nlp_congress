 Madam Speaker, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 2.  This amendment will modernize our infrastructure spending to yield more  investments in infrastructure projects, more jobs for frontline  workers, and equitable spending for communities across our Nation.   I am always hesitant about measures that are brought before this  Chamber that are partisan, which is what H.R. 2 is. I am disappointed  that Democrats decided to turn the infrastructure bill into a partisan  exercise by spending over a trillion dollars, while failing to address  this longstanding problem and save taxpayers tens of billions of  dollars a year.   Instead of recognizing and addressing ongoing issues with the Highway  Trust Fund's inevitable insolvency, this bill relies on deficit  spending and adds to the taxpayers' growing burdens at a time when many  families are struggling with the uncertainty created by the COVID-19  crisis.   Instead of building the infrastructure Americans need, this bill  gives priority to rail lines and urban hubs, even as Americans across  the country begin to flee these high-cost areas.   Instead of building a bipartisan consensus to streamline the project  review process, this bill binds the hands of States and localities and  burdens the American public with unworkable mandates.   Madam Speaker, at a time when numerous other bills that had been  brought to the floor carry a $1 trillion price tag, without offsetting  cost, we must look for ways to rein in out-of-control spending. My  amendment would inject a modicum of fiscal research into this $1.5  trillion bill by reversing a Federal contracting policy that was  designed to protect established union work at the expense of would-be  competitors, taxpayers, and our Nation's investment in infrastructure.   My amendment will allow us to continue to fund important highway  projects by making commonsense reforms to lower the cost of  infrastructure contracts funded by the American taxpayer.   The Davis-Bacon Act requires Federal contractors and subcontractors  to pay the local prevailing wage for construction projects on which the  Federal Government is a party. It sounds innocent, but the devil is  always in the details. The prevailing wage is severely dictated not by  market forces but by the domination of union bargaining power.   By using this metric, Congress is effectively pricing out any would- be competition for contracts and shielding entrenched interests from  competition.   What is the result of Davis-Bacon, which was adopted before Federal  minimum wage standards existed? According to a report from the Joint  Economic Committee, Davis-Bacon-determined wages tend to inflate labor  costs an average of 22 percent above market rates.   Additionally, research from Suffolk University found that Davis-Bacon  requirements cost U.S. taxpayers an additional $8.6 billion annually  and add 9.9 percent to construction costs.   The Congressional Budget Office has found that removing this  burdensome mandate would free up $13 billion over 10 years. Perhaps  that is why the Government Accountability Office advocated for its  repeal over 40 years ago.   I know Congress is often derelict in its duty, but that is simply  inexcusable. These inflated costs mean bloated government spending and  less bang for the taxpayers' buck.   Beyond requiring taxpayers to overpay for construction projects,  Davis-Bacon requirements force businesses working on Federal highway  projects to comply with burdensome paperwork and reporting regulations,  which further inflate costs and slow project completion.   The premise of this bill is that it invests in America. If that is  the goal, then we must address this outdated  [[Page H3028]]  stumbling block to our Nation's progress. Davis-Bacon concentrates  wealth by government fiat instead of growing our economy. It  artificially limits the number of construction projects in which we  engage. Finally, it limits the number of jobs created.   Madam Speaker, our economy needs expansion, not constraint. Federal  spending needs efficiency, not bloated profit-making. People need jobs,  not barriers to entry to employment.   Madam Speaker, if we want investment, support my amendment and inject  our infrastructure projects with a healthy dose of the 21st century.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Madam Speaker, you know, the gentleman, I  think, maligns the State of North Carolina. I didn't think I would have  to really stand here and defend what a wonderful State North Carolina  is, but I think it is the fourth largest growing State in the country.  People are coming there in droves. It is considered one of the best  States in the country for workers. The minimum wage may be $7.25, but I  think we know only about 2 percent of the people in this country are  making the minimum wage, and they are entry level people. I think we  are talking more about an average wage of about $20 an hour for people  in North Carolina. So that is a straw dog that he is bringing up.   We have a wonderful State, and people are flocking there. The quality  of life is great. And I will put up our quality of life in North  Carolina against the quality of life in Oregon or anywhere else in the  country as a great place to live.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Davis-Bacon stifles competition and discourages small and minority- owned businesses. Small business owners often do not have the financial  resources to bid on or win Davis-Bacon contracts. These restrictions  mean less infrastructure and fewer jobs in America, but more jobs and  higher pay only for union members, concentrating wealth in the hands of  the few while many Americans are out of work. That  [[Page H3029]]  is something our colleagues seem to be opposed to in every other  situation.   Suspending this mandate would make each public construction dollar go  at least 10 percent further. This would create more bridges and  buildings at the same cost to taxpayers. It would also employ hundreds  of thousands more construction workers.   Repealing these restrictions would allow the government to build more  infrastructure and create 155,000 more construction-related jobs at the  same cost to taxpayers.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, under the nearly $500  billion surface transportation reauthorization piece of H.R. 2, the  Highway Trust Fund, HTF, which pays for Federal highway and transit  programs, it will require a $145 billion general fund bailout to cover  the cost of the majority's irresponsible spending decisions.   Instead of trying to find a responsible way to pay for this huge  increase in surface transportation funding and address the HTF's long- term solvency issues, the bill simply piles more debt onto future  generations.   Infrastructure is vital to our economy and the flow of commerce, but  it is reckless to push such a massive bill that relies so heavily on  more deficit spending, adds billions of dollars to programs without  providing any reforms to reduce costs associated with the  infrastructure project approval process, and ignores the Highway Trust  Fund's solvency issue.   In addition, these partisan changes to our Federal transportation  programs focus more on climate change and less on building  infrastructure projects, creating more uncertainty for transportation  workers and businesses.   Rather than kicking the can down the road and burdening future  generations with the spending habits of today, we need to recognize and  address inefficiencies that have lingered for far too long.   By repealing the Davis-Bacon Act for transportation projects, we can  stretch taxpayer dollars further while updating, improving, and  advancing the development of our Nation's critical infrastructure.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, you know, the attacks on this amendment are truly  uncalled for. No Republican is calling for people to be paid $2 an hour  or to be abused, nobody.   You know, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, they have a  right to their opinion but not to making up things and not to putting  words in our mouths. That is just uncalled for.   So, I am not going to really dignify those comments by trying to  respond to them except to say that. We are getting sick and tired of  people telling others what we think.   Let's just talk about what we do. And what this bill does is waste  hardworking taxpayer dollars, and that is what we are trying to  protect.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask for the gentleman's  words to be taken down.    Madam Speaker, I ask for the gentleman's  words to be taken down. I am not a hypocrite.    May I hear the gentleman say what he said  again, please? I am sorry, someone was distracting me, Madam Speaker. I  am only asking.    As I understand it, the gentleman is  withdrawing his remarks and asking for unanimous consent that his  remarks be withdrawn. Is that correct?    No objection.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the jobs bill and tax cut bill which Republicans alone  passed in 2017 cut taxes for low-income Americans. Again, my colleagues  are welcome to their opinions, but they are not welcome to make up  facts, and that is what happened. The top 1 percent of the people in  this country pay more in taxes as a result of that bill.   Madam Speaker, I grew up extremely poor in a house with no  electricity and no running water. My father had to work away from home  in the north. I grew up in North Carolina, and he was forced to be a  member of a union and he hated it. He hated it because he had to pay  union dues that supported policies he didn't support.   He was forced to take breaks. He was forced to slow down jobs. What  he wanted to do was do his job and do it well and not come under the  heavy hand of union bosses. I learned a long time ago about negative  aspects of union membership from my father.   But we are not here today to talk about personal issues; we are here  to talk about the future of this country.   I also am the lead Republican on the Education and Labor Committee,  and I fought all of my life to help people gain the skills they need to  get good jobs and better their lives. I am proud of what I have done  over the years, and I will continue to do those things and focus on  helping individuals become masters of their own lives and not be the  subjects of anyone--not the unions, not the government, not anyone--but  preserve their own freedom.   We are here today to consider a massive progressive wish list. The  majority has made no attempts to pay for any of the program increases  or offset any of the other $1.5 trillion added to this bill, which puts  the American people in debt.   In the surface transportation provisions, $2 out of every $5 is tied  up in Green New Deal goals. Let's be clear. Also, this bill has no  chance of becoming law.  [[Page H3031]]    With so many Americans already out of work because of the pandemic,  this costly shift in our transportation programs creates more  uncertainty and does nothing to address longstanding inefficiencies.   Rather than pushing partisan wish lists that would heap enormous  amounts of debt on future generations, we instead need to find  commonsense solutions to modernize our infrastructure spending so we  can get the most from every dollar invested. That is what Republicans  want to do. We are not hypocrites.                                time  1300    We believe, again, in freedom. We believe in what founded this  country, the values that founded this country, and we are about to  celebrate Independence Day. That is what we should be focused on: How  do we do everything we can to celebrate independence and preserve that  for the American people?   One of the ways we do that is by not incurring more debt on their  behalf. I ask my colleagues to join me in taking a step toward fiscal  restraint by overturning this antiquated law from a bygone era. At this  critical junction in our Nation's history, we need to maximize our  commitment to job creation, wise investment, equitable spending, and  solutions to our unending deficit.   Support my amendment to get the real investment in our Nation's  infrastructure that our citizens deserve.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
