 Mr. Speaker, I am in support of the bill. However, this  is the jurisdiction of the Financial Services Committee. I am the vice  ranking member, and I am willing to yield time. I think we will be  speaking in both opposition and in support of the bill.  [[Page H8918]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  H.R. 3702, the Reforming Disaster Recovery Act, which I introduced with  Congressman Al Green.   Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I want to take a moment to thank  Congressman Green and the majority leader, Mr. Hoyer, and so many  others who have been great partners in this endeavor--again, unanimous  votes out of the Financial Services Committee in both the 115th and the  116th Congresses. I appreciate their willingness to make sure that  disaster relief is being spent on the most vulnerable victims of  natural disasters.   When natural disasters strike, the Federal Government plays a  critical role in delivering emergency aid. Taxpayer dollars spent on  disaster relief must be allocated wisely and efficiently. Every  disaster relief dollar diverted to an ineffective or wasteful use is a  dollar that is not going to help people in need.   Last Congress, the Financial Services Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations began a bipartisan effort to improve the Community  Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery program. Today's legislation  is a product of that strong bipartisan work.   The Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery program helps  communities start the recovery process and assists neighborhoods with  limited resources in rebuilding critical infrastructure after a  catastrophic event.                                time  1630    According to numerous IG reports and a hearing that the Oversight and  Investigations Subcommittee held in 2018, major issues have been  identified with the CDBG-DR program. Slow reimbursement of disaster- related funding, delays in funding for our low- to moderate-income  citizens, and the potential duplication of benefits were just some of  the identified difficulties.   While FEMA and other government agencies provide immediate resources  to victims of disasters, it is HUD that often distributes the most aid  through the CDBG disaster recovery program. Although HUD has become a  primary provider of disaster assistance since 1993, this program is not  codified in statute.   HUD uses more than 60 Federal Register notices to issue clarifying  guidance waivers and alternative requirements to oversee at least 113  active disaster recovery program grants, which  [[Page H8920]]  total--are you ready for this, Mr. Speaker?--more than $47 billion of  taxpayer money as of last year.   Codifying the CDBG-DR program would provide a framework for future  disasters, reduce the overreliance on Federal Register notices for each  disaster, and speed delivery of disaster assistance to grantees and  disaster victims.   The CDBG-DR program must be codified and reformed to increase  oversight and accountability and ensure that disaster relief dollars go  directly and expeditiously to those who need them the most.  Codification provides proper controls that protect against waste,  fraud, and abuse.   In testimony before the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee  last Congress, the acting inspector general of HUD noted that $11.5  billion of CDBG-DR funds appropriated for disasters, going all the way  back for almost nearly a decade, remain unspent.   H.R. 3702 sets up a mechanism to recapture future unused CDBG-DR  funds, an accountability mechanism that we desperately need to put in  reserves for future disasters. We must do a better job recouping this  lost money for future disasters. And, most importantly, this will help  ensure disaster funds are getting to those who need them most when they  need it.   H.R. 3702 also helps to eliminate the duplication of benefits that  can occur in the wake of government response to a natural disaster  under our current multiagency system. It helps protect taxpayer dollars  from being improperly allocated, from waste, fraud, and abuse, as was  laid out by the inspector general.   It is about time, Mr. Speaker, that Congress makes this disaster  relief program accountable to the people we serve and to American  taxpayers in every State.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill), one of our senior members of the Financial  Services Committee who is also the ranking member on the Subcommittee  on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy.    Mr. Speaker, may I make an inquiry? Is the gentleman  ready to close? I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Those who oppose this bill, the Reforming Disaster Recovery Act, they  oppose it because HUD involvement has been involved in disaster  recovery. Their opposition is so strong that they would allow waste,  fraud, and abuse to continue to overrun the program instead of  codifying and reforming it.   Their opposition is purely philosophical, Mr. Speaker. It is not  practical. HUD has been charged with administering this program since  1993 under Democrat and Republican Presidents, under Democrat and  Republican Speakers. No matter the composition of the House or the  Senate, this program has continued.   I have seen no national movement to end this program and bring the  gentleman's theoretical vision into being. Meanwhile, the program  continues to generate waste, fraud, and abuse. The gentleman would  justify this waste and abuse because they believe some day they will  successfully convince both Chambers in Congress and the President to  pass legislation that would make FEMA the sole distributor of disaster  funds.   The gentlemen have articulated no feasible path toward ending the  program. The gentlemen have no interest in reforming or fixing the  program, and they have no jurisdiction, Mr. Speaker.   During the 115th Congress I served as the chair of the Oversight and  Investigations Subcommittee of the Financial Services Committee. I  worked with committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, a conservative through  and through, to draft this legislation with my good friend and  colleague, Mr. Green, and address the flaws in this program.    We must pass this bill in order to end the waste and abuse, and to  ensure that funding goes quickly to those who need it, and to recapture  the unused funds responsibly. I am dismayed that my colleagues in  opposition will continue to waste taxpayer dollars simply because they  have an interagency disagreement that falls outside of their  jurisdiction.   This legislation places greater accountability and controls on  taxpayer money spent after disaster through codification, a clawback  provision, duplication of benefit reforms, minimum procurement  standards for States, and other very important provisions.   This bill, Mr. Speaker, is effective and responsive policy, and I  urge all of my colleagues to support this piece of legislation. I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4029, the Tribal Eligibility  for Homeless Assistance Grants Act of 2019.   According to a study from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development, homelessness on Tribal lands often looks different from  many other areas of the country. Tribal homelessness often results in  overcrowding in housing that is already in short supply and rapidly  aging and deteriorating.   Sadly, 16 percent of households in Tribal areas are overcrowded  compared to just 2 percent nationally. These overcrowded conditions  hide the problem of homelessness throughout these communities.   In 1996, the Native American Housing Assistance and Self- Determination Act was passed to give Tribes one larger and more  flexible block grant to meet their housing needs. As a result, Tribes  are ineligible for HUD's individual housing assistance programs.   H.R. 4029 would allow Tribal communities to be eligible to apply for  and receive HUD's local Continuum of Care grants. Making Tribes  eligible recipients for homeless assistance grants is a first step  towards fixing Tribal housing issues and solving this hidden crisis of  homelessness on Tribal lands.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud the sponsors of H.R. 4029, Mr. Heck, and our  former colleague, Mr. Duffy. I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues once again to support  H.R. 4029, the Tribal Eligibility for Homeless Assistance Grants Act of  2019, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this Congress, our committee has held multiple hearings  focused on strengthening diversity and inclusion in our financial  system and beyond, including a full committee hearing examining  America's boardrooms.   Witness testimony makes clear that women and minorities are  underrepresented in leadership positions throughout the financial  services sector. This bill will help move companies in the right  direction.   We know that women hold just 26 percent of senior management  positions and only 15 percent of executive positions in the finance  industry. These figures have stayed relatively flat over the past  decade.   Corporate leaders know the value of having a wide range of  perspectives and experiences in the boardroom and are being proactive  in their efforts to diversify leadership in the financial services  industry. Last year, 91 percent of board directors reported taking  steps to increase diversity. Just last month, Citigroup announced the  promotion of Jane Fraser to lead Citigroup's global consumer banking,  setting her up to be the first female CEO of a major bank.   The private sector is working proactively to achieve more diversity,  and this bill will give us even more data to measure progress,  including with respect to hiring veterans. Companies should also work  to help our servicemen and -women reacclimate into civilian life. This  bill will reinforce the work that industry is already doing to help  employ our veterans.   Witnesses who testified before the committee believe that the  disclosures in this bill are a step in the right direction, in part  because a large percentage of companies already do it annually. In  fact, more than 40 percent of publicly traded companies already  disclose information related to the gender, race, and ethnic makeup of  their boards.   I thank Congresswoman Maloney and Congressman Meeks for working on  this bill. I am grateful to the ranking member and the chairman of the  Committee on Financial Services. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R.  5084, the Improving Corporate Governance Through Diversity Act of 2019.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to recognize the gentleman from Utah (Mr.  McAdams) and the ranking member of the Investor Protection,  Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets Subcommittee, Mr. Huizenga, for  their diligent efforts on this bipartisan bill.   This bill is the result of the Supreme Court's Kokesh decision, which  restricted the SEC's disgorgement authority to 5 years.   SEC Chairman Jay Clayton almost never advocates for Congress to  legislate on a particular issue; however, the issue before us today is  the exception, as Chairman Clayton has expressed concern that a 5-year  statute of limitations allows bad actors to hold on to their ill-gotten  gains obtained outside of that 5-year window.   As Chairman Clayton has pointed out: Many long-running frauds go  longer and, in some cases, well longer than 5 years; and it is just  plain wrong to allow a fraudster to keep money made from their fraud  simply because he or she was good at concealing the wrongful behavior.   Today's bill is responsive to Chairman Clayton's concerns in a  thoughtful and balanced way. Statutes of limitations are important  procedural protections intended to strike the balance between ensuring  wrongdoers are not rewarded for bad behavior and protecting  shareholders, who are ultimately responsible for paying large penalties  for violations they did not commit in the event of an SEC judgment.   I know there is concern that the 14-year statute of limitations in  the bill is too long. I share concerns that the SEC could be slow to  bring a case when certainty and swiftness should be the priority when  pursuing enforcement actions. However, the reality is this: A 14-year  statute of limitations is a reasonable first attempt to strike the  appropriate balance in the disgorgement context.   I say ``first attempt'' because the bill also requires the SEC to  report to Congress with data on cases where the SEC has sought  disgorgement. These reports will be useful in allowing Congress to  evaluate the effectiveness of the statute of limitations and fine-tune  it, if appropriate.   This bipartisan bill carefully balances the benefits of statutes of  limitations with the downside of fraudsters potentially holding on to  significant amounts of their gains.   Again, I thank the gentlemen from Utah and Michigan for their  thoughtful draft bipartisan legislation, which I support, and I urge  all my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the ranking member of the  Investor Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4300, the Fostering Stable  Housing Opportunities Act.   Each year, Mr. Speaker, roughly 20,000 youth age out of foster care.  Young adults without families who exit the foster care system are  incredibly vulnerable to homelessness. A number of studies show that  between 11 and 36 percent of these young people who age out of our  foster care system experience homelessness.   These foster youth need and deserve our support. A stable roof over  their heads can allow these young men and women to pursue an education  or a career. A home can be a bedrock from which they can build their  lives and protect them from crimes like human trafficking.   It will also help these young adults by allowing up to 2 years of  extensions if they enroll in HUD's Family Self-Sufficiency program,  pursue education or workforce development, or gain employment.   It is our duty, Mr. Speaker, to protect these young men and women  from being jettisoned from our foster care system and onto the streets.  This bill doesn't just give them a roof over their heads; it gives them  the ability to build a future.   I applaud the sponsors of H.R. 4300, Ms. Dean and Mr. Stivers, and I  would like to acknowledge, in particular, the hard work that my good  friend, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner) has put into this bill  over the last few years. He has been a true champion of this issue, and  should be commended for his dedication.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to strongly support this bill, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
