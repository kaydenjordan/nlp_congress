 Mr. President, July 31, 2021, marks the retirement  of Rick Shanklin, whose remarkable career with the National Weather  Service spans several decades.   Though Rick hails from a small farming community near Hopkinsville in  Christian County, most of his career has been spent at the NWS office  in Paducah, KY, where he was the warning coordination meteorologist.   He has served at all three National Weather Service operations in  Kentucky, has been a forecaster, worked with countless tornado drills  and national assessment teams, and pursued his passion for operational  readiness and public severe weather preparedness, earning many honors  along the way from the Department of Commerce, various Governors  throughout the region, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky's Division of  Emergency Management.   Rick is also credited with championing the development of Kentucky's  ``Mesonet,'' a network of over 70 automated weather monitoring  stations, hosted by Western Kentucky University, that is a model for  other States.   It turns out that Rick is something of a celebrity among those who  share his passion for the science and technology of predicting and  preparing for the very dynamic weather conditions of the Commonwealth.  His fans, local leaders, and county emergency managers will miss his  regular updates and his steady, thorough engagement during critical  weather events.   Most importantly, it would be difficult to calculate the lives saved  and property losses mitigated by the work that Rick has performed  during his career. I am proud to recognize him for his considerable  contribution to the safety of Kentuckians and to families throughout  the region.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize an  outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Three Boys Farm Distillery in Graefenburg, KY, as the Senate Small  Business of the Week.   In 2011, Ross and Heather Caldwell moved their family from Colorado  to Kentucky, and quickly pursued their dream of opening a distillery.  Before moving to Kentucky, Ross and Heather purchased a 122-acre farm  providing them a space to open a distillery, and have remaining land to  graze cattle and grow corn for use in their single barrel bourbon and  whiskey. Like many small business owners, the journey to open their  business was no easy task, as Ross and Heather navigated redtape and  burdensome regulations before getting their business off the ground.  After many hurdles, Three Boys Farm Distillery opened its doors in  2013, named in tribute to the Caldwells' triplets: Patrick, Andrew, and  Ethan. Over the years, family has remained the foundation of this small  business with Ross serving as master distiller, but growth has led to  hiring nine additional employees, including another master distiller.   Today, Three Boys Farm Distillery is renowned for its bourbon and rye  whiskey. Their products are sold throughout the United States and have  drawn praise nationwide. The distillery's bourbon and whiskey tastings  are a hit among Kentuckians and tour groups alike, drawing visitors  from around the United States and abroad. Uniquely, Three Boys Farm  Distillery allows guests to sample and bottle their own whiskey and  bourbon straight from the barrel. Over the years, Three Boys Farm  Distillery has also become a popular event venue for weddings and  family reunions. Additionally, the distillery supports other local  artisans and small businesses by selling their goods at the  distillery's on-site gift shop.   Like many small businesses, Three Boys Farm Distillery was faced with  challenges caused by the coronavirus pandemic but overcame them by  adapting their business model throughout the ever-changing government  regulations. The distillery expanded their shipping operations to  provide long-time consumers access to their products and relied on the  recommendations from their loyal customers to grow their customer base  when distillery tours and tastings were prohibited. Furthermore, Three  Boys Farm  [[Page S5174]]  Distillery expanded its bottling operations to assist outside companies  bottle and label their products for sale. While expanding the  distillery's operations helped Three Boys Farm Distillery stay afloat  during the pandemic, longtime friend of the Caldwells, Walter Zausch, a  University of Kentucky alum, provided additional assistance by  investing in the business and becoming a majority owner. Rebounding  from the pandemic, this summer, Three Boys Farm Distillery began  hosting live concerts featuring local artists and continues to provide  Kentuckians with a place to relax, build community, and enjoy a glass  of bourbon with friends.   Three Boys Farm Distillery is a remarkable example of the resilience  and adaptability of locally owned small businesses. Small businesses,  like Three Boys Farm Distillery, form the heart of towns across  Kentucky and play a critical role in Kentucky's bourbon and whiskey  industry. Congratulations to Ross, Heather, Walter, and the entire team  at Three Boys Farm Distillery. I wish them the best of luck, and I look  forward to watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
