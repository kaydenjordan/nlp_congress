 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I would like to begin today by  welcoming our newest colleague, Senator Laphonza Butler of California.   As the Senate continues to mourn our late friend and colleague Dianne  Feinstein, I know the people of California are grateful for Senator  Butler's willingness to serve. And I know our colleagues join me in  welcoming her.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on another matter, last week, the  Senate voted to prevent a domestic budget dispute from shutting down  the Federal Government. Now, with straightforward, short-term funding  in place, it is time for Congress to redouble our efforts on a number  of unfinished priorities.   In the coming weeks, the Senate needs to continue making progress on  full-year appropriations. And we will begin by funding important  resources for military construction, veterans services, agriculture,  housing, and transportation infrastructure.   But our work does not stop there. The Senate also needs to address  urgent supplemental funding needs and continue our work to bring the  Biden administration's reckless spending and radical regulations to  heel.   Many of our colleagues are particularly keen to deliver additional  relief to communities rebuilding after devastating national disasters-- from hurricanes on the gulf coast to wildfires in Hawaii, to flooding  in Kentucky.   Bipartisan majorities in both Chambers continue to recognize that  providing additional lethal assistance to Ukraine's defense against  Russian aggression is in the United States' direct interest.   Across the country, as historic inflation continues to wreck  household budgets, millions of working families are ready to turn the  page on Bidenomics.   After three record-setting years of functionally open borders, folks  in every State are eager for Congress to force the Biden administration  to start cleaning up the southern border crisis. The fiscal year that  just ended saw apprehensions at the southern border exceed 2 million  for only the second time in history. The first time was just last year.  Some reports expect that the last month's total could clock in as the  highest on record. On President Biden's watch, illegal border crossings  and asylum claims have stretched Border Patrol and ICE personnel to  their breaking point.   Authorities are seizing hundreds of millions of lethal doses of  fentanyl, although they also estimate that they are apprehending just a  fraction--roughly a quarter--of all the fentanyl that is smuggled at  the border.   Frankly, this is less about providing border personnel with new  resources than it is about giving them the authority and direction to  actually enforce the law. It is certainly not about bailing out blue  State sanctuary cities while the tsunami of illegal immigration  continues unabated. It is about the administration finally taking  commonsense steps to end their wrongheaded policies that have  encouraged illegal immigrants to cross our borders in the first place.   Every State is now a border State. Major cities like New York and  Chicago are being overwhelmed by arrivals from the southern border.  Finally, even blue State mayors and Governors are joining the chorus  calling out the administration for its utter failure on border  security.   Of course, across the country, liberal local governments and innocent  residents are also facing the consequences of years of soft-on-crime  policies, and once again our Nation's Capital leads the headlines.   Just last night, for example, Congressman Henry Cuellar was the  victim of a violent carjacking a few blocks from the Capitol Building.  Armed assailants threatened him at gunpoint and stole his car.  Thankfully, our House colleague was not injured, and his car has been  recovered.  [[Page S4903]]    It is not even the first time this year that a Member of Congress has  been assaulted while in town for work. But this is what private  American citizens are facing every single day, like the 22,000 people  who had their car stolen in Chicago this year or the 20,000 victims of  felony assault in New York City. This sort of brazen violence against  anyone should be a wake-up call for local officials.   Last year, a 54-year-old man was murdered at a gas station in  Washington by a group of teenagers attempting to steal his car. The  city is now averaging two carjackings every day, and these crimes are  increasingly being committed by young people.   At a certain point, the American people who visit our Nation's  Capital by the millions every year might expect the city's liberal  government to finally start getting serious about securing the streets,  but even as senseless violence increases, local leaders are bent-- bent--on undermining public safety.   One member of the DC Council--the same soft-on-crime panel that tried  to weaken sentencing for repeat offenders earlier this year--proposed  recently that local courts be required to provide a written explanation  before releasing violent criminals before trial. The courts' response?  Such a requirement was ``not feasible'' because it would  ``significantly increase'' their workload. All this in a city where  prosecutors declined to even prosecute two-thirds of the arrests last  year.   American families deserve to feel safe in their homes and in their  neighborhoods and certainly in the Nation's Capital. It shouldn't take  another assault or carjacking or homicide to convince leftwing local  leaders to start actually doing their jobs.
