 Madam Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the career  of Dr. Betsy Oudenhoven, president of the Community College of Aurora,  and congratulate her on her upcoming retirement.   Dr. Oudenhoven joined CCA in 2011, as the vice president for student  affairs. She possessed an extensive leadership background, serving  students at institutions in Wisconsin, Minnesota, New York, and  Illinois.   CCA recognized her commitment and exceptional service when they  appointed her president in December 2013.   In her time at CCA, Dr. Oudenhoven is recognized for advancing the  institution's commitment to diversity and inclusion, prioritizing  equity, and supporting student success.   During her tenure, CCA also reaffirmed its role in the community by  expanding enrollment in high school equivalency and English as a second  language programs.   Dr. Oudenhoven faithfully served students across the country for 42  years and helped transform CCA over the last decade.   I congratulate Dr. Betsy Oudenhoven on her retirement and thank her  for her commitment to our community.             Recognizing the Life and Legacy of Dr. Felix Gilbert     Madam Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the life  of Dr. Felix Gilbert following his passing on April 27 of this year,  2021.   Dr. Gilbert was a pastor, an Air Force veteran, a professor, a  mentor, a father, a brother, and a grandfather. He built his ministry,  Restoration Christian Fellowship, and the community development  corporation, Restoration Christian Ministries, in Aurora, with his  wife, Pastor Kotane Gilbert.   Through these organizations, Dr. Gilbert built collaborative  partnerships with members of the community to meet their needs where  they live, learn, work, play thrive, and worship.   These efforts include establishing Restoration Christian Academy and  working with the Food Bank of the Rockies and the city of Aurora to  feed hundreds of families per month.   During the pandemic, Dr. Gilbert devoted his time to public health  and housing. He worked with the city of Aurora and UC-Health on testing  and vaccination efforts, and with Interfaith Alliance of Colorado and  other local agencies to support his ministry's Affordable Housing and  Unhoused Residents Village Initiatives.   Dr. Gilbert was an inspiration to his community and worked to mentor  local pastors. To honor his legacy, may we strive to build people up  and love them just as they are.                Congratulating Deputy City Manager Nancy Freed     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Deputy City  Manager Nancy Freed and congratulate her on her retirement following 28  years of service to the city of Aurora.   During Nancy's career, she oversaw nearly every department in the  city. Nancy's impact can be felt across every part of Aurora, as she  was integral in the planning, construction, and operation of many  community services across the municipality, including libraries and  recreation centers.   Nancy saw Aurora through incredible challenges, through drought,  unprecedented population growth, and tragedy. She rose to each  occasion, creating the Prairie Waters Project, one of the country's  first reuse water projects; helping plan Colorado's light rail system,  including bringing the RTD's R Line to Aurora; and founding the Aurora  Strong Resilience Center and the 7/20 Memorial Garden project following  the 2012 Aurora Theater shooting.   In 2018, Nancy was named an Unsung Hero of Aurora by the Aurora  Chamber of Commerce.   A powerhouse of knowledge and creativity, I thank Nancy for her  dedicated service and leadership.                      Recognizing Arapahoe Rescue Patrol     Madam Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the  lifesaving work of the Arapahoe Rescue Patrol.   Formed in 1957, in Arapahoe County, Colorado, the search and rescue  operations by this team are managed by local high school students.  These students dedicate hundreds of hours to  [[Page H2822]]  field search and rescue training, wilderness survival, winter  operations, aircraft crash rescue, and more. They live their high  school career on call prepared to save lives.   When a person is lost in the Colorado mountains, the patrol's teenage  volunteers handle dispatch, patrolling, active search and rescue,  emergency medical care, and command of the operation.    In towns like Littleton, Englewood, and Aurora, they manage block  searches and neighborhood canvassing to find lost children and elderly  neighbors. Patrol members are also on scene for disasters like  blizzards, floods, chemical spills, and commercial plane crashes,  providing assistance to local police, fire, and the sheriff department.   I am proud to take a moment to honor the hundreds of young heroes who  served admirably in the Arapahoe Rescue Patrol over the last 60 years,  balancing their high school careers with the commitment to saving  lives. We owe a debt of gratitude to these dedicated, service-minded  young folks.                            ____________________
