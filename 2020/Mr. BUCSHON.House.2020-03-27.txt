 Mr. Speaker, these unprecedented times call for unity to  help Hoosiers and all Americans who are struggling medically and/or  financially through no fault of their own.   This relief package puts Americans first, with aid for families,  workers, small businesses, and companies that employ millions of  people.   There is assistance for healthcare providers who are on the front  lines, working tirelessly to save our friends, neighbors, and family  members from COVID-19, in addition to their usual duties.   I am proud to see that two provisions I have helped author are  included in this package. These bipartisan policies will ensure  patients have timely and affordable access to COVID-19 preventive care,  such as vaccines and testing, and make clear that doctors who provide  volunteer medical services during this public health emergency have  liability protections.   I have spent the past week talking to hospitals in Indiana. It could  not be clearer that they need our help, just as we need their help, to  defeat the virus and to keep our loved ones safe.   I urge my colleagues to support this package so we can provide the  relief Americans desperately need.
