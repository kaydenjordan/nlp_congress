 Mr. Speaker, at this time in our Nation, protecting our  local law  [[Page H4241]]  enforcement and first responders could not be more important. Tens of  thousands of law enforcement and first responders around the country  put their lives on the line every single day to serve their  communities. Sadly, statistics show that simply doing their jobs has  become very dangerous for these individuals.   In 2016, police officer shootings increased by 56 percent nationally,  with ambush-style killings of law enforcement officers increasing by a  staggering 167 percent. These dramatic numbers demonstrate that more  protection is needed for our law enforcement officers.   In my home State of Texas, 17 law enforcement officers gave their  lives just last year, including five who were killed in the horrible  assault that targeted police officers in Dallas, Texas. On Monday, in  recognition of National Police Week, we honored fallen law enforcement  officers at a memorial ceremony in Deer Park, Texas, in my district.   We need the Thin Blue Line Act, which would make the killing of a  local or State law enforcement officer or first responder an  aggravating factor in Federal death penalty determinations. It is  important that our local and State police officers and first responders  have the same safeguards that Federal law enforcement officers already  have.   The local law enforcement and first responders that I know in my  district not only serve their communities through their jobs but also  give back to their communities in positions such as Little League  coaches, City Council members, Sunday-school teachers, and in countless  other positions of service. These individuals put their communities  first, Mr. Speaker, and they deserve to be protected by much stronger  laws.   I rise in strong support of the Thin Blue Line Act and encourage my  colleagues in the House to support its passage today.
