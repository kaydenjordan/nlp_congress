 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   (The remarks of Mr. Merkley pertaining to the introduction of S. 987  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.'')    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   (The remarks of Mr. Merkley pertaining to the introduction of S. 987  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.'')    I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, today I rise to address the important  urgency of addressing climate change. Across the country, we are seeing  the impacts of the warmer climate, and it is having devastating  consequences on our forests, on our farming, on our fishing, and on our  urban populations.   Years ago, people talked about what we might see if we continued to  burn fossil fuels and continued to put carbon dioxide into the air, but  no longer do we have to talk about what we might see, because it is  here. The facts are on the ground right now.   We can look at my home State of Oregon. In Oregon, we have the  challenge of forest fire seasons that are longer by several months than  they were just decades ago. We have the challenge of warmer winters,  resulting in pine beetles doing more damage to our trees. The fact that  we have lower snowpacks in the Cascade Mountains means warmer trout  streams and less water for irrigation. We have had the worst-ever  droughts in the Klamath Basin in the past 15 years. Over on the coast,  we have a big impact on oysters. Because we have burned so much in  fossil fuels to create so much carbon dioxide that has been absorbed by  the oceans and turned into carbonic acid, the oceans have acidified.  They are 30 percent more acidic than they were 150 years ago, meaning  our oysters are having trouble reaching out and pulling the molecules  out of the water to form a shell. In fact, it takes so much energy to  do so that they are dying.   That is what is happening. That is just in Oregon. We can look across  the United States and see impact after impact.   If we were in Minnesota, we could talk about the tick populations  that are killing the moose because it is not cold enough in the winter  to kill the ticks. If we are in Maine, we can talk about the fact that  the lobsters are migrating to Canada because that is where the colder  waters can be found. If we are in Florida, we can talk about sunny day  floods, because the ocean levels have risen and the ocean water--the  saltwater--is contaminating the freshwater that cities depend on. If we  are up the Atlantic coast, we can talk about Hurricane Sandy and how  its devastating power was enhanced by an ocean that is much warmer than  it was decades ago. If we are in Texas, we can talk about the spread of  mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus affecting folks. So the list goes  on and on. But it is not just in the United States of America. It is on  the entire planet.   As we are talking about oysters on the west coast of the United  States, across the globe folks are talking about coral reefs. The Great  Barrier Reef has virtually died over the last few years. Scientists say  80 percent of the Great Barrier Reef off Australia has died in the last  3 years. If we are looking at the mountainous regions of the world, you  can trace the flow of glaciers and find that across the globe glaciers  have diminished by an enormous amount. Some say that if you  [[Page S2625]]  want to see a glacier in Glacier National Park, you better get there  soon. That is just in the United States.   If we turn north to the upper reaches of Canada and the permafrost,  you can visit what are called the drunken forests, because the  permafrost is melting and the trees are starting to lean in every which  direction. If you turn to Alaska, you are finding that Native  populations are having to relocate because of changing circumstances of  a warmer Alaska.   Go to the Arctic Ocean and what you see is a massive amount of  missing ice, and, because that ice is missing, the ocean is absorbing  more energy from the sun, and it is creating a feedback loop that is  having further devastating consequences. And so the list goes on and  on.   It is not just time to address climate change boldly. It is time to  address it aggressively. It is time for 100 by 50. What that means is  100 percent clean and renewable energy to power the economy by the year  2050 and the steps to get there in between and to have 50 percent of  our energy clean and renewable by the year 2030. That is not far away.  That is just 13 years away, and for 2050, add another 20 years.   We have to act quickly because right now human civilization is  failing the test. Our responsibility is to stop burning fossil fuels  and to stop putting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. That is why we  have to rapidly transition from an energy economy based on fossil fuels  to one based on clean and renewable energy.   Why do I say we are failing the test at the moment? We are failing  the test because if you look at the flow of carbon dioxide into the  atmosphere from human civilization, the rate of carbon dioxide  pollution has not leveled out. In fact, the speed of pollution and the  amount of pollution per year is increasing. So we have a tremendous  challenge ahead of us. We have to take and not only reduce the amount  but reduce it enormously in a short period of time.   Now some say this vision is too bold. Some say this vision is too  difficult, that it is too hard. It makes me think of President  Kennedy's call. He said decades ago:         We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do other       things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.       Because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept,       one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to       win.    I tell you today that we must, as a Nation, be willing to accept the  challenge of transforming our energy economy. We must be unwilling to  postpone tackling this challenge of transforming our energy economy,  and this challenge is one where we must be committed to winning. It is  not just time. It is way past time.   I came to the Senate floor last September to lay out the concept of  100 by 50--100 percent clean, renewable energy by 2050. I come today to  the Senate floor to say that today a group of Senators are introducing  a bill to lay out a roadmap to get there.   Just as President Kennedy laid out the vision of putting an American  on the moon, NASA went to work and laid out a plan on how we would get  there. They didn't know at first how it would be done. They hadn't  proceeded to invent the staged rocket that would enable someone to  escape the gravity of Earth in a fashion to get us to the moon. They  didn't know how to create a lunar landing operation to put people  safely on the planet surface. They weren't even sure of the composition  of the surface of the moon, but they figured it out. They put forward a  draft. They reworked that draft.   Today we are putting forth a roadmap. I thank my colleagues who are  standing with me today to be the original cosponsors: Senator Bernie  Sanders of Vermont, Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, and Senator  Cory Booker of New Jersey. I know other colleagues will join us as time  progresses, but it is important not to wait until we have, if you will,  a large population to begin the conversation--a large set of sponsors  to begin the conversation of laying out a roadmap. It is important to  lay it out now. It is important to lay it out now because it is a  statement of values. It is important to lay it out now so that there is  a vision that can be discussed--a detailed vision of how to take on  different sectors of the energy economy that can be discussed and  debated.   So we are focused not on whether to get to 100 by 50, but on how we  are going to get to 100 by 50. I invite and encourage that debate  because each of us can envision a roadmap that is slightly different.  So let's have that conversation, but let's not forget the importance of  getting to this destination--100 percent clean, renewable energy--and  getting thereby the year 2050.   Yes, it is audacious when you think about how we use energy today, to  think about how we can transform it in just a few decades, but we have  many of the tools we need right now. With focused research and  development, we can add the other tools that we need.   Let us not fail to accept this challenge, because our planet is  crying out in anguish. In addition to the facts on the ground that I  have been mentioning, we can simply take the temperature of the planet.  Month after month after month, year after year, in the past 2 years we  have been setting new records for having the hottest month--not the  hottest month in Washington, DC, not the hottest month in the United  States of America but the hottest March in the history of the planet,  the hottest April since we have been measuring the temperature of the  planet--May, June, and so on and so forth.   So the time for conversing about whether we have a problem is over.  Now is the time to say how we will achieve this vision.   One important element of achieving this vision is greening the grid.  That means that we need to phase out electricity that is generated by  fossil fuels. We need to invest in clean and renewable energy that puts  green electrons in the grid instead, and we need to advance and develop  the deployment of technologies that contribute to this, including high- voltage transmission lines that will move energy between different  parts of the United States. We certainly need to develop the ability to  store electricity and to use automated demand management and automated  supply management so we can match the supply of green energy to the  demand at different times of the day or just the demand of different  times of the day to make renewable energy fit to the operation of the  economy.   Now, we have some specific powerful gifts in this effort. One is that  we have a dramatically declining cost of solar energy. A second is that  we have a dramatically declining cost in wind energy. A third is that  we have a dramatically declining cost of battery storage. This isn't an  accident. This has happened because of the innovation economy where  these ideas were developed and promoted and researched and advanced  right here in the United States of America. But it really helps change  the conversation. There have been many who are deeply invested in the  fossil fuel world who would like to say that advancing to a clean and  renewable energy economy will hurt the economy. But now we are coming  to the point that it is less expensive to generate renewable energy  than to generate fossil fuel energy. The fact is that we can create a  tremendous number of jobs as we rebuild this energy economy.   If we turn specifically to the issue of a Federal emissions vehicle  standard--because that is one of the pieces of this puzzle--it means  that we have to make national investments in electrical recharging  stations along our roads and highways to support these vehicles. There  are already half a million plug-in electric vehicles on our roads  today, and these vehicles--these cars--are becoming cheaper as the  numbers continue to grow.   One of the factors that is enabling the car to become cheaper is the  dropping cost of lithium in the batteries that power them. They are  getting smaller, lighter, and cheaper. So in the same space you can put  more energy with less weight to drive cars further. Since 2008, the  cost of these batteries per kilowatt hour has fallen fourfold. They  will continuously grow. Having more of these cars on our roads and our  highways as the costs keep falling, it is vital that we have an  infrastructure in place to support them.   We need to ensure that everyone is part of this clean and renewable  energy resolution, including low-income and disadvantaged communities.  We addressed that in the 100 by 50 legislation. To do this, we  established grants  [[Page S2626]]  to bring affordable clean energy and energy efficiency to individuals'  homes and communities. We invest in zero emission public transportation  that is affordable and accessible. We also want to ensure that no  workers are left behind in this transformation, especially the workers  in the fossil fuel industry. That is why we need to provide a just  transition for those workers and job training programs. We need to have  a strategy to ensure that there are opportunities to move from jobs in  the fossil fuel world to positions in the clean and renewable energy  industry. Those industries are, in fact, booming, with jobs in solar  and wind growing 12 times faster than the rest of the U.S. economy.  Already, the number of clean and renewable industry jobs has surpassed  those in the fossil fuel industry by a margin of 5 to 1.    We want to enable everyone to have the skills they need to succeed in  these emerging industries, but to move to this future, we must come to  a point at which we stop investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure.  We cannot proceed to make this pivot quickly to a cleaner, brighter,  renewable future if we continue to tie ourselves and our government to  a fossil fuel-powered past. To achieve this clean break, the 100 by 50  Act ends future fossil fuel investments at the Federal level. That  would affect projects similar to the Keystone XL Pipeline and the  Dakota Access Pipeline, and we would end the tax subsidies for the  fossil fuel industry.   This burning of fossil fuels is destroying our planet. We must stop  subsidizing the destruction of our planet. This burning of fossil fuels  is destroying our forests, which our rural communities depend on. We  must stop subsidizing the destruction of our forests. The burning of  these fossil fuels is driving droughts, reducing irrigation water, and  hurting our farmers. We must quit subsidizing the destruction of  agriculture in America. The burning of fossil fuels is also impacting  our fishing--from warmer, smaller trout streams to a fishing industry  that depends on the critical ecosystem in the ocean. We must stop  subsidizing the destruction of our fishing industry.   It is also important to make sure that America remains a leader in  the energy economy and leads in the effort to make sure that we do not  have a disadvantage with regard to manufacturing in other countries.  What that means is that, with regard to countries that are not pursuing  this on the same aggressive level, we need to have an effort to drive  this transaction. We need to make sure that if there are additional  costs, those are offset with a border tax so that we do not encourage  the movement of production out of our economy here at home. We have  done so with trade policy--in a massively destructive way--to the  middle class of America. If we do not make things in America, we will  not have a middle class in America, and we need to make sure that we do  not do that in the transition of our energy economy.   To fund this plan, we propose a new source of revenue. When I say a  ``new source of revenue,'' that is a little misleading because we are  taking a cue from history, specifically World War II, and modeling  bonds--climate bonds--on the war bonds that helped fund our fight  against totalitarianism--to fund our fight against Germany and the  Soviet Union. Auctioning off climate bonds is a way to raise the funds  to drive the grants to power this transformation--to accelerate this  transformation--and make sure that we do not leave out disadvantaged  communities but, rather, bring them fully into this transition. The 100  by 50 Act is ambitious, but the circumstances require no less.   Furthermore, we cannot, simply, propose a Federal Government strategy  because we live in the United States of America, where important things  are done at many different levels. Here in this Chamber--right now in  the U.S. Senate--we do not have a committee chair who is going to say  that we need to have committee hearings in order to take on this issue.  We do not have a committee chair on the House side who is going to  drive this conversation. We do not have a President who understands the  damage that is being done to our forests and our fishing and our  farming and to our planet and who is going to lead the battle.   We have to turn to the wisdom of the American people. We have to turn  to the wisdom of the States and the wisdom of the counties and the  wisdom of the cities and the wisdom of individuals across America who  are willing to go to the leadership of their mosques or the leadership  of their temples or the leadership of their churches, who are willing  to go to the leadership of nonprofits that they are a part of, who are  willing to go to their city councils or their county commissions, who  are willing to go to their State legislators.   They are going to say that we need to have a 100 by 50 resolution for  our nonprofits, for our religious organizations, for our cities, for  our counties, for our States because we need to own this issue. We  Americans at every level need to own this issue. This is an issue that  depends upon citizens across the globe taking hold of this in a  powerful way that cannot be blocked by the dark money of the fossil  fuel industry.   In so doing, by passing that 100 by 50 resolution for the city or the  nonprofit or the church or the mosque or the synagogue or the temple,  we will also adopt an action plan that involves the specific steps that  local organizations are going to take over the next 2 to 3 years. This  year, maybe they are going to convert their hot water heaters to  electrons rather than burning natural gas. Maybe they are going to sign  up for green electrons from their local utilities, which is an option  that is offered in many places across America. The following year,  maybe they are going to invest in energy-saving retrofits of their  buildings. The year after that, maybe they are going to say that we  have to revamp our fleet of vehicles and start using rechargeable  vehicles, like the Volt or the Bolt or the LEAF or a whole set of cars  that has been appearing in the economy over the last few years. One can  charge them up and, thereby, run them off green electrons rather than  off fossil fuels.   These are things that can be owned and done. In fact, it is already  happening. It is happening with local organizations across this country  that are committing themselves to 100 percent clean and renewable  energy. More than 25 cities across the country have already adopted  this vision--from Madison, WI, to Abita Springs, LA; from San Diego,  CA, to Salt Lake City, UT; from Georgetown, TX, to Greensburg, KS-- cities that are working toward a 100 percent clean and renewable  future. There are 88 major businesses that are getting in on the action  as well--Walmart, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Nike, Coca-Cola,  General Motors, and Apple. These are only a few of the major companies  that have committed to powering themselves with 100 percent clean and  renewable energy.   What is driving this move toward clean and renewable energy? It is  that Americans everywhere are seeing the effects on the ground. They  are calling for action, and community leaders and business leaders are  responding. We need to respond here in the U.S. Senate. We should be  holding hearings on how to put this plan into action. We should be  taking the best ideas from the city actions and the business actions  and the nonprofit actions from across the country and from the ideas  generated on the right side of the aisle and the left side of the aisle  because the destruction we face--the threat we face--is not a blue  issue or a red issue; it is a human civilization issue.   America has been a driver of the technology that can transform our  economy and also the technology that we can sell to the world. In  adopting this vision and in fighting for this vision, America can be a  leader with other nations around the world. It has been beyond strange  to have other countries lecture us over the last few months to maintain  our commitment as a Federal Government to this vision. Other countries  are saying: America, you have to be part of the solution. You have  benefited enormously from the burning of fossil fuels, perhaps more  than any other economy in the world. You have one of the highest per  capita footprints for carbon. You must be part of this effort because  every country in the world is affected.   More than 40 countries have now adopted the vision of clean and  renewable energy, so there is no time for America to step out and not  be part of the solution, not be part of the leadership, not be part of  the driving force, not benefit from being on the cutting edge of this  transformation of the energy economy.  [[Page S2627]]    Just as President Kennedy laid out the vision for going to the Moon,  Americans from every walk are coming together to lay out the vision for  a 100 percent clean and renewable energy economy. They are adopting a  framework--a time, a goal--as to where we are going and when we are  getting there; 100 by 50 sums it up.   After President Kennedy laid out the vision, America went to work to  make it happen, and we landed American citizens on the Moon. Now it is  time for all of America to get to work and implement this vision and  ensure that we succeed in transforming our energy economy within the  next few decades by taking important steps every single year--driving  ourselves forward, understanding the urgency, applying the technology,  accelerating the implementation--to achieve 100 percent clean and  renewable energy by 2050.   If there were an asteroid coming toward the Earth, we would not be  talking politics or political advantage. We would all be working  together to take it on--destroy it before it destroyed us. We have the  equivalent of an asteroid that is coming at the Earth in global  warming. The time to play politics has passed. The time to play  partisanship has passed. It is time for every citizen and every  organization at every level--every chair representing every Senator  from every State in the Union--to come together to take on this  challenge together.   I call upon my fellow Senators to be part of, perhaps, the most  important effort we have to solve the biggest challenge to the health  of America and the health of the planet--global warming. Step forward  and be part of the effort.   Thank you, Mr. President.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I rise to address the important  urgency of addressing climate change.

We need to ensure that everyone is part of this clean and renewable  energy resolution, including low-income and disadvantaged communities.  We addressed that in the 100 by 50 legislation. To do this, we  established grants  [[Page S2626]]  to bring affordable clean energy and energy efficiency to individuals'  homes and communities. We invest in zero emission public transportation  that is affordable and accessible. We also want to ensure that no  workers are left behind in this transformation, especially the workers  in the fossil fuel industry. That is why we need to provide a just  transition for those workers and job training programs. We need to have  a strategy to ensure that there are opportunities to move from jobs in  the fossil fuel world to positions in the clean and renewable energy  industry. Those industries are, in fact, booming, with jobs in solar  and wind growing 12 times faster than the rest of the U.S. economy.  Already, the number of clean and renewable industry jobs has surpassed  those in the fossil fuel industry by a margin of 5 to 1.    We want to enable everyone to have the skills they need to succeed in  these emerging industries, but to move to this future, we must come to  a point at which we stop investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure.  We cannot proceed to make this pivot quickly to a cleaner, brighter,  renewable future if we continue to tie ourselves and our government to  a fossil fuel-powered past. To achieve this clean break, the 100 by 50  Act ends future fossil fuel investments at the Federal level. That  would affect projects similar to the Keystone XL Pipeline and the  Dakota Access Pipeline, and we would end the tax subsidies for the  fossil fuel industry.   This burning of fossil fuels is destroying our planet. We must stop  subsidizing the destruction of our planet. This burning of fossil fuels  is destroying our forests, which our rural communities depend on. We  must stop subsidizing the destruction of our forests. The burning of  these fossil fuels is driving droughts, reducing irrigation water, and  hurting our farmers. We must quit subsidizing the destruction of  agriculture in America. The burning of fossil fuels is also impacting  our fishing--from warmer, smaller trout streams to a fishing industry  that depends on the critical ecosystem in the ocean. We must stop  subsidizing the destruction of our fishing industry.   It is also important to make sure that America remains a leader in  the energy economy and leads in the effort to make sure that we do not  have a disadvantage with regard to manufacturing in other countries.  What that means is that, with regard to countries that are not pursuing  this on the same aggressive level, we need to have an effort to drive  this transaction. We need to make sure that if there are additional  costs, those are offset with a border tax so that we do not encourage  the movement of production out of our economy here at home. We have  done so with trade policy--in a massively destructive way--to the  middle class of America. If we do not make things in America, we will  not have a middle class in America, and we need to make sure that we do  not do that in the transition of our energy economy.   To fund this plan, we propose a new source of revenue. When I say a  ``new source of revenue,'' that is a little misleading because we are  taking a cue from history, specifically World War II, and modeling  bonds--climate bonds--on the war bonds that helped fund our fight  against totalitarianism--to fund our fight against Germany and the  Soviet Union. Auctioning off climate bonds is a way to raise the funds  to drive the grants to power this transformation--to accelerate this  transformation--and make sure that we do not leave out disadvantaged  communities but, rather, bring them fully into this transition. The 100  by 50 Act is ambitious, but the circumstances require no less.   Furthermore, we cannot, simply, propose a Federal Government strategy  because we live in the United States of America, where important things  are done at many different levels. Here in this Chamber--right now in  the U.S. Senate--we do not have a committee chair who is going to say  that we need to have committee hearings in order to take on this issue.  We do not have a committee chair on the House side who is going to  drive this conversation. We do not have a President who understands the  damage that is being done to our forests and our fishing and our  farming and to our planet and who is going to lead the battle.   We have to turn to the wisdom of the American people. We have to turn  to the wisdom of the States and the wisdom of the counties and the  wisdom of the cities and the wisdom of individuals across America who  are willing to go to the leadership of their mosques or the leadership  of their temples or the leadership of their churches, who are willing  to go to the leadership of nonprofits that they are a part of, who are  willing to go to their city councils or their county commissions, who  are willing to go to their State legislators.   They are going to say that we need to have a 100 by 50 resolution for  our nonprofits, for our religious organizations, for our cities, for  our counties, for our States because we need to own this issue. We  Americans at every level need to own this issue. This is an issue that  depends upon citizens across the globe taking hold of this in a  powerful way that cannot be blocked by the dark money of the fossil  fuel industry.   In so doing, by passing that 100 by 50 resolution for the city or the  nonprofit or the church or the mosque or the synagogue or the temple,  we will also adopt an action plan that involves the specific steps that  local organizations are going to take over the next 2 to 3 years. This  year, maybe they are going to convert their hot water heaters to  electrons rather than burning natural gas. Maybe they are going to sign  up for green electrons from their local utilities, which is an option  that is offered in many places across America. The following year,  maybe they are going to invest in energy-saving retrofits of their  buildings. The year after that, maybe they are going to say that we  have to revamp our fleet of vehicles and start using rechargeable  vehicles, like the Volt or the Bolt or the LEAF or a whole set of cars  that has been appearing in the economy over the last few years. One can  charge them up and, thereby, run them off green electrons rather than  off fossil fuels.   These are things that can be owned and done. In fact, it is already  happening. It is happening with local organizations across this country  that are committing themselves to 100 percent clean and renewable  energy. More than 25 cities across the country have already adopted  this vision--from Madison, WI, to Abita Springs, LA; from San Diego,  CA, to Salt Lake City, UT; from Georgetown, TX, to Greensburg, KS-- cities that are working toward a 100 percent clean and renewable  future. There are 88 major businesses that are getting in on the action  as well--Walmart, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Nike, Coca-Cola,  General Motors, and Apple. These are only a few of the major companies  that have committed to powering themselves with 100 percent clean and  renewable energy.   What is driving this move toward clean and renewable energy? It is  that Americans everywhere are seeing the effects on the ground. They  are calling for action, and community leaders and business leaders are  responding. We need to respond here in the U.S. Senate. We should be  holding hearings on how to put this plan into action. We should be  taking the best ideas from the city actions and the business actions  and the nonprofit actions from across the country and from the ideas  generated on the right side of the aisle and the left side of the aisle  because the destruction we face--the threat we face--is not a blue  issue or a red issue; it is a human civilization issue.   America has been a driver of the technology that can transform our  economy and also the technology that we can sell to the world. In  adopting this vision and in fighting for this vision, America can be a  leader with other nations around the world. It has been beyond strange  to have other countries lecture us over the last few months to maintain  our commitment as a Federal Government to this vision. Other countries  are saying: America, you have to be part of the solution. You have  benefited enormously from the burning of fossil fuels, perhaps more  than any other economy in the world. You have one of the highest per  capita footprints for carbon. You must be part of this effort because  every country in the world is affected.   More than 40 countries have now adopted the vision of clean and  renewable energy, so there is no time for America to step out and not  be part of the solution, not be part of the leadership, not be part of  the driving force, not benefit from being on the cutting edge of this  transformation of the energy economy.  [[Page S2627]]    Just as President Kennedy laid out the vision for going to the Moon,  Americans from every walk are coming together to lay out the vision for  a 100 percent clean and renewable energy economy. They are adopting a  framework--a time, a goal--as to where we are going and when we are  getting there; 100 by 50 sums it up.   After President Kennedy laid out the vision, America went to work to  make it happen, and we landed American citizens on the Moon. Now it is  time for all of America to get to work and implement this vision and  ensure that we succeed in transforming our energy economy within the  next few decades by taking important steps every single year--driving  ourselves forward, understanding the urgency, applying the technology,  accelerating the implementation--to achieve 100 percent clean and  renewable energy by 2050.   If there were an asteroid coming toward the Earth, we would not be  talking politics or political advantage. We would all be working  together to take it on--destroy it before it destroyed us. We have the  equivalent of an asteroid that is coming at the Earth in global  warming. The time to play politics has passed. The time to play  partisanship has passed. It is time for every citizen and every  organization at every level--every chair representing every Senator  from every State in the Union--to come together to take on this  challenge together.   I call upon my fellow Senators to be part of, perhaps, the most  important effort we have to solve the biggest challenge to the health  of America and the health of the planet--global warming. Step forward  and be part of the effort.   Thank you, Mr. President.                            ____________________
