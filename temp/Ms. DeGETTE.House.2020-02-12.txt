 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to insert extraneous material on H.R. 2546.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased today to rise in support of H.R. 2546, the  Protecting America's Wilderness Act.   As a fourth-generation Coloradan, I know how important our public  lands are to the people of my State and to millions of Americans across  the West.  [[Page H1059]]    Wilderness areas provide us a glimpse of what our world looked like  before it was taken over by man. They are some of the most pristine and  majestic areas on the planet.   For many of us, the access that we have to these lands is a large  part of why we are so proud to call our Western States home and why so  many others come to visit us each year.   While we may be the stewards of some of these lands, our Nation's  public lands belong to everyone. We, as Members of Congress, should be  doing everything we can to protect them.   The bill before us today would permanently protect nearly 1.4 million  acres of land across three States. It is one of the largest wilderness  protection packages Congress has considered in over a decade, and it is  the largest Congress has considered for Colorado in a generation.   The areas that this bill will protect include some of the most unique  and irreplaceable landscapes that our Nation has to offer, from the  winding canyons of Colorado to the native grasslands of California and  to the mossy forests of Washington State.   The designations in this bill will do more than protect the land  itself. They will help protect the air we breathe and the water we  drink. They will help protect wildlife and some of our favorite, world- class recreation areas. They will provide a boost to the nearby  economies and help grow our Nation's multibillion-dollar outdoor  recreation industry that directly supports thousands of jobs across the  U.S.   Perhaps most importantly, in preserving these lands, the bill will do  what we need to do to further fulfill the House's commitment to takes  steps to combat the climate crisis.   Preserving more of our public lands is one of the best short-term  solutions that we, as a Nation, can take to respond to this crisis.  Experts agree that we must strive to protect 30 percent of our public  lands by 2030 to protect our planet.   The Protecting America's Wilderness Act combines six bills, each  introduced by a different Member of Congress.   Title I of the bill consists of my legislation, the Colorado  Wilderness Act, which will permanently protect more than 600,000 acres  of wilderness in over 32 unique areas.   For more than 20 years now, I have been working closely with a group  of citizens from my State, as well as countless local residents and  community leaders, to craft and recraft the legislation we have before  us today. I personally have been to most of the areas in my bill, by  foot, by horse, and by raft, to experience the areas for myself. I have  met with landowners and ranchers across my State to get their feedback  and, when necessary, to adjust the bill to address their concerns.    It includes areas like the dramatic ridgeline vistas of Grand Hogback  and the sprawling plateaus of Little Book Cliffs, areas like the  stunning red cliffs of the Dolores River Canyon that we see here in  this poster and the winding riverways of Browns Canyon, areas like the  desert slopes of Cross Canyon and the highest peaks of the San Juan  Mountains, places that have been untouched by man.   These are just some of the more than 1.3 million acres of wilderness  this bill will protect. It will also add more than 1,000 river miles to  the National Wild and Scenic River System and would expand or designate  new recreation areas, national monuments, scenic and special management  areas, restoration areas, and trails.   Mr. Chair, I can't thank my colleagues enough for the work that they  have done to make this bill a reality, especially Representatives  Huffman, Carbajal, Chu, Schiff, and Kilmer. I know each one of them is  going to have more to say about their individual titles in this bill,  but before I yield to them, I quickly want to address my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle.   I recognize that we have ideological differences about protecting our  public lands through designations such as these, but I want to  encourage them to consider the importance of protecting not only our  Nation's environment but also our economy and our way of life.   Mr. Chair, I urge them to consider our tireless and ongoing efforts  to ensure that this bill will not just protect public lands, but also  make a real boost to our economy.   Wilderness is, at its heart, about providing our fellow Americans  with truly wild places to escape. If we don't take steps right now to  protect those magical places, then one day, they will no longer exist.   A famous conservationist once said: ``What a country chooses to save  is what a country chooses to say about itself.''   These areas are without a doubt deserving of the highest protections  we can give them and passing them on to the next generation in the same  state they are in today has always been one of our top priorities.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Huffman).    Madam Chair, I yield the gentleman from California an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Carbajal).    Mr. Chair, I would point out to my close friend from  Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) that there are no multiple use areas in the  Colorado Wilderness Act. Two-thirds of the areas are already wilderness  study areas and being converted, and the rest have no motorized use or  mining or drilling of any kind. So the bill has no conversion of  multiple use areas.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Napolitano).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff).    Mr. Chairman, I am delighted to yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), chairman of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I would just point out to the gentleman  that when we did the last land package none of these bills had been  brought up for a hearing by the then-majority, so the gentleman would  not have been too happy to have included them in that package.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Neguse).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Brownley).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  the State of Washington (Mr. Kilmer).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.  [[Page H1066]]    Mr. Chairman, wilderness is not owned by me, it is not owned by any  Member on the other side of the aisle, and it is not owned by any  Members of Congress. It is owned by the people. It is owned by the  people of this country and future generations of this country. That is  why we are the stewards of this wilderness.   These are Federal lands, and I have heard some of my colleagues on  the other side in this debate say: Well, some county commissioner  doesn't support it; some Member doesn't support it.   It doesn't matter. These Federal lands belong to the public. In fact,  last October in Colorado there was a poll done of the areas that are  impacted in my portion of the wilderness bill. This poll found that 71  percent of the people in the affected areas--the citizens, the people  who use this land for economic development and recreation--believe that  these wilderness study areas should be made permanent and that they  should be made into wilderness. That is whom I believe.   I want to tell you one more story, Mr. Chairman, and that is the  story about in August when I went down to Cortez, Colorado, near three  of the wilderness areas in my bill. One of the county commissioners,  Mr. Ertel, testified in Congress that he represents that area.    Do you know something?   In Cortez, Colorado, the city council and the mayor support the bill.  At a townhall meeting I had, there were 75 people. Sixty-five of them  raised their hands when I asked if they supported the bill. That is who  supports this bill, that is who this is for, and that is whom we need  to think about and listen to as we pass this legislation.   The areas in this bill all have strong wilderness characteristics,  and we owe it to our children, to our grandchildren, and to our great- grandchildren to take bold action right now and preserve them.   I just want to take a minute and thank everybody who has been  involved with this bill: obviously, the chairman of the committee, Mr.  Grijalva, his staff, Chris Rackens, Brandon Bragato, Henry Wykowski,  Cameron Walkup, and Lily Wang; and my staff who have worked on this  bill for over 20 years now, Lisa Cohen, my Chief of Staff; Kaila Hood,  Matt Allen, Tom Woodburn, and Marc Rehmann, all of whom have worked  their guts out for this, as well as many other staffers past and  present.   Finally, I want to thank the citizens who brought this bill to me to  begin with and who continue to work their hearts out every day to  preserve our wild places; in particular, John Stansfield of Wild  Connections who can't be with us today, and Mark Pearson of San Juan  Wilderness--who the last time I saw him, he was sitting on a cliff high  up in one of my wilderness areas and is now sitting in the gallery  watching us pass this historic legislation.   It truly is a labor of love, and I look forward to telling my  grandchildren about this historic day.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the amendment I offer today adds four  additional unique wilderness areas to the State of Colorado, totaling  more than 60,000 acres to our bill, the Protecting America's Wilderness  Act.   The addition of these areas stems from extensive conversations I had  with local stakeholders, Tribes, and outdoor recreation groups.   The first one is Diamond Breaks, a wilderness study area in northwest  Colorado that is attached to our State's beloved Dinosaur National  Monument. This area was recommended for wilderness designation by the  Bureau of Land Management under George H.W. Bush. It is a favorite  among the many rafters, kayakers, and canoers who visit the national  monument every year, and preserving it has been a priority for many  conservation groups in my State.   Protecting this land will help provide economic security for an area  of the State that depends heavily on our outdoor recreation economy.   The amendment also further protects Papoose Canyon, another  wilderness study area in southwest Colorado, near Cross Canyon, which  is the area I mentioned that I visited last August.   Papoose Canyon has been a wilderness study area since 1980. It lies  within the Canyon of the Ancients National Monument and, with an  estimated 100 ancestral Puebloan sites per square mile, has significant  cultural value. By officially designating this area as federally  protected wilderness, we will permanently preserve this sacred land for  generations to come.   Finally, Mr. Chairman, this amendment protects north and south  Ponderosa Gorge, which is often referred to as the Southwest Secret of  Colorado. According to the Bureau of Land Management, nearly 13,000  visitors come to this region every month during its peak season. It is  a favorite among those looking to launch their nonmotorized boats on  the Dolores River or backpack into the Chemehuevi Mountains. Protecting  this land has also been a priority for conservationists in Colorado for  decades.   While each of these areas that would be protected under this  amendment is unique, they are some of the most incredible wilderness  that our State has to offer. Countless Coloradans, when they found that  this bill was coming forward, came and asked me to include these three  unique areas in the legislation.   Mr. Chair, I hope my colleagues will honor their request and accept  this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter from a coalition of  groups--the San Juan Citizens Alliance, the Sierra Club, the Sheep  Mountain Alliance, the Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship, and  the Western Colorado Alliance--urging me to include these areas in the  bill.                                                   February 4, 2020.      Hon. Diana DeGette,      Washington, DC.        Dear Rep. DeGette: Thank you for the opportunity to provide       feedback on the Colorado Wilderness Act, HR 2546. We       appreciate your relentless leadership in pursuit of       protecting Colorado's BLM wild lands.        It's worth recalling that your original proposal first       introduced in 1999 encompassed 49 areas and almost 1.4       million acres, and was the result of field work completed by       conservationists over the prior 20 years. The Colorado       Wilderness Act has evolved over time, and most recently       includes about 30 areas with a little over 600,000 acres.        There are several areas we wanted to highlight as HR 2546       moves towards consideration by the House of Representatives.       One area consistently included in every version of the bill       since 1999 is Snaggletooth, an area that encompasses the       spectacular ponderosa gorge of the Dolores River Canyon.       Snaggletooth was removed from the bill during consideration       by the House Natural Resources Committee, but we believe that       with some modest boundary adjustments and clarifications       about nearby rights-of-way corridors that Snaggletooth can be       reincorporated into the legislation. It is without  [[Page H1090]]       doubt one of the BLM's crown jewels in Colorado.        Papoose Canyon is one of three wilderness study areas in       Canyons of the Ancients National Monument. It was included in       the Colorado Wilderness Act through 2007, but then       inexplicably omitted from subsequent bills. Papoose is       adjacent to Cross Canyon, and provides added protection for       some of the richest cultural resource concentrations in the       Southwest. Like Cross Canyon, it is outside the McElmo Dome       carbon dioxide reserves and is unlikely to provide any       conflict with energy minerals. We encourage your inclusion of       Papoose Canyon WSA in the Colorado Wilderness Act as the       other WSAs in Canyons of the Ancients National Monument are       already in the bill.        While we might hope that National Monument designation       provided a level of conservation certainty, in the past few       years we have observed that an Administration hostile to the       Antiquities Act could well pursue actions to undermine or       eliminate the National Monument status of Canyons of the       Ancients. Wilderness designation is a congressional action       that cannot be overturned at the whim of the executive branch       and is the tried and true approach to guaranteeing the       wildlands resources, wildlife habitat, and undisturbed       cultural resources of Papoose Canyon will be preserved into       the future.        In 2009, you deferred to an effort by BLM to undertake re-      evaluation of wilderness candidate areas in northwest       Colorado, including a number of areas surrounding Dinosaur       National Monument that BLM had long recognized for their       wilderness values, and removed those areas from the Colorado       Wilderness Act. Unfortunately, once BLM's unsuccessful       wilderness re-inventory concluded, these areas from northwest       Colorado that had previously been included within every       version of the Colorado Wilderness Act from 1999 through 2007       were not reincorporated into the legislation. We encourage       you to revisit the status of these areas and consider adding       them back into the Colorado Wilderness Act. These include one       of the largest Wilderness Study Areas in Colorado, Diamond       Breaks, which is bounded both by Dinosaur National Monument       and Browns Park National Wildlife Refuge. Additional       wilderness quality lands surround Dinosaur National Monument,       and include the stunning Yampa River gorge through Cross       Mountain, sandstone canyons across the southern approaches to       the Monument, and extraordinary wildlife habitat on Cold       Spring Mountain.        Diamond Breaks straddles the Colorado-Utah border. For many       years, America's Red Rock Wilderness legislation has been       pending that includes the Utah portion of Diamond Breaks.       Most recently, America's Red Rock Wilderness Act was       reintroduced with 16 cosponsors in the Senate, S. 3056, that       once again includes wilderness designation for the Utah       portion of Diamond Breaks. In 2017, a companion House bill       was introduced, HR 2044, cosponsored by 123 members of the       House and similarly included wilderness designation for       Diamond Breaks in Utah. Pairing Colorado legislation that       completes designation for the Colorado portion of Diamond       Breaks makes obvious sense.        We are hopeful the Colorado Wilderness Act, HR 2546 will be       favorably approved by the House. We look forward to working       with your office and Senate colleagues to further refine the       Colorado Wilderness Act and see it successfully enacted into       law.            Respectfully yours,      Mark Pearson,        Executive Director, San Juan Citizens Alliance.      Jim Alexee,        Colorado Chapter Director, Sierra Club.      Lexi Tuddenham,        Executive Director, Sheep Mountain Alliance.      Steve Bonowski,        Colorado-based Board member, Conservatives for Responsible       Stewardship.      Emily Hornback,        Executive Director, Western Colorado Alliance.     Mr. Chair, these areas have all been protected for  years. Two of them have already been wilderness study areas, and as I  mentioned, they are in the area of the State where there is widespread  public support and where they also are great economic drivers. They are  appropriately contained in this bill.   As I said, when these groups found out that this bill was moving  along, they urged me to include these really important historical and  recreational areas in the bill.   Mr. Chair, one last thing: I forgot to thank Steve Bonowski, who is  with Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship. He has been a real  partner with us throughout, making the conservative argument of why we  need to protect wilderness.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I am so glad the author of this amendment has  asked us to listen to the people who this affects because we have.   That is why we found out that 71 percent of the people in the  affected areas, the citizens, support this legislation.   That is why when I went to Cortez, Colorado, and had a townhall and  there were 75 people there, 65 of them said they were in support of the  wilderness areas.   We shouldn't allow one or two local elected officials, or even  Members of Congress, to have veto power over preservation of Federal  lands for future generations.   If this amendment were adopted and the bill enacted, local  governments would be able to indefinitely delay a Federal land  designation approved by the House, the Senate, and signed into law by  the President.   Wilderness designation, which is the highest level of protection that  we bestow, is solely at the discretion of Congress and has been so  since the original Wilderness Act. It is intended to provide permanent  protection for exceptional landscapes, and it is a key tool for  preserving undisturbed lands.   So what are we going to do? Are we going to be at the whim of local  elections to decide who should support it? And who decides? Why do the  county commissioners get veto power? What about the mayors and city  councils?   While the Montezuma County commissioners may oppose the designation  of the wilderness study areas, the Cortez City Council and the mayor  support it.    That is why we have to hear what the people have to say. No  individual elected official, from a commissioner to a Member of  Congress, should have the ability to unilaterally veto these things.   All the areas included in all the titles of this bill are the result  of multiyear collaborative efforts between bill sponsors and  stakeholders on the ground.   We have to remember that these lands are publicly owned. They are not  privately owned. They belong to every American and future generations.   Frankly, I think that, as Members of Congress, we have the  responsibility to listen to our constituents and to listen to the  people of the United States, and the people of the United States want  to preserve the very few special remaining wild places that we have.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, this amendment, just like the prior  amendment, is another attempt to cede congressional responsibility.   I can assure the gentleman that every piece of land in this bill that  is designated as wilderness is, in fact, wilderness. The gentleman is  right; in the statutory definition of wilderness there is no mechanized  or motorized equipment. There is no mining or drilling. I will say, for  firefighting, you don't just have to use shovels; you can use other  things.   But, be that as it may, wilderness should be reserved for those very  few special areas that are untrammeled by man, just like the Wilderness  Act says.   I will also guarantee, Mr. Chair, that every acre that is designated  wilderness has been gone over by the sponsors, by the citizens, by the  activists, and it qualifies as wilderness.   In the Colorado Wilderness Act, two-thirds of the areas have been  managed as wilderness because they are wilderness study areas, and they  have been managed as wilderness for over 30 years; so these areas are  wilderness.   Why, then, would I object to this amendment? Because what it does is  it cedes Congress' powers to the executive branch. And, frankly, with  this administration, that is the last thing I think we should do in  deciding what wilderness is.   If this amendment were adopted and the bill was enacted, Secretary  Bernhardt would be unilaterally empowered to veto designations of  wilderness enacted by Congress and signed by the President.   This amendment would give unprecedented and problematic power to the  Secretary to override Congress, based on no criteria, other than what  they wanted to do.   Now, if my colleagues had questions about if these areas are worthy  of designation, they only have to look at the bill reports, where we  extensively documented the outstanding values of the public lands and  rivers included in this bill.   Now, I would just challenge the gentleman to tell me which of the  wilderness designations in this legislation do not meet wilderness  criteria, because it is for Congress to make that decision, not the  executive branch. And we need to retain our Article I power every day  and in every way.   For that reason, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I do agree that wilderness is reserved for  those very special few areas that are left that truly are wild.   I challenged the gentleman to tell me which area, which acre in this  bill does not meet the Wilderness Act criteria, and he did not do so.  And that is because every acre of wilderness that my cosponsors and I  have designated meets that criteria. It has been vetted, and it is one  of those very few pristine areas that we should protect.   By the way, in Colorado, even if this bill is adopted, still, only  less than 10 percent of our land will be wilderness and as it should  be, because wilderness should be protected as a wild area.   I will say, though, that is not what this amendment does. What this  amendment does is it cedes determination of what is wilderness from the  Congress, which should be determining this, to the administration,  another erosion of an Article I power. That is why I oppose this  amendment, and I urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Unlike the Panetta amendment that we just debated, the Westerman  amendment contains no action or management prescription to address  wildfire risk on our public lands. Instead, the amendment is another  attempt by my colleagues to override Congress' constitutional  responsibility to make law and, instead, give political appointees  overly broad and unilateral authority to essentially veto an act of  Congress.   This amendment contains the false narrative that wilderness is a ``no  management'' designation and that any protective designation will  inherently increase wildfire risk.   That, in fact, is not true, and it is the opposite: Wilderness areas  are some of our most resilient natural landscapes.   Wilderness areas are usually far away from homes and other developed  areas. They don't contain power lines or roads, which are major causes  of human-caused ignitions, as we saw with the recent California fires.  And if a fire does start in a wilderness area, these landscapes are  best equipped to endure those periodic disturbances, which can achieve  important management objectives and enhance habitat and ecosystem  functions.   Mr. Chair, here we have got a photo provided to me by my colleague,  Mr. Carbajal, which illustrates this point. It is the Machesna  Wilderness Area that is included in this bill. If you look at the area  for a moment, you can see this is not an area that is appropriate for  logging, but you can also see some charred wood from a recent fire. But  overall, look at how this area has regrown and the beautiful flowers  that bloomed after the fire. This is what a resilient landscape looks  like, and it is what we are protecting in this bill.   Furthermore, we have said this over and over and over, and I can't  stress it enough, there is nothing that prevents suppression of an  active wildfire in a wilderness area. And the Wilderness Act allows  management activities if they are necessary to address fire, insects,  and diseases, which is referenced in no uncertain terms by Mr.  Panetta's amendment.   Wildfire, like climate change, is an issue that always should be on  our minds and inherent in our policies, but this red herring narrative  that wilderness designation inherently increases wildfire is just  simply not played out.   I encourage my colleagues not to give in to these false assumptions  and oppose this amendment. I urge a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, just to reiterate, the way it works right  now with existing wilderness areas is that  [[Page H1095]]  the region that is managing that wilderness area can decide, obviously,  taking into account that it is a wilderness area.   If it is a remote area, as we just saw in this photo, where burning  would benefit the ecosystem, then they are allowed to burn, as they are  in other areas of Federal land; but, if the regional director in the  management plan has a wilderness that is near an urban interface and it  looks like homes and lives may be put at risk, they are allowed, under  the Wilderness Act, to take that action.   That is what I have been trying to tell my colleagues for years now.  I think that the Panetta amendment makes that clear. I think that it  allows us the power that we have in designating wilderness.   Again, we shouldn't offload our power to the executive branch or any  other branch of government. I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, plain and simple, this amendment would remove  all the potential wilderness from this bill, which totals over 130,000  acres.   My colleagues are using this amendment to claim that the wilderness  areas in this bill don't meet the definition or intent of the  wilderness designation.   Guess what? That is exactly why they are designated as ``potential  wilderness.'' These are areas that are, for all intents and purposes,  wilderness, but for a small nonconforming use. Since the quotation  marks on the amendment description seem to show some lack of  understanding about this designation, I would like to explain it for  the Record.   A potential wilderness designation typically means that an area has  wilderness characteristics, but it recognizes that there is a  nonconforming use or activity that would otherwise be prohibited by a  standard wilderness designation, which is exactly what my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle keep trying to argue. They keep trying to  say: ``Well, you know, you can't have motorized activities. You can't  have this and that in wilderness,'' and they are right. But that is why  some of these areas are potential wilderness.   Some examples of potential wilderness allowances that would be  impacted by this amendment include allowing redwood forest restoration,  allowing trail reconstruction using heavy equipment, and allowing the  high-altitude helicopter operations in Colorado to continue in  potential wilderness, because those uses are not appropriate in  wilderness but these areas have strong wilderness characteristics, but  for that one activity.   Potential wilderness designations simply say this: manage the area  for the wilderness quality characteristics but continue to allow the  specific use or activity. Then when that nonconforming use is removed,  the area will then revert to wilderness because mostly that is what it  is.   Potential wilderness provides exactly the type of management  flexibility that my colleagues claim is needed for certain areas, but  they want to strike all of these designations from the bill. Frankly,  it seems a little backward to me.   For some of my friends on the other side of the aisle, I know it can  be hard to see these areas for anything other than their extractive  potential, but I see it from the other side of the coin. These areas  are strong wilderness areas; they just have a small nonconforming use  that eventually will be removed, restoring these areas to wilderness.  That is why these areas are called potential wilderness.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close if the gentleman is  ready. I think I have the right to close. Mr. Chair, I will reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the 131,702 acres of potential wilderness  in this bill, they are in many of the sections of this legislation, and  they all have strong wilderness characteristics but for one  nonconforming use, which will be eventually gone, in which case it is  imperative that we manage these areas as wilderness.   Mr. Chair, that is why I oppose this amendment, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no.'' I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I have nothing but great affection and  respect for my friend from the Third Congressional District, and I have  worked with him and his predecessors as I have developed this bill over  the last 20-plus years, but I respectfully have to strongly disagree  with him over his proposal to remove these two areas from the  legislation.   As a matter of fact, as I mentioned earlier in general debate, I  actually went to these two areas over the August recess and I visited  these areas. I invited Mr. Tipton to come, but he was unavailable. When  we were in the Cross Canyon area, we rode in on horses because there  are no trails. It is completely inaccessible. There we saw ancestral  pueblos. We saw petroglyphs with our own eyes.   When we went to the Weber-Menefee area to the area overlooking it, we  saw really clearly how this area was wild and needed protection. And,  by the way, the areas with the noxious weeds were several miles away,  not even close to the wilderness area.   I do understand these concerns, but I believe these two areas are a  case study for who you should listen to when you decide what wilderness  should be.   As I said in general debate, when Commissioner Ertel came to testify  before Congress, he rightly said that I had never been to these two  areas. So, last August I went there, and I toured the areas. I had a  town hall meeting in Cortez, which is the town that is right in between  these two areas. We had over 70 people who showed up at this  [[Page H1099]]  town hall meeting, and I presented what the bill was. Several other  people asked questions, presented opposing views.   At the end I just had a gut feeling that there was support there, so  I took an impromptu survey, and I asked the people in that room, ``How  many of you, knowing what you know, would support designation of Cross  Canyon and Weber-Menefee as wilderness?'' Sixty-five people raised  their hands. Then I asked, ``How many of you would oppose it?'' Four  people raised their hands. When I asked, ``How many are neutral,'' four  people raised their hands.    It seems to me we shouldn't be having local county commissioners have  veto power either over the citizens in those areas or over the U.S.  Congress in determining wilderness. And by the way, the local mayor of  Cortez and the town council have all voted to support designation of  these areas--both of which have been wilderness study areas for over 30  years--permanently.   That is why we need to keep these areas in our bill. That is why they  need to be designated as wilderness because they are wild and pristine.   And that is why I humbly and respectfully ask for a ``no'' vote on  this amendment   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman should be assured we spent  quite a little bit of money in your town.   I just want to say what the gentleman said points to exactly what I  am saying. He says that the Cortez town council and mayor are not  managing the county lands. Well, guess what, the county commissioners  aren't managing the Federal lands. These are Federal lands. These are  wilderness study areas, and they have been wilderness study areas for  almost 30 years. The residents, the local residents, they are the ones  that should care. They are the ones using these areas and they want  them to be preserved.   Mr. Chairman, I refer again, on the Western Slope in the areas  referenced in this bill, New Bridge Strategy did a poll last October of  2019, and they found that in those areas, 71 percent of Coloradans  support wilderness protections for those already managed as such, like  these two areas. And 63 percent supported expanding wilderness  protections across the State. These are the people who matter. These  are the people who care.   Also, we have a list of 80 different groups, most of them on the  Western Slope, and we have a list of 179 business owners and community  leaders, most of them on the Western Slope, who support this  legislation. The reason is because the local governments and the county  governments are benefiting from the visits that they have to these  areas.   In Cortez, one of the biggest employers is Osprey. Almost everybody  has an Osprey backpack or something in their home. They are selling  their goods to the people who are using these areas.   That is why I oppose this amendment. That is why we need to pass this  bill, and we need to protect these areas that are already wilderness  study areas and have been for 30 years, for the future generations to  come.   I include in the Record the list of business owners and the  conservation and recreation groups, as well as the survey from New  Bridge Strategy.

To: Interested Parties      From: Lori Weigel & Kathryn Hahne/New Bridge Strategy      Date: October 21, 2019      Re Support for Colorado Wilderness Act in Survey of Western           Slope Voters        New Bridge Strategy recently completed a survey of voters       throughout western Colorado--an area largely consisting of       the Third Congressional District--to determine their views on       a range of conservation issues, particularly increasing       wilderness designations on some lands in the West. The study       found strong support for the Colorado Wilderness Act to       increase wilderness primarily in desert and canyon areas in       their region. They also want to keep Wilderness Study Areas       intact, rather than removing that designation on some public       lands. This support may be grounded in the fact that voters       view public lands as beneficial for the economy. They also       anticipate outdoor recreation becoming increasingly important       in the region. This is not surprising given that most voters       in this region say that they engage in outdoor recreation       activities and/or sportsmen activities.        Specifically, the survey found that . . .        More than three-in-five Western Slope voters support       ``dedicating additional, existing public lands as wilderness       areas here in Colorado.'' Fully 63 percent support dedicating       more land as wilderness in Colorado after hearing a brief       explanation of what this would entail. Respondents were told       that ``Just over fifty years ago Congress passed the       Wilderness Act, which protected the Maroon Bells and the San       Juan Mountains here in Colorado. These areas are designated       as wilderness in order to keep that land conserved in its       natural state. Wilderness lands can be used for hiking,       camping, livestock grazing, horseback riding, wildlife       watching, hunting and fishing. However, mining, oil and gas       development, logging, and the use of motorized or off-road       vehicles and mountain bikes are not allowed on wilderness       lands.'' Again, after hearing this neutral explanation, there       is solid support of 63 percent, and fully 42 percent       ``strongly'' support it. Only 35 percent register opposition       to this proposal. Support for increasing the amount of       wilderness in Colorado is evident throughout the entire       district as well.        Support for extending wilderness protections has appeal       among virtually all sub-groups, including a majority of       hunters (55 percent) and anglers (62 percent), and       surprisingly, off-road vehicle users (55 percent support, 43       percent oppose). More than two-thirds of every other type of       outdoor recreation enthusiast expressed support, including 80       percent of mountain bikers, 75 percent of bird/wildlife       watchers, and 73 percent of hikers). A majority across party       lines also express support, with near universal support among       Democrats (94 percent), and nearly three-in-five Republicans       (59 percent) and unaffiliated voters (59 percent) registering       support for additional wilderness areas in Colorado.        In addition, once voters know that ``just five percent of       Colorado lands are currently dedicated as wilderness areas,''       support for dedicating additional public lands as wilderness       increases to fully 69 percent.        Likewise, there is significant support for adding       wilderness protections to public lands in desert and canyons       regions of the state. Fully 68 percent express support for a       proposal that would ``designate as wilderness lands areas       that include some desert canyons and mesas, such as lands       near Mesa Verde National Park, and natural areas along the       Arkansas and Dolores Rivers. These amount to less than 10       percent of the public lands in southern and western       Colorado.'' Two-in-five (40 percent) strongly support the       proposal, while 29 percent oppose it. This proposal engenders       majority support across party lines (92 percent of Democrats,       62 percent of unaffiliated voters and 54 percent of       Republicans), and with virtually every sub-group examined. It       has solid support throughout the district, including in Mesa       County (66 percent support).        Voters in this region also reject calls to eliminate       protections for Wilderness Study Areas. Western Colorado       voters prefer that Congress keep existing public lands in       Wilderness Study Areas, rather than removing that designation       to those lands by a nearly three to one margin, as the next       graph illustrates.        Majorities of all key voter sub-groups prefer that Congress       keep the status quo. This includes more than three-in-five       Republican and unaffiliated voters in the region (61 percent       say to keep the areas as they are, while 34 percent would       change their status) and virtually all Democrats (97 percent       keep as is). The desire to retain Wilderness Study Areas is       evident throughout the region, including in Mesa County (70       percent).        Support for these public lands proposals may be grounded in       the fact that voters make a connection between their economy       and the outdoors. The overwhelming majority of voters in       western Colorado say they presence of public lands in       Colorado helps our economy (84 percent) rather than hurts it       (6 percent) or has little impact on the economy (8 percent).       Majorities of every single sub-group hold the perception that       public lands help the economy.        Similarly, the survey demonstrates that voters in this       region view the ``outdoor economy'' as being ``very       important'' to their economic future. Fully 68 percent       characterize the outdoor economy which in the survey we       defined as ``people who come to hunt, fish, camp, hike, see       wildlife, as well as those who manufacture and sell equipment       for those activities'' as being very important to ``the       economic future of western Colorado.'' Another one-in-four       (25 percent) say it is ``somewhat important,'' and a mere 7       percent do not see it as important. Both Democrats (76       percent) and Republicans (70 percent) view the outdoor       economy as very important to the economic future of western       Colorado.        The vast majority of western Coloradans engage in outdoor       recreation themselves. When asked about their own ties to the       outdoors, the vast majority of voters here are participating       in many activities. Many identify as either a hunter (39%) or       an angler (52 percent). More than nine-in-ten say that they       regularly participate in some other form of outdoor       recreation, with a range of activities identified:        64% Hiking or trail running, 64% Camping, 51% Bird watching       and viewing wildlife, 30% Kayaking, canoeing or boating, 36%       Riding an off-road vehicle or snowmobile, 36% Snow shoeing,       skiing or boarding, 22% Mountain biking.        In fact, a majority say that they regularly participate in       three or more of these activities (56 percent).     Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, there has been a lot of debate for a long  time about how this bill might or might not impact military training in  Colorado, and I myself have been concerned about this for some years.  We have been looking at this for over 10 years, ever since we found out  about the high-altitude training by the National Guard.   We have provisions in the underlying bill and, of course, we have  accepted an amendment from Mr. Cunningham that would clearly say  nothing in this bill will interfere with the HAATS activities. As a  matter of fact, we removed several areas from the original bill that we  found out had helicopter landing pads in them and we called them  potential wilderness, because, frankly, I don't think that landing a  helicopter in an area is an approved wilderness use, and I have said  that all along.   So, therefore, we want to make sure that the National Guard can  continue to do its landing in these areas as long as it deems that it  is necessary to do so. We have written the underlying bill that way.  Mr. Cunningham's amendment clarifies it. And, frankly, if this  amendment will help to clarify the situation even more, I would be  happy to go along with that because I do not intend, and I don't think  any of the other bill sponsors intend, to interfere with our national  defense.   People might be surprised to find out the findings of the study once  it comes out, because the Pentagon often supports the protective buffer  that wilderness offers for aviation training. Also, this bill is  supported by a number of veterans and other military organizations.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a letter dated February 11, 2020,  from the Vet Voice Foundation that shows support for this legislation  and, in particular, support for the wilderness in this legislation.                                           Vet Voice Foundation,                                                  February 11, 2020.      Subject: Vet Voice Foundation Support for H.R. 2546--          Protecting America's Wilderness Act.       Hon. Diana DeGette,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congresswoman DeGette: I am Paul Eaton, Major General       (Ret.), U.S. Army, who served more than 30 years in the       United States Army, including combat and post-combat       assignments in Iraq, Bosnia and Somalia, and Senior Advisor       for the Vet Voice Foundation (VVF). The VVF serves as a       platform for veterans to influence policy outcomes and has       over 500,000 members with over 34,000 living in California       and Colorado. We write to express our support for H.R. 2546--      Protecting America's Wilderness Act.        Our support for H.R. 2546 is based on our intent to protect       our public lands. Those who serve our country fought to       preserve American freedoms and lifestyles. Almost nothing       better encapsulates these ideals than the wild spaces and       ecologically rich lands that have changed little since our       country's founding, thanks to the laws that protect them.        Through our work, we know veterans return from war and turn       to the outdoors to find relief from the trauma and stresses       of war and reintegration. For many veterans who've returned       from locations marked by desperation and violent conflict,       nature and wildlife can be a critical source of strength and       healing. The Protecting America's Wilderness Act would ensure       veterans and future generations have access to the great       outdoors.        We also recognize that the Protecting America's Wilderness       Act would provide permanent protections for landscapes in       Colorado, California, and Washington by designating over 1.3       million acres of federal land as new, expanded or potential       wilderness and safeguarding more than 1,200 miles of river as       components of the National Wild and Scenic River System.       These bills are the product of years of input by a wide       variety of stakeholders and will boost local economies,       recreation opportunities, and protect wildlife and their       habitats.        In order to protect and defend our public lands, we       strongly support H.R. 2546--Protecting America's Wilderness       Act.        Thank you for your continued support of our public lands       and consideration of Vet Voice Foundation's views. If we can       be of assistance on this matter, please do not hesitate to       contact me.            Respectfully,                                                     Paul Eaton,                                    Major General (Ret.), U.S. Army,                              Senior Advisor, Vet Voice Foundation.     Mr. Chair, I urge support for Mr. Tipton's amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms.  Schrier) having assumed the chair, Mr. Cuellar, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2546) to  designate certain lands in the State of Colorado as components of the  National Wilderness Preservation System, and for other purposes, had  come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the  motion to recommit.    Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit may sound  innocuous, but it truly is a wolf in sheep's clothing, and let me tell  you why.   Our local agencies already have the ability to fight fires if they  need to in wilderness areas. There is no provision in the Wilderness  Act that says they can only use axes or nonmechanical items, none.   They keep saying this all day, and I don't know why. It is simply not  true.   What this amendment would do is it would give some amorphous entity  the ability to use mechanical means whenever they thought necessary,  potentially usurping the right of local governments.   And also, as the gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) pointed  out, the local areas, the management teams, already had the ability to  fight fires how they wanted. And what is more, in the underlying bill,  we say that.   But just to make clear, just about everybody in this Chamber just  voted for the Panetta amendment, which underscores that we can fight  fires in wilderness.   But let's talk about what this bill really is about. Let's talk about  it, because it is so important for our children and our grandchildren,  the future generations.   Today, we have a bipartisan ability to preserve these special wild  areas. It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to preserve 1.4 million  acres of wilderness across the West for our generations to come.   It will stimulate the economies of our States; it will encourage  recreation; it will encourage conservation; and it will take us a long  way to our goal of preserving 30 percent of public lands by 2030 to  start slowing down the changing of our climate.   P.S., if we slow down the climate change, we slow down the forest  fires, and everybody in this Chamber knows that.   Look at the charts that we have of the areas in this bill. I want to  show everybody these gorgeous areas:   This first chart, one of the 35 areas in my Colorado Wilderness Act,  the Dolores Canyon River;   The second chart, the Middle Fork Eel Wild and Scenic River in Mr.  Huffman's Northwest California Wilderness, Recreation, and Working  Forest Act;   The third chart, Dry Lakes Ridge in Mr. Carbajal's Central Coast  Heritage Protection Act.   And, by the way, Mr. Speaker, you can see here where they had a fire,  and you can see here what happened when that area remediated itself  from the fire: beautiful wildflowers.   The San Gabriel National Recreation Area waterways in Ms. Chu's act,  you can see the beautiful areas that are protected there.   The Rim of the Valley in Mr. Schiff's Rim of the Valley Corridor  Preservation Act. These were sent to him by his constituents, who love  these areas.   And the Skokomish River in Mr. Kilmer's Wild Olympics Wilderness and  Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.   Folks, this is what we are talking about. This is the legacy we are  leaving our children.   The Wilderness Act of 1964 says:         Wilderness should be preserved as an area where the Earth       and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man       himself is a visitor who does not remain.    That is what we are talking about today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this motion to recommit  and vote ``yes'' on this important groundbreaking bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
