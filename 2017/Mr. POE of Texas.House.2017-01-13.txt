 Mr. Speaker, Iran is the world's leading state  sponsor of terrorism. It funds and controls terrorists groups like  Hezbollah. Its tentacles stretch all over the world, far beyond the  Middle East.   Many of its activities are done through the Iranian Revolutionary  Guard Corps, which has funded, planned, and executed terrorist attacks  in the United States and elsewhere for decades.   The IRGC is the parent organization of the Quds Force and is directly  responsible for its terrorist activities worldwide. But somehow this  group has managed to escape repercussions, and the United States has  never recognized it as a terrorist organization. I am working to change  that.   This week I introduced the IRGC Terrorist Sanctions Act. This bill  will require the President to designate the IRGC for its terrorist  activity and levy the relevant statutory sanctions against it.   It is time to close loopholes like these that allow terrorist- affiliated groups to continue their reign of terror. Designate and  sanction these terrorist groups that are sponsored by the number one  world state sponsor of terrorism, Iran.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
