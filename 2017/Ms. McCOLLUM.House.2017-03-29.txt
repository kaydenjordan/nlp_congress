 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1430, which  makes it harder for the Environmental Protection Agency to do its job.   This bill would bring the EPA's work to a halt, undermining  protection of America's health and safety. This legislation interferes  with the use of sound science and creates obstacles that stop the EPA  from enforcing the law.   This bill is just one part of President Trump and congressional  Republicans' attacks on science and our environment. Shortly after the  inauguration, the Trump administration removed taxpayer-funded  scientific data from public websites. Now, that is not open, that is  not honest, and that is not fair to the taxpayers.   This month, President Trump proposed dramatic budget cuts that would  make it impossible for the EPA to enforce clean air and clean water  laws. Yesterday, President Trump rescinded the Clean Power Plan, paving  the way for more air pollution.   We cannot go backwards. I urge my colleagues to reject this bill and  other Republican efforts to weaken the environmental protections.   We must put public health and scientific integrity before polluters'  profits.
