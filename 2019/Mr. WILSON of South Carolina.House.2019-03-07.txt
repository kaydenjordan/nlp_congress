 Madam Speaker, Saudi Arabia has a vital  role in the global war on terrorism. Riyadh is a crucial  counterterrorism partner. But, sadly, textbooks of Saudi Arabia have  been teaching its students to hate others for too long.   One current textbook is inflammatory against Christianity, Judaism,  and even other Muslims who do not subscribe to the Saudi interpretation  of Islam, which they describe as ``evil.''   Saudi Arabia has committed to reforming curriculum for over a decade.  That is why Congressman Bill Keating and I have introduced H.R. 554,  the Saudi Educational and Transparency and Reform Act. It will hold the  Saudis accountable by requiring an annual report on any intolerant  content of their textbooks. It will also send a clear, bipartisan  message to end the incitement now.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
