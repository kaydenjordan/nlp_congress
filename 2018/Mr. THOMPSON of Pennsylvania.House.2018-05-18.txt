 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  life of Mrs. Delphine Gibson from Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, who passed  away on May 10, 2018. At the age of 114, Mrs. Gibson was America's  oldest living person. She became the oldest living person in February  of 2017.   Mrs. Gibson was born in South Carolina on August 17, 1903, where her  family owned and operated a local farm. After her marriage to Taylor  Gibson, the couple moved to Mount Union, Pennsylvania, in 1928, and  together they had three children: Frank, Moody, and Ella.   Those who knew Mrs. Gibson speak of her great sense of humor and  bright smile. She was known to sing and hum her favorite tunes around  the nursing home where she resided and shared the gospel with her  fellow residents. She credited her longevity to her faith in God and  her church, Mount Hope Missionary Baptist, where she proudly  worshipped.   Having lived in Pennsylvania for 90 years, Mrs. Gibson left a lasting  impression on all who knew her, and, Mr. Speaker, she will certainly be  missed.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment. As chair of the  Nutrition Subcommittee, I have been out West. This amendment not only  helps preserve our forests, but it prevents mudslides in California, it  prevents erosion, and it prevents the killing of fish. Without managing  the understory, the intensity of these wildfires will caramelize, or  bake, the soil to where no water is absorbed. It runs off, takes  everything with it, including soil particles, and increase turbidity in  streams. My point is that clean watersheds depend on this amendment as  well.     Will the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman  for offering this amendment. It is an incredibly important amendment.   Ms. Stefanik talked about just one of many invasive species. This  body, uniformly and united, put a lot of money into a significant  threat to our forests, which was wildfire funding. Those of us who live  on the East Coast, we have wildfires, Mr. Chairman, but they are more  limited in scope. We don't have, certainly, the devastating effects of  the half a million acres that I saw when I visited Washington.   Our primary threat is invasive species. The hemlock woolly adelgid is  one of those. That is actually our State tree that it goes after in  Pennsylvania, so we take that pretty personal. When the hemlock woolly  adelgid kills the hemlock trees, it warms our trout streams, which we  are known for, and that is an important part of our number two  industry, which is tourism.   We have a new threat that has just recently come into this country  from somewhere in Asia. It might have been China, I am not sure. It is  called the spotted lanternfly. The spotted lanternfly is the most  beautiful butterfly you have every seen, Mr. Chairman, but it is the  most deadly to grapes, apple trees, pear trees, all fruit trees, and  hardwoods. That is a big part of our economy, certainly in Pennsylvania  and on the East Coast.   Mr. Chairman, I really support this amendment. We need research, we  need not just solutions on how to deal with these invasive species, but  we need to find solutions that are landscaped, that can be applied  broadly, because it is very difficult to do it tree by tree. We are  doing that with the hemlock woolly adelgid, but we do need more  research. The U.S. Forest Research Lab is a great part of the U.S.  Forest Service.  [[Page H4216]]    I appreciate the work also on restoring those forests. A good healthy  forest, which means we are actively harvesting and we are maintaining  and we are preventing wildfires and dealing with invasive species,  provides us with clean air and clean water. They are the largest carbon  sinks in the world, a good healthy forest.                                time  0930     Mr. Chair, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.    Mr. Chair, I want to thank Mr. Faso for  his amendment. I have had the privilege and honor of visiting his  district, where we had one of our listening sessions that we did.   This is only my second farm bill to participate in, and the last one  was very good. Chairman Lucas did a great job. But this one, we kind of  broke the barriers, I think, in terms of transparency and in the amount  of listening sessions that we had.   I appreciate we were in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where each January,  we have a farm show, the largest indoor agriculture exposition in the  country--that was a shameless plug, I know--but we were also in New  York, and I appreciate what Mr. Faso is offering here with his  amendment.   I certainly speak in favor and support of his amendment. Identifying  the geographic sources is so incredibly important, Mr. Chairman,  because then we can see what are the natural enemies to these bugs,  these fungi, the invasive species that really today are having such a  devastating effect.   In the Allegheny National Forest, we are proud of our hardwood  cherry. We are very afraid of the spotted lanternfly because of what  that could do.   Compared to the West, we are probably what are considered a puny or  very small National Forest, about 513,000 acres, but it is the most  profitable National Forest because of the value of our timber, and  invasive species go right after the value. Today, standing in that  forest, we have a lot of ash--which makes great baseball bats, among  other things--that are dead because of the emerald ash borer.   So the gentleman's amendment, which would track and really provide  the tools that the Forest Service--it builds on the tools that the  Forest Service has. These are additional tools that they need to have.   It is so incredibly important when you look at the economic threat,  and that is the way I look at invasive species. It is not just forest  health, but these are assets. Our national forests were created not to  be national parks. That is why they are managed by the Department of  Agriculture, not the Department of Interior.   They are meant to provide resources, timber, energy resources,  minerals, and the invasive species represent just a tremendous threat.  So we should do anything that we can to protect the value of that  taxpayer-owned asset.   Again, everybody benefits from a healthy forest. It takes  CO2 out of the air, it creates oxygen. They are the largest  carbon sinks in the world. It keeps our watersheds healthy.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate all parts of this gentleman's amendment and I  thank him for his amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield as much time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Conaway), the chairman of the Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Chair, just once again, let me  thank the gentleman for his amendment.   Let me also say that this farm bill, from my perspective, is  groundbreaking with what is in the base language with healthy forests,  and the series of amendments that we have seen made in order. The  people that will vote for this farm bill today are ones that are  concerned with too much CO2 in the area, because the work  that we do as a result of this farm bill, if you are concerned about  climate change and you are concerned about CO2, this is  probably the most effective piece of legislation to deal with that in  my 10 years serving here in Congress, because, once again, these  forests--and I am a little biased. I am from Pennsylvania, Penn Wood.  We have more trees today than we did when William Penn got the charter.   Our healthy forests are our largest carbon sinks. It is the most  effective tool that we have to take CO2 out of the air and  to deal with any impact that CO2 may have on climate change.  So certainly anyone who is concerned about that, talks about that,  needs to support this amendment and certainly needs to support the  underlying bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I just want to thank my  colleague and friend from Pennsylvania for this amendment. Yes, the  USDA has existing authority, but I think this expresses the intent of  Congress and our recognition that one of the biggest issues that we  face in the agriculture industry--which is the number one industry in  Pennsylvania, one out of every seven jobs comes directly or indirectly  from agriculture--it is our succession planning. It is where is the  next generation of farmer coming from? Congress recognizes the need of  having this type of leadership designated so that there is somebody on  point overseeing, and pointing, and administering the young and  beginning farmer programs that we have put in place for the past couple  of farm bills.   It is actually a crisis, given the average age of farmers across this  Nation. And I appreciate the fact that we are going to help to  certainly further express the intent of this Congress on the importance  of this, and provide a direction so that resources can be administered  to meet this need. I appreciate the gentleman's effort.
