 Mr. President, Vermont has a rich history of supporting  vibrant arts in communities throughout our State and across the world.  Local and foreign visiting artists alike make invaluable social and  economic contributions to our communities. Today our complex,  overloaded, and outdated immigration system often prevents foreign  artists from coming to the United States and engaging in international  cultural exchange.   That is why I am reintroducing the bipartisan Arts Require Timely  Service, ARTS, Act with Senator Orrin Hatch. Our bill would assist  nonprofit arts organizations in obtaining visas for foreign artists by  ensuring enforcement of current statutory requirements. The O visa is  available to individual foreign artists, while the P visa is available  to groups of foreign artists. The Immigration and Nationality Act  currently requires that O visa and P visa petitions be processed within  14 days. However, artists and nonprofit arts organizations routinely  confront lengthy and uncertain wait times in the adjudication process.  Many nonprofit arts organizations are unable to afford the exorbitant  filing fee necessary for expedited processing of petitions.   The ARTS Act would require USCIS to provide premium processing  services, without a fee, if an O visa or P visa is not adjudicated  within the statutorily required 14-day timeframe and if the petition is  filed by or on behalf of a nonprofit organization.   The many problems plaguing our immigration system demand responsible  reforms. This bill is just one small piece. As we look ahead to  comprehensive immigration reform, I hope that Congress will consider  commonsense legislation like this that will help create permanent  solutions. Foreign visiting artists provide an important public service  and support our international diplomacy. It is time we start working to  create results that can best help our communities as a whole.                                  ______                                         By Mr. FLAKE (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):   S. 2470. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit  the purchase of certain firearms by individuals under 21 years of age,  and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
