 Madam Speaker, I include in the Record the accompanying  three letters from Americans for Financial Reform, the Consumer  Federation of America, and Public Citizen, which express support for my  amendment, No. 573, which was included in En Bloc amendment No. 1 to  H.R. 4521.                                                      Americans for                                                Financial Reform,                                                   February 2, 2022.        Dear Members of the Committee: Americans for Financial       Reform support Chairman Sherman's amendments to amend H.R.       4521, the America COMPETES Act.        We support Representative Sherman's amendments that would       close some of the gaps that allow covered companies to escape       from financial reporting requirements with the Securities and       Exchange Commission through exemptions in Regulation D,       Regulation S, and Rule 144A. This would increase transparency       and accountability.        The amendment would require identification of:        Issuer        Issuer's place of incorporation        Amount of issuance        Principal beneficiaries of issuer        Use of proceeds, including each country and industry where       proceeds are invested.            Sincerely,      Americans for Financial Reform.                                   ____                                   Consumer Federation of America,                                                   February 2, 2022.      Re Support for Amendment #573 to H.R. 4521.       Hon. Brad Sherman,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Sherman: On behalf of the Consumer       Federation of America (CFA), I am writing to express support       for your amendment to H.R. 4521, the America COMPETES Act of       2022. By requiring certain privately held issuers to disclose       basic information to the U.S. Securities and Exchange       Commission (SEC), your amendment will promote additional       transparency in the ``private placement'' market and enhance       investor protection.        CFA has long been concerned about the rapid expansion and       relative opacity of the private securities markets. Under the       current exempt offering framework, foreign and domestic       issuers can access virtually unlimited amounts of private       capital without ever having to register with the SEC or       engage in ongoing reporting under the Securities Exchange Act       of 1934. Moreover, many other stakeholders, including state       securities regulators, SEC Commissioners, leading academics       and practitioners, and others--have echoed CFA's concerns in       this regard.        In December of 2020, Congress passed the Holding Foreign       Companies Accountable Act, which requires that any U.S.       exchange-listed foreign company be delisted if, for three       consecutive years, the PCAOB is unable to inspect the primary       auditor of that company. As hearings held by the House       Financial Services Subcommittee on Investor Protection,       Entrepreneurship and Capital Markets have established, in the       event that foreign issuers--and especially issuers based in       the People's Republic of China (PRC), are prevented from       listing on U.S. securities exchanges pursuant to the Holding       Foreign Companies Accountable Act, it is possible and indeed       likely that such issuers may attempt to utilize the exempt       offering framework as a means to continue to raise large       amounts of capital from U.S. investors. Your amendment       anticipates this possibility and takes important steps to       prevent it.        In summary, your amendment will enact important reforms to       the exempt offering framework to enhance transparency for the       investing public with respect to privately issued securities       sold by foreign issuers. Such reforms are commendable in-and-      of themselves. Your amendment would also compliment the       Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act by making it more       difficult for foreign issuers to ignore its requirements       while continuing to raise capital from U.S. investors. For       those reasons, CFA is pleased to support your amendment.        Thank you for your attention to CFA's views. Please do not       hesitate to contact me should you have any questions.            Sincerely,                                                    Dylan Bruce,                                         Financial Services Counsel,                                    Consumer Federation of America.  [[Page H865]]                                          ____                                                Public Citizen,                                   Washington, DC, February 2, 2022.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi: On behalf of more than 500,000 members       and supporters of Public Citizen, we support an amendment       sponsored by Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif) to the ``America       COMPETES Act'' regarding disclosure requirements of certain       securities transactions, including those involving Chinese       corporations.        Currently, foreign companies that wish to raise capital in       American securities markets may do so through a number of       exemptions (Rule 506(b), Regulation S, or Rule 144a) that       allow them to avoid basic disclosures that apply to standard       securities. In fact, more than 60 percent of capital raised       in US securities markets is generated under one of these       exemptions, according to a report from the Securities and       Exchange Commission (SEC). As a matter of national security       and basic investor protection, we believe that improved       disclosure is warranted.        The Sherman Amendment would require firms using one of       these exemptions to disclose: the place of incorporation of       the issuer; the amount of capital raised; the principal       beneficial owners; the intended use of the proceeds; each       country in which the issuer intends to invest the proceeds;       and each industry in which the issuer intends to invest such       proceeds. This amendment will apply to transactions of more       than $25 million, or those the aggregate to more than $50       million in a one-year period. Finally, the SEC must report to       the House Financial Services Committee all those transactions       that relate either to a firm incorporated in the People's       Republic of China or maintains significant entities within       China that are consolidated in the parent company.        We believe these additional disclosures will be valuable to       investors as well as those responsible for national security       to better understand how American capital is deployed.        For questions, please contact Bartlett Naylor.            Sincerely,                                                    Public Citizen.
