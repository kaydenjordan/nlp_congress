 Mr. President, having been away for a while from the  Senate, I am pretty amazed to come back today and see a budget that is  passed that throws away years of rhetoric about fiscal conservatism.  The Senate just passed a budget that adds $1.5 trillion to our national  debt, a budget that slashes seniors' healthcare by $473 billion. It  decimates the Medicaid Program for parents and grandparents in nursing  homes, those who are disabled, and those who are among the poorest,  with cuts of over $1 trillion over the next decade.   In total, the Republican budget would cut more than $5 trillion over  the next decade from education, healthcare, affordable housing,  childcare, nutrition assistance, transportation, and other programs  that all Americans rely on.   The question many New Jerseyans will be asking me is, Why? Why do  Republicans in Congress add $1.5 trillion  [[Page S6631]]  to our national debt while slashing the Medicare Program? The answer is  simple. We are on a pathway to provide massive tax breaks to corporate  interests, special interests, and the wealthiest 1 percent. This has  been a Republican agenda for as long as I can remember.   What I find most galling is that this budget plan is meant to set up  a special process that we know here as reconciliation to pass the Trump  tax plan--a plan, which, by which their own admission, will raise taxes  on middle-class families. Think about that. The Republican Party is  adding $1.5 billion to the debt to pay for massive tax breaks for the  wealthiest among us--I should say trillion, $1.5 trillion to the debt  to pay for massive tax breaks for the wealthiest among us. They aren't  even guaranteeing that middle-class taxes will not go up.   What the Republican budget fails to realize is that budgets are not  just about numbers. Budgets are about people, their hopes, their  dreams, their expectations for a better life for themselves and their  children.   My view is that this budget sells America short. It is not what the  American people believe our collective values would be. Hard-working  families want us to work together and pass a budget that addresses  their concerns. They want safe communities, not a budget that threatens  to cut the firefighter grants and stretches local budgets even thinner.  They want peace of mind when they reach their golden years, not a  budget that raises their healthcare costs. They want a tax proposal  that cuts taxes for the middle class and working people, not more tax  breaks for the folks that have been rigging the system against us.   People are willing to do their part if everyone is sharing in the  sacrifice. But this budget fails that test. It fails to recognize that  we are all in this together and should benefit together and sacrifice  together--each of us working for the betterment of all of us.   Mr. President, another area where it is critical that we come  together, not as 50 separate States but as the United States of  America, is to help the 3.5 million American citizens living in Puerto  Rico. I have serious concerns that the current disaster relief package  currently being considered by Congress falls far short of that.   Tomorrow will mark 1 month since Hurricane Maria devastated the  island of Puerto Rico, leaving in its wake a trail of destruction,  despair, and suffering. It is 1 month later, and still 88 percent of  our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico don't have power. It is 1 month  later, and still one-third of the island lacks access to clean, safe  drinking water.   Outside of the city of San Juan, the situation is even worse, as  nearly two-thirds of people still remain without water. Let me just  pause for a moment to think about that. Think about it: an entire month  without clean water, without water to bathe, to cook with, or simply to  drink. How many of us can even imagine such an existence? More than  half of the island's cell towers are down, which is not just an  inconvenience. It is a threat to safety. Imagine the sense of isolation  and desperation when your power is out, when you have run out of  potable water, with none on the way, and you can't even call for help.   As bad as it looks on TV, the situation on the ground, as I saw it,  is tragically worse. I am concerned that the package we are considering  now is both inadequate in scope and unfair in treatment--inadequate  because it is just a fraction of what Puerto Rico needs to recover,  unfair because it treats the people of Puerto Rico different than  Florida and Texas, even though they are U.S. citizens.   While all three areas have been devastated by natural disasters, only  Puerto Rico is being required to pay back natural disaster assistance.  That is right. Unlike Florida and Texas, the majority of Puerto Rico's  assistance is coming in the form of a loan. While there are a lot of  things that the people of Puerto Rico need from their Federal  Government, one thing they absolutely do not need and simply cannot  afford is billions of dollars of more debt.   This is not a normal disaster loan. No. Just like everything else  with Puerto Rico, this loan comes with a major stipulation. While  disaster loans are normally forgiven according to a standard formula  under the Stafford Act, this package overrules longstanding law and  leaves the decision entirely in the hands of the Secretaries of the  Treasury and Homeland Security.   While disaster loans are normally used to help people be safe and  start the recovery process, this legislation gives the Secretaries of  the Treasury and Homeland Security the authority to control how Puerto  Rico spends the money. If Secretary Mnuchin decides that some, most, or  even all of the loan should be used to pay off his friends on Wall  Street, there is nothing Puerto Rico can do to stop him. If he decides  that debt bondholders are more important than those who are suffering  in darkness, there is nothing they can do to stop him. Instead of being  treated like the rest of the country, Puerto Rico is left at the mercy  of Treasury Secretary Mnuchin. They are at the mercy of someone who  made his fortune off the backs of seniors and hard-working families who  lost their homes in the foreclosure crisis.   Do we really think that someone who callously rejected the pleas of  struggling families to save their homes and instead put them on the  fast track to foreclosure is going to suddenly change now for the 3.5  million American citizens in Puerto Rico? Does anyone really believe he  is going to put the people of Puerto Rico first? What a tragedy it  would be if, instead of helping our most vulnerable citizens, this loan  was used to pay off, in whole or in part, vulture funds. We need people  saved, not bondholders.   We need a response that answers Puerto Rico's call. Instead of  continuing to treat Puerto Rico like a foreign country and make them  start a tab at the U.S. Treasury while they are vulnerable and pleading  for help, we need to treat them just like their fellow American  citizens in Florida and Texas. We need to provide unconditional  assistance--real dollars to rebuild roads, the electrical grid, and to  put people back in their homes and businesses. We need to address the  massive Medicaid cliff that is forcing even more doctors and nurses off  the island and threatening the health of the people of Puerto Rico. We  need strong protections to make sure that the disaster relief stays  with the people of Puerto Rico, where it is needed the most.   Let me close by saying that I grew up believing the United States was  the greatest country the world had ever seen. I still believe that  today as strongly as ever. Ultimately, our response as it relates to  the people of Puerto Rico is not just about the people of Puerto Rico  but about all of us. It is about our values--who we are as a people,  who we are as a nation. How we respond to this crisis will test the  collective conscience of our Nation, and it will define us.   As I have said many times, I have never shied away from voting for  assistance for flooding in Mississippi, for wildfires in the West, for  hurricanes like Katrina, and any other natural disaster that has faced  our country with our fellow Americans. I was amazed when I had to  struggle and fight here on the Senate floor for the first time--I don't  know--in my lifetime to get assistance in the New York-New Jersey area  after Superstorm Sandy. It took a major fight, with people voting no,  even though I had always voted yes.   The people of Puerto Rico do not have a U.S. Senator to cast their  vote for them or to raise their voices for them. Yet, as long as I am a  Member of this Chamber, I am going to continue to prick the conscience  of the Senate to understand that when we walk to the Vietnam wall and  see those names, a disproportionate number of them are Americans of  Puerto Rican descent, who wore the uniform, gave their lives, and made  the ultimate sacrifice. They did not leave the conflict early; they  gave it their all. We cannot leave them early, nor should we leave them  short.   I yield the floor.
