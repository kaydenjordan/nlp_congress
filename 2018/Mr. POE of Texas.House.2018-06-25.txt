 Mr. Speaker, the rain came down, the bayous and  creeks rose, and the wind blew. It was as if it would never stop  raining. It was Hurricane Harvey last September. After it was over, 55  inches of water had hammered the Houston area.   But in the rainy haze, Officer Norbert Ramon appeared. But Officer  Ramon, a 55-year-old officer of the Houston Police Department, was  sick. He had stage IV colon cancer. He was undergoing treatment, and  doctors said that he had only a few years to live.   However, the 24-year veteran of the Houston Police Department jumped  into the flooded aftermath of the hurricane despite his cancer. Officer  Ramon sloshed through bacteria-filled waters, putting his own life at  risk.   Over the course of 4 days, he rescued 1,500 Houstonians stranded in  the flood. He said: ``My main concern was to help the citizens. Nothing  else was on my mind. I didn't worry about me or anything.''   As the waters receded and the Texas Sun came out through the blue  sky, Mr. Speaker, Officer Ramon headed back to the hospital, returning  to his treatments. Despite a hard-fought battle, Officer Ramon lost his  fight against a cancerous invader.   Taps sounded today, Mr. Speaker, as hundreds of peace officers and  citizens of Houston honored the life of one of Houston's finest.   Officer Norbert Ramon stood Houston strong. Mr. Speaker, they don't  make `em like him anymore.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
