 Mr. Speaker, I am relatively new to this  body, but I have been following politics in this country for quite some  time. For many years, I have been hearing Members of Congress on both  sides of the aisle, but more so on this side, promising the country  that we would secure the border, that we would disrupt the drug  traffickers who are poisoning our people, and that we would disrupt the  human traffickers who abuse and rape small children and others as they  take them across the desert.    This is the opportunity to fulfill the promise of securing our  country's border, because this country, just like any other country in  the world, has the right and the responsibility to secure its border  and enforce its immigration laws.   For a long time, I have also been hearing people talk about Dreamers,  the victims of a broken immigration system, young immigrants brought to  our country as children, who grew up here, went to school with our own  children, pledge allegiance to the same flag, and today are  contributing to this great country. A lot of people in this Chamber, on  both sides, more so on the other side of the aisle, have been promising  a solution for Dreamers for 17 years, with nothing to show for it.   This is our opportunity to make sure these young immigrants are  treated fairly and guaranteed a future in America with a bridge onto  the legal immigration system. We take the exact criteria that the Obama  administration laid out in the DACA program. That is in this  legislation.   This bill will also help us end family separation, which I think  there is a great deal of bipartisanship for in this Chamber. Our  country should have the ability to enforce its laws and to keep  families together, which is exactly what the Obama administration was  attempting to do until the courts got in the way. We can fix that here.   And lastly, we need to modernize our immigration system. We are a  nation of immigrants. I am the child of immigrants, and I am so proud  of it. But our immigration laws are outdated. Our immigration system  has to be modernized so that it is better aligned with our economy so  that immigrants who come to this country have the best opportunity to  grow, to prosper, and to contribute.                                time  1500    The alternative is the status quo. A vote against this legislation is  the status quo.   What is the status quo? A porous, wall-less border; uncertainty for  Dreamers; young people who could lose their status within months;  families separated at the border; and an outdated immigration system  that dishonors every American.   So this is our chance to come together. Is this legislation perfect?  Every Member of this House could find an excuse to vote against this  bill. But that is the problem with immigration, that nothing has ever  been good enough. When nothing is good enough, you get nothing. And  that is not fair to the American people.   That is why I sat at the table, and I have been at the table for  weeks, not just with Republicans, with Democrats, good colleagues like  Mr. Polis. We sat long hours trying to reach a compromise, and it is  always elusive. Let's change that now.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished  chairman for yielding me time.   Mr. Speaker, the reason I am here is because I made a commitment to  my constituents, and, really, to the country, that I wanted to improve  our country's immigration system.   If you look at the reality of what is happening today, it is really  sad. We have a chaotic situation at the border. We have drug  traffickers active at the border, bringing in their drugs, poisoning  the American people.   We have human traffickers, which are exploiting some of the most  vulnerable people in the world, profiting off of them.   Some of these children that get brought over by coyotes get abused,  molested, raped.   This is what is happening at our southwest border, and it has to  change.   The underlying bill invests in border security, and most Americans-- an overwhelming majority--want to see the situation at the border  improve. And an overwhelming majority believes that the United States  of America, like every country in the world, has the right and the duty  to enforce its laws and to protect its borders.   I am also here, Mr. Speaker, because I made a commitment to some of  the victims of our broken immigration system.   There are a lot of young immigrants in our country who were brought  over as children. Some of them have no memory of their countries of  origin. They are the victims of a broken immigration system. Some of  these young  [[Page H5487]]  people--I know their stories because I know them well--when they are 14  or 15, they discover that they are undocumented, after years of having  sat in classrooms with our own kids, pledging allegiance to our own  flag, and loving this country just as much as we do.   And that is why this bill contains a solution that is fair to these  young immigrants.   If we don't pass this bill, these young immigrants, the Dreamers, the  DACA recipients, could lose all of their protections in a matter of  months.   Now, we don't have to get into why or how that happened. We know that  there are some court challenges out there, but that is the reality.  That is what we are dealing with today.   In addition to that, we have all spoken out against this tragedy of  children being separated at the border and the difficult position that  the current and the previous administration were in of having to choose  between enforcing our immigration laws and separating families.   Yes, the Obama administration planned and started detaining families  together until a court told them that they could not, and now we have a  true tragedy on our hands. This bill would also help solve that issue.   In addition to that, we modernize our immigration laws by making sure  that our economy's needs are met.   Now, the alternative is to vote ``no'' and to double down on the  status quo: a failed broken immigration system that has created so many  victims over the years, from the small children who get abused by the  human traffickers, to the young immigrants in our country who  discovered one day that they were undocumented, to drug trafficking at  the border that is poisoning so many people in our country.   A vote against this bill is a vote for that status quo. And I don't  think anyone in this Chamber supports the status quo on immigration.   Mr. Speaker, I know this bill isn't perfect. This isn't the bill I  would have drafted. My bill is the Recognizing America's Children Act.  That is the bill that I drafted and that I would prefer. But there are  435 of us in this Chamber, and sometimes we have to meet somewhere,  meet into the middle, compromise.   And let's not let this time be like it always is on immigration where  everyone says: Unless I can get 100 percent of what I want, no one is  going to get anything. And that might be easy for us to say here in  this Chamber, but that isn't something easy for people to hear. For the  American people, for young immigrants brought to our country, for the  DACA population, that isn't easy for them to hear.   They want to hear that we are going to find a way to get to yes, and  that although our solution might not be perfect, it will leave us at a  place better than the one we are in today.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I respectfully ask all of my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle to strongly consider supporting this  legislation that will leave our country much better off than it is  today.
