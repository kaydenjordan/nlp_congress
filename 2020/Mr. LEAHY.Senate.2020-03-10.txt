 Madam President, I want to take a moment to recognize the  brave and selfless individuals from the St. Michael's College Fire and  Rescue Squad, based in Colchester, VT. These young men and women  respond to emergencies on a moment's notice to help those in need--all  while balancing the demands of their full college course load. St.  Michael's College Fire and Rescue helps bring a greater degree of  safety to residents in Chittenden County, and we are thankful for their  efforts. Today, I would like  [[Page S1666]]  to commemorate their 50 years of service.   St. Michael's Fire and Rescue Squad was founded in late 1969, after a  local student died while waiting for emergency medical services to  arrive. The community recognized that in order to prevent further  tragedies of this nature, greater resources must be dedicated to  emergency responders. Students rose to this challenge, and with the  help of Donald ``Pappy'' Sutton, the former dean of students, they  formed the squad. Despite starting out with only minimal equipment,  this remarkable group now serves 385 square miles of Chittenden County,  spanning their reach into surrounding towns and along 26 miles of  Interstate 89. The territory covered far exceeds what we might expect  from a group of college volunteers, but their capacity to serve only  goes to show just how dedicated the St. Michael's Fire and Rescue team  truly is.   Perhaps one of the most impressive aspects of this team is the fact  that they are all between the ages of 18 and 22. The maturity and grace  displayed by these young individuals while fulfilling their duties is  nothing short of inspiring. These are people who, for some, have just  left home for the first time and yet are successfully responding to  crisis situations which would tax even the most experienced of us.  These responders will sometimes be the first on the scene for a car  crash, overdose, fire or medical emergency, and a split-second decision  could make the difference between a life saved and a life lost. And we  should not forget: these responders are all students managing their  college classes in addition to volunteering. Emergencies give no  credence to a student's sleep schedule; sometimes these students will  get woken up in the late hours of the night or early hours of the  morning to put out a fire, despite having class the following morning.  Those who receive credit for their volunteer work are on call for 24  hours a week, taking turns sleeping in the designated volunteer bunks.   The work done by the St. Michael's Fire and Rescue team is not always  glamorous, but it has kept the community remarkably safer. On average,  the squad responds to more than 3,000 calls each year--some just false  alarms, others far more severe in nature. But what has remained  consistent is the relief that these volunteers have offered to local  emergency responders and the peace of mind they have bestowed upon our  residents. By offering support to our hard-working first responders,  they inevitably ensure that more Vermonters get the help they need in  the nick of time. In the process, they have inspired other college  campuses around the Nation to form their own volunteer response teams,  who can then help their own communities in times of need.   This is the type of bravery and selflessness that we are proud to see  exemplified in our young citizens, and I am honored to have them  recognized today.                            ____________________     Madam President, I want to take a moment to recognize a  Vermont gem, Elmore Mountain Bread, a small business founded by a wife  and husband team. Blair Marvin is a native Vermonter, who met her  husband, Andrew Heyn, in Seattle, where she attended culinary school  and worked. Blair brought Andrew to Vermont, where after working in  several local restaurants, they took over a small bakery. Their work  has been recognized locally, regionally, and nationally, in  publications including Kids VT, Yankee Magazine and over the airwaves  on National Public Radio. An article by Amelia Nierenberg in the  February 18, 2020, edition of the New York Times focuses on Blair and  Andrew's development of soft, sliced organic loaves, inspired by  Blair's effort to provide healthier bread to their son Phineas's  classmates at a local one-room schoolhouse. Small businesses like  Elmore Mountain Bread are the cornerstone of our local economies, are  fixtures in our communities, and are at the very heart of the American  dream. In recognition of Blair and Andrew's efforts, I ask that the  article ``The Whole-Grain Grail: A Sandwich Bread With Mass Appeal,''  be printed in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Feb. 18, 2020]          The Whole-Grain Grail: A Sandwich Bread With Mass Appeal                           (By Amelia Nierenberg)         Elmore, VT.--When Blair Marvin started making and selling       bread 15 years ago, she promised herself three things: She       would never preslice it. She would never bake it in a pan.       And she would certainly never sell it in plastic.        But three years ago, as she was helping out in the one-room       schoolhouse where her son, Phineas, attended first grade, she       realized she had a problem. At lunch, his friends weren't       eating sandwiches made from the stone-ground, organic loaves       she and her husband baked at Elmore Mountain Bread, and sold       in local supermarkets. Sure, the students had Vermont-churned       cheese from Vermont-raised cows. But their bread often came       from a national bread company, made from white flour or laced       with preservatives.        ``All of these preconceived notions and standards I set for       myself,'' said Ms. Marvin, 39. ``None of it mattered. If       Phineas's peers weren't eating our bread, then we were doing       something wrong.''        So she broke her vow. Using mostly whole-wheat flour,       stone-ground in a mill made by New American Stone Mills, a       company owned by her husband, Andrew Heyn, she developed a       new loaf--soft, sliced and sealed in plastic.        ``Everybody should have access to healthy food,'' she said.       ``We're trying to make something that is recognizable to the       general population. It's a way of getting real bread into       people's diets.'' Ms. Marvin and Mr. Heyn are part of a       collective of about 40 bakers, millers, teachers and wheat-      breeders who work with the Bread Lab, a famed research center       affiliated with Washington State University that has long       focused on developing wheat varieties specific to regions of       the country. Since last April, using guidelines established       by the lab, the collective has pursued a common goal: making       a whole-grain loaf that's familiar-looking and affordable       enough to appeal to a mass audience.        The Bread Lab calls it ``the approachable loaf,'' but each       bakery in the Bread Lab Collective makes a slightly different       version, informed by local tastes and local grains. Elmore       Mountain Bread calls its bread the Vermont Redeemer, after a       type of local wheat. Zingerman's Bakehouse, in Ann Arbor,       Mich., calls its loaf State St. Wheat. King Arthur Flour, an       employee-owned company in Norwich, Vt., christened its       version Just Bread and published a recipe for home bakers on       its website. It sells 350 of the loaves a week and donates       others to a food pantry, said Karen Colberg, a chief       executive at King Arthur Flour.        Whatever the name, the approachable loaf is made in 20       states, from Kalispell, Mont., to New Haven, Conn., as well       as in England, Canada and Australia. For each loaf sold, 10       cents goes back to the Bread Lab to help fund grain research.        The loaf is something of a Trojan horse, a way to sneak       healthy ingredients onto the taste buds of a younger       generation. Its disguise as a standard-issue sandwich bread       might be just the guerrilla tactic needed to get regional       whole grains integrated into the developed world's diet.        ``If it's crusty, you're not going to get soccer moms       saying, `Hey, we need to make peanut butter and jelly       sandwiches out of this,' '' said Anthony Ambeliotis, a member       of the collective who sells a version of the approachable       loaf for $4.50 at Mediterra Bakehouse, his family bakery       outside Pittsburgh.        Despite a growing interest in baking bread and declining       consumption of white bread, most loaves sold in America are       still less than ideal in nutrients and fiber. Even the whole-      grain breads that have reached a national market sometimes       contain chemical preservatives or additives, like flavor       enhancers or sugars.        ``Why is it that `affordable' has to be this hyper-      centralized, hyper-processed product?'' said Stephen Jones,       the director of the Bread Lab, standing in its flour-covered       research kitchen in Burlington, Wash., about 70 miles north       of Seattle.        Since he founded the lab in 2011, Dr. Jones has tried to       reinvent bread by promoting regional grain, breeding wheat       varieties that taste good, like heirloom strains, but have a       strong yield, like most modern hybrids. At the Grain       Gathering conference, an annual meeting he hosts at the lab,       enthusiasts and members of the collective come together to       discuss how to incorporate the lab's research into craft       baking.        ``Once, if you said, `I want to put my bread in a plastic       bag and I want it sliced,' people would be like: `I think       you're at the wrong conference,' '' said Louie Prager, an       owner of Prager Brothers Artisan Breads in San Diego, which       sold 4,800 approachable loaves last year, at $5 apiece. ``But       now, it's fine to make a bread that works better for more       people.''        In summer 2018, Dr. Jones laid out his new vision. Like Ms.       Marvin, he recognized that the collective needed to pivot and       work with, rather than against, an American palate shaped by       generations of white-bread sandwiches. To build the base       formula for the new bread, he turned to Jeff Yankellow, a       baker and the western region sales manager for King Arthur       Flour.  [[Page S1667]]         ``It's not the bricks of whole wheat bread that you think       of from the hippie days,'' Mr. Yankellow said. ``We're making       really good stuff.''        The Bread Lab has set three strict parameters for the       approachable loaf: More than 60 percent of the flour must be       whole wheat; it can't have more than seven ingredients, all       of which have to be real food, not chemical additives; and it       can't cost more than $6.        ``It's local, and I know the people who make it,'' said       Elaina Lefevre, 27, who regularly buys Ms. Marvin's loaf for       her young daughter at the Hannaford supermarket in       Morrisville, Vt. ``Five ingredients or less on a label is       what I aim for.''        Bread is among the simplest and most mundane things humans       eat. It's in our prayers: Give us this day our daily bread.       It's in our wallets: our bread and butter.        But bread has also been a catalyst for change. In 1789, the       high price of bread brought angry protesters to the streets       of Paris. In 2011, it did again, in Cairo's Tahrir Square.        ``There's nothing more revolutionary than bread,'' Dr.       Jones said. ``But there's also nothing more mundane or       pedestrian than bread. It's who we are.''        Dr. Jones often works in an apron branded with a skull and       the words ``White Sliced Death,'' armor in his crusade for       whole grains. Still, his no-hostages approach to white flour       and regional grains has earned him the respect of many in the       local-food movement.        ``I think what we're doing is radical,'' Mr. Prager said.       ``It's radical to make good, organic, clean food affordable       to more people.''        The collective has a point. It is a curious quirk of       contemporary America that a 6-year-old from Burlington, Vt.,       and a 6-year-old from Burlington, Wash., can eat entirely       identical sandwiches for lunch. Once, that would have been       impossible. Vermont bread was made with Vermont wheat, and       Washington bread was made with Washington wheat, made from       local grains ground in local mills.        But in the late 19th century, a new technology arrived from       Europe, changing American flour: roller mills, which separate       the bran--the ``whole'' part of whole wheat--from the kernel.       Without the bran's oils and proteins, the chalky ``all-      purpose flour'' that most Americans would recognize today is       inert and easier to preserve.        Although it keeps longer, white flour is less nutritious,       as the bran holds most of the kernel's fiber. Dr. Jones also       thinks it is wasteful in an agricultural system struggling to       adapt to climate change.        ``If you're a farmer and you grow 100 pounds of wheat, only       70 of it is going to be made into food,'' Dr. Jones said ``If       you wanted to raise the yield of wheat tomorrow, just eat the       whole kernel.''        Without added chemicals to keep the bread soft and mold-      free, the approachable loaf has a shelf life of about a week       before it goes stale. This requirement also helps ensure that       the bread stays local; any time spent traveling to a store       would waste precious freshness.        ``There's no reason that bread should keep for this long,''       said Dr. Jones, shaking a mass-produced loaf with a sell-by       date of June 2018 that is still soft. He keeps it in the lab       to help make his case.        Today, after millenniums as a daily staple, good bread has       almost become a luxury item. Whole-wheat flour can be       expensive, especially if it's organic. Loaves baked by hand       cost more, as bakers need to be paid for their time and       labor.        Even $6 for the approachable loaf can be a steep price for       many families. But though it's not as cheap as Wonder Bread,       the loaf is close in price to most other whole-wheat options       sold in supermarkets. Members of the collective hope that,       together, they get Americans to take bread more seriously.        ``People care about their hops and their cheese and their       coffee and their dairy and their meat, but they don't even       think twice about their grains,'' Ms. Marvin said. ``But       bread is the most broken.''                            ____________________     Madam President, Vermont's King Arthur Flour has long been  a worldwide leader in culinary circles. Today, I would like to  recognize the company's effort to produce a healthier bread, called  Just Bread. King Arthur Flour, which is an employee-owned company in  Norwich, VT, sells 350 loaves of Just Bread each week and also donates  loaves to a local food shelf, in the true tradition of Vermonters  reaching out to help others. In recognition of these efforts, I ask  that the February 18, 2020, article ``The Whole-Grain Grail: A Sandwich  Bread With Mass Appeal,'' by Amelia Nierenberg from the New York Times,  be printed in the Congressional Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Feb. 18, 2020]          The Whole-Grain Grail: A Sandwich Bread With Mass Appeal                           (By Amelia Nierenberg)         Elmore, VT.--When Blair Marvin started making and selling       bread 15 years ago, she promised herself three things: She       would never preslice it.
