 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the love, dedication,  and faithfulness of George and Norma Carpenter of Allen, Michigan.   In 1943, in the midst of a war George bravely served in, George and  Norma were married. Soon they will be celebrating their 80th  anniversary.   Throughout the years, George and Norma have continued to set an  example for our community, not only  [[Page H657]]  through their dedication to each other, but also to their faith as  devoted members of the Countryside Bible Church.   George and Norma are currently 98 and 97 years old, respectively, and  are still strong in their health as well as their love for each other.   With over 100 descendants, the Carpenters have left a tremendous mark  on the community and beyond. I would like to recognize this remarkable  couple and congratulate them as they celebrate their extraordinary  milestone.                            ____________________
