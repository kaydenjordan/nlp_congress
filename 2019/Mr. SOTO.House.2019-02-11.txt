 Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank the gentleman from  North Carolina. We in Florida all express our condolences for the loss  of Congressman Walter Jones. I thank the gentleman for bringing that  up.   Mr. Speaker, we had the longest shutdown in history caused by the  President of the United States claiming the mantel that government  needed to be shut down for his border wall. Then, finally, government  was reopened as every party came to their senses.   As we speak, Mr. Speaker, we have Senate Members and House Members  diligently negotiating a bipartisan border deal, four Republicans in  the Senate led by Senator Shelby and three Democrats led by Senator  Leahy. In the House, we have Chairwoman Nita Lowey, subcommittee  Chairwoman Roybal-Allard, Ranking Member Granger, and Ranking Member  Fleischmann.   I believe a deal is imminent, where both sides will deliver  concessions and  [[Page H1513]]  have to compromise. Yet, tonight, I heard dozens of speeches by my  friends across the aisle on the one hand pleading for a bipartisan deal  and on the other hand condemning Democrats with every other breath.   Were they not aware that there is a bipartisan negotiation happening  as we speak that their colleagues are involved in? Devoid of reality,  perhaps, or maybe it was just political scare tactics.   Mr. Speaker, when bipartisan plans come up before this body this  week, and we show that we will keep the government open and protect our  Nation, I know one other thing is for sure: My colleagues across the  aisle are going to need a new script, because these scare tactics  aren't going to work anymore.                             Black History Month     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I want to  recognize Anna M. Pinellas. Anna M. Pinellas and her husband, Louis C.  Pinellas, moved to Kissimmee, Florida, in 1981, after having worked in  local government in Washington, Maryland, and Virginia.   Having knowledge in securing funds for various projects, she was  hired by the city of Kissimmee and was able to secure grants for the  infrastructure around Osceola Square Mall, the paving of Hill Street,  and John Young Parkway, the first of those grants being $750,000.                                time  2015    She was also hired by Osceola County government to secure Federal  funds for projects, which include bringing Head Start back to Osceola  County, refurbishing the old courthouse, and the establishment of a  salary plan for Osceola County employees.   One of her primary goals was to pursue the establishment of the Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday in the city of Kissimmee, city of St.  Cloud, Osceola County, and the school board. Thirty-four years ago,  Pinellas founded Osceola Visionaries, Inc., a nonprofit corporation  devoted to honoring and celebrating Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. before  the holiday was observed.   Today, Pinellas continues to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. by  hosting their annual banquet and holding programs for the central  Florida community.   And for that, Mrs. Pinellas, we honor you.                       Recognizing Beverlye Colson Neal     Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I recognize  Beverlye Colson Neal.   Beverlye Colson Neal is the president of the Orange County branch of  the NAACP and the former executive director for the Florida State  Conference of the NAACP. She has spent most of her life fighting for  civil rights, beginning in her early childhood, as a member of the  Jacksonville Youth Council of the NAACP.   She has a wealth of experience in the field of civil rights,  community, and political organizing. Her involvement has been centered  around safeguarding the Black community.   She coordinated the 1984 GOTV efforts for the Congressional District  3 for Reverend Jesse Jackson for President of the United States,  getting the only elected Jesse Jackson delegate from Florida from that  congressional district. In 2009, she was asked by Dr. C. Delores Tucker  to start a chapter of the National Congress of Black Women, Inc. in  Florida. She has since organized five other chapters in the State. She  has been instrumental in ensuring the programs under the NCBW-Orlando  reflect the needs of Black women and their families in Orlando.   She is the mother of three adult sons--James, Odell, and Kenneth  Neal--and the proud grandmother of five grandchildren. She has a  committed passion for the work that she does in the State, and is  always working for those who are ignored or overlooked. She feels that  this is God's purpose for her life on Earth.

He was then drafted as  a first-round pick to the Los Angeles Rams, where he played his first 5  years. Since then, he has played for the Pittsburgh Steelers, New  Orleans Saints, and the Atlanta Falcons, having never missed a game.   After the NFL, Gandy focused on his foundation, The Wayne Gandy  Foundation, organized exclusively to support and promote the power of  sports in developing the qualities of leadership, social  responsibility, and excellence through the sponsorship of sports camps,  team building events, and programs that build healthy spirits, bodies,  and minds of at-risk teens.
