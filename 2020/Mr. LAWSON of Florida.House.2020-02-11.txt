 Madam Speaker, today I rise to commemorate the  120th anniversary of ``Lift Ev'ry Voice and Sing.''   This hymn was first performed this week 120 years ago by 500 school  children at the segregated Stanton School in Jacksonville, Florida.   Today this song is widely known as the Black national anthem and is  performed at churches, schools, sporting events, and meetings around  the Nation.   Brothers James Weldon Johnson and John Rosamond Johnson wrote this  song at their home in the LaVilla community of Jacksonville in the  Fifth Congressional District, the district I represent.   It was there that James Weldon penned the words that inspired hope,  strength, and faith. It also reminded us to never forget the obstacles  of the past.   I am honored to represent the birthplace of this great song that will  live on for generations to come.                            ____________________
