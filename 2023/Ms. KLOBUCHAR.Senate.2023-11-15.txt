 Mr. President, today I rise to honor and pay tribute  to Herbert ``Bertie'' Bowman who passed away on October 25, 2023, at  the age of 92 after a remarkable life and over six decades of service  to the U.S. Senate.   As has been noted by my colleague Senator Cardin, Bertie was the  embodiment of the American Dream. Bertie began his Capitol Hill career  by sweeping steps of the Capitol after running away from his South  Carolina home, where his family members were sharecroppers, following a  chance encounter with then-Senator Burnet Maybank in a Summerton, SC,  general store. Senator Maybank invited Bertie--then only 13 years old-- to come see him in Washington sometime, and that is just what he did.   A week later, Bertie hopped on a train bound for Union Station and  ended up in the Senator's office. The Senator gave him his first job-- to sweep the Capitol steps for $2 a week--and from there, he went on to  build a reputation on Capitol Hill as someone who could do it all.  According to his memoir, Bertie's mother gave him the best career  advice anyone could ask for. She said, ``Be patient and do what you're  supposed to do.''   Over his many decades in the Senate, one job led to another, and  Bertie eventually got a clerical position with the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee in 1966. He left the Senate in 1990 to run  [[Page S5537]]  his own chauffeur service, but he returned to the Foreign Relations  Committee a decade later as hearing coordinator--a job he held until  his nineties.   Through it all, Bertie exhibited the decency and courtesy that led  him to befriend all those who knew him.   I want to honor Bertie Bowman for his lifelong dedication and service  to this institution and to our democracy and to thank him for setting  the example of civility to which we all should aspire.                            ____________________
