 Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R.  5.   I am the mother of two young children who you saw stand with me in  this very Chamber 2 weeks ago, and I have near-daily conversations with  the parents in my district about their hopes and concerns. I can assure  you, they have a seat at the table in the school room, and they are not  concerned with banning books, censoring our curriculum, or dictating  what bathrooms students use.  [[Page H1367]]    Parents want increased resources for mental and behavioral health  services, inclusive school environments that foster critical thinking  and learning, and more funding to repair outdated and crumbling school  buildings and address security issues.    They want their children to learn a complete and accurate history of  our country and our world, and they want the peace of mind that their  children are safe.   Three days after my son stood with me on this floor and watched me  take the oath of office, one of his classmates shot himself  accidentally with an unsecured gun, and he died. It was a devastating  loss for our community.    It was a devastating loss for our community and the  community at large. These are the issues that matter to parents as they  deal with the mental fallout of that incident. These are the issues  they are talking about.   H.R. 5 does nothing to address these priorities. It would create  unnecessary reporting requirements and divert critical resources away  from meeting the real needs of our students and families.   I urge our colleagues to vote ``no'' on the politics over parents  act.
