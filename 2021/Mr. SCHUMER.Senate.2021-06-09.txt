 Mr. President, now, 68 to 32, that was the final vote  tally last night for the U.S. Competition and Innovation Act--USICA--an  overwhelming display of bipartisan support, a rarity on a major bill in  this Senate.   I believe the final vote reflects the importance of the bill--of  rededicating the Federal Government to science and technology; to  outcompeting our adversaries, especially the Chinese Communist Party;  to strengthening critical supply chains as well as our partnerships and  alliances abroad.   I believe that future generations will look back on this competition  bill as the turning point for American leadership in the 21st century.   I think the depth of the bipartisan support reflects the process we  took as well. The kernel of the bill is legislation I wrote with  Senator Todd Young, the Endless Frontier Act. We ultimately included  legislation from six committees and input from every Member. Over 3  weeks, the Senate considered more than 20 amendments, the vast majority  from Republicans. In fact, the Senate even accepted an amendment from  Senator Paul by voice vote. That doesn't happen too often around here.   Excluding budget resolutions, nearly as many amendments have received  [[Page S4000]]  rollcall votes on this one bill as on all the bills in 2017, when the  Republicans were in the majority--nearly as many amendment votes on  this one bill as over that entire year. We are running the Senate in a  different way.   So I want to thank my colleagues on both sides for their efforts,  Senators Cantwell and Wicker for their excellent management of the  bill, Senator Young for working with me from the beginning until the  very end, Senators Menendez and Risch as well as Murray, Durbin,  Peters, Brown, and Wyden, whom I am committing to working with to put  real teeth into the anti-censorship provisions of this bill before it  becomes law. Senator Wyden has been a hallmark on that.   Of course, the job is not done until the legislation moves through  the House and onto the President's desk.   Now that the bill has passed the Senate, we are going to work with  Speaker Pelosi and the relevant committee chairs in the House to move  this bill forward as quickly as possible.   Of course, the House can bring in additional priorities, but I am  intent on seeing the major thrust of this legislation become law. The  bill is so important to the future of America that the House and Senate  must come together and send President Biden a bill he is very, very  eager to sign.   Yesterday, the Senate took a bold, strong step toward boosting  American science, technology, and innovation for decades. We are going  to keep at it, keep at it until we cross the finish line.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 266, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, that the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10:30 a.m.,  Thursday, June 10; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that upon conclusion of  morning business, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Quraishi nomination; further, that the cloture  vote on the Jackson nomination occur immediately following the cloture  vote on the Quraishi nomination; that if cloture is invoked on the  Quraishi nomination, all time expire at 1:45 p.m.; finally, that if any  of the nominations are confirmed, that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   I wish everyone a nice evening.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 5:02 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, June 10, 2021, at 10:30 a.m.  [[Page S4022]]                                ____________________
