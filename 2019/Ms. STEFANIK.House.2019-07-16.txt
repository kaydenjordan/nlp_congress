 Mr. Chair, I am proud to rise in support of this year's  Intelligence Authorization Act.   After the recent partisan NDAA debate and vote, it is an  accomplishment that this committee came together to produce a  bipartisan bill that supports our intelligence community and provides  the warfighter with the intelligence support needed to protect the  United States and our allies.    I am particularly pleased that this bill contains the  Counterintelligence Accountability Act that I introduced earlier this  year that I wanted to take a moment to highlight for the American  public.   This bill amends the National Security Act by requiring the FBI to  provide quarterly counterintelligence briefings to the congressional  intelligence committees, which is not only necessary for us to conduct  meaningful oversight over the FBI's counterintelligence operations, but  also provides the American people with the comfort that the FBI is  subject to the same types of scrutiny as other intelligence agencies.   Importantly, this bill also mandates that the FBI notify the  congressional intelligence committees when the FBI has a  counterintelligence investigation open related to a CI risk to an  election or campaign for Federal office.   Given former FBI Director Comey's testimony in 2017, I am still  deeply concerned that the FBI failed to provide notification to the  congressional intelligence committees regarding the investigation  opened into the Trump campaign in 2016 until well after the election.   This bill ensures that Congress is kept fully and currently informed  of these types of counterintelligence activities. This is good,  accountable governance.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the chair and ranking member's support in  adding my legislation into this bill and urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes'' on final passage.
