 Mr. President, for 50 years, the Vermont State Housing  Authority, VSHA, has helped make available secure, safe, and affordable  housing in my home State of Vermont.  [[Page S1785]]  Founded in 1968, the Vermont State Housing Authority provides thousands  of Vermonters with the resources they need to find housing that works  for them. As the first statewide housing authority in the Nation, VSHA  was a pioneer in the field, as they built a successful program from the  ground up without existing State models or best practices to replicate.   Not only does VSHA help Vermonters of all ages and backgrounds find a  home through Federal or State programs, they also provide critical  support to those who need it most. The VSHA offers a variety of  assistance and resources to the refugee population that has settled in  Vermont, including free interpreter services and the promise of a  friendly face ready to help navigate a new beginning in an unfamiliar  culture. Further, VSHA staff make what can be a frightening transition  more tailored, personal, and comfortable--helping new citizens  acclimate and assimilate into their new communities.   From connecting families in need with resources from the Department  of Housing and Urban Development to developing innovative programs that  inspire self-sufficiency and long-term independence, to promoting  affordable housing for veterans, VSHA is involved in every community in  Vermont. VSHA, though the Family Self-Sufficiency Program, helps  families achieve economic stability and independence. As of the fall of  last year, the program has graduated 194 people and has assisted a  total of 153 Vermonters in becoming first-time homeowners through the  homeownership program. While homeownership is a critical piece of  building wealth and a hallmark of the American dream, it is often a far  off dream for many families who struggle just to find a stable and  affordable place to call home.   As more and more families struggle to make ends meet, especially when  affordable units are few and far in between and housing prices continue  to rise, the team at VSHA, led by their executive director of more than  30 years, Richard Williams, has worked hard to ensure that we work to  meet the needs of our community. Though support for our most vulnerable  populations is first and foremost in the minds of the VSHA team, it is  clear that civic engagement and involvement plays a large role as well.  The VSHA is involved in partnerships with dozens of Vermont nonprofit  organizations, State and Federal agencies, and private sector  businesses. Through their work rehabilitating and managing buildings,  VSHA has revitalized our communities and downtowns one by one.   The Vermont State Housing Authority has made a lasting difference in  the lives of Vermonters across our great State. For that, I thank them.  On behalf of all Vermonters, congratulations on 50 years of hard work,  dedication, and outstanding commitment to those you serve.                            ____________________     Mr. President, my wife, Marcelle, and I thoroughly enjoyed  reading about the Wayside's 100th anniversary.   I remember when my sister, Mary, brother, John, and I would go with  my parents, Howard and Alba Leahy, for a special treat: Sunday after  church, we would go to the Wayside for lunch.   I remember my mother speaking Italian with some of the people there,  but it was particularly special because of the fact that we would see  everybody we knew from Montpelier and Barre, where my father was born.   Even today, I hold those memories from when I was a child, and I have  thought of them every time Marcelle and I have brought our children,  and now our grandchildren, for lunch at the Wayside. This is one of the  institutions that makes Vermont the most special place in our country.   I ask unanimous consent that a press release commemorating the 100th  anniversary of the Wayside Restaurant be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                              [Feb. 16, 2018]        2018 Marks Vermont's Wayside Restaurant's 100th Anniversary         Montpelier.--In 1918, the Allies declared victory in World       War 1, Babe Ruth pitched 29\1/3\ scoreless innings for the       Red Sox in the World Series, Woodrow Wilson was President,       color movies were invented, and Effie Ballou opened the       Wayside on the Barre-Montpelier Road.        Originally just a roadside eatery, the Wayside Restaurant       has withstood the test of time and is ready to celebrate its       100th Anniversary this year! In an industry where 70 percent       of all restaurants fail after 10 years, the Wayside has       defied the odds.        Throughout the year, there will be meal and dessert       specials. In July, the actual month the Wayside opened; there       will be a Customer Appreciation Party on July 29th from 6:30       p.m. to 9:30 p.m. The Wayside Creamery will host a free Ice       Cream Social and at sundown all guests will be treated to a       special fireworks display! Be sure to save the date.        For those who want to learn more about the Wayside and its       long history go to www.WaysideRestaurant.com. There is also a       new book on sale at the restaurant commemorating their 100th       Anniversary titled, It's Worth The Ride To The Wayside:       Celebrating 100 Years with Anniversary Ale, Yankee Cooking       and Ice Cream. And yes, the book includes several of the       Wayside's delicious comfort food recipes!                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I am proud to once again join with  Senator Collins to introduce the bipartisan Runaway and Homeless Youth  and Trafficking Prevention Act. Senator Collins and I have championed  this effort together for years now, and I thank her for her thoughtful  and steadfast advocacy and constructive contribution throughout our  efforts. Our bill will extend for five years key programs authorized by  the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, and expand and improve the programs  and services that are vital--and sometimes lifesaving--resources and  safe havens for at risk youth in our home states and across the  country.   Runaway and homeless youth are significantly more likely to become  victims of sexual abuse and trafficking. Our bill ensures that service  providers, who are the bedrock of the support system for runaway and  homeless youth, have the information, training, and resources they need  to identify and serve youth that have been victims of trauma. This  includes connecting the youth with appropriate additional services to  ensure their physical and mental health and safety.   The bill reauthorizes and expands programs and guidance that help  providers reunify youth with their families and loved ones, or, if not  possible, provide a tailored and comprehensive support system to help  them get back on their feet or on a path to self-sufficiency. The  spectrum of support services include emergency and transitional  housing--because the first step is having a safe place to stay. They  also include training and counseling relating to physical and mental  health care, financial literacy, and workforce training. Runaway and  Homeless Youth providers are there for the youth every step of the way,  supporting them and connecting them to their community and to available  resources. Our reauthorization adds completion of the Free Application  for Financial Student Aid (FAFSA) form to the available assistance to  help youth who wish to pursue advanced educational opportunities  realize their goals.   Finally, our bill ensures that no child can be discriminated against  in trying to gain access to access services or housing through Runaway  and Homeless Youth programs. It is unconscionable to turn away any  child in need--gay, straight, black or white. These are our Nation's  most vulnerable youth and they must all feel welcome. In many cases,  Runaway and Homeless Youth programs can be a last resort. We cannot let  one child fall through the cracks in our support system.   In Vermont alone, the Vermont Coalition of Runaway and Homeless Youth  Programs served 500 young people in need of housing supports in Fiscal  Year 2017. Vermont is the seventh most expensive State to live in for  rural areas, and ranks within the top five States for the largest  shortfall between housing wage and renter wage. As youth and families  struggle to make ends meet in Vermont and across the Nation, these  programs and support systems are more important than ever. We must  invest the resources to ensure our youth have a safe place to go and  the resources they need to become self-sufficient.   Senator Collins and I know just how dangerous and unpredictable the  weather can be in the Northeast. In fact, we are getting hit with yet  another nor'easter complete with fresh snow this week. No child in  either of our states, or anywhere in the United States, should have to  call the street home. The bill we are introducing today will help  ensure our nation's children have a safe place to stay and have the  support they need to grow, learn, and thrive.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I am proud to once again join with  Senator Collins to introduce the bipartisan Runaway and Homeless Youth  and Trafficking Prevention Act.
