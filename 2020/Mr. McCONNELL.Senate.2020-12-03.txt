 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, anyone who has heard me speak about  coronavirus relief going back months has heard one central principle:  Let's deliver right away on all the subjects where everybody agrees and  argue over the rest later. The solution to this impasse has been in  plain sight for a long time now for anybody willing to see it: Agree  where we agree, bank that progress, make law, take a whole lot of  pressure off struggling people, and then keep debating the areas where  we don't agree.   There is no actual reason why the fates of commonsense policies like  a second round of the job-saving Paycheck Protection Program had to be  linked to the fates of fringe proposals like stimulus checks for  illegal immigrants. There is no reason why the fate of funding for  vaccine distribution or extending unemployment aid or legal certainties  for universities should have been tied to radical ideas like paying  people more not to work than essential workers earn on the job.   These linkages have been totally arbitrary, just a political decision  that Democratic leaders made many months back. Democratic leaders have  tried to create a narrative where it is taken for granted that the most  bipartisan, commonsensical relief policies would live or die with their  side's most outlandish ideas. Well, that just isn't so.   They have tried to create a dynamic where they move from one made-up  number to a second slightly smaller arbitrary number and call it a  meaningful concession. The truth is simple. This has always been about  policy differences. We have two sides with two different visions for  the best way to support our Nation through what we hope will be the  last chapter of the pandemic.   That isn't new. We have disagreements all the time. Our system can  handle disagreements, but both sides have to be willing to compile  their  [[Page S7192]]  commonalities and make law here, and, up to now, our Democratic  colleagues have declined to do that.   Remember, their side said in March this pandemic was ``a tremendous  opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.'' So when  Republicans tried to pass commonsense relief measures in July, in  September, and in October, as well, our Democratic colleagues actually  blocked policies they do not even oppose.   It has been heartening to see a few hopeful signs in the past few  days. After months of arbitrary attachment to sky-high dollar amounts  that the Speaker of the House claimed were essential--that it would be  an insult to settle for a nickel less--those baseless claims have  suddenly evaporated.   That is at least movement in the right direction, but the underlying  reality is still with us. There are many important policies that have  strong bipartisan support. There are many others that do not, and the  way to help the country is for our Democratic colleagues to finally let  the former group be signed into law while we keep arguing over the  rest.   The targeted second round of paycheck protection that we have been  trying to establish since July would help a huge number of small  businesses survive to the finish line and help huge numbers of workers  to keep their jobs. And it can pass the Senate today, probably with 95  votes.   With the apparent success of Operation Warp Speed, it makes no sense  to skimp on the systems to distribute and deliver vaccines around the  country. Those funds could pass the Senate today, possibly unanimously.   University presidents have made it clear they need certainty for  their reopenings. Let me say that again. University presidents have  made it clear they need legal certainty for their reopenings. That  shouldn't be partisan. Liability protections should be able to pass the  Senate today.   A number of our Democratic colleagues have focused especially on  several of the unemployment relief programs that are set to expire in a  matter of days. I specifically made sure to include those programs in  my framework a few days ago. That extension could pass the Senate  today.   The House of Representatives is spending this week on pressing issues  like marijuana--marijuana--you know, serious and important legislation  befitting this national crisis. But here in the Senate, I put forward a  serious and highly targeted relief proposal including the elements  which we know the President is ready and willing to sign into law. Why  should these impactful and noncontroversial life preservers be delayed  one second longer?   At long last, let's do what Congress does when we want an outcome.  Let's make law on all the subjects where we agree and on all the areas  where President Trump is ready to sign bipartisan relief into law.   I promise, our deep differences will still be here to debate. Our  disagreements will be right where we left them. But do you know what  can't wait? What can't wait are American workers, American small  businesses, K-12 schools, the vulnerable Americans and frontline  healthcare workers for whom speedy vaccine distribution will literally  be a life-or-death matter.   Yesterday, my home State of Kentucky experienced yet another  dreadful--dreadful--record-setting day. But Kentuckians also know that  hope is in sight. Our State's workers are standing by at the UPS  Worldport in Louisville and the DHL Express American Hub in northern  Kentucky, key logistics centers that will play crucial roles in sending  vaccines all around the country.   Our people are hurting, but they are ready to finish this fight.  Congress should not keep them waiting for reinforcements that should  have arrived literally months ago.   So compromise is within reach. We know where we agree. We can do  this. Let me say it again. We can do this, and we need to do this. So  let's be about actually making a law                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 649.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 911.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the  distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a  resolution authorizing representation by the Senate Legal Counsel and  ask for its immediate consideration.    Mr. President, this resolution concerns a civil action  pending in New York federal court against Senator Feinstein. In this  lawsuit, the pro se plaintiff asserts a jumble of confusing allegations  claiming that local government officials in California have assaulted  him and taken his property. He appears to sue Senator Feinstein because  he wrote to her for assistance, and she did not take sufficient action  to satisfy plaintiff. Plaintiff's suit is subject to dismissal on  jurisdictional grounds and failure to state a claim. This resolution  would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent Senator Feinstein  in order to seek dismissal of this suit.                            ____________________
