 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the  previous question.   The House should focus on our constitutional responsibility to fund  the government and provide for our national defense.   Current government funding runs out in 29 days. But instead of  finalizing the National Defense Authorization Act or Defense  appropriations bill, we are debating partisan messaging bills and  distracted by an impeachment process that lacks any semblance of  transparency.   Last year, Republicans made defense their highest priority. The  Defense appropriations bill was law before the end of the fiscal year,  and the NDAA was signed in August. This year, the NDAA has been in  conference for more than a month, and the House last acted on Defense  appropriations in June.   China and Russia aren't slowing down their defense buildup. Why  should we handicap our own military and allow our enemies to take  advantage of our distraction? This is dangerous and shortsighted.   Our highest priority must be keeping the government functioning and  the Defense Department fully funded. This House must focus on providing  for our national defense and work with our colleagues in the Senate and  the White House.   In order to achieve this goal, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous  question, a ``no'' vote on the rule, and a ``no'' vote on the  underlying measure.
