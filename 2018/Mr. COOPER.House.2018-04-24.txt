 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the victims of a  deadly mass shooting at a Waffle House in Antioch, Tennessee, early on  the morning of Sunday, April 22.   Four young, promising lives were lost: Joe R. Perez, DeEbony Groves,  Taurean C. Sanderlin, and Akilah DaSilva. They crossed paths at the  restaurant expecting nothing more than good food. Now four young lives  are lost, and we mourn with their families and friends.   I would also like to recognize Mr. James Shaw, Jr., a native  Nashvillian and an American hero. Mr. Shaw bravely stopped this attack  from being even worse. His courageous and decisive action saved many  lives. Now, Mr. Shaw doesn't consider himself a hero, but his actions  clearly prove that he is a hero. He gave us hope on one of our darkest  days.   We are heartbroken for the tragic loss of life, but we are heartened  and proud of our hometown hero. May we remember Mr. Shaw's words:         I hope that we can bring violence to an end in all facets,       not just gun violence, but all violence.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the victims of a deadly mass  shooting at a Waffle House in Antioch, Tennessee, on the morning of  Sunday, April 22.   Four young, promising lives were lost, and two other people were  injured. Today we mourn Joe R. Perez, 20 years old, who moved to  Nashville to live with his grandmother and work at his brother's  business; DeEbony Groves, 21, a senior at Belmont University who was  weeks from earning a degree in social work; Taurean C. Sanderlin, 29, a  Waffle House employee who was outside on a break; and Akilah DaSilva,  23, a student and aspiring musician. They crossed paths at the Waffle  House, expecting nothing more than good food. Now, four young lives are  lost. We mourn with their families, friends, and the Antioch community.  [[Page H3496]]    I would also like to recognize Mr. James Shaw, Jr. a native  Nashvillian and an American hero. Mr. Shaw bravely stopped this attack  from being even worse. His courageous and decisive actions saved many  lives. In Mr. Shaw's own words, he ``saw an opportunity and took it.''   Later Sunday morning, after receiving treatment for his own injuries,  Mr. Shaw went home to see his family. He is a loving father to his 4- year-old daughter, Brooklyn. He then went to the church he has attended  since he was a baby. Mr. Shaw's greatest concern is for the other  victims, and he has organized a fund to support them.   Mr. Shaw doesn't consider himself a hero, but his actions clearly  prove otherwise. Mr. Shaw gave us hope on one of Nashville's darkest  days, and he embodies the very best of our community. We are forever  grateful for his bravery and his willingness to put his own life at  risk in order to save others.   We are both heartbroken for the tragic loss of lives but proud of our  hometown hero. This tragedy will not define our city. We are grateful  to people all across America who have supported our community with  prayers and financial support.   May we all remember Mr. Shaw's words: ``I hope we can bring violence  in all facets--not just gun violence, but all facets of violence--to an  end.''                            ____________________
