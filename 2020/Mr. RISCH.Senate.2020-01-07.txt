 Madam President, I wish to commemorate the life of David  Blee, who tragically passed away on December 29, 2019, at the age of  66. David was the founder and president of the United States Nuclear  Industry Council, USNIC. During his long and distinguished career in  the nuclear industry, David concentrated on nuclear supply chain and  reactor technology and actively worked to increase support for nuclear  power in the United States and abroad. David also worked with the  National Laboratories, including Idaho National Laboratory, often  running conferences in conjunction with them. At the time of his  passing, David held an appointment to the U.S. Department of Commerce's  Civil Nuclear Trade Advisory Committee, CINTAC, an achievement that  spoke to his incredible expertise.   David graduated from Dickinson College in Pennsylvania with a degree  in economics, but he soon began working in politics and public service.  After managing several political campaigns, David became chief of staff  to former Representative and Senator Connie Mack while Mack served in  the House of Representatives. David then served as a Deputy Assistant  Secretary and, later, Director of Public Affairs for the U.S.  Department of Energy during the Reagan administration. He also served  as the executive vice president for NAC International, a U.S.-based  energy services and technology company, where he directed the company's  worldwide consulting group and marketing and business development  portfolios.   One of David's best attributes was his ability to work with people  and bring organizations together. Composed of over 80 companies, USNIC  represents the ``who's who'' of the nuclear energy supply chain,  including technology developers, fuel cycle companies, and others that  demonstrate the importance of maintaining the nuclear industry. These  companies working in conjunction would not have been possible without  the dedicated effort of David Blee. In July of last year, I was honored  to be presented with the U.S. Nuclear Energy Distinguished Leadership  Award by USNIC. The coalition of groups attending that award ceremony  personified the great unifying effect that David had on the nuclear  industry. He was a leader and a motivator, and his advocacy for the  nuclear industry will be remembered. I am grateful for the work that he  completed during his lifetime and his lasting legacy as a respected  leader in the nuclear field.                            ____________________     Madam President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today I am pleased to honor Pocatello Electric located in Pocatello as  the Idaho Small Business of the Month for January 2020.   Max Schaefer opened Pocatello Electric in 1902 and sold the business  to Ed Hall in the 1930s. The business became well known for its ``free  air and water at the curb,'' which meant air for automobile tires and  water for horses. Al Vigliaturo began working at Pocatello Electric in  1947 and eventually bought the business from Hall in 1973. Vigliaturo's  son and daughter-in-law, Mike and Suzie Vigliaturo, bought the business  in 1989 and continue to run daily operations.   Pocatello Electric offers a wide range of home appliances, accessory  items, and mattresses for purchase in its 7,500-square-foot showroom in  historic Old Town Pocatello. For more than 117 years, the business has  remained committed to providing exceptional customer service. Employees  assess the needs of each customer to ensure buyers select products that  will fit their unique needs. The delivery team provides professional  delivery and installation, and the service team provides continued  service and repairs for all products purchased in-store. Pocatello  Electric has received the Idaho State Journal's Readers' Choice Award  for best appliance store each year since 2004 and its best customer  service award 3 years in a row. The business recently hosted a No Child  Hungry event, which brought the Pocatello community together to pack  10,000 meals that were delivered to local food pantries, homeless  shelters, and soup kitchens.   Congratulations to Mike Vigliaturo and all of the employees at  Pocatello Electric for being selected as the Idaho Small Business of  the Month for January 2020. You make our great State proud, and I look  forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
