 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 5, the Parents Bill  of Rights Act.   I am the father of 6 children and the grandfather of 16  grandchildren. I am also the son of two educators. I know from  experience that students succeed when parents and educators work  together.   Between crippling learning loss, school closures, and now teacher  strikes, our kids have been through enough. They don't stand a chance  if parents are kicked out of the driver's seat. Moms and dads are the  primary stakeholders in a child's education, not the government,  period. They have a God-given right to be involved in their child's  education and development, especially in the classroom.   Under the one-party Democratic rule in Washington, parents have been  left behind, kept out of the classroom, and even labeled and targeted  as domestic terrorists by the Biden DOJ. In Biden's America, parents  come last.   Under the House Republican majority, we are supporting parents and  fulfilling our commitment to America by making sure moms and dads have  a seat at the table.   The Parents Bill of Rights Act is just good, old-fashioned common  sense, and here is the truth of the Parents Bill of Rights Act. Parents  have a right to know what is being taught in schools and to see the  reading materials. Parents have a right to be heard. Parents have a  right to see the school budget and spending. Parents have a right to  protect their child's privacy. Parents have a right to be updated on  any violent activity at school.   Unfortunately, in committee, 17 Democrats opposed protecting these  God-given parental rights. Just remember: Parental rights are  nonnegotiable.   Mr. Chair, I am proud to vote ``yes'' on the Parents Bill of Rights  Act, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.
