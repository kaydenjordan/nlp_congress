 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to add my  voice to many around the world who remember our dear friend and our  colleague John McCain.   John McCain was a man of the highest character, courage, and  credibility, known for his stubborn courage and his heroic patriotism.  He leaves a legacy of unquestioned devotion and love for his country  and his family.   When I first came to the Senate, John was very welcoming. He knew I  had been an orthopedic surgeon, and he told me I really ought to take a  look at his x rays. Of course, the x rays showed the many fractures  which were the result of being shot down over Hanoi and the injuries  that resulted from the crash and the subsequent beatings as a prisoner  of war. It was out of pure generosity on his part that we became  friends and traveling companions.   John took great pride in this institution and in knowing that none of  us in this body of 100--left or right, Republican or Democrat,  conservative or liberal--none of us agreed with him 100 percent of the  time. But every one of us respected him and the strength of his  convictions. I always have.   Probably no one knows the first person to give him the nickname  ``Maverick,'' but he certainly lived up to it. For John, it wasn't  about playing a character on television. For him, there was no  switching between a public and a private persona; he was the same when  the cameras were off as when they were on.   His voice would thunder on the Senate floor when he was stirred to  outrage, with incredible force and conviction, and so he came to  another affectionate name--``Hurricane McCain.''   His humor was legendary. He used his biting humor like a surface-to- air missile.  [[Page S5995]]    We all know his incredible biography--the courage he showed as a  naval officer and as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. It was a story that  inspired millions of people around the world. I could see it when we  traveled the world together. We would visit American troops overseas,  and it was incredible to see the respect he commanded no matter where  he went.   Mr. President, you served time in the military. You have been  deployed. You know what it is like to be there and when someone from  home comes to thank you and support you and make sure you have  everything you need. Our men and women in uniform looked at him in awe,  and they hung on his every word. Foreign leaders did the same. John  really was a reassuring figure around the world.   My first trip with John was Thanksgiving 2007. It was before he was  the nominee for President. He was actually trailing significantly in  the polls. We went to Iraq during the surge. We spent the day in  Baghdad and in other locations, and then in the dark of night, we flew  out into the Anbar Province, where his son, a marine grunt, was  serving.   We had Thanksgiving dinner with a number of the soldiers. When John  got to see his son, he went to hug him, to lift his arms, but because  of the orthopedic injuries he had sustained, until the end of his life,  he was unable to really lift his arms due to the fractures. He was up  on his toes trying to hug his son in the Anbar Province of Iraq. I had  a chance to have dinner with six Wyoming soldiers that evening. They  had only one request of me: Could I introduce them to Senator McCain?   Our final trip was over Memorial Day this past year, 2017. It was to  Vietnam. We went to the lake where he had been shot down. It was a  bipartisan group. Senator Coons from Delaware was along. We went to the  Hanoi prison where he spent 5\1/2\ years. We saw the cell. We also went  to the Presidential Palace. No matter where we went, he was met with a  hero's welcome. I don't know how many people could have sustained and  survived 5\1/2\ years in that prison with the beatings. It took a man  of incredible courage and character, and he gained credibility, as well  as a certainty for his own life.   We also went to Cam Ranh Bay during that trip to Vietnam. Many  Vietnam war veterans have been through that area. They brought in the  USS John McCain, the ship named after his father and his grandfather.  While there, we had a luncheon on the deck of the ship, and it was  called McCain Field. He was greeted warmly by everyone, and he greeted  them just as warmly.   Every Senator who ever traveled with Senator McCain shared a common  experience; it was being approached by someone on the street or in a  restaurant and being asked: Are you with Senator McCain? Of course we  would say yes. Then they would hand us a cell phone and say: Could you  please take a picture of me with Senator McCain. Of course we always  said yes. You could see the reverence and respect each of these  individuals had for Senator McCain.   People also respected his incredible legacy of service, his strength  as one of the fiercest legislators in our history. It is fitting that  just a few weeks ago, Congress paid tribute to him by passing the John  S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019  because we all know that caring for the military was an abiding concern  in his career. He wanted to make sure that the men and women in uniform  were treated fairly by the government, that they were respected, and  that they were honored for their service.    We get used to using the language of combat around here in all sorts  of other areas where it doesn't really belong. We talk about fierce  political battles. We talk about hard-fought election campaigns. But as  someone who knew what real battles looked like, John had a realistic  perspective on the political kind of battle. He took them seriously,  and he never engaged in a fight where he didn't believe that he was on  the side of right.   He never tired of ridiculing what he saw as wasteful government  spending.   Every soldier, every sailor, every airman knows that none of us are  indispensable. We serve our mission, and if we fall, another will step  up to take our place. John understood that truth also about public  service.   I think John would also understand the sincerity of the grief that  the Members of this Senate are feeling today.   I remember vividly the last time I saw John McCain. I went to visit  him and his wife Cindy at the ranch in Sedona. I will tell you, John  and Cindy have been so kind to my wife Bobbi when we have visited the  ranch in the past. I remember John taking my wife Bobbi on a tour of  the many historic trees on the ranch. John has also been so very kind  to my daughter Emma on her visits in Washington and some of her travels  with me.   Let me assure you about Cindy McCain. Cindy is also an American of  great strength and great courage. When I was there, we sat together and  we talked about the Senate, about his beloved Arizona, about the past  and actually about the future as well, and about the places around the  world we had visited together.   Senator McCain was a great lover and student of history. We talked of  Teddy Roosevelt's ``Man in the Arena'' speech. It was one that he knew  quite well, he knew by heart.         It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out       how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could       have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is       actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat       and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes up       short again and again . . . who knows great enthusiasms, the       great devotions; who spends his life in a worthy cause; who       at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement       . . . and who . . . if he fails, at least fails while daring       greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and       timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.    John McCain knew both. He knew victory, and he knew defeat. John  McCain was the man in the arena.   Mostly, John and I sat and enjoyed the view of the river, the trees,  and the red rocks. I know that view was one of his great joys, the  peace and serenity of a hard landscape shaped by years of wear and  weather. Think about that--the serenity of a hard landscape shaped by  years of wear and weather. People will see all sorts of symbolism in  that hard landscape shaped by years of wear and weather, but if John  had heard me say that, he would have said: Whiskey Tango Foxtrot--get  to the point. So I will.   John McCain was the conscience of the Senate. He served the American  people and the Senate on his own terms. He left us on his own terms as  well. We grieve him today because, for us, it just was not enough time.  That is the thing about our heroes--we start to believe they will live  on forever, but of course they do not.   Ronald Reagan's final letter to the American people said this:         When the Lord calls me home, whenever that may be, I will       leave with the greatest love for this country of ours and       eternal optimism for its future.    John McCain has left this world, I can assure you, with the greatest  love for this country of ours and eternal optimism for the future.   Rest in peace, my friend John McCain. Rest in peace.
