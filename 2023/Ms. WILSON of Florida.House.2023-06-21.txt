 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to MAGA  Republicans' attempts to override the President's veto and kill his  student debt relief plan for millions of Americans. It is the height of  hypocrisy.   Listen to this: We didn't hear a peep from the Republicans when we  bailed out the auto industry. They even nicknamed Detroit ``Government  Motors''.   We didn't hear a peep when they bailed out the airlines, or the  farmers, and not a word when Members of Congress' PPP loans were  forgiven.   We bailed out Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank just the other  day. No one said a mumbling word.   When Republicans controlled both Chambers and the White House in  2017, they gave billionaires $1.7 trillion in tax breaks. Shameful.   But when we decide to bail out the students, the hardworking, want- to-be-somebody college graduates who contribute to the economy, all  hell breaks loose, and Republicans are outraged.   I know people in their sixties and seventies who still owe student  loan debt, and the principal has never changed. But I will keep  fighting because every American should have a fair chance to succeed.  It is a shame where our country's priorities lie.
