 Mr. President, Rube Goldberg was an American sculptor,  cartoonist, and inventor best known for his cartoons that created very  complicated machines to do very simple tasks.   Today, we have heard from Mitch McConnell that he wants to emulate  Rube Goldberg and put our entire national economy at risk by an  extraordinarily complicated method to do a simple task, and the simple  task was laid out so clearly in 2006. The minority leader said we are  in exactly the same position now as we were then. Well, yes. The  Republicans asked the Democrats to not filibuster so that they could  raise the debt limit. The tables are turned. The simple same courtesy  takes away the risk to our economy.   The risk is great for disaster relief, for Medicaid, for payments to  our veterans, for payments to our currently serving forces; and there  are broader risks, risks that Mark Zandi has laid out, in saying a  recession could result in the loss of millions of jobs, that it could  result in the loss of a half a billion dollars in family wealth, that  it could be--or $15 trillion in household wealth--$15 trillion.   There are moments when the political games have to stop, when the  partisan warfare has to stop. The Democrats did what the Republicans  suggested in 2006. We also took an alternative method that Mitch  McConnell suggested in the past, which was to let, in 2011, the  President raise the debt ceiling subject to an override by Congress. We  have twice worked with the Republicans, at their request, for a simple  method. This is not the moment for a Rube Goldberg disaster with the  wealth and health of Americans at risk.   I thank the Presiding Officer.
