 Mr. Speaker, one in two, the number of  Delawareans living with a preexisting condition, including cancer  survivors and those with chronic diseases.   Before the Affordable Care Act, having a preexisting condition meant  your access to healthcare was in jeopardy. You could be charged  unaffordable premiums with limited benefits or denied coverage  outright. Because of the ACA, the fear of not being able to find  coverage has been replaced with the guarantee of lifesaving  protections.   To those who want to roll back those protections, I ask you to think  about the Delawareans caring for a newborn with congenital heart  disease, those struggling to overcome substance use disorder, or the  many monitoring their blood sugar up to 10 times a day.   Just 9 years ago, this body rightfully promised to protect those very  people. I urge my colleagues to stand with me in defending strong  protections for people with preexisting conditions and reject efforts  to turn back the clock on millions of Americans and their families.                            ____________________
