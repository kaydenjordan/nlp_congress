 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 605,  to honor the life and impact of John H. Johnson.   Though he was born in Arkansas, and known for his work in Chicago,  Johnson's impact isn't limited by geography. In fact, in the village of  Harlem, his work is beloved. He was a trailblazer of African-American  media, starting his first magazine at 24, going on to have an  internationally acclaimed career in publishing, with magazines like  Ebony and Jet being globally renowned and internationally recognizable  to this very day.   Madam Speaker, Johnson said that you have to change images before you  can change acts and institutions--and changing acts and institutions,  he did.   The impact Johnson had on his community and the world of media cannot  be understated, and still serves as a role model of perseverance and  success to this very day, inspiring the next generation of Black and  Brown leaders.   November 1 is celebrated in Arkansas as John H. Johnson Day. With  great pride, I rise today to support this resolution, but he is also  revered and loved in the village of Harlem.                            ____________________
