 Madam President, with just a few hours to spare, the  Senate is now in a position to prevent a harmful and unnecessary  government shutdown.   As I have said for weeks, the clearest path forward has been to pass  a straightforward, short-term funding extension that gives us time to  continue a number of important discussions about outstanding  priorities, from securing supplemental relief for victims of natural  disasters to restoring security and sanity at the southern border that  the Biden administration has dragged into chaos, to putting stronger  restraints on the President's reckless spending to supplying Ukraine  with even more of the lethal assistance it needs to repel Russia's  invasion.   On that particular point, most Senate Republicans remain committed to  helping our friends on the frontlines, to investing more heavily in  American strength that reinforces our allies, and deterring our top  strategic adversary, China.   I am confident the Senate will pass further urgent assistance to  Ukraine later this year. But let's be clear. The alternative to our  action today, an entirely avoidable government shutdown, would not just  pause our progress on these important priorities, it would actually set  them back. And in the process, it would saddle the people we represent  with unnecessary hardships.   So I am glad our colleagues in the House have taken action on a  continuing resolution that keeps critical government functions going at  their current rates of operation.   Passing this measure and keeping the lights on will allow us to  return our attention to making headway on full-year appropriations our  colleagues have been working on, literally, for months. And it will  give us the flexibility to meet urgent supplemental priorities both at  home and abroad.   Therefore, I would urge our colleagues to join me in supporting this  important step in the right direction.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the title of the bill  for the third time.   The bill was ordered to a third reading and was read the third time.                              Vote on H.R. 5860    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill having been read the third time,  the question is, Shall the bill pass?
