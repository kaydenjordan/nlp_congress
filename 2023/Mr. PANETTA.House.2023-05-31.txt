 Mr. Speaker, I support the bipartisan budget agreement  to raise the debt ceiling because if we don't, we will devastate the  global markets and undermine the faith of the world's most important  financial system, the United States of America.   I support a clean raising of the debt ceiling, but elections have  consequences. My colleagues on the other side wanted to use their  leverage for concessions. In a divided government, governing means  compromise, and it gets us this bill, legislation that would: one,  raise the debt ceiling until 2025; two, stop the drastic cuts desired  by the Republicans and protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.   Although it limits SNAP for certain ages, it expands those types of  benefits for veterans and our homeless.   Finally, we protect the historic legislation we passed last Congress  to invest in our infrastructure and manufacturing, reduce drug costs,  and care for veterans. Part of this bill even furthers our transition  to clean energy.   I will vote for this bill, but we have a lot more to do if we want to  get serious about reducing our debt and deficit. That only begins when  we stop governing by crisis and start governing by leadership.
