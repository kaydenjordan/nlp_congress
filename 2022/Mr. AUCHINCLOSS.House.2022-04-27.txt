 Madam Speaker, I rise today to encourage my  colleagues to pass a bill recognizing that viruses don't respect  borders and that the United States has a moral imperative to lead the  world in vaccine diplomacy.   The only way to reach our goal of a 70 percent vaccination rate  worldwide is to fund global vaccination efforts. We have the best  vaccines in the world, and plenty of them, but we lack the political  will to use them. Without this funding, people around the world will  die, and future variants and surges will be more likely here at home.   I implore my colleagues to fund global COVID vaccinations and  treatments. A supplemental relief bill that does not fund global  vaccinations is not a bill that prevents and prepares for COVID surges.  It would be a humanitarian setback and a threat to the American  recovery.                            ____________________
