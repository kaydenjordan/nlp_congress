 Mr. Speaker, I am here before a relatively empty Chamber, as  is too often the case in the people's House, as I want to raise to the  attention of the American people the absolute crisis and tragedy that  is occurring on the southern border of the United States. It is  unconscionable what we are allowing to occur.   As we speak today, a little girl and her mom will be abused on the  journey through Mexico while this country, the most powerful nation in  the history of the world, buries its head in the sand because my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle, in a cynical political  gesture and move, refuse to actually take up the supplemental request  from the President of the United States for $4\1/2\ billion to provide  the beds and the resources necessary to deal with the crisis, and to  start taking up the bills that we should take up to ensure we fix the  asylum crisis that cartels are using for profit, and to fix the catch- and-release broken system that is allowing our system to be overrun,  allowing communities in Texas to be overrun.   This is a tragedy, and it is unconscionable that this body will not  address it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.

Mr. Speaker, in light of the humanitarian crisis at our border and  what is happening to the migrants who seek to come here and to the  people of the United States of America, I ask unanimous consent to call  up H.R. 3056, an emergency supplemental to provide critically needed  funding for the humanitarian crisis at the border, and ask for its  immediate consideration.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, we are sitting here 10:30 at night, and I am  mystified that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are  preaching about this issue, which is already the policy of the  administration, and yet we are not funding the $4.5 billion request  from the administration to deal with the problem at hand.   Our border is being overrun. My friend from Texas knows this, we know  it, if you go spend any time on the border. We had 144,000 people  apprehended on our southern border. HHS has taken charge of nearly  41,000 unaccompanied alien children this year, a 57 percent increase  from last year. I could go down stat after stat after stat.   Little girls are being abused on the journey and cartels are  profiting while we ignore it. Talk to the mayor of Uvalde, Texas, and  throughout the southern area of Texas, talk to the people about what is  actually happening in the communities.    I cannot believe, for the life of me, that we can't come  together in a bipartisan fashion to pass $4.5 billion to fund the  necessary beds, to fund what is necessary to house these children.   When people talk about kids in cages, are they directly attacking  Border Patrol? Have they spent time with Border Patrol who are trying  to figure out whether a kid's dad is actually the dad or whether it is  somebody who is using that child?   That is happening today while this body waxes on about whatever  amendment we are throwing on the floor right now that is already part  of the administrative policy. We are not actually addressing the  problem. And the American people sent us here to do that: Oh, by the  way, oh, no, we are demanding votes.   Heaven forbid this body votes. Heaven forbid we follow the  Constitution, which says something about a quorum. Maybe we should  actually be in this body voting on the things the American people sent  us here to do, like secure the border and ensure the safe passage of  migrants in the United States of America under our rule of law.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, it is 1:35 in the morning here on the East  Coast.   I represent a district in Texas. Somewhere in Texas right now are a  host of families and children who have no place to be put, nowhere to  be put because we are not doing our job. Those are facts.   All the theater, all the grandstanding that is going to be pointed  out here on the floor of the House of Representatives, those are the  facts.   There is a child today who doesn't have a place to be put. We can't  just take that child and put him or her someplace magical. We have to  have a place to put him or her.   Today, right now, the Reynosa faction of the Gulf Cartel is making  hundreds of millions of dollars moving people--not just fentanyl, not  just cocaine, not just heroin, although lots of that, too, but moving  people.   Right now, somewhere in the United States of America, particularly  probably in Houston or San Antonio, there is a stash house with  children in it and people in it being held hostage to pay money back to  the cartels.   If you don't believe it, go talk to the people in the Department of  Public Safety in Texas and CBP and ICE in Texas. Talk to them. That is  what is actually happening.   And how can we, with a straight face, say that we are the most  powerful nation in the world and allow that to be happening at our  border, while our asylum laws are being exploited by cartels for  profit, asylum laws which we should have, but where people should go to  ports of entry and have a path to come here? Instead, we allow them to  be violated by cartels for profit, and cartels have operational control  of our border.   I literally cannot comprehend how our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle believe it is more appropriate to bury their heads in the  sand of this Chamber and ignore this, ignore this problem, this real  problem, where 144,000 people were apprehended in May. HHS has taken  charge of nearly 41,000 UACs this year--41,000.   In December, 4,700 unaccompanied children were apprehended on the  southern border. In May, 11,500 unaccompanied alien minor children were  apprehended on the southern border. These are the actual numbers. Does  that not matter?    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Maryland. I  appreciate my friend from New York's concern about this important issue  that is obviously paramount for the Nation. Every State in the Union is  touched by the tragedy of opioid abuse.   I do want to point out, as has, I think, been made clear by my  colleagues and myself about our continued concern about our lack of  appreciation and effort by this body to deal with the crisis at our  border, that the impact on the opioid problem by the trafficking going  on at our southern border is significant. I think we all agree on that.  We all recognize that.   In fact, my colleague from New York and I have sat in Oversight  hearings where we have had witnesses there where we talk about the  massive increase over the last several years in the amount of narcotics  that are coming through our southern border, and this is just something  that I hope we can have a bipartisan understanding and agreement on  about addressing and actually dealing with the concern.   According to Border Patrol's most recent data, through the end of  May, they seized 144 pounds of fentanyl between ports of entry since  October; 98 percent was seized on our southwest border.   Fentanyl, in a pack of sugar, is enough to kill everybody in this  room. It is a very dangerous narcotic--144 pounds between ports of  entry.   In 2018, U.S. Border Patrol seized 388 pounds of fentanyl.   6,162 ounces of heroin have been seized between the ports of entry in  fiscal year 2019 alone; 444 pounds of cocaine in May of this year  between the ports of entry. Office of Field Operations has seized  241,000 pounds of drugs, total.   Seventy thousand Americans died from drug overdoses in 2017, and  fentanyl played a large roll in that. Deaths involving fentanyl  increased more than 45 percent in 2017, alone.   I could go through the stats and we can keep talking about it, but I  would hope that, on an issue like this, where I believe very much in  the heart of my colleague and what she is trying to accomplish with  this amendment, that we could come to an agreement that the vast  quantities of these narcotics, so much of it is coming across our  southern border. In addition to, obviously, the prescription drug  problems we have had and we have been dealing with and we are trying to  deal with, we have got to address this problem.   The cartels, literally, have operational control of our border; and  the consequences aren't just the profit on the back of people and  children and what we are dealing with and the inability to house them,  but it is in this, in the opioid crisis that we are all trying to deal  with that is being supplied so much from both China and then through  Mexico.    Madam Chair, I appreciate that, and I would only point out  in response to my friend from New York, and recognizing that this is an  HHS-related matter, that one of the issues we are trying to deal with  with respect to HHS is the office of ORR in dealing with the children  and dealing with the unaccompanied children that we don't have anyplace  to house, and we are looking for $4\1/2\ billion to deal with the  problem at our border, including dealing with ORR and the children who  are being housed at HHS. That it is a very paramount issue, and I think  it is relevant in this particular moment.
