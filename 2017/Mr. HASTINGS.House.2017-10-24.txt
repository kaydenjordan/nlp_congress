 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank my friend, the gentleman from Georgia, for yielding me the  customary 30 minutes for debate.   Mr. Speaker, I am here today to debate the rule for consideration of  H.R. 469, the Congressional Article I Powers Strengthening Act; and  H.R. 732, the Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act, two Judiciary bills that  are deficient in both process and in substance.   First, let me address the Congressional Article I Powers and  Strengthening Act, a bill that my Republican friends purport will  provide commonsense solutions to curbing regulatory abuse, but will, in  fact, undermine the ability of Federal regulators to protect the health  and safety of Americans, threaten the privacy of victims of government  misconduct, and intrude on the Department of Justice's enforcement  discretion, raising serious separation of powers concerns.   Mr. Speaker, just as appalling as the substance of this bill is the  process by which we are considering it and many other bills deriving  from the Judiciary Committee lately.   This bill is actually three Judiciary Committee bills wrapped in one  Rules Committee print. However, one of the bills, H.R. 4070, was  introduced last week without a hearing, without a markup, without  notice to Democrats on the Judiciary Committee, and without  consultation with constitutional  [[Page H8089]]  lawyers and experts and interested citizens.   This process is truly a slap in the face of regular order. A bill  that has zero input from members on the Judiciary Committee or been the  subject of any thoughtful discussion is suddenly on the House floor for  a vote.   Interestingly, when I listened to my friend from Georgia, who I know  is particularly serious about his approaches to legislation, I sat here  and then I looked into the gallery, and there were 20 people who were  seated there. I didn't see on the faces of those that I could see any  understanding of one thing that he said, not because of the speed of  his manner of speech, but because of the complexity of issues that give  rise to us.   Among the things he said was transparency, accountability, and  wanting to make sure that we, this body, exercise our prerogative with  reference to for the people, by the people, and of the people.   I would imagine that people listening to this debate would want to  believe that half of this body, half of the people who are represented  in this country had input to this legislation. Let me tell you, People,  they had none, zero. No Democrat had any input to this measure that I  just discussed.   How can we expect Members of this body, let alone the American  people, to have any idea as to what we are voting on with this measure  and what its impact will be when it seems the path it took to getting a  vote is based solely on the whim of the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee?   Unfortunately, there is total disregard for even a semblance of  regular order. That term is utilized a lot here, and, again, the  American people, many of them, don't have a clue what we are talking  about.    What we are talking about, basically, is matters that go to  committees have hearings, have both sides have input, have witnesses  who are experts or have responsibilities in that arena, and then the  matter comes to the Rules Committee and is granted a bill of substance  to come here to the floor, and that process is generally known by those  of us with Congress-speak as regular order.   It is nothing new for the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee,  which has been the worst offender of regular order, when it comes to  pushing for a closed process.   During the 115th Congress, bills coming to the floor from the  Judiciary Committee were granted the most closed rules of any of the  committees in this august body, eight closed rules. There is no  committee chair in this Congress who has requested the Republican- controlled Rules Committee grant more closed rules than the chairman of  the Judiciary Committee.   Indeed, this departure from a process that we refer to as regular  order, from a process that allows input from outside experts and other  witnesses, a process that allows both parties, if there is a hearing,  to ask questions of those witnesses, this departure is astounding, and  that is within the context of this Congress, which, in just the first  10 months, will soon become the most closed Congress in history.   I remember when I ran for office in 1992, I appeared a lot on radio  stations. In many of those appearances, the opposition, not just my  opponent, but the major party, had begun a drumbeat of the Democrats  are not following regular order, they are having closed rules.   Little did I know in 1992, nor did I aspire when I came here, to be  on the Rules Committee to have a better understanding, but I kept  listening to this closed rule argument, and many persons lost their  elections because of that.   If there is ever a time for us to address it, it would be now. We  have that prerogative to be able to open up this process so that all  Members can be involved.   When this Congress began, the distinguished Speaker of this body  promised an open and transparent House. He called for a return to  regular order. After what we have seen over the last 10 months, I  shudder to think what the distinguished Speaker considers a closed  process.   I might add, the next tier under closed is structured rules, which we  are here today on, which, yet again, limits the number of activities by  others, amendments, and other processes that would be appropriate.   Yesterday, when my colleague and I were in the Rules Committee, we  had before us matters that were germane to this issue that were denied,  that could have, under an open process, been made in order so that we  could discuss it here today.   This Republican process, shutting out the voice and input of  representatives of nearly half the country, is not just an affront to  normal House procedure, which it is, it is downright undemocratic and  emblematic of the Republican majority's true inability to govern.   Mr. Speaker, I turn to the second bill encompassed in this rule, H.R.  732, a bill as misguided and substantively unnecessary as the first  bill was lacking in process. In fact, in the last Congress, a law  professor testifying on an identical bill described it as a solution in  search of a problem.   That was as true in the last Congress as it is in this one, which is  too bad, because we do not lack in actual problems in desperate need of  sensible solutions.   H.R. 732 would prevent Federal agencies from requiring third-party  payments, such as those to charities, in settlement agreements with  entities accused of wrongdoing.   Now, there in the report pointed out by the chairman of the Rules  Committee yesterday shows the number of banks and mortgage companies  and others that have violated the law and entered into settlements with  the government for billions of dollars. Such payments, in excess of  what the victims have agreed to, and the settlements that have been  entered into and approved by judges, each one of these settlements, my  friend said these payments may have gone to politically motivated--may  be politically motivated organizations, and he cites to La Raza, which  did receive money, but so did other charitable organizations: the New  Christian Joy Full Gospel Baptist Church, the Catholic Charities of the  Archdiocese of Chicago, the Catholic Charities Financial and Housing  Counseling.   We sought yesterday while we were in the committee--I sought and  asked staff to provide for me some of the organizations that my friends  say may be politically motivated, or activists, as he referred to them,  and it is 49 pages of organizations that were available to receive  these funds, and, yes, some of them are liberal and also some of them  are conservative organizations as we know them.   Such payments to charities are a common enforcement tool in  settlements and have long been used to help provide communities with  relief from systemic harm caused by illegal behavior.   Now, for example, following the 2008 financial crisis, in some of the  settlement agreements with Wall Street banks, President Obama's  Department of Justice required banks to donate money to charities  committed to neighborhood stabilization and foreclosure prevention  efforts, and this made perfect sense.                                time  1245    In the wake of the crisis, as many as 10 million families lost their  homes to foreclosure. Both the Government Accountability Office and the  Federal courts have long upheld this practice in settlement agreements.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, my Republican colleagues considered these  provisions to be an attempt by President Obama's administration to use,  as they say, ``a slush fund,'' to enrich, ``liberal friends,'' despite  the fact that certified charities eligible to receive these payments  encompass liberal and conservative groups alike.   They even launched an investigation which yielded no credible  evidence to substantiate their claims. Yet, despite the GAO, the  Federal courts, and a Republican-led investigation showing no  wrongdoing, we are considering this bill today to ban this longstanding  legal practice aimed at assisting communities in the wake of suffering  systemic abuse--abuse that I will underline again, and even say slowly,  hurt Democrats and Republicans.   I suppose the only question left to ask my Republican friends is, 10  months into the new administration, nearly a year after the last  election, why are they continuing to conduct  [[Page H8090]]  pointless and partisan oversight of the Obama administration?   Let me see if I can make this clear. President Obama is no longer the  President of the United States, nor is Bill Clinton or George Bush. The  President of the United States now is a new individual who we have to  deal with, and it would be helpful if we were to address some of the  matters ongoing that this particular administration is deserving of  oversight.   I know that President Obama was a useful foil for many in the  Republican Party when it came to messaging and campaigning, but he is  not the President anymore. He won his two elections. That is the past.  This bill represents nothing but the Republican majority grasping at  straws and trying their best to turn their oversight attention away  from doing their duty and providing oversight of the Trump  administration.   Today, two new inquiries, I don't even have the time or wouldn't take  the time to go into the inquiries that ain't going nowhere, have been  announced, certainly as a distraction to many of the negatives that  come out by virtue of this particular Congress not having done  anything. It is the do-nothing Congress on steroids.   If there was ever an administration that needed rigorous oversight,  it is the current one. In just 10 months, we have had reports of  gratuitous use of private jets, the use of private email servers by  senior staff, and I might add that one of those things identified today  is they are going to go after Hillary or have oversight hearings on  Hillary Clinton's emails. Enough already. Hillary Clinton lost her  election, and lost with the emails as well, but we have current staff  who are using private email servers. Given your history, should that  not at least pique your oversight interest?   Spending tens of millions of taxpayers' dollars to use Mar-a-Lago for  official meetings, waste, cronyism, the list goes on and on and on. How  about oversight of a little, old company in Montana that doesn't have  any successful history getting a $200 million no-bid contract in Puerto  Rico to reestablish those facilities there? Out of Montana, little, old  company, $200 million, no-bid. You got it. You go forward. You talk  about waste and cronyism. And what do we get from the Republicans?  Deafening silence.   Mr. Speaker, I find it ironic that we are considering the rule for a  bill today entitled Article I Powers Strengthening Act when this  Republican Congress has shown they can't even undertake the basic  Article I duty of providing oversight of the executive. They don't need  to strengthen Article I, they need to just start doing their jobs in  the first place.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am ready to have my friend understand that I am  getting close to closing. I don't think I have any speakers, but I do  have words that I wish to put forward right now.   It is shameful that we would be in a position where the DACA program  is being threatened without a single thought to the consequences this  decision would have on the 800,000 young lives this program protects.   While this may appear to be off message with regard to the measures  that are before us, the minority is given an opportunity to present  what is called a previous question, and it can be on matters germane to  the thoughts of the minority and can be on any subject that they  choose. In this instance, we choose to, with the previous question,  address DACA.   Do the American people even want DACA to end? The answer is clearly  no. According to a Politico/Morning Consult poll, support for allowing  these immigrants to remain in the United States spans across party  lines: 84 percent of Democrats, 74 percent of Independents, and 69  percent of Republicans think they should stay. Congress must act to  protect our DREAMers.   Mr. Speaker, here is a chance to rectify the President's decision and  restore the American people's faith in this institution.   If we defeat the previous question, I am going to offer an amendment  to the rule to bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream Act. This bipartisan  bicameral legislation would help thousands of young people who are  Americans in every way except on paper.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of this  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, earlier I mentioned that there were 49 pages--I didn't  realize how extensive it really was--of organizations that were  eligible to receive funds under the Justice Department's prerogative.  It includes organizations that did, in fact, receive these funds.                                time  1300    They come from a wide array of organizations in our respective  communities that, in my judgment, have on-the-ground ability to be  efficient and to make sure that the expenditure of those funds benefit  those who have suffered from systemic inequities by large  organizations.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a portion of these organizations  that were eligible to receive funds under the Justice Department's  prerogative.

Mr. Speaker, I do want to acknowledge that my friend  from Georgia does have a companion bill in the other body. I believe it  is S. 333. I would--like I will when the Georgia-Florida game comes  up--make a wager with my friend that that bill ain't going nowhere.  But, anyway, we are here talking about it, so my wager with the  gentleman will be under appropriate measures. I wish he and I could go  to Jacksonville together at what they say is the greatest cocktail  party in the world.   Mr. Speaker, I just mentioned that at least one of the bills wrapped  up in today's, in my view, nonsense, ought to continue to be described  as a solution in search of a problem. I am not fully convinced that the  observation is not an apt one for the whole lot of bills before us  today. As I just mentioned, this is particularly disturbing as this  country has real problems which need real solutions.   The Children's Health Insurance Program has expired, and there seems  to be little to no will on the other side of the aisle to right this  wrong at this time. Sure, we hear possibilities of a solution. When I  came back this week, I thought that we would certainly address it.  September 30 was when it expired. Yet we and, more importantly,  millions of children and organizations wait for an answer.   We know that we are fast approaching a government shutdown, but  instead we come to the floor week after week forced to debate  ridiculous bills that, in substance, are well-thought-out by the  persons presenting them, but, in reality, are not going to become law  and are nothing more than talking points of the day, when these things  that we should be addressing are going unmet.   We need to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, yet the  answer to this issue evades my friends across the aisle. We need to  reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program, yet we wait.   We need to address the crippling epidemic that is gun violence in  this country. We need to remember that not even a month ago, this man  out in Las Vegas took aim from the 32nd floor of a hotel and rained  terror down upon thousands of innocent people enjoying a music  festival. The weapons of war he used that night are just as readily  available today as the day he bought them.   Finally, I understand people may want to forget the following, but we  cannot, and I will not let you forget that there are millions of people  across the United States Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, and there are  thousands in Florida and in Texas who are still awaiting visits from  FEMA.   On the plane up yesterday, I was reading a 3-page-long article  addressing, right in my community, the fact that people are sitting  waiting for FEMA's response. I continue to raise at the same time that  these hurricanes in Texas, southwest Louisiana, the Virgin Islands, and  Puerto Rico have occurred, forest fires in California and Montana and  Oregon have occurred, and we haven't addressed drought in other areas  that occurred. Just last week, tornadoes occurred in Oklahoma. We have  these disasters occurring.   I heard my colleague earlier today during morning hour make a  presentation regarding a main burst in Detroit, Michigan, and that they  don't have in her area sufficient drinking water. We know that the  Flint, Michigan, matter isn't resolved.   This past weekend, I busted a tire on a bumpy-hole road, and we need  to fix our roads in this country. This Capital ought to be called the  ``Pothole of the World.''   Yet we stand here day after day discussing things that are going  nowhere when people in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands are craving  electricity, opening schools with no electricity, moving people from  hospitals. We need safe drinking water all over this country. They need  for us to show compassion and at least some decency with reference to  humanity with those concerns.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and the underlying  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
