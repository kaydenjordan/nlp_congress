 Madam Speaker, in the December Jobs  Report, job numbers remain strong. Over 140,000 jobs were added, and  wages are up. The unemployment rate remains at a 50-year low at 3.5  percent. These new, consistent numbers show that President Trump is  continuing his effective record of promises made, promises kept.   The December Jobs report also showed that the total employment level  rose to 158.8 million--another record high. By creating jobs, lowering  unemployment, increasing wages, and consistently working to promote  opportunities, President Trump continues keeping his promises.   Baseless attacks on the President by Democrats and the biased fake  news attempted to conceal his successes, but make no mistake: President  Trump is focused to work for American families and jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Best wishes to Coach Dabo Swinney, go Clemson Tigers tonight.                            ____________________
