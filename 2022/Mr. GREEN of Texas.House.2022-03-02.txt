 And still I rise, Mr. Speaker. And I rise on this  historic occasion to compliment the chairperson and the ranking member  of the Foreign Affairs Committee. What they are doing today will be  hailed in the annals of history as that which was necessary to help our  friends in a time of need.   Mr. Speaker, those who say that if we leave the world alone, the  world will leave us alone are wrong. The world will find its way to our  door just as it is now because Dr. King's words are so right. Life is  an inescapable network of mutuality tied to a single garment of  destiny. What impacts one directly impacts all indirectly. What is  happening to Ukraine directly impacts us indirectly.   We have a duty, a responsibility, and an obligation to help them and  to make sure that when the final word is written, it will be said that  we did all that we could to protect democracy.
