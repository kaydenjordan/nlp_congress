 Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend President  Trump and the administration for taking decisive action to lower drug  costs for America's seniors.   Currently, 34.2 million people in the U.S. have diabetes. One in  every three seniors on Medicare has diabetes, and over 3.3 million  beneficiaries use at least one type of insulin.   Thanks to President Trump, the out-of-pocket cost for insulin has  been cut. Participating plans will cap costs at just $35 a month per  type of insulin. This is tremendous news.   For far too long, seniors have been subjected to escalating insulin  prices. Now, Americans will save an average of $446 on insulin costs in  just a year.   I thank President Trump for continuing to put the American people  first.                     Administration Aiding North Carolina     Mr. Speaker, there is no substitute for  swift and decisive action. Since the initial outbreak of COVID-19 in  China, President Trump and the administration have worked tirelessly to  protect the American people.   First, President Trump closed our borders and enacted a travel ban to  protect the American people. This was a necessary precaution that  undoubtedly saved lives. In response, the mainstream media's political  pundits cried foul and claimed this was an ill-advised tactic intended  to score political points. That could not be farther from the truth.   Sadly, my colleagues across the aisle and those in the media would  rather search for the newest outrage du jour instead of focusing on the  efforts of the President and the administration to combat COVID-19.   It is time to correct the record and cast aside the falsehoods that  Democrats and the mainstream media are pushing against President Trump  and the administration.   For example, let's look at what is being done to help North  Carolinians during this pandemic. Under the direction of President  Trump, FEMA has obligated almost $30 million for COVID-19 response  efforts in North Carolina.   From the Strategic National Stockpile, North Carolina received to  date: Over 250,000 N95 masks; over 580,000 surgical masks; over 100,000  medical gowns; over 115,000 face shields; and over 425,000 pairs of  gloves.   In addition, President Trump approved Governor Roy Cooper's Major  Disaster Declaration, and then directed FEMA to fund 100 percent of the  emergency assistance activities provided by the North Carolina National  Guard.   President Trump and the administration are deeply committed to  protecting not only North Carolinians, but also Americans across our  country.   If my colleagues across the aisle shared the same sentiment of being  ``in it together,'' they would work with us to deliver for the American  people and set aside their relentless impeachment crusade.   It is time to get our country back on its feet, and I am proud that  President Trump and the administration are working day in and day out  to do so. We will win this fight, and I am certain we will emerge  stronger and more resilient.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, our Nation's frontline  workers must be commended for their tireless work during this pandemic.   I am reminded of the 2,200 employees in my district who work at the  Tyson Food plant in Wilkesboro. These men and women come to work every  day to help put food on kitchen tables across the country.   This week, a Wilkesboro salon restricted access to Tyson employees  out of caution for COVID-19. While the salon owner's intentions may be  good, there are safety measures that can be enacted to protect all  patrons and employees.   It is critical that we understand the challenges that these frontline  workers are facing, and we must do everything we can to support them.   Exclusionary actions are not the solution. We are in this fight  together, and we must take care of one another.  [[Page H2292]]                                ____________________
