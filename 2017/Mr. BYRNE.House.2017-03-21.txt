 Mr. Speaker, it is written in Philippians 4:6:         Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by       prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests       be made known to God.    As this body debates important issues, it is critical we begin with  prayer. I am honored my constituent Pastor Chris Bell was able to lead  today's prayer.  [[Page H2250]]    Mr. Speaker, Pastor Bell studied theology and communications at the  University of Mobile and Luther Rice Seminary, and he has over 20 years  of ministry experience.   Pastor Bell is currently the lead pastor at 3 Circle Church in  southwest Alabama. 3 Circle Church has five campuses, with weekly  attendance reaching over 2,000 people.   In addition to their regular services, Pastor Bell and 3 Circle  Church have a focus on mission and serving others locally, regionally,  and around the world. These missions make a real difference.   So on behalf of Alabama's First Congressional District, it is an  honor to welcome Chris and his wife, Nan, to the people's House.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 210 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 210         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 1101) to       amend title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act       of 1974 to improve access and choice for entrepreneurs with       small businesses with respect to medical care for their       employees. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. In lieu of the amendment recommended by the       Committee on Education and the Workforce now printed in the       bill, an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting       of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-9 shall be       considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce; (2)       the further amendment printed in the report of the Committee       on Rules accompanying this resolution, if offered by the       Member designated in the report, which shall be in order       without intervention of any point of order, shall be       considered as read, shall be separately debatable for the       time specified in the report equally divided and controlled       by the proponent and an opponent, and shall not be subject to       a demand for a division of the question; and (3) one motion       to recommit with or without instructions.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for  1 hour.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Alabama?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 210 provides for  consideration of H.R. 1101, the Small Business Health Fairness Act of  2017.   President Trump promised to repeal and replace ObamaCare, which is  negatively affecting our economy and causing great hardship on the  American people. Congress is responding this week with multiple bills  to do just that.   After years of endless premium increases, we must take steps to make  health insurance more accessible and affordable, including for small  businesses that employ the majority of Americans. H.R. 1101, the Small  Business Health Fairness Act, will do just  [[Page H2261]]  that by helping to level inequalities between large and small  employers, ultimately making health insurance more affordable for  millions of Americans.   Simply put, the Small Business Health Fairness Act will empower small  businesses to band together through association health plans to  purchase health insurance. This will allow them to increase their  bargaining power, negotiating for lower health insurance rates on  behalf of their employees, just like their large competitors do.   Additionally, the bill will allow their plans to fall under the  Employee Retiree Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA, and the  Department of Labor, just like the large self-funded employer plans,  preempting a myriad of State regulations that often make insurance  unaffordable for small businesses.   The usefulness of this legislation is easy to imagine. For example, a  small accounting firm might employ just three or four people while the  largest firms employ tens of thousands. If that small firm could join  together with others just like it to provide health insurance through  their national association, it could have the same bargaining power and  be subject to the same regulation as the firm with thousands of  employees. This parity means more options and lower costs for employers  and employees.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation's small businesses were hit especially hard  by the passage of ACA. In fact, a 2016 survey by the National  Federation of Independent Businesses found that small businesses  identified the cost of health care as their number one challenge.   An estimated 300,000 small-business jobs were destroyed, and an  estimated 10,000 small businesses closed altogether due to the failed  ObamaCare policies.   Since 2008, 36 percent of all small businesses with fewer than 10  employees have stopped offering healthcare coverage. This has resulted  in less overall healthcare options for working families.   ObamaCare's compliance costs and mandates have resulted in $19  billion in lost wages for small-business employees.   The bottom line is that small businesses--the backbone of our  Nation's economy--and their employees are feeling the pain of  ObamaCare's failures and broken promises.   I meet with these small-business owners from south Alabama every day.  They want to take care of their employees and provide them with high- quality health insurance. Through enacting the Small Business Health  Fairness Act, we can help thousands of small businesses achieve that  goal.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to point out that this legislation includes  strong protections to ensure association health plans are solvent and  that the families covered by them are indeed protected. A sponsor of a  plan must be a bona fide trade, industry, or professional organization  and can't be established for the purpose of providing medical care.   The sponsor must have existed for a period of at least 3 consecutive  years before providing group health insurance coverage. The association  health plan must be operated by a board of trustees and will be  supervised by the Department of Labor. This will include minimum  capital requirements and a requirement that plans have a stop-loss and  solvency insurance.   Finally and most importantly, the bill prohibits association health  plans from discriminating based upon health status and preexisting  conditions.   Mr. Speaker, the Small Business Health Fairness Act is about ensuring  our Nation's small businesses are afforded the same opportunities given  to large corporations and labor unions. When similar legislation has  been brought to the floor in the past, it has received strong  bipartisan support, as I hope this bill will today.   Ultimately, this bill is just one part of our larger plan to rescue  the American people from the failures of ObamaCare. This week, the  House intends to vote to repeal ObamaCare, along with its mandates and  its taxes.   But we do also understand that the pre-ObamaCare status quo is not  acceptable. That is why the House is already moving to consider bills  to give Americans the freedom, choices, and control they deserve.   Our solutions are built on free market and patient-centered  principles. By getting the government out of the way and increasing  competition, we can draw down costs and help Americans obtain health  care that actually works for them.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 210 and  the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1400     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My colleague from Colorado raised an important question: What are the  Republicans trying to accomplish here? It is pretty simple. We are  trying to give freedom and choice back to the American people who lost  their freedom and choice and control over their healthcare plans, who  lost freedom and control over their health care because of an ill- considered law passed by this Congress several years ago.   He talked about the cost to American consumers. If you want to pass  something that is going to increase cost to American consumers, this  Congress did that several years ago. Look at the dramatic increase in  healthcare insurance premiums, the dramatic increase in people's  deductibles that have occurred since the Affordable Care Act--the so- called Affordable Care Act--was passed here in Congress several years  ago.   We are trying to reverse that. We are trying to get control back.  And, in fact, we know from the Congressional Budget Office score that  it will lower premiums by 10 percent. We haven't seen premiums go lower  in years. So if they want to know what we are trying to accomplish, it  is plain on its face.   The gentleman referred to some amendments that he offered in  committee. Every one of those amendments was ruled nongermane.   And for those of us that maybe don't understand a lot about what  ``germane'' means, it is pretty simple. You can't offer amendments to a  bill that aren't related to the subject matter of the bill.   The chairwoman of the committee ruled that he offered amendments that  weren't germane to the bill that we have today. So the gentleman didn't  lose because people were trying to lock him out of the process. He just  offered amendments that had nothing to do with the underlying bill.   He talked about the fact that this underlying bill for the rule we  have today will lure away young and healthy workers.                                    1415    Let me say it again. I said this in my principal remarks. Under this  bill, none of these association health plans can discriminate against  anybody. They can't do that. They can't say we are only going to let  young or healthy people in the plan. They have to admit everyone. So  there is no discrimination here. Everyone will be covered.   And remember how many people in America work for small businesses.  All types of Americans work for small businesses. We are not trying to  hurt them. We are trying to give them more opportunities to get better  health insurance that will cost less money.   And if there was anything in here that would cause discrimination, we  would have heard long and hard about that before this point. I would  suggest to you, Mr. Speaker, that that is not a relevant argument to  this particular bill. Every plan that is going to be  [[Page H2264]]  under this bill must comply with the regulations of the Department of  Labor, just like big corporation plans have to comply with the  regulations of the Department of Labor.   We are simply treating small businesses through these associations  the same way we treat big corporations. We have essentially denied to  the employees of small businesses the same opportunities to get good  health insurance at a lower cost that their colleagues that work for  bigger corporations get.   The reason the bigger corporations have this is because the  Department of Labor comes up with a nationwide rule so you don't have  all these different variations from State to State and allows for those  big companies to do the things that they can do so very well because of  their size to get better health care for an affordable cost for their  employees. We are giving the same thing to these small businesses  through their associations.   And remember, this is not just one bill. We actually just passed a  rule. We will be considering another bill that will exempt, from the  provisions of McCarran-Ferguson, health insurance so we get more  competition into the health insurance market.   This bill is on top of that. It is on top of the AHCA that we will be  considering later this week and other bills that will be coming,  because there are a host of things that we are doing on this side of  the aisle to make sure we restore freedom and choice and affordable  care to the people of our country.   We are not removing people from health insurance in any of the bills  that we are doing. We are giving them the freedom to choose. And that  is what America is really all about: the freedom to choose.   Right now we are coercing, by law, people to go out and buy health  insurance that they don't want. That shouldn't be done in America. We  are going to give them their freedom back. And if they chose not to buy  health insurance, that is their right as Americans. That is not taking  something away from somebody. That is giving them their freedom back.   So I would suggest to the gentleman that, if he wants to look for  something that is going to help the workers of America, this bill and  the other bills that our side of the aisle are proposing will do just  that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Dunn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the manager's amendment that has been referred to was  put on a public website last night. Everyone in the House of  Representatives will have 3 days to read the manager's amendment. There  is nothing secret about it.   Bills are not written in front of cameras. They are written so that  they can be put on public websites for all of us to see it. This  manager's amendment was handled like many, many other manager's  amendments are handled, including the way manager's amendments have  been handled by the other side when they were in the majority.   Let's remember, in 2010 when the reconciliation bill was passed that  established the ACA, no amendments were allowed on the floor--none,  zero. So if there is a precedent that has been set in this House, it  was set by my friends on the other side of the aisle when they passed  the Affordable Care Act and wouldn't allow any amendments by any Member  of the House. That is the precedent.   There is nothing new about the way this manager's amendment was  handled. It was handled the way manager's amendments are handled  virtually all the time. Everybody in this House now has a copy of it,  has plenty of time to read it and ask questions about it. Nothing  secret going on here.   The truth of the matter is that we are moving forward with our plan,  as we said we were, to repeal and replace ObamaCare, to give freedom  and choice back to the people of America so that patients control their  health care, not a bureaucrat in Washington.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    Will the gentleman yield?    As far as I know, speaking back to the gentleman from  Colorado, the manager's amendments that were posted last night are  going to be the manager's amendments that we will consider tomorrow in  the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am ready to answer the question.   We believe that we will be receiving the CBO table prior to the vote  on the floor of the House of Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, from what I saw in the CBO score of the bill,  the AHCA bill actually reduces government spending, reduces taxes, and  reduces health insurance premiums over the window of the CBO score.                                time  1430    So it does the exact opposite of what the gentleman suggested. It  does exactly what the American people sent us here to do.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I certainly agree with my colleague from Colorado that we should  avoid silly partisanship, and I hope that that means we won't see silly  partisan procedural motions and points of order between now and the end  of the week. We have seen plenty of those up until this point in time  by our friends on the other side of the aisle, and I hope that his  statement means we won't see any more since he believes that silly  partisanship is bad for this body and the consideration of these  important healthcare bills.   We are not here today to talk about the AHCA. We are here today to  talk about the Small Business Health Fairness Act. That is what this  rule covers.   Let me go over again what has happened to small businesses, but, more  importantly, what has happened to the people who work for small  businesses. An estimated 300,000 small-business jobs were destroyed by  ObamaCare; 10,000 small businesses closed because of ObamaCare.   Since 2008, 36 percent of small businesses that have fewer than 10  employees have stopped offering healthcare coverage altogether.  ObamaCare's compliance costs and mandates have resulted in $19 billion  in lost wages for small-business employees.   The majority of people in this country work for small businesses. We  are trying to give them a fair shake. We are trying to give them their  freedom and their choice back. We are trying to give them affordable  care because their freedom and their choice and the affordability of  their care has evaporated over the last several years.   Ask anybody in America. They come up to me all the time in my  district and tell me this.   We, through this bill and the other bills we are considering, are  repairing the damage done to the people of America by ObamaCare.   Now, my colleagues can throw up dilatory points of order and other  procedural items later on if they want to engage in silly partisanship,  or we can get down to the business of taking care of the workers in  America.   This bill, or a concept like this bill, has been on this floor before  and enjoyed bipartisan support. If we are going to drop silly  partisanship, let's drop it right now on this rule and on this bill,  and adopt it for the good of the workers in these small businesses  throughout America.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support House Resolution  210 and the underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:              An Amendment to H. Res. 210 Offered by Mr. Polis         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       section:        Sec. 2. In rule XXI add the following new clause:        13. (a) It shall not be in order to consider a measure or       matter proposing to repeal or amend the Patient Protection       and Affordable Care Act (PL 111-148) and the Health Care and       Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PL 111-      152), or part thereof, in the House or in the Committee of       the Whole House on the state of the Union unless an easily       searchable electronic estimate and comparison prepared by the       Director of the Congressional Budget Office is made available       on a publicly available website of the House.        (b) It shall not be in order to consider a measure or       matter proposing to repeal or amend the Patient Protection       and Affordable Care Act (PL 111-148) and the Health Care and       Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PL 111-      152), or part thereof, in the House or in the Committee of       the Whole House on the state of the Union, that is called up       pursuant to a rule or order that makes a manager's amendment       in order or considers such an amendment to be adopted, unless       an easily searchable updated electronic estimate and       comparison prepared by the Director of the Congressional       Budget Office reflecting such amendment is made available on       a publicly available website of the House.        (c) It shall not be in order to consider a rule or order       that waives the application of paragraphs (a) or (b).                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to  [[Page H2267]]       offer an alternative plan. It is a vote about what the House       should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee). The question is on  ordering the previous question.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the ayes appeared to have it.
