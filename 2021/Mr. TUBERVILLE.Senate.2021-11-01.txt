 Mr. President, in 1919, President Woodrow Wilson  declared November 11 as Armistice Day, marking an agreement the year  prior between the Allied Nations and Germany to temporarily cease  fighting during World War I.   President Wilson said:         The reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn       pride in the heroism of those who died in the country's       service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of       the thing from which it has freed us and because of the       opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with       peace and justice in the councils of the nations.    In battles before World War I and in battles since, our  servicemembers and veterans have served to protect the American way of  life. Every year, our country pauses on November 11 to recognize our  veterans with the solemn pride and gratitude that President Wilson  referenced.   We all wake up each morning and enjoy the freedoms this great country  affords us because of our veterans--because it was our veterans, our  men and women in uniform, who were there when their country needed them  most. While their roles span multiple theaters and decades, our  veterans were and continue to be united by a common mission: to protect  and to defend the United States of America. This is a great  responsibility they shouldered, and they deserve gratitude equal to  their great sacrifice. Our veterans may say that they are just ordinary  Americans doing their job. They may be ordinary, but they performed an  extraordinary service to our country.   Alabama is home to nearly 400,000 veterans, and today it is my honor  to recognize a few of them for their service. I have had the pleasure  of meeting many veterans from my great State, and I am always inspired  by their service and their sacrifice.   Their patriotism is unmatched, and their courage is unwavering, like  that of CPL Edsel Bonds of Samson, AL, who experienced a shell blast to  his right femur on January 28, 1966, while on a mission to intercept  guerillas during the Vietnam war. The blast blew out 4 inches of his  femur bone and several muscle groups. He spent most of a year  recovering in the hospital from this horrific injury and never lost the  love for his country.   Now, nearly 56 years later from the time of his injury, he is just as  patriotic as ever. He views his service as something that was necessary  for our country to remain the greatest country in the world. Corporal  Bonds risked life and limb because he believed that America is worth  sacrificing for.   We enjoy the blessings of living in a free nation but often discount  the fact that our liberties come with a tremendous cost. Many brave men  and women have paid a price that even our deepest gratitude could  never, ever repay.   I think Elmer Davis, the Director of the U.S. Office of War  Information during World War II, said it best:         This nation will remain the land of the free only so long       as it is home of the brave.    One-hundred-year-old SGT George Mills of Decatur, AL, showed great  bravery during his time serving in World War II. The Germans surrounded  his company 500 yards from the German border and launched attacks into  the building where they were staying, setting it on fire. With no  ammunition left to defend the enemy, Sergeant Mills and his fellow  comrades were forced to surrender.   For the next 5 months, George Mills and his company were marched  across Europe toward the former Czechoslovakia without food. They were  starved and no doubt weary. Yet Sergeant Mills and his company  persevered. They survived by eating scraps of sugar beets and rutabagas  found in barns where they were held captive before they were finally  liberated on April 13, 1945.   During this initial attack, Sergeant Mills, despite being injured,  sprang to action to help save the lives of those in his company. He was  awarded a Purple Heart for his bravery.   Another American hero is Fred Lacy of Auburn, AL. A lieutenant  colonel in the U.S. Army, Mr. Lacy provided valuable leadership and  negotiation skills during his time in Europe, Korea, and Vietnam. He  and his brigade helped defend the western half of the Korean  demilitarized zone at the end of the Korean war, ensuring that there  were no weaknesses in our defense for North Korea to attack. During the  Vietnam war, he coordinated all U.S. activity in the Mekong Delta and  assisted the Vietnamese in combating the Vietcong.   He volunteered in a leprosy orphanage in his free time while staying  there. He was a natural at building relationships and resolving  conflicts during his time. During a dispute between a Vietnamese and an  American officer, Fred stepped in front of a gun to prevent the  American officer from being shot.   He received two Bronze Stars and the Combat Infantryman Badge for his  leadership and courageous efforts. When reflecting on his service, he  says that it was ``a privilege to serve.'' That spirit of service is  something he carries with him even after his time in the military.    Lieutenant Colonel Lacy has taught Bible classes for more than 60  years and still teaches today at Auburn United Methodist Church.   We, as citizens of this country, are privileged to have veterans like  Lieutenant Colonel Lacy who have not only honorably fought for our  freedom but have also proudly carried the torch of liberty across the  world. They love their country, and you don't have to talk with them  very long before you  [[Page S7530]]  understand how much of a driving force it is to them.   CPL Clyde Haynes from Vestavia Hills, AL, served in the Army Air  Corps' 439th Troop Carrier Group during World War II. Mr. Haynes shared  the joy of walking with children in France as they rushed out of their  houses and filled the streets to celebrate their new liberation from  Nazi rule. He said that he ``wished he had a picture of that.'' Even  though he does not have a physical photograph, you can tell that he  holds that memory near and dear to his heart.   Even though Mr. Haynes is now 100 years old, he is just as moved by  that moment now as he was at that time because freedom is a powerful  thing. But freedom does not come without cost. There are many  servicemembers who pay the ultimate price for our freedom and never  return home. There are families left behind who sit down to dinner  every night with an empty seat at the table knowing that life for them  will never be the same. They, too, have shouldered the cost of  America's liberty and deserve our gratitude.   For our servicemembers who do return home, their struggles do not end  after they reach American soil. They continue to face challenges from  what they have endured while in service and from the difficult reentry  into civilian life.   Most of us will never know the full weight of preserving our freedom,  never have to endure sleepless nights from the harrowing memories of  the battlefield, bear pain from war injuries, or miss important events  with family and friends, like Ryan Charrier from Orange Beach, AL, who  served as a U.S. Air Force technical sergeant in the war in  Afghanistan, with the 442nd Fighter Wing. He received his first  deployment when his children were just 8 and 4 years old. Sergeant  Charrier said he was a bit older than his fellow fighters. He left  behind young children but served with soldiers who missed births of  their first children or deaths of family members.   A veteran's life is so much more than just time in service. There is  also the reintegration to civilian life, which requires just as much  bravery, courage, and sacrifice. Sergeant Charrier's reminder to  Americans is powerful:         We as a country promised that we would never forget . . .       so I hope that every patriotic American will keep the promise       of never forgetting. Just because the war may have winded       down, doesn't mean our men and women who served the last 20       years still don't need the support of every American.    These veterans--Edsel Bonds, George Mills, Fred Lacy, Clyde Haynes,  and Ryan Charrier--are heroes, just like millions of brave men and  women who have selfishly sacrificed throughout the decades. Their  stories should inspire all of us to show a greater love for our country  and our fellow Americans.   Thirty-three years ago on Veterans Day in 1988, Ronald Reagan said:         We remember those who were called upon to give all a person       can give, and we remember those who were prepared to make       that sacrifice if it were demanded of them in the line of       duty. Most of all, we remember the devotion and gallantry       with which all of them ennobled their nation as they became       champions of a noble cause.    May we join together as a nation this Veterans Day to honor our  veterans who have served this Nation and defended our freedom and  values that we hold so dear. To our veterans, I say: Thank you for your  sacrifice. Our Nation will be forever indebted to you.   I yield the floor.
