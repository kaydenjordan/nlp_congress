 Mr. Speaker, as the 117th Congress comes to a close, I  rise today to say it has been an absolute honor and privilege to serve  Michiganders across Kent, Ottawa, Muskegon, Newaygo, Oceana, Lake,  Mason, and Allegan Counties in the current Second District.   West Michigan is blessed to have beautiful beaches, world-class  manufacturing, and an incredible variety of top-notch agricultural  produce. But what makes places like Muskegon, Grand Haven, Ludington,  Pentwater, Fremont, Baldwin, and Grandville so special are the people  who call these communities home.   It is embracing servant leadership. It is emphasizing the value of  hard work, and it is fostering the drive to go the extra mile that  makes west Michigan such a wonderful place to live, work, and raise a  family.   Mr. Speaker, as I say goodbye to the current Second District, I will  never forget the residents who have called the Second Congressional  District home over the past 10 years or the memories we have shared.   Please know that I will continue to be a champion for you and for  Michigan. It has been an honor and a blessing to be your voice in  Washington.                            ____________________
