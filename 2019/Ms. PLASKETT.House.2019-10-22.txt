 Madam Speaker, during this difficult time, the House  will continue our strong legislative agenda for the people: lowering  healthcare costs, creating bigger paychecks, building the physical and  human infrastructure of America.   My friends on the other side of the aisle want to belittle our work  here by focusing solely on the impeachment process. The American people  want the truth. The House will proceed with our impeachment inquiry to  find the facts and expose the truth, guided by our Constitution and the  facts. This is about patriotism, not politics or partisanship.   I am pleased that, despite the Senate's refusal to move on  legislation passed in the House, my office continues to work hard on  behalf of the people of America.   My office was successful in convincing HUD to release CDBG funding  for mitigation activities. $774 million in HUD CDBG mitigation funds  have been released to the Virgin Islands.   The House doubled the funding on the Violence Against Women Act for  my people.   The House has averted the Medicaid cliff, increasing the Federal  Government's share of spending to the Territories.   We wait on the Senate to act.                            ____________________
