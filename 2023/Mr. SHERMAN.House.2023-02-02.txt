 Mr. Speaker, imagine an antisocialist resolution so  poorly drafted that the cochair of the CPA Caucus finds it necessary to  come here and denounce it. But this resolution equates Willy Brandt  with Kim Jong-un, Medicare with the Great Leap Forward, and European  Socialist Allies of America and NATO, with the worst murderers in  history.   Democracy calls for every country to decide what blend of government  regulation of business, what blend of government programs to have, and  that is a decision for each country to make. Instead, we have a  resolution that provides a misleading and sophomoric description of  history.   We are told that all socialism is equal, and that Marxist-Leninism is  the same as the European Socialists. When communism stood over Europe  and could have conquered the Western world, we organized NATO.   Here are the NATO leaders who were all socialists:   Harold Wilson, Willy Brandt, Francois Mitterand, and so many others,  as shown on the chart.   Without them, Stalinism may well have prevailed. Yet, this resolution  condemns them.   Then we are told, Oh, well, then the anti-communists must be great  people.   Yes, like Francisco Franco and the rest of those identified on this  chart.   Later today, the Republican leadership wants to take someone off her  committee because they say they are dedicated to fighting anti- Semitism.   Yet, on this same day, they bring a resolution to this floor that  equates some of the greatest leaders of Israel with some of the  greatest mass murderers of history.   Look at the history of Israel. The founder of Israel, Ben-Gurion, a  socialist; Golda Meir, a member of the Socialist International; and  Shimon Peres, President of Israel and President of the Socialist  International.   Yet, they say they are against anti-Semitism.   Mr. Speaker, 73 percent of the American people believe Republican  leadership is ignoring the problems facing America, per a CNN poll. And  we could dismiss this resolution as just a stupid waste of time  consistent with that ignoring.                                time  1045     Can I get another 30 seconds?    Mr. Speaker, they are intent on using the debt limit to  attack Social Security, which was attacked by Republicans as socialist  at the time, the 1930s, and by Paul Ryan, more recently.   They are here to attack Medicare as socialist as was done by Ronald  Reagan on a whole LP album denouncing Medicare as socialism.   They are here with this resolution to say that any social program can  be equated with the greatest mass murderers in history.   This resolution is not just a waste of time. It is a pernicious  attack on the programs that American people support.
