 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Cody Rouge  Community Action Alliance for their outstanding service on behalf of  our communities across Michigan's 13th District. They are celebrating  their 15-year anniversary.   The Cody Rouge Community Action Alliance was founded to serve the  needs and goals of the neighborhood residents, businesses, and  community-based organizations. They have worked so tirelessly to create  pathways to greater community engagement, to build future leaders  through its youth programming, and to create a better quality of life  for all of our residents.   Cody Rouge Community Action Alliance has been able to successfully  connect thousands of residents to critical resources, especially during  this pandemic. We have super supported this organization and continue  to welcome them as they continue to expand to do more.   The alliance, as many know, includes a multitude of instrumental  churches and various faith leaders, as well as neighborhood  organizations and associations.   Please join me in recognizing the numerous contributions of the Cody  Rouge Community Action Alliance on behalf of Michigan's 13th District  Strong.                             Honoring Rosa Parks     Madam Speaker, I stand here today to celebrate the passage  in this Chamber, the House of Representatives, of our bill, H.R. 6614,  to honor the mother of the civil rights movement and the beloved  resident of the 13th Congressional District, Rosa Parks.   I am proud to lead this effort, in partnership with her family, to  rename a United States Post Office near her Detroit home after this  incredible leader. This comes at a time when the radical love and  beautiful strength embodied in leaders like Rosa Louise Parks and so  many others whose footsteps we march in today, like Dr. King, Malcolm  X, Fred Hampton, Congressmen Cummings and John Lewis, is really under  extreme attack. We can't allow any of our beloved civil rights leaders  to be erased.   We know our struggle against racism is a lifelong pursuit. As mother  Rosa Parks would say, and she wrote: ``Freedom fighters never retire.''  As her memory continues to guide us, I will add that the spirit of  freedom fighters never dies.   I urge my colleagues in the Senate to please pass this bill, H.R.  6614.                           They Will Not Silence Us     Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition of the simply  draconian efforts to overturn the historic, landmark decision of Roe v.  Wade and express disappointment in the failure of the Senate to codify  Roe.   Without widespread access to abortion care, millions of women in our  communities all across our country will be deprived of their human  rights, especially those pertaining to privacy.   By no means is an abortion an easy choice, but it should be a  guaranteed right within our healthcare system to prevent unnecessary  trauma for our women across our country.   It is truly disappointing to see efforts of those that claim they are  pro-life but do not pass the child tax credit expansion, or don't  support the End Child Poverty Act, or don't address the infant  mortality crisis in our country. If they truly cared, they would be  working on those issues.   No matter how much others want to silence us, I remind women across  the country that we will not be silent. We will continue to fight, from  the streets of our communities in our districts, to keep voicing our  opposition, to right here in the Halls of Congress.   We are with you. We are going to continue to fight. Again, they will  not silence us.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I would begin by thanking Chairman Thompson  and Chairwoman Maloney and, of course, the committee staff, for really  working on these two important amendments that protect our Federal  employees within the TSA.   My team and I are proud to have worked with many workers on the  ground at our Detroit Metro Airport, one of the most busiest in the  country, including Gregory Simpkins, as well as coworkers that met with  me about these really important items. The amendments directly respond  to issues that they brought to my attention, specifically on their  lived experiences as TSA employees.   One major issue that we brought up in an amendment is that TSA is one  of the most diverse Federal agencies in our country at its lower level,  but its leadership is far less diverse and the agency has struggled  with employee retention and promotions from within.   Thanks to the leadership of Chairman Thompson and others, our  amendment takes a step towards addressing the issue by directing that  we examine the current promotion policies and leadership diversity at  the TSA and provide recommendations aimed at improving the diversity of  TSA leadership, as well as strategies for how the TSA can better retain  and promote current employees into leadership positions.   Mr. Speaker, another major issue brought up by many of the members of  the Local 778 of AFGE specifically, was the shocking levels of  harassment and violence experienced by TSA employees in their  workplace. So we address it with an amendment before us that requires  that we examine TSA's efforts right now to ensure the safety of its  employees with regard to harassment and assault in the workplace,  including incidents where the alleged perpetrator is a member of the  general public, and develop recommendations of how TSA can better  protect its employees.   This amendment would center its review process around employees  themselves, documenting their experiences, getting the feedback to  truly improve the safety of their workplace, and factor into it the  final recommendations that we would hopefully bring to this body.   I urge my colleagues to truly make this is a safe place for many of  our neighbors--many of them, again, working in these sometimes  challenging experiences at the airports and at these ports.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues, again, to support these two  commonsense amendments.
