 Mr. Speaker, today is National Farmers  Day. From farm to fork, our farmers work hard to put food on dinner  tables across this country and around the world.   Today has traditionally been a day to recognize farmers and thank  them for all their endless hard work. Records of National Farmers Day  events date back to the 1800s.   Mr. Speaker, our farmers are the cornerstone of our rural  communities. They face tough odds by the very nature of the business,  and food security is national security.   Right now, there is a critical shortfall of skilled young and  beginning farmers and ranchers. That is why, together with Congressman  Joe Courtney from Connecticut and Congressman John Faso from New York,  we introduced the Young Farmer Success Act.   This legislation provides incentives for those who would like to  pursue a future in the agriculture industry by adding farmers to the  Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, which currently offers loan  payback assistance for professions such as government service,  teaching, and nursing.   Under the program, eligible public service professionals who make 10  years of income-driven student loan payments can have the balance of  their loans forgiven.   On Monday, I heard from a number of young farmers in upstate New York  in Congressman Faso's district. The House Agriculture Committee hosted  a farm bill listening session at SUNY Cobleskill, and we covered topics  from dairy to specialty crops to nutrition assistance programs, and we  heard a lot of excellent feedback from those who shared their stories  with us.   As the House Agriculture Committee works to craft the next farm bill,  these listening sessions have allowed us to hear firsthand from those  who are directly impacted by the farm bill. They provide us with real  world examples of what is working and what isn't working.   With farmers in every region of this country, we heard from many  different perspectives. This feedback will help us write the best farm  bill possible.   Mr. Speaker, food security is national security, and it aids the  long-term sustainability of our country. They provide fresh produce and  products to communities throughout the country, and there is no better  food than something grown locally.   Today, we celebrate our food producers on National Farmers Day, but  we should also celebrate them every day for putting food on our tables  and in our grocery stores. Let's face it, farming is a tough business.  Long hours, unpredictable commodity prices, and, even more,  unpredictable weather conditions, but it is also exciting, rewarding,  and full of opportunities.   Generations of farmers have worked every patch of American soil  caring for the Earth, their animals, and their neighbors.   Mr. Speaker, as vice chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, I  want to wholeheartedly thank America's farmers for providing our  country with safe, sustainable, healthy, and nutritious food every day.  Happy Farmers Day.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, technology connects the  world in ways like never before. From everyday conveniences at our  fingertips to improved communications, technology plays an ever- increasing role in our lives.   We are becoming more dependent on applications, or apps, and the  students of today will become the leaders of tomorrow by developing  such technology. That is why my office is proud again to participate in  the Congressional App Challenge.   This competition allows K-12 students from across the country to  practice their code-writing skills by developing an app. Winning apps  will be displayed in the Capitol Building later this year.   The 2015 winner from my office, Lachlan Campbell, created an app to  store recipes and discover new dishes. I am proud that this State  College student was able to show off his talents in our Nation's  Capitol.   Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that students from across Pennsylvania's  Fifth Congressional District will put their skills to work, create an  app, and submit it to the Congressional App Challenge.   Submissions will close on November 1, and I can't wait to see what  our students create.                            ____________________
