 Madam Speaker, the underlying legislation we are  considering in this rule is extremely alarming. We have two out-of- touch immigration bills that do nothing to address our current  immigration crisis, and then we have a partisan priority that reeks of  the swamp and is simply unconstitutional.   H.R. 1333 restricts any President's authority to suspend entry into  the United States from certain foreign nationals for national security  or public health reasons putting the safety of Americans at risk.   With H.R. 1573, it appears my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle plan to address the crisis at our southern border by sending in  the lawyers. President Biden created this crisis with his policies, and  this bill just continues to encourage more people to come and cross our  border illegally.  [[Page H1975]]    We wrap up this rule with the most ridiculous legislation of all, the  unconstitutional H.R. 51. Our Founders envisioned our Nation's Capitol  set apart from the States and enshrined that in our Constitution. No  action by this body can make Washington, D.C. a State, nor is there a  reason to take such action other than to ensure the Democratic Party  receives two more seats in the United States Senate.   Madam Speaker, I stand in opposition to the underlying bill, and I  urge my colleagues to vote against the rule.
