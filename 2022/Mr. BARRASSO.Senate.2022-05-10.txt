 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today in opposition  to the nomination of Dr. Asmeret Berhe, who has been nominated to serve  as the Director of the Office of Science at the U.S. Department of  Energy.   The Office of Science is the Nation's largest Federal sponsor of  basic research in physical sciences. Its mission is to advance the  energy, economic, and national security of the United States. This job,  this mission to advance the energy, economic, and national security of  the United States is one that I view as very critical.   Dr. Berhe has been a professor of soil biogeochemistry--soil  biogeochemistry--at the University of California Merced for over a  decade. Now, she has focused her research on soil management and  sequestering carbon in the soil. Her background and her experience have  very little to do with the Department of Energy's main scientific  focus.   A May 9, 2001, op-ed in the Wall Street Journal by a physicist whose  expertise is theoretical physics has noted:         Ms. Berhe's research program on soil chemistry, exploring       the capture of carbon dioxide, is relevant to climate-change       policy. But her research expertise isn't in any of the Office       of Science's major programs, and she has no experience as a       scientific administrator and minimal experience with the       Energy Department itself.    So not that there is anything wrong with her underlying experience to  do other things, but for this specific position, the qualifications  just aren't there. Dr. Berhe is clearly not the right choice to lead  the Office of Science.   Certain positions Dr. Berhe has taken or endorsed are also  concerning. On February 28, 2001, she retweeted this statement:         I'm just going to propose that a nation that can land an       SUV sized rover in an ancient lake on another planet can       build an electrical grid that is not [f---ing] useless--    This is her retweeting--    because of slavish devotion to the free market.    Apparently, we are devoted to the free market, and she doesn't like  it.   On May 7, 2015, she wrote in Science that ``the practice of farming''  is to blame for climate change. ``The practice of farming'' is to blame  for climate change.   Dr. Berhe is not the right person to serve as the Director of the  Office of Science. I rise in opposition to her nomination. I urge my  colleagues to join me in voting against this nominee.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to start the  vote.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
