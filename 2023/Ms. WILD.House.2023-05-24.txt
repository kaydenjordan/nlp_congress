 Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of Mental Health  Awareness Month, particularly as it pertains to the struggles young  people face in our Nation today.   Mental health is an issue close to my heart, and ensuring that  everyone has access to the mental health care they need is one of my  top priorities in Congress.   In a recent national survey, 71 percent of college students reported  experiencing mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and  depression.   That is why I will soon be reintroducing my bill, Enhancing Mental  Health and Suicide Prevention Through Campus Planning Act, which  promotes positive mental health among college students and encourages  more comprehensive planning on college campuses to prevent suicide and  other mental health crises.   Schools and college campuses do not have the counselors or services  needed to ensure that every one of our young people has a bright  future, and it is our job to make sure they do.                            ____________________
