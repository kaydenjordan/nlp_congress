 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 716, I call  up the bill (H.R. 3992) to amend the Age Discrimination in Employment  Act of 1967 to prohibit employers from limiting, segregating, or  classifying applicants for employment, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 3992, the Protect Older Job  Applicants Act of 2021.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Protect Older Job Applicants  Act of 2021.   Protecting all workers from workplace discrimination is of the utmost  importance. Unfortunately, older workers have disproportionately been  affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with more workers over the age of 65  leaving the workforce in 2020 than in any year over the last six  decades.   The Protect Older Job Applicants Act of 2021 would help address  discrimination older workers face in the hiring process, and it is an  especially important step toward helping older workers reenter the  workforce as the Nation recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic.   Currently, the disparate impact provision in the Age Discrimination  in Employment Act, the ADEA, covers older employees seeking relief from  age discrimination, but not older job applicants. The bill we are  considering today would clarify the disparate impact provision and make  clear that older job applicants, not just older employees, are  protected.   This bill is a commonsense fix to the ADEA that would help protect  workers from ageist hiring practices. I urge my colleagues to support  this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a Statement of Administrative  Policy in support of H.R. 3992, the Protect Older Job Applicants Act of  2021.                     Statement of Administration Policy   H.R. 3992--Protect Older Job Applicants Act of 2021--Rep. Garcia, D-TX,                             and 62 cosponsors         The Administration supports House passage of the Protect       Older Job Applicants (POJA) Act of 2021. The legislation       would amend the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)       of 1967, which prohibits, among other actions, age-based       discrimination in hiring, to specifically prohibit employers       from limiting, segregating, or classifying job applicants on       the basis of age.        The POJA Act of 2021 provides a critical clarification to       support older Americans during recruitment and hiring,       ensuring the ADEA's nondiscrimination protections extend       fully to older job applicants.        Workplace age discrimination, including at the application       stage, prevents people from fully accessing the American       dream and limits the contributions that they can make to our       shared prosperity. Ensuring equitable access to employment is       a priority for the Administration. The Administration       supports this legislation that protects older job applicants.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to correct the record on a couple of  points. In fact, the committee did have a hearing on this subject on  March 18, 2021, in the Subcommittee of Civil Rights and Human Services.  It was a hearing called ``Fighting for Fairness: Examining Legislation  to Confront Workplace Discrimination.''   Additionally, my colleague's argument simply misstates the law with  regard to places like college campuses or online recruitment. For  example, employers will always have the freedom to choose the time,  place, and manner in which they recruit. Whether it be on a college  campus or LinkedIn, employers face no risk of liability if they can  show it was based on reasonable factors other than age, such as a  larger pool of highly trained individuals from which to recruit.   The argument that anyone who wasn't available to be recruited on  LinkedIn or enrolled in college would be able to sue an employer for  age discrimination is a misunderstanding of this law, Mr. Speaker.   Finally, Title VII has outlawed disparate impact discrimination since  1972. If there are any doubts that these sorts of laws would wipe out  recruiting practices, we would have seen those consequences. In fact,  this law is to correct a couple of circuits that have gone a different  way from the rest of the country. In 9 out of 11 circuits, it is  already the law. So any parade of horribles that my colleague is  suggesting, we would have seen that already and we have not.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Garcia), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to note that the reality is that there is  substantial evidence that older workers are routinely harmed by  plausibly neutral but age-discriminate hiring practices.   For example, in 2017, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco  conducted a study on age discrimination and hiring by sending similar  resumes to 13,000 job openings in 12 cities, totaling 40,000  applicants. For all five job position types they studied, the callback  rate was higher for younger applicants and lower for older applicants,  consistent with age discrimination in hiring.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers on the  underlying bill, and I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I do want to note with regard to my colleague's  remarks, I believe there is a House rule about not impugning the  motives of people who are here on this distinguished floor of the House  of Representatives.   Older workers are suffering from a higher rate of long-term  unemployment versus their younger peers. According to AARP, this has  produced devastating consequences during the COVID-19 pandemic, as 74  percent of workers aged 40 to 65 who have lost a job in 2020 reported  being unemployed for more than 6 months.    Again, Mr. Speaker, this is already the law of the land except for  people in two Federal circuits here in the United States. This bill is  intended to make a uniform law across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Passing the bipartisan Protect Older Job Applicants Act should be a  priority of every Member of Congress. Republicans and Democrats worked  together just a few months ago to advance the Protecting Older Workers  Against Discrimination Act. This bipartisan effort was a major step  toward ensuring older workers can assert legal claims to hold employers  accountable for disparate treatment that results in age discrimination.   However, we cannot defeat age discrimination in employment if we  leave older job applicants behind. Without equal protections, older  workers are still being denied job opportunities because of hiring  practices that, while not intentionally discriminatory, ultimately  exclude workers based on their age.  [[Page H6164]]    Providing job applicants with the tools to seek justice for  discriminatory hiring practices is not just the right thing to do, it  is the smart thing to do. In 2018 our economy missed out on as much as  $850 billion in gross domestic product because older workers who wished  to switch jobs, grow in their jobs, or reenter the workforce were  denied that opportunity.   The Protect Older Job Applicants Act addresses this gap in an  important ADEA protection and helps older workers eliminate barriers  that prevent them from fully contributing to our economy.   More broadly, this legislation will deliver on the promise of the  ADEA and help ensure that all older workers, regardless of whether they  are looking for a job or already have one, are equally protected  against age discrimination under the law in every part of the country.   I want to again thank Ms. Garcia for her leadership. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back the balance of my time.
