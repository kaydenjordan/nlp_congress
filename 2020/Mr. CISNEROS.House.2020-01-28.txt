 Madam Speaker, it is with great pride that I rise today  to honor and congratulate 13 elementary schools in California's 39th  District for their selection as 2020 California Distinguished Schools.   The 39th District elementary schools awarded this distinction  include: Acacia, Blandford, Buena Terra, Charles G. Emery, Golden,  Hidden Trails, Killian, Laguna Road, Laurel Elementary Magnet School of  Innovation and Career Exploration, Mesa Robles, Robert C.

Our students' success is a testament not only to their dedication but  also to the tireless efforts made by educators, administrators, staff,  and parents.   Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my honorable colleagues join me in  congratulating these 13 California distinguished schools for their  tremendous educational achievements.                            ____________________
