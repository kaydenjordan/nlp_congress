 Mr. President, today I bid a fond farewell to my  chief of staff Sean Farrell. Sean has been an indispensable member of  my team for 6 years. During that time, he has worn several hats, each  coming with its own challenges. Sean joined Team Blackburn when I was  serving on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where he mastered  some of the most complex issues that the U.S. Congress examines. After  I was elected to the Senate, Sean agreed to move from the House to the  Senate and assumed the formidable task of managing my legislative  agenda, as well as a gaggle of young lawyers and policy experts.   When I asked Sean to serve as my chief of staff, I knew I was asking  him to face challenges far beyond those normally associated with the  position.  [[Page S3615]]  Pandemic-era rules had scattered our staff across the country, and the  Senate was still limping its way through a once in a lifetime crisis.  Thankfully, Sean stepped up. He approached the job with grace and  persistence and, even during the toughest fights kept his eye on the  ball and the team's focus on serving the people of Tennessee.   We will miss him tremendously, but I have no doubt that his beautiful  wife Kasey will be happy to see him spending more time at home and less  time in the halls of the Dirksen Senate Office Building. I would like  to leave Sean with my thanks for his years of service to the Volunteer  State and my best wishes as he moves forward in this next exciting  season of his career.                            ____________________
