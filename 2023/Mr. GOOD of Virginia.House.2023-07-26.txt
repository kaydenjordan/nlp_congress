 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the actions of  emergency responders in Appomattox and Campbell Counties.   Recent major rainstorms caused severe flooding that affected many of  the residents of these counties. When that happened, the Concord Rescue  Squad, the Concord Volunteer Fire Department, and the Appomattox  Volunteer Fire Department sprang into action, working around the clock  to courageously save many people from the floodwaters.   These three emergency squads mobilized and volunteered their time  once again, as they always do, to help those in need. All their water  rescue teams were activated as they demonstrated true selflessness,  bravery, and decisive action, while making multiple rescues of drivers  trapped in submerging cars.   In fact, these three volunteer squads effectively responded to over  10 calls in one night. They had to navigate dangerous conditions and  unsafe roads, helping to clear fallen trees, power lines, and other  debris. They also saved many others whose houses were flooded with no  other way to escape the floodwaters.   I am grateful for the valiant efforts of the Concord Rescue Squad,  the Concord Volunteer Fire Department, and the Appomattox Volunteer  Fire Department. I am proud to represent them in Virginia's Fifth  District.                      Danville Fire Captains Hone Skills     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the  accomplishments of three fire captains in Danville, Virginia.   Few people demonstrate the mental and physical strength, personal  diligence, or sacrificial love and commitment to their communities that  fire captains do.   Three Danville fire captains recently honed their skills through the  Virginia Chief Officer Academy. The academy is a 6-day training period  established to equip aspiring chief officers in overcoming whatever  leadership challenges may come their way.   During the program, students were trained in personal leadership and  other skills needed to lead at the executive level.   I am proud to congratulate these captains on their completion of this  program at the University of Richmond on Saturday, July 22:   Captain J. Satterfield,   Captain W.T. Poteat, and   Captain J.P. Haymore.   They have worked tirelessly to effectively serve the Danville  community. After completing the program, these men are even more ready  to lead as chief officers in the Danville Fire Department.   I am proud to represent these hardworking individuals in the Fifth  District of Virginia, and I admire their excellent character and  determination to help those in need.                            ____________________
