 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, which  was November 25.   According to the World Health Organization, one in three women around  the world experience violence in their lifetimes, across all class,  race, country, and age groups, but less than 10 percent of abused women  seek judicial or legal help.   That is why I recently cosigned a bipartisan letter to Secretary of  State Pompeo and USAID Administrator Green, urging their continued  support for the citizen security program in Guatemala, which addresses  crime and violence at the community level while working with  Guatemala's Attorney General and judiciary to bring criminals to  justice. The letter also called for the creation of similar programs in  countries that have high levels of corruption and violence against  girls and women.   It is crucial that nations work together to strengthen the rule of  law and support institutional structures that protect women and girls  from abuse and violence.                            ____________________
