On February 15, 2019, the President declared a       ``national emergency'' for the purpose of diverting       appropriated funds from previously designated uses to build a       wall along the southern border. We are aware of no emergency       that remotely justifies such a step. The President's actions       are at odds with the overwhelming evidence in the public       record, including the administration's own data and       estimates. We have lived and worked through national       emergencies, and we support the President's power to mobilize       the Executive Branch to respond quickly in genuine national       emergencies. But under no plausible assessment of the       evidence is there a national emergency today that entitles       the President to tap into funds appropriated for other       purposes to build a wall at the southern border. To our       knowledge, the President's assertion of a national emergency       here is unprecedented, in that he seeks to address a       situation: (1) that has been enduring, rather than one that       has arisen suddenly; (2) that in fact has improved over time       rather than deteriorated; (3) by reprogramming billions of       dollars in funds in the face of clear congressional intent to       the contrary; and (4) with assertions that are rebutted not       just by the public record, but by his agencies' own official       data, documents, and statements.        3. Illegal border crossings are near forty-year lows. At       the outset, there is no evidence of a sudden or emergency       increase in the number of people seeking to cross the       southern border. According to the administration's own data,       the numbers of apprehensions and undetected illegal border       crossings at the southern border are near forty-year lows.       Although there was a modest increase in apprehensions in       2018, that figure is in keeping with the number of       apprehensions only two years earlier, and the overall trend       indicates a dramatic decline over the last fifteen years in       particular. The administration also estimates that       ``undetected unlawful entries'' at the southern border ``fell       from approximately 851,000 to nearly 62,000'' between fiscal       years 2006 to 2016, the most recent years for which data are       available. The United States currently hosts what is       estimated to be the smallest number of undocumented       immigrants since 2004. And in fact, in recent years, the       majority of currently undocumented immigrants entered the       United States legally, but overstayed their visas, a problem       that will not be addressed by the declaration of an emergency       along the southern border.        4. There is no documented terrorist or national security       emergency at the southern border. There is no reason to       believe that there is a terrorist or national security       emergency at the southern border that could justify the       President's proclamation.        a. This administration's own most recent Country Report on       Terrorism, released only five months ago, found that ``there       was no credible evidence indicating that international       terrorist groups have established bases in Mexico, worked       with Mexican drug cartels, or sent operatives via Mexico into       the United States.'' Since 1975, there has been only one       reported incident in which immigrants who had crossed the       southern border illegally attempted to commit a terrorist act       That incident occurred more than twelve years ago, and       involved three brothers from Macedonia who had been brought       into the United States as children more than twenty years       earlier.        b. Although the White House has claimed, as an argument       favoring a wall at the southern border, that almost 4,000       known or suspected terrorists were intercepted at the       southern border in a single year, this assertion has since       been widely and consistently repudiated, including by this       administration's own Department of Homeland Security. The       overwhelming majority of individuals on terrorism watchlists       who were intercepted by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol were       attempting to travel to the United States by air; of the       individuals on the terrorist watchlist who were encountered       while entering the United States during fiscal year 2017,       only 13 percent traveled by land. And for those who have       attempted to enter by land, only a small fraction do so at       the southern border. Between October 2017 and March 2018,       forty-one foreign immigrants on the terrorist watchlist were       intercepted at the northern border. Only six such immigrants       were intercepted at the southern border.        5. There is no emergency related to violent crime at the       southern border. Nor can the administration justify its       actions on the grounds that the incidence of violent crime on       the southern border constitutes a national emergency. Factual       evidence consistently shows that unauthorized immigrants have       no special proclivity to engage in criminal or violent       behavior. According to a Cato Institute analysis of       criminological data, undocumented immigrants are 44 percent       less likely to be incarcerated nationwide than are native-      born citizens. And in Texas, undocumented immigrants were       found to have a first-time conviction rate 32 percent below       that of native-born Americans; the conviction rates of       unauthorized immigrants for violent crimes such as homicide       and sex offenses were also below those of native-born  [[Page S1434]]       Americans. Meanwhile, overall rates of violent crime in the       United States have declined significantly over the past 25       years, falling 49 percent from 1993 to 2017. And violent       crime rates in the country's 30 largest cities have decreased       on average by 2.7 percent in 2018 alone, further undermining       any suggestion that recent crime trends currently warrant the       declaration of a national emergency.        6. There is no human or drug trafficking emergency that can       be addressed by a wall at the southern border. The       administration has claimed that the presence of human and       drug trafficking at the border justifies its emergency       declaration. But there is no evidence of any such sudden       crisis at the southern border that necessitates a       reprogramming of appropriations to build a border wall.        a. The overwhelming majority of opioids that enter the       United States across a land border are carried through legal       ports of entry in personal or commercial vehicles, not       smuggled through unauthorized border crossings. A border wall       would not stop these drugs from entering the United States.       Nor would a wall stop drugs from entering via other routes,       including smuggling tunnels, which circumvent such physical       barriers as fences and walls, and international mail (which       is how high-purity fentanyl, for example, is usually shipped       from China directly to the United States).        b. Likewise, illegal crossings at the southern border are       not the principal source of human trafficking victims. About       two-thirds of human trafficking victims served by nonprofit       organizations that receive funding from the relevant       Department of Justice office are U.S. citizens, and even       among non-citizens, most trafficking victims usually arrive       in the country on valid visas. None of these instances of       trafficking could be addressed by a border wall. And the       three states with the highest per capita trafficking       reporting rates are not even located along the southern       border.        7. This proclamation will only exacerbate the humanitarian       concerns that do exist at the southern border. There are real       humanitarian concerns at the border, but they largely result       from the current administration's own deliberate policies       towards migrants. For example, the administration has used a       ``metering'' policy to turn away families fleeing extreme       violence and persecution in their home countries, forcing       them to wait indefinitely at the border to present their       asylum cases, and has adopted a number of other punitive       steps to restrict those seeking asylum at the southern       border. These actions have forced asylum-seekers to live on       the streets or in makeshift shelters and tent cities with       abysmal living conditions, and limited access to basic       sanitation has caused outbreaks of disease and death. This       state of affairs is a consequence of choices this       administration has made, and erecting a wall will do nothing       to ease the suffering of these people.        8. Redirecting funds for the claimed ``national emergency''       will undermine U.S. national security and foreign policy       interests. In the face of a nonexistent threat, redirecting       funds for the construction of a wall along the southern       border will undermine national security by needlessly pulling       resources from Department of Defense programs that are       responsible for keeping our troops and our country safe and       running effectively.        a. Repurposing funds from the defense construction budget       will drain money from critical defense infrastructure       projects, possibly including improvement of military       hospitals, construction of roads, and renovation of on-base       housing. And the proclamation will likely continue to divert       those armed forces already deployed at the southern border       from their usual training activities or missions, affecting       troop readiness.        b. In addition, the administration's unilateral,       provocative actions are heightening tensions with our       neighbors to the south, at a moment when we need their help       to address a range of Western Hemisphere concerns. These       actions are placing friendly governments to the south under       impossible pressures and driving partners away. They have       especially strained our diplomatic relationship with Mexico,       a relationship that is vital to regional efforts ranging from       critical intelligence and law enforcement partnerships to       cooperative efforts to address the growing tensions with       Venezuela. Additionally, the proclamation could well lead to       the degradation of the natural environment in a manner that       could only contribute to long-term socioeconomic and security       challenges.        c. Finally, by declaring a national emergency for domestic       political reasons with no compelling reason or justification       from his senior intelligence and law enforcement officials,       the President has further eroded his credibility with foreign       leaders, both friend and foe. Should a genuine foreign crisis       erupt, this lack of credibility will materially weaken this       administration's ability to marshal allies to support the       United States, and will embolden adversaries to oppose us.        9. The situation at the border does not require the use of       the armed forces, and a wall is unnecessary to support the       use of the armed forces. We understand that the       administration is also claiming that the situation at the       southern border ``requires use of the armed forces,'' and       that a wall is ``necessary to support such use'' of the armed       forces. These claims are implausible        a. Historically, our country has deployed National Guard       troops at the border solely to assist the Border Patrol when       there was an extremely high number of apprehensions, together       with a particularly low number of Border Patrol agents. But       currently, even with retention and recruitment challenges,       the Border Patrol is at historically high staffing and       funding levels, and apprehensions--measured in both absolute       and per-agent terms--are near historic lows.        b. Furthermore, the composition of southern border       crossings has shifted such that families and unaccompanied       minors now account for the majority of immigrants seeking       entry at the southern border; these individuals do not       present a threat that would need to be countered with       military force.        c. Just last month, when asked what the military is doing       at the border that couldn't be done by the Department of       Homeland Security if it had the funding for it, a top-level       defense official responded, ``[n]one of the capabilities that       we are providing [at the southern border] are combat       capabilities. It's not a war zone along the border.''       Finally, it is implausible that hundreds of miles of wall       across the southern border are somehow necessary to support       the use of armed forces. We are aware of no military- or       security-related rationale that could remotely justify such       an endeavor.        10. There is no basis for circumventing the appropriations       process with a declaration of a national emergency at the       southern border. We do not deny that our nation faces real       immigration and national security challenges. But as the       foregoing demonstrates, these challenges demand a thoughtful,       evidence-based strategy, not a manufactured crisis that rests       on falsehoods and fearmongering. In a briefing before the       Senate Intelligence Committee on January 29, 2019, less than       one month before the Presidential Proclamation, the Directors       of the CIA, DNI, FBI, and NSA testified about numerous       serious current threats to U.S. national security, but none       of the officials identified a security crisis at the U.S.-      Mexico border. In a briefing before the House Armed Services       Committee the next day, Pentagon officials acknowledged that       the 2018 National Defense Strategy does not identify the       southern border as a security threat. Leading legislators       with access to classified information and the President's own       statements have strongly suggested, if not confirmed, that       there is no evidence supporting the administration's claims       of an emergency. And it is reported that the President made       the decision to circumvent the appropriations process and       reprogram money without the Acting Secretary of Defense       having even started to consider where the funds might come       from, suggesting an absence of consultation and internal       deliberations that in our experience are necessary and       expected before taking a decision of this magnitude.        11. For all of the foregoing reasons, in our professional       opinion, there is no factual basis for the declaration of a       national emergency for the purpose of circumventing the       appropriations process and reprogramming billions of dollars       in funding to construct a wall at the southern border, as       directed by the Presidential Proclamation of February 15,       2019.
