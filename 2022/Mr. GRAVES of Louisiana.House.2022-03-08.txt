 Madam Speaker, look at what is happening  right now. We are dependent upon foreign sources of energy from  volatile places around the world. We are bringing in energy from  African nations. We have recently brought in energy from Venezuela,  from Russia, from Iraq.   Madam Speaker, we have these resources in the United States. The  President stood in this very room and talked about buying American. Why  can't we buy our own American energy?   Tonight and tomorrow, we are going to be talking about banning  Russian oil. Well, I welcome folks to this discussion. We have been  trying to do this for years. And unfortunately, my friends on the other  side of the aisle have opposed our efforts, have opposed efforts to ban  Russian oil.   You can look at history. Whenever you stop producing in the United  States, it doesn't change demand. All it does is it causes you to get  the energy from somewhere else. This is affecting people all across  America.   As a result of President Biden's strategies, as a result of Democrats  impeding good policy, we are now to a point where we have the highest  gasoline prices in American history. We watched under President Biden  where we nearly tripled our dependence upon Russian crude oil--nearly  tripled it.   Madam Speaker, it has greater emissions. They have greater  environmental impacts. And again, why can't we buy America's resources?  These are flawed energy strategies that are impacting those people the  most that can least afford it.   ``Buying American,'' we support that term. We support American  energy. We support putting Americans back to work.
