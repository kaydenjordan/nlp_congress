 Madam Speaker, today, one in five Americans are  affected by dyslexia, making it the most common learning disability.  Yet, there are still children in U.S. school systems that go without  being diagnosed. Instead, they are written off as having a lack of  effort, or a plain lack of intelligence.   Despite misconception, dyslexia is not connected to one's level of  intelligence. In fact, where students have a difficult time reading,  they often excel in creative thought and critical thinking. My  bipartisan legislation, the 21st Century Dyslexia Act, will Federally  define dyslexia and label proper treatments and diagnosis, enabling  teachers, students, and parents to assist aspiring students to achieve  successful academic careers, and to ensure that all children are  granted equal opportunity in the classroom.                              Save Our Sequoias     Madam Speaker, 3,000 years; that is how long some  giant sequoias have been alive. To put this into perspective, these  trees started growing before the concept of democracy, the English  language, and the birth of Christ.   The Mariposa Grove, the largest grove of giant sequoias in Yosemite  National Park has been a source of inspiration for generations. When  the Washburn Fire recently hit the Mariposa Grove, the fire's intensity  dramatically decreased, thanks to 50 years of thinning and prescribed  burns.   There is a stark contrast between areas that have a history of proper  management and those that have been disregarded. While the fire  subsided in the Mariposa Grove, surrounding areas that did not receive  sufficient management were destroyed.   As a licensed forester, I take it upon myself to seek science-based  solutions for the conservation of our forests. The Mariposa Grove  serves as a prime example of how mechanical thinning and prescribed  burns are necessary tools for proper forest management.   It is my hope that the grove continues its legacy of inspiration by  encouraging a new generation of proactive forest management that will  protect these iconic trees for the enjoyment of generations to come.   It is past time for the Natural Resources Committee to mark up the  bipartisan Save Our Sequoias Act, and for the House to pass it to  protect these iconic national treasures.                      Great Basin Bristlecone Pine Trees     Madam Speaker, recently, we have talked a lot about  the dire situation of some of California's most iconic trees, the  sequoias. But we have yet to discuss the condition of California's  oldest trees, the Great Basin bristlecone pine trees.   Great Basin bristlecone pines signify resilience, longevity, and  perseverance. To cope in difficult times, they almost completely die  off, leaving but a few strips of bark that can continue to grow along  the ground or skyward for thousands of years. To ward off pests,  bristlecone pines trap pests in their thick resin.   Due to severe drought, in mixed forests, bark beetles have been able  to build up broods on other tree species  [[Page H7082]]  and overwhelm many bristlecone pines, which succumb to bark beetles in  a way they have never before.                                time  1300    The good news is, in the past month, a Forest Service pathologist  confirmed that Methuselah, the nearly 5,000-year-old bristlecone pine  thought to be the oldest tree in the world, has yet to face bark beetle  infestation.   There is still time to act on the drought in a timely, commonsense  manner to protect our Great Basin bristlecone pines. We must follow the  bristlecone pine's example of resilience and perseverance, adapting our  laws to the needs of the natural world to stave off catastrophic  wildfire and severe drought.                  Devastating Year for Farmers and Ranchers    Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the hardworking farmers and  ranchers of Arkansas, who are being crushed by unprecedented drought  and heat on top of out-of-control inflation that has created  suffocating input costs for basic farming inputs such as fuel and  fertilizer.   Although this devastating farm year can't be salvaged, hopefully the  Biden administration and Democrats in Congress will realize how  detrimental their actions have been on raising energy and food prices  on those who can least afford it: low-income and fixed-income  Americans.   There is still time to change directions on this dangerous path  Democrats are leading our country down. I plead with my colleagues  across the aisle to embolden common sense.                            ____________________
