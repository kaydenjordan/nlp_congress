 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished  gentleman from Illinois and the distinguished gentlewoman from Florida  for the opportunity to speak.   The late Congressman John Lewis once said: ``Your vote is precious,  almost sacred. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have to  create a more perfect union.'' Few truer words have been spoken.   Over the weekend, I had the privilege of joining President Biden and  my colleagues in Alabama to commemorate the 58th anniversary of Bloody  Sunday. We traced the steps of incredible brave soldiers. What a  blessing to feel their heartbeats in the wind.   I will make my thoughts on this trip concise. We must protect the  right to vote. Fair representation is a cornerstone of our democracy. A  war was fought to give every American of every race one vote. For  voters today, voters tomorrow, and all of those who sacrificed for the  sacred right to vote, we must pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights  Advancement Act to restore the vote for all.   In every fashion, in every avenue, we will continue to battle to  protect this sacred right and strengthen the very foundation of our  democracy.   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Mr. Speaker, I thank so much Representative  Troy Carter for his words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey).
