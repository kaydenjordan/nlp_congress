 Mr. Speaker, America should no longer be shocked with the  Republican mantra of ``no'' to everything--that is, until Wall Street  and the financial services industry calls. Today's action on H.J. Res.  66 and 67 illustrates this unfortunate reality.   Congressional Republicans once again are putting the financial  industry ahead of average American workers. Their attempt to roll back  President Obama's Department of Labor rules, which expanded working  families' abilities to save their own retirement money through State-  and large-city-administered retirement savings programs. The Republican  proposal restricts saving options for working people.   For years, Republicans have hawked a false crisis about Social  Security solvency; meanwhile, now they are proposing a very real  retirement security crisis for America's seniors. We are nearing a  boiling point. The difference between what average Americans have saved  for retirement and where their savings should be is staggering: more  than $6 trillion in shortfalls.   Roughly half of all U.S. families have no money set aside for  retirement. Thirty-nine million Americans don't have access to a  workplace retirement savings plan. Even Americans who work diligently  to save for retirement are falling behind. With 10,000 American seniors  reaching retirement age every day, enormous strain on the Federal  budget is mounting to make up the difference.   Today most workers don't have a pension. Those that do, can't be so  sure it will be there throughout their golden years. There has been a  dramatic decline in guaranteed retirement benefits through employer  support.   Without access to easy and affordable savings vehicles, far too many  American workers will retire into poverty. This leads to overreliance  on Social Security and other State and Federal assistance programs. It  surely isn't the American Dream.   President Obama identified this crisis. He spoke to Congress about  trying to work together to address it through bipartisan action, but  our Republican colleagues said ``no.'' Their failure to act drove  President Obama to coordinate with States, eight of which have already  passed laws to create State-administered retirement programs for  private sector workers, which H.J. Res. 66 and 67 would roll back.   More than half the States are considering similar action to improve  retirement readiness, and these plans help small businesses offer  savings plans for their employees without imposing financial burdens.    Mr. Speaker, so what do Congressional Republicans have as  an alternative solution? Nothing.   The cost to roll this rule back is significant. It is not good for  retirees or workers, and it maintains the growing burden on taxpayers  who fund assistance programs.   I urge all of my colleagues to reject this shortsighted action. Stand  up for the American working class and oppose both H.J. Res. 66 and H.J.  Res. 67.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Veasey) for his great leadership in bringing us together in this Blue  Collar Caucus. I feel very comfortable. I actually have blue on today.   I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle) of the  greater Philadelphia area, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Norcross), and myself from the Toledo to Cleveland, Ohio, part of our  country to bring to the attention of the American people the fact, for  example, that workers in northern Ohio, since the year 2000, earn on  average $7,000 less than they did at the beginning of the century. They  have taken some great hits. They are hardworking people. They are  fighting back, but they need our help.   In the last 3 weeks, if we take a look at President Trump's term thus  far, we begin to see the real Donald at work, if I might quote one of  the news media. After months of grandiose campaign promises to  renegotiate NAFTA, bring back American manufacturing jobs, and make  America great, we can begin to assess where he is putting his  attention. I think this is really important for us, as we represent  blue-collar America, what is he doing for them. I think the proof is in  his actions, or lack thereof.   After roughly 20 executive orders and actions, we see President Trump  has a penchant for mediagenic events and moments with a hodgepodge of  executive orders, but apparently not sending any legislation up here  yet. And most striking is his clear motivation to assist his wealthy  friends on Wall Street with appointments to the administration, such as  Secretary of Treasury, rather than paying attention to average  Americans who voted for him. He exhibits a great penchant for public  approval rather than a focus on efforts to improve the current economic  stagnation of average Americans.   We are noting that he is filled his Cabinet with billionaires and  multimillionaires who simply can't figure out how to walk in the shoes  of blue-collar America. His actions to help the wealthiest Americans  will have significant consequences.   So what happened with his promise to drain the swamp?   I thought in the first month we would have had something that would  really resonate out in the heartland.   While all of this happens just miles away at the White House, our  Republican congressional colleagues remain either silent or moving the  car in reverse.   Why would they criticize activity that helps those who fund their  elections?   We need campaign finance reform to dominate their political focus and  write their policy objectives, like taking away today here in the House  the ability of workers to save money for their own pensions, for  heaven's sake.   In Trump's first days, he took action to roll back the financial  reform bill called Dodd-Frank and tried to eliminate protections for  seniors as they seek retirement investment advice. We know there are a  lot of sharks out there in the financial waters.   Why wouldn't you want to help the American people rather than hurt  them more?   He did nothing to address the trade issues, which were in his power  to do on day one, and propelled his victory through our part of the  country. I note my colleagues come from Texas, Pennsylvania, New  Jersey, and me being from Ohio. It was actually the Midwestern States  that lifted this President to victory. He hasn't declared China as a  currency manipulator. He could have done that already.   He had no elimination of the Buy America waiver, which affords access  to U.S. Government contracts for all firms and goods from 45 World  Trade Organization nations and 16 additional U.S. Free Trade Agreements  that exist. Not a word about that.   No NAFTA renegotiation. He could have pulled the plug on that on day  one. Nothing.   Where is the negotiating team in place to take care of what NAFTA has  done to the people of the heartland and our country in general?   What will President Trump do for ongoing negotiations he inherited on  the U.S.-China Bilateral Investment Treaty, the Trade in Services  Agreement, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership? Will he  put American workers, global workers, and environmental concerns at the  forefront of negotiations? Or will he continue to allow corporate and  wealthy financial interests to dominate and run roughshod over workers  and communities?   Candidate Trump promised the 15,000 steelworkers laid off due to a  flood of unfairly traded imports that he would support America's  manufacturing and industrial base. He came to Ohio and said that. He  promised to protect our industries from the Chinese and to keep jobs at  home. But in the pipeline of executive action, he actually enforced the  trade agreement Buy America waiver, negating his promises to help  America's steelworkers. How about that? That was done in the first  month.    Just recently, the U.S. Department of Commerce released a report that  showed the U.S. trade deficit hit a 4-year high as it rose to over half  a billion dollars for 2016. Middle America isn't surprised this trade  deficit continues to hollow out U.S. manufacturing jobs and depress  incomes across our great Nation. Reducing our trade deficit should be a  top priority for the new administration. I hope the President puts a  big scoreboard in front of the White House on his progress on this  front. It would do wonders to fix the economy for working Americans if  we balanced that trade deficit.   As Congressman Veasey has said, the Democratic Party has long  championed issues for blue-collar America that create real life success  for working class people. Lost in the political dialogue is the reality  that Democrats have always stood for individual and economic rights for  average Americans of all backgrounds. Each of us in our own lives  represents that, and it is a privilege to serve here in this House.   For blue-collar families, education remains a vital stepping-stone in  upward mobility. Democrats continue to prioritize early childhood  literacy and STEM education, efforts to make Americans globally  competitive in advanced manufacturing, science, medicine, and research  and development. Democrats continue to expand apprenticeship options to  allow young people to enter the workforce trained and without the  enormous burden of student loans.   Meanwhile, Republicans push policies that exacerbate the ever- expanding wealth gap, even allowing it to invade our school systems.  Just watch the opposition Mr. Trump and his newly minted Education  Secretary Betsy DeVos have towards public schools.   In closing, let me thank our esteemed leaders here in the Blue Collar  Caucus, Congressman Veasey and Congressman Boyle. I don't see that this  [[Page H1231]]  President is draining the swamp. He is actually digging deeper into it.  I really thank them for being an accountability wing here in the first  branch mentioned in the Constitution--the legislative branch. I  congratulate both of them. It has been a great privilege to join them  this evening.    Mr. Speaker, I want to welcome my colleague, Congressman  Joe Crowley, the chair of the Democratic Caucus who is joining us this  evening as well. I know how very busy he is, and I appreciate it.   As author of the legislation that created our Nation's World War II  Memorial here in Washington, I felt obligated and actually compelled to  come to this well tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Trump administration's  hollow January 27 statement commemorating International Holocaust  Remembrance Day.    Statement by President Trump on International Holocaust Remembrance                           Day--January 27, 2017         ``It is with a heavy heart and somber mind that we remember       and honor the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust. It       is impossible to fully fathom the depravity and horror       inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror.        ``Yet, we know that in the darkest hours of humanity, light       shines the brightest. As we remember those who died, we are       deeply grateful to those who risked their lives to save the       innocent.        ``In the name of the perished, I pledge to do everything in       my power throughout my Presidency, and my life, to ensure       that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of       good. Together, we will make love and tolerance prevalent       throughout the world.''     Astoundingly, the White House statement made no reference  to the 6 million Jews that perished in the Holocaust. There was no  mention of anti-Semitism nor a reference to Israel, as has been  customary in prior statements issued by our past Presidents.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement by President George  Bush in 2008.     Statement by President George W. Bush on the International Day of   Commemoration in Memory of the Victims of the Holocaust--January 27,                                    2008         On the third International Day of Commemoration, we       remember and mourn the victims of the Holocaust.        I was deeply moved by my recent visit to Yad Vashem,       Israel's Holocaust museum. Sixty-three years after the       liberation of Auschwitz, we must continue to educate       ourselves about the lessons of the Holocaust and honor those       whose lives were taken as a result of a totalitarian ideology       that embraced a national policy of violent hatred, bigotry,       and extermination. It is also our responsibility to honor the       survivors and those courageous souls who refused to be       bystanders and instead risked their own lives to try to save       the Nazis' intended victims.        Remembering the victims, heroes, and lessons of the       Holocaust remains important today. We must continue to       condemn the resurgence of anti-Semitism, that same virulent       intolerance that led to the Holocaust, and we must combat       bigotry and hatred in all forms in America and abroad. Today       provides a sobering reminder that evil exists and a call that       when we find evil, we must resist it.        May God bless the memory of the victims of the Holocaust,       and may we never forget.     Mr. Speaker, I will also include in the Record a  statement by President Barack Obama from 2015 showing what the White  House said about Holocaust Remembrance Day.  Statement by President Obama on International Holocaust Remembrance Day   and the 70th Anniversary of the Liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau--2015         On the tenth International Holocaust Remembrance Day and       the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau,       the American people pay tribute to the six million Jews and       millions of others murdered by the Nazi regime. We also honor       those who survived the Shoah, while recognizing the scars and       burdens that many have carried ever since.        Honoring the victims and survivors begins with our renewed       recognition of the value and dignity of each person. It       demands from us the courage to protect the persecuted and       speak out against bigotry and hatred. The recent terrorist       attacks in Paris serve as a painful reminder of our       obligation to condemn and combat rising anti-Semitism in all       its forms, including the denial or trivialization of the       Holocaust.        This anniversary is an opportunity to reflect on the       progress we have made confronting this terrible chapter in       human history and on our continuing efforts to end genocide.       I have sent a Presidential delegation to join Polish       President Komorowski, the Polish people, official delegations       from scores of nations, and many survivors, at today's       official commemoration in Poland.        As a founding member of the International Holocaust       Remembrance Alliance, the United States joins the Alliance's       thirty other member nations and partners in reiterating its       solemn responsibility to uphold the commitments of the 2000       Stockholm Declaration. We commemorate all of the victims of       the Holocaust, pledging never to forget, and recalling the       cautionary words of the author and survivor of Auschwitz       Primo Levi, ``It happened, therefore it can happen again. . .       . It can happen anywhere.'' Today we come together and       commit, to the millions of murdered souls and all survivors,       that it must never happen again.     Mr. Speaker, let me be clear: between 1933 and 1945, 14  million unarmed men, women, and children were murdered in Eastern  Europe. These bloodlands were where most of Europe's Jews lived and  where Hitler's and Stalin's imperial plans overlapped. Of the 14  million human beings who were killed, at least 6 million were Jewish  souls. Their carnage was the largest in human history.   Thus, the brevity of the Trump administration's statement was  surprisingly and unusually short and general--only about 100 words.  When the White House was asked about these glaring omissions, multiple  officials in the new administration at the White House merely confirmed  ``the statement was no mistake.''   The Trump White House statement chose not to explicitly acknowledge  the deaths of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust. This is atypical of  any former President of our country. Moreover, the Trump statement  implies that the recognition of the death of Jews during the Holocaust  would come at the exclusion of other groups. The tone of those remarks  takes the reader in the direction of denying the suffering of the  Jewish people.   For the President not to mention Jews is a terrible omen.   So let us go through some history. The term ``holocaust,'' arising  from World War II, has come to mean annihilation of Jewish persons.  From 1933 to 1945, those Jewish souls who perished in Europe totaled at  least 6 million human beings. Between 2.7 million and 3 million Jews  were murdered in Nazi-run death camps. In the USSR, 1,340,000 Jewish  deaths were ordered by Joseph Stalin. At least 1.5 million of the  victims forcibly killed by Hitler and Stalin were children.   Cumulatively, this carnage represented about two-thirds of the 9  million Jews who had resided in Central Europe. By way of explanation,  for the 8 million Christians and others who were also murdered, the  term generally used to describe their carnage is martyrdom. As an  example, in Poland, 3 million Catholic Christian Poles were martyred by  Nazi and Soviet killing machines.   The Holocaust also included Stalin's mass executions and forced  starvation  [[Page H1236]]  and relocation of Soviet prisoners of war to fight in horrendous places  like the Battle of Monte Cassino after being marched through the Middle  East. Many of them were buried in Tehran.   Stalin also perpetrated a massive post-war ethnic and religious  cleansing of Jews and non-Jews. As Hitler and Stalin fought for control  of the European continent, over 14 million innocent people--these  aren't soldiers I am talking about. This was in addition to the 14  million--women, children, and men who were civilians died in their  vastly evil plunder. Millions of Eastern Europeans were trapped between  the two most murderous regimes in not only European history, but human  history: Nazi Germany and Communist Soviet Union.   As an aside, I found it chilling that President Trump's top adviser,  Steve Bannon, in an address to the Vatican in 2014, referenced in a  most troubling line of thought the name of Julius Evola and his  murderous movement.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record excerpts of an article entitled  ``This is How Steve Bannon Sees the Entire World,'' which is also  available at www.buzzfeed.com.   [From BuzzFeed News Reporter]               This Is How Steve Bannon Sees the Entire World                            (By J. Lester Feder)         Donald Trump's newly named chief strategist and senior       counselor Steve Bannon laid out his globalist nationalist       vision in unusually in-depth remarks delivered by Skype to a       conference held inside the Vatican in the summer of 2014.        Bannon: I think it's a little bit more complicated. When       Vladimir Putin, when you really look at some of the       underpinnings of some of his beliefs today, a lot of those       come from what I call Eurasianism; he's got an advisor who       harkens back to Julius Evola and different writers of the       early 20th century who are really the supporters of what's       called the traditionalist movement, which really eventually       metastazied into Italian fascism. A lot of people that are       traditionalists are attracted to that.        One of the reasons is that they believe that at least Putin       is standing up for traditional institutions, and he's trying       to do it in a form of nationalism--and I think that people,       particularly in certain countries, want to see the       sovereignty for their country, they want to see nationalism       for their country. They don't believe in this kind of pan-      European Union or they don't believe in the centralized       government in the United States. They'd rather see more of a       states-based entity that the founders originally set up where       freedoms were controlled at the local level.        I'm not justifying Vladimir Putin and the kleptocracy that       he represents, because he eventually is the state capitalist       of kleptocracy. However, we the Judeo-Christian West really       have to look at what he's talking about as far as       traditionalism goes--particularly the sense of where it       supports the underpinnings of nationalism--and I happen to       think that the individual sovereignty of a country is a good       thing and a strong thing. I think strong countries and strong       nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors, and       that is really the building block that built Western Europe       and the United States, and I think it's what can see us       forward.     Mr. Speaker, Julius Evola has been described as one of  the most influential Fascist racists in Italian history, admired by the  Nazi SS, its commander, Heinrich Himmler, and Benito Mussolini. Nazi SS  Reichsfuhrer Heinrich Himmler was most certainly responsible for the  Holocaust.   Hitler's madness obsessed over creating an Aryan nation. Joseph  Stalin's depraved dream of conquest knew no bounds. Stalin even  conscripted Jews to lead hunts to exterminate other ethnic groups, and  then killed the Jews when the mission was completed. The level of  Stalin's depravity is difficult for sane people to understand.   Violent anti-Semitism and hatred did not end with the defeat of Nazi  Germany and the ultimate collapse of the Communist Soviet Union. We can  observe a resurgence in certain places in Europe and, sadly, even in  isolated incidents here in the United States.                                time  1930    History tells us that the rising anti-Semitic violence is not just a  threat to civil society today, but the future of free people  everywhere. The recent anti-Semitic terrorist incidents in Paris at the  Bataclan, Jewish-owned enterprises, or Nazi symbols appearing in  hateful situations here in our own beloved country demand that decent  people find peaceful means to stare down hate.   Timothy Snyder's masterful book ``Bloodlands'' documents the 6  million souls of the Holocaust and 8 million souls of martyrdom and  murder. The Nazis established killing centers for efficient mass  execution. These killing centers, also referred to as ``extermination  camps'' or ``death camps,'' were almost exclusively ``death  factories.'' German Schutzstaffel and police murdered nearly 2.7  million Jews in these killing centers either by asphyxiation with  poison gas or by shooting.   For the non-Jewish populations of Europe, the 8 million non-Jewish  victims of Nazi and communist campaigns of mass murder include Romas,  Soviet prisoners of war, Aktion T4 patients, Ukrainian Holodomor famine  victims, Serbs, the disabled, the LGBTQ communities, and others known  only to God.   There were also unfathomable crimes against entire nations, as Poland  and Belarus were both slated for complete extinction. Poland lost an  astounding 20 percent of its entire population, with 6 million killed  in the war, and Belarus, though smaller in population, lost 25 percent  of its population.   In Poland, leaders were annihilated. Many members of the Catholic  clergy were either threatened with deportation, kept in custody, or  sent to camps. The Catholic Church was particularly suppressed, for  nearly a fifth of all priests--over 3,000--were killed between 1939 and  1945, most in concentration camps.   From 1932 to 1933, Joseph Stalin's forced famine engulfed much of  present-day Ukraine and its eastern flank. The heaviest losses were in  Ukraine--which is struggling for its freedom today--which had been the  most productive agricultural area of the Soviet Union. Stalin was  determined to crush all evidence of Ukrainian pride. As with Poland's  leadership, the famine was accompanied by a devastating purge of all of  Ukraine's intelligentsia.   Millions of peasants were condemned to death by starvation. Troops  and secret police units waged a merciless war against peasants who  refused to give up their grain. Any man, woman, or child caught taking  even a handful of grain from a collective farm could be, and often  were, executed or deported to work camps. Stalin's system of internal  passports and brutal secret police forced collectivization of the land  to Communist-run production.   After a long search through history and recordkeeping, I can  personally give testimony and even learned that the Catholic Church  located in today's Ukraine, in which our maternal grandparents were  married, held a dark secret. Joseph Stalin's secret police, the  People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, the NKVD, killed 168 people  in its basement as Stalin's Black Raven trucks drove the innocents to  their death.   Historians continue to seek truth even until today about what  happened. Their painstaking research includes information from the  Soviet archives. Though some people try to erase history or ignore it,  others work diligently to record it and learn from it.   I recall how fondly our grandmother spoke of Jewish storekeepers in  the region from which she emigrated, welcoming her before and after  church on Sunday and telling her to change into her church shoes there  before attending mass and after her 5-mile hike from her village and  the 5-mile hike back. The Jewish storekeeper would always give her a  piece of candy.   There are other Members here tonight that wish to speak. I am so  grateful for their presence here tonight because we are the bearers of  liberty's torch.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York, (Mr. Crowley),  the great leader of the Democratic Caucus, and I thank him for taking  time from his busy schedule to be here with us.    Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful for Mr. Crowley's presence  and his eloquent remarks this evening, representing one of the major  cities in our country where Jewish leaders from all walks of life have  helped elevate America. I know how proud they are of him and what he is  attempting to do. I hope every one of our colleagues, all 435, sign on  to his resolution. It is most worthy. I thank him so very, very much  for joining us this evening.   I want to tell a story in the region that I represent, though this  particular neighborhood was cut out of my district. A Nazi swastika was  painted on a garage door recently of the home of a Muslim family. It  was really repugnant and very cruel, but what happened in our  community? What did the American people do? One neighbor came over with  a bottle of red paint and she made a big heart over the swastika. Then  the conductor of the symphony came and musicians came, and they played  ``Ode to Joy'' to the family, and other friends came and the American  people.   I love the American people because deep in their hearts they live the  values of liberty and justice for all. The garage door itself was  replaced by the Toledo Overhead Door Company. They gave the family a  new door for free. I am just so proud of them. I am just so proud of  them.   Our communities don't have to bear this sadness of anti-Semitism and  of degradation by those who really don't  [[Page H1238]]  get what this country is made of. I know the Trump White House  statement on the Holocaust falls far short of the administration's  ability to properly recognize and record history accurately.   The Trump White House has the means to hire appropriate staff to  prepare thoughtful, carefully researched statements, and their 2017  statement is out of touch with history. History teaches us that  wherever anti-Semitism has gone unchecked, the persecution of others  has been present or not far behind. Presenting historical truth and  defeating anti-Semitism must be a cause of great importance not only  for Jews but also for us, for people who value liberty, truth, free  expression of religion, justice for all. I know that is the vast  majority of the American people.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the subject of our Special Order this  evening.    I want to thank Mr. Brendan F. Boyle of Pennsylvania also  for coming to the floor this evening. If there is any remaining time, I  would just like to read a couple of the sentences of Congressman  Boyle's remarks because they are so incredible.   He talks about Deborah Lipstadt, an American historian and author of  influential books such as ``Denying the Holocaust,'' who wrote an  important article in The Atlantic, entitled, ``The Trump  Administration's Flirtation With Holocaust Denial.''   He talks about ``'hardcore Holocaust denial.' In this type of  rhetoric, anti-Semites argue that the Holocaust simply did not occur;  that there was no systematic plan to destroy the Jewish people based  solely on their religion.   ``This type of hate speech has unfortunately been espoused by those  who seek to delegitimize the suffering of the Jewish people since the  Holocaust began.''   But he talks about a more insidious form of denial in rhetoric that  has begun to creep into our national discussion. Lipstadt terms this  ``'softcore Holocaust denial.' This form of denial, argues Lipstadt,  uses different tactics but has the same end-goal. . . . It does not  deny the facts, but it minimizes them, arguing that Jews use the  Holocaust to draw attention away from criticism of Israel. . . .   ``Softcore denial also includes Holocaust minimization, as when  someone suggests it was not so bad. Softcore denial, then, is  potentially more insidious than our traditional form of denial, by  minimizing the suffering of the Jewish people and suggesting that while  the Holocaust may have occurred, it was not just about the Jews per  se.''   I appreciate those listening this evening and am very grateful to  have this privilege of entering into the Record materials we believe  important not only to our Republic, but to free people everywhere.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
