 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and dear friend,  Congresswoman Luna, for leading the charge to hold our Democrat  counterparts responsible for their gross misuse of power.   Adam Schiff abused his power as chairman of the House Intelligence  Committee to create false narratives that were sold to the American  people about President Trump. The Mueller report and Durham report both  proved that the basis for the so-called Russian collusion investigation  was nonexistent.   The Representative from California misled the American people and  compromised the interests of the United States of America in service of  defeating, persecuting, attacking, and defaming President Donald Trump.   Mr. Speaker, he was hasty, prejudiced, and wrong. It is clear he was  concerned for no one but himself and the advancement of the Democratic  Party's political agenda. Now, $32 million later, the American people  are left with lies and the obligation to pick up the tab for this  boondoggle of a political witch hunt.   The Representative from California prioritized personal political  gain over the interests of our Nation, and he more than deserves to be  censured by the people's House.   The Democratic Party has allowed an invasion on our southern border  where every small town in America is now a border town. Every one of us  knows someone who has been poisoned or overdosed because of fentanyl.  Illegals are raping and killing people across our country. What do they  do? They claim to have a solution, and they have none.
