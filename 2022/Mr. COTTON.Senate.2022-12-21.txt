 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, every       American has heard about our drug death crisis. Many have, sadly,       experienced it first- or secondhand, seeing loved ones and friends       struggle with addiction.        And it is not just opioids. In the past year, more than 25,000 of our       fellow citizens died by cocaine. That is more than a 25-percent       increase since Joe Biden took office and more than double the overdoses       in 2016.        At the same time, murders and other violent crime rates are       skyrocketing, as we just heard earlier from the Senator from New       Jersey. The murder rate has hit levels not seen since the 1990s. Gangs       and cartels are emboldened in part because they know that many Soros       prosecutors across the country in the Garland Department of Justice       will treat them with kid gloves.        This so-called EQUAL Act is likewise going to go easier on crack       cocaine traffickers, including members of gangs and cartels. This would       only exacerbate our problems.        Why would we do that now, of all times, given these facts? Crack       cocaine and powder cocaine, while true that they are the same primary       chemicals, are different drugs. Their delivery is different. Crack       cocaine is more addictive. The typical methods of trafficking and sale       are more dangerous.        According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, crack cocaine       traffickers are more than twice as likely as powder cocaine traffickers       to involve weapons in their crimes, and crack cocaine traffickers are       the most likely of any type of drug trafficker to be rearrested. Nearly       60 percent of crack cocaine traffickers are rearrested, many for       violent offenses within just a few years of release.       Disproportionately, minorities and individuals in low-income areas bear       the brunt of the violence of this trafficking.        That is why I have to remind everyone that Congress passed laws with       enhanced penalties for crack cocaine trafficking in the first place,       and I have to remind everyone that those laws passed almost unanimously       decades ago, when the Senator from New Jersey and I were just kids, and       they were supported by, among other people, the Congressional Black       Caucus, Senator Durbin, Senator Leahy, Senator Schumer, and then-      Senator, now-President Joe Biden.        This was not an accident. This was a deliberate policy choice for the       reasons I have stated.        The EQUAL Act, though, would not just reduce sentences for those       dealing drugs now; it would also retroactively allow crack cocaine       traffickers in Federal prison to seek early release.        Nevertheless, I have heard, as we heard today, for years about this       so-called disparity, as if it were an accident, as if it were       unintentional--a loophole in the law--rather than people like Senator       Schumer and Senator Leahy and then-Senator Biden and the Congressional       Black Caucus seeking it as a deliberate policy choice.        Oftentimes, it is attributed to racism. Again, the disparity is in       the law because of the facts I have cited. However, I am willing to try       to meet the other side halfway. I have a different plan to eliminate       the disparity.        Rather than reducing sentences for crack cocaine traffickers, I       propose that we increase sentences for powder cocaine trafficking to       eliminate this disparity. Especially with cocaine overdoses on the rise       now, we should start enforcing the law even more rigorously so innocent       Americans don't die.        So, Mr. President, still reserving the right to object, I ask       unanimous consent that the Senator modify his request to include my       amendment, which is at the desk; that the amendment be considered and       agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time       and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and       laid upon the table.         Mr. President, reserving the right to object, just to be       clear, powder cocaine sentences are here, and crack cocaine sentences       are here. The bill in question would reduce these sentences to       eliminate the so-called disparity. My amendment would simply raise       sentences for powder cocaine dealing.        So I would suggest the issue here is not so much the disparity but       tough sentences for crimes whatsoever. So I object.         Madam President, I join one of law enforcement's finest       friends, Senator Boozman, in honoring and mourning Benton County       Detective Paul Newell, who passed away on Saturday after a lifetime of       service to his community, our State, and our country.        Detective Newell was also an Army veteran and a law enforcement       officer who had served with the Benton County Sheriff's Office for 24       years.        Detective Newell began his career in the office's detention division.       Thanks to his hard work, he rose through the ranks to be a patrol       deputy, a patrol sergeant, a training sergeant, a lieutenant, and,       finally, a detective in the criminal investigative division.        In short, Detective Newell was a patriot who served his community and       his country with great devotion, and, even in his final moments, that       is exactly what he was doing.        Last weekend, Detective Newell gave up his Saturday morning to escort       the Wreaths Across America procession through Bentonville. The       procession was delivering wreaths to our fallen veterans at       Fayetteville National Cemetery. Detective Newell was on a police       motorcycle. Tragically, Detective Newell's motorcycle struck a curb       during the procession. He crashed into a semitruck and was pronounced       dead at the scene.        Detective Newell's passing is a tragedy and a reminder that the men       and women of law enforcement risk their lives every day--and not just       in shoot-outs or foot chases but in so many other unsung acts of       service they perform day in and day out.        Detective Newell deserves our gratitude, as does every American who       puts on the uniform. I am proud to report that the community of       Northwest Arkansas came together to show their gratitude for Detective       Newell's service. The morning after that tragic crash, officers and       citizens alike came out to honor Detective Newell as law enforcement       transported his remains to the Arkansas State Crime Lab.        Detective Newell gave his life during a procession honoring our       fallen heroes. So it is only fitting that Detective Newell should have       received a procession honoring him in return.        Detective Newell's watch has ended, but his spirit and his memory       live on. May God comfort his wife Charlene, his daughters, and all       those who knew him in this life. May God bless and keep Paul Newell.                                  Remembering Police Sergeant Donald Scoby              Madam President, I also sadly join Senator Boozman today in mourning       the death of another patriot, veteran, and great Arkansan. Last week,       Stuttgart Police Sergeant Donald Scoby was shot and killed in the line       of duty while pursuing a dangerous criminal.        Officer Scoby lived a life of selfless service. He is described by       friends as ``the type of person who would give you the shirt off his       back.''        He joined the U.S. Army and was deployed to both Iraq and Bosnia,       where he fought to keep peace halfway around the world. He proudly and       honorably served in our Armed Forces, but he wasn't done there.              Back in Arkansas, he joined the Stuttgart Fire Department and then in       2018 joined the Stuttgart Police Department. In 2019, the department       named him ``Officer of the Year.''        After a life of running toward danger to protect others, Officer       Scoby was in hot pursuit of a violent and unstable criminal, a man       named Jacob Barnes, last week. Barnes then abandoned his car and fled       on foot. Officer Scoby pursued him. As Scoby chased down this menace to       our society, Barnes opened fire on the officers, shooting and killing       Officer Scoby.        Later that night, Barnes met an end that, it is fair to say, he       deserved. He was killed by Arkansas SWAT officers. But this justice is       insufficient to repair the far deeper injustice that he had inflicted       on our State and on Officer Scoby's comrades in arms, his family, and       his friends. Arkansas lost a hero last week.        Donald Scoby served in war zones, charged toward raging fires, and       fought criminals threatening our streets. He protected our country, our       State, and our neighborhoods. He lived a noble life and he died nobly,       serving the community he loved and swore to protect. He leaves a legacy       and an example from which all Arkansans can draw inspiration.        We grieve his death, but we are grateful for Sergeant Scoby's life of       sacrifice. Our prayers are with his wife Amanda and his four children--      Rebecca, Sarah, Dylan, and Haley--and all those who knew him and loved       him. May God bless and keep Donald Scoby and may God console his family       and friends in this time of grief.         Sadly, I join Senator Boozman again in mourning the death       of a public servant and a good and decent Arkansan. This July,       Jonesboro policeman Vincent Parks died of a heart attack after training       exercises at the Central Arkansas Law Enforcement Training Academy. He       was on the force for 32 days.        Parks was a native Arkansan and dedicated family man who is survived       by his loving wife Christina and his daughter Vivianna. He is       remembered as a kind and joyful man with an infectious smile and       positive attitude that could fill a room.        For 14 years, he had a good, stable job, but he felt a calling to do       more and to serve the community where he was born. So in June of this       year, he answered that call. At the age of 38, he joined the Jonesboro       Police Department.        Tragically, only a month into this noble new chapter of his life,       Officer Parks started showing signs of medical distress during       training. He suffered a severe heart attack on the way to the hospital       and was pronounced dead later that day.        All of Arkansas was saddened by the news of this good and dedicated       man who was taken from his family and community so young and too early,       but his memory, spirit, and example endure.        May God bless and keep Vinnie Parks, and may God bless and keep all       of our heroic fallen officers.        I yield the floor.
