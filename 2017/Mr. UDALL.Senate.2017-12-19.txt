 Mr. President, thank you for the recognition. I rise also  to talk about the tax issue and this horrible tax cut, but I can't help  but mention a little bit about what I went through the last hour or so  with some wonderful young people in my office.   First of all, there are 7,000 Dreamers in my home State of New  Mexico. Here is one of them, shown in this picture. This is Carlos.  Carlos was brought to New Mexico from Mexico when he was less than 1  year old, and New Mexico is the only place that Carlos has known as his  home. I had the opportunity to visit with a number of young people who  are very much like Carlos. They have gotten in a bus, they have come to  Washington, they call themselves the New Mexico dream team, and it is a  remarkable story. They told many stories to me about their situations  that sounded very much like Carlos's story. They urge us to protect  them. They are fearful, they are emotional, but they are also strong  and courageous. Let's remember these are some of our very best and  brightest young people. We cannot lose them. We must continue to fight  for a clean Dream Act--no doubt about it--and we need to remember the  11 million undocumented immigrants who are here in the United States  and strive and fight for true immigration reform.   Mr. President, working families in New Mexico want good jobs and good  wages. They want affordable healthcare and retirement security. They  want a job and educational opportunities for their children, but the  Republican's latest tax plan does nothing for regular families in New  Mexico or across the country. It will not create good-paying jobs, not  now nor for our children. It will kick 13 million people off healthcare  and raise insurance premiums. Their plan threatens Medicare, Medicaid,  and Social Security, and it does nothing to improve public education or  bring down the high cost of college.   The Republican tax plan overwhelmingly benefits the rich by giving  huge tax breaks to their campaign donors, to the superwealthy, big  corporations, multinational businesses, and hedge funds. One of the  biggest problems is, the Republican plan will drive up the debt by $1.5  trillion, and that means they will have to take a hatchet to programs  working families rely on. This is not a responsible or a fair tax plan.  It is a hocus-pocus tax sham, and I oppose it.   I have to reflect a little on this first year that we have seen under  President Trump and the Republican majority--what a year of lost  opportunities. If the Republicans had worked with us during this year,  we could have had at least two big bipartisan achievements. We could  have had a bipartisan improvement on healthcare, built on the successes  of the Affordable Care Act, and we could have had a fair tax bill for  all Americans. How sad partisanship and politics got the upper hand.   The Senate and the House majority are pushing this tax scam as fast  as they can to hide it from the American people. We have not had proper  hearings. We have not heard from expert witnesses or had adequate  independent analysis. Even the Republicans don't know what is in it. My  office has met with many New Mexicans raising red flags on the  unintended consequences of this bill. No Member of Congress--no  Democrats or Republicans--has had enough time to digest and understand  this plan.   When it comes to legislation this important, we must follow the  regular order. We must see a full analysis by the Congressional Budget  Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation. We must hear from the best  tax experts in the country. The American people must understand the  plan, and every Member of Congress must fully understand its impacts.  We are not there.   Republicans and the President are not being straight about what this  plan will mean for the average American. They aren't talking about how  it will affect the President's own personal taxes. He touts it as a tax  cut for the middle class and working Americans, but not one single  objective analysis says it is designated to help the middle class, and  his Treasury Department's one-page so-called analysis predicting a $300  billion surplus is built on unrealistic growth assumptions that no  serious economist accepts. Even Republicans have said the bill is about  helping their donors and cutting taxes for big corporations.    The American people are not blind. They aren't fooled by the  administration's fake numbers, and they oppose this plan. Recent  polling, as recent as December 13, shows that 55 percent of Americans  disapprove of the bill. Sixty-five percent say the wealthy benefit the  most, and almost all pollsters come out somewhere in that range.   Now, let's look at some of the hard, cold numbers. First, we know the  Republicans propose adding $1.5 trillion to the debt over the next 10  years. This chart shows the difference between the Federal deficit  under current law and the massive increase in the deficit under the  Senate Republicans' plan. Current law is in blue, as you can see here,  and the Republicans' plan is in red. It is pretty dramatic--pretty  dramatic. Republicans represent themselves as the party of fiscal  responsibility, but incurring this amount of debt to give big tax  breaks to the rich is patently irresponsible.   To pay for this debt, the government will have to borrow by selling  Treasury bills, notes, bonds, securities, and savings bonds. Based on  estimates from the JTC and the CBO, the government's cost to borrow to  pay for this debt will be over $40 billion over the next 10 years and  even more after that unless we pay off the debt. The American people  will be on the hook for $1.5 trillion. That is $12,742 for each and  every American household today. My colleagues have come to the floor  saying this tax bill will provide an average tax cut of around $2,000  for 1 year in 2019. What they aren't telling you is, they are also  opening a line of credit on you and your family of $12,000.   This is the new Federal debt that would be taken out in every  American's name every year by the GOP. So much additional borrowing by  the Federal Government can also drive up interest rates. Higher  interest rates mean higher costs for the government to borrow. The  Congressional Budget  [[Page S8111]]  Office estimates that if interest rates are 1 percent higher annually  than projected through 2027, the debt will be $1.5 trillion higher-- that is 6 percent of gross domestic product--and the amount each  American owes on their new forced Federal credit card would go up even  more.   Increased Federal interest rates have real consequences for the  average American. A rise in rates can price out a first-time home  buyer; it can determine whether a young person can afford to buy a car.  The average American consumer does not want to see interest rates go  up. Increased government borrowing and interest rates can take up the  economy's lending capacity and discourage the very private investment  Republicans say they want to encourage.   Giving massive tax cuts to the wealthy also will force massive cuts  in revenue coming into the Federal Government. When I first arrived in  the Senate, Senator Kent Conrad from North Dakota was chair of the  Budget Committee. He was a master on the Federal deficit and on the  Federal budget, and he understood the danger of racking up huge  deficits. In 2011, the Budget Committee was concerned that the debt  threatened the national security. The committee majority developed a  budget framework that Senator Conrad presented on the floor that July.  He showed us many charts that day. One showed that the government had a  budget surplus for only 5 of the last 50 years--that was in 1969, 1998,  1999, 2000, and 2001. In those years, revenues were close to 20 percent  of gross domestic product.   Around the same time, the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles budget commission  concluded that the Federal Government needed revenue equal to 21  percent, but the Republicans' current tax cut legislation would leave  the Federal Government with revenue of only 17 percent of GDP.   Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers sounded alarm bells in an op- ed in the Washington Post on December 10, and Larry Summers isn't  alone. Bruce Bartlett was an economic adviser to Presidents Reagan and  George W. Bush. In a September Washington Post op-ed, he freely  acknowledged that he ``had a hand in creating the Republican tax  myth.'' He is referring to the myth that tax cuts lead to robust  economic growth. Mr. Bartlett now says: ``Republican rhetoric around  tax cutting'' is ``wishful thinking. . . . In reality, there's no  evidence that a tax cut would spur growth.''   In other words, tax cuts will not spur economic growth. They will  create more debt, squeeze consumers, and mean steep cuts to vital  government programs. So why is the majority pushing so hard for them?  Why do they want this tax cut bill so badly?   There is really only one reason--for their donors. Representative  Chris Collins of New York was honest about why he has to deliver tax  cuts. He said, ``My donors''--and this is his quote, Congressman  Collins--``My donors are basically saying, `Get it done or don't ever  call me again.' ''   Making the superrich even richer doesn't justify burdening our kids  with huge government debt. It doesn't excuse threatening American  healthcare, retirement security, and other vital programs, but cutting  vital Federal programs is exactly the price the middle class and  working Americans will be expected to pay under the Republicans' tax  sham. Their plan calls for $500 billion worth of cuts, and Speaker Ryan  is already talking about where they will cut. He said:         We are going to have to get back next year at entitlement       reform, which is how you tackle the debt and the deficit.       Frankly, it's the healthcare entitlements that are the big       drivers of our debt, so we spend more time on healthcare       entitlements--because that is really where the problem lies,       fiscally speaking.    He wants to starve the Treasury to benefit the wealthy, and then he  wants to slash critical programs that create jobs, support innovation,  secure our Nation, and help people pay for housing, food, and medicine.   I want to support tax cuts for middle-class families. I want to help  make sure that working people can take home more of their pay. I also  want to make sure we can pay for roads, bridges, schools, scientific  research, and national defense. This bill doesn't do that; it does  exactly the opposite. It takes money from the middle-class families and  gives it to the ultrarich. Then it leaves us with little to support our  communities, little for infrastructure, little to make the United  States of America continue to lead the world in innovation, science,  and economic might, and little to ensure that we take care of those in  need.   This bill also fails Indian Country. While giving billions of dollars  of tax breaks to corporations, this bill does nothing to spur economic  growth or attract investments in our Native communities--not even  basic, low-cost provisions to ensure that Tribes receive the same tax  benefits as other governments, like State governments. Once again,  Tribes have been overlooked by the majority, despite early and vocal  Tribal input on tax parity in Indian Country.   I am prepared to roll up my sleeves and work with Republicans on tax  reform that is fair, simplifies the Tax Code, and keeps American  businesses competitive, but I cannot support tax cuts that lopsidedly  benefit the ultrarich, hurt working families, neglect Indian Country,  and balloon the Federal deficit.   I yield the floor.
