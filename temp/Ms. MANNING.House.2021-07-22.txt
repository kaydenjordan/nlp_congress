 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, ahead of the 2021 Tokyo  Olympics, to recognize the Olympians from North Carolina Agricultural  and Technical State University, the largest HBCU in the Nation, located  in my district in Greensboro, North Carolina.   It gives me great pride to recognize Trevor Stewart and Randolph  Ross, Jr., who will represent the United States on the track and field  team.   Randolph Ross, Jr., a sophomore, is competing in the men's 400-meter  and the 4x400-meter relay, and Trevor Stewart, a senior, will compete  in the men's 4x400-meter relay.   Two other Aggie runners will compete in the Olympic track and field  events. Akeem Sirleaf will compete for Liberia, and Daniel Stokes will  compete for Mexico.   With all four of these young men qualifying, the entire Aggie 4x400- meter relay team will run in the Olympics.   I also recognize NC A&T director of track and field programs, Duane  Ross. Coach Ross' leadership has propelled his team forward to success.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the athletes and coach on this tremendous  achievement. On behalf of North Carolina's Sixth District, I am sending  them the best of luck in Tokyo. Go, Aggies.                            ____________________
