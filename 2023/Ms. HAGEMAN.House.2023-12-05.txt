 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  legacy  [[Page H6120]]  of Alfred Hill, Jr., a Wyomingite who courageously defended our country  and whose life was marked by a track record of accomplishments and  deeply rooted compassion for others.   Born and raised in San Antonio, Texas, Alfred made the selfless  decision to serve his country as a member of the U.S. Sixth Army from  1963-1966, completing a tour of duty in Korea and earning a promotion  to the rank of specialist.   Following his time in the Army, he earned a degree in business  administration and accounting from the Universities of Texas and  Montana.   Alfred and his wife, Barbara, moved to Sheridan, Wyoming, in 2010  where he dedicated his time to supporting others and bettering the  community.   Alfred was an active member of the Rotary Club, served as a  Scoutmaster, volunteered to deliver Meals on Wheels, and arranged  hunting trips for disabled veterans through the Hunting with Heroes  Program.   Alfred valued his Christian faith and family above all else and  cherished every minute he could spend with his grandchildren and great- grandchildren.   Alfred passed away peacefully on the morning of October 20, leaving  behind a legacy of selfless service in his community that will be  forever cherished by his friends and family.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in remembering the life of Alfred  Hill, Jr.                            ____________________
