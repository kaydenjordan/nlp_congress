 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, nearly ten years  ago Senator  [[Page H3048]]  Ted Kennedy and I introduced a bill called the Working Families  Flexibility Act.   The bill before us today has the same name and its supporters may try  to claim it fixes the same problems we were trying to fix, but, Mr.  Speaker this is not Senator Kennedy's bill and in fact it bears little  resemblance to the bill he and I worked on and that Sen. Bob Casey and  I have reintroduced this week.   Let me be clear, the bill before us today creates zero new rights for  workers. Zero.   In fact, under this bill working families would have even less  flexibility than they do now to care for a child or sick family member.   This GOP bill allows employers to withhold desperately needed  overtime pay for months at a time.   It lets bosses hold back overtime earnings, and only pay them out  when employees request the money they have earned.   And even if employees do ask, which is ridiculous since it is money  that they earned and should not have to ask their bosses if they can  get paid for work they already did--bosses are given a month to write  that overtime check.   And if it wasn't clear enough that this bill is not about helping  working families, this bill puts all decisions about when employees can  use flex time in the hands of their bosses.   Want to take an extra week off in the summer when kids are out of  school? Too bad, that doesn't fit with your boss' plans.   Even if you work hard for six months to build up that extra comp  time, your employer can still deny that request.   We should be ashamed that the U.S. stands out in the world as a  country that requires the least family-friendly benefits for workers.  How can we call ourselves a country dedicated to family values when we  don't support working families?   The real value of the minimum wage has severely eroded, and the new  administration has blocked a badly needed update to our overtime  protections.   We have no mandated paid parental leave. No paid sick days. No fair,  predictable scheduling. No flexible work arrangements.   And American families are paying dearly for our inaction.   So let's not call this bill the Working Families Flexibility Act.   That's an insult to millions of working families across the country  and it's an insult to the late-Senator Ted Kennedy who did so much for  the working families of this Nation.   I urge my colleagues to oppose.    MALONEY of New York changed her vote from ``aye'' to  ``no.''   Mr. TURNER changed his vote from ``no'' to ``aye.''   So the bill was passed.   The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York (for herself,               Mr. Bilirakis, and Mr. Payne):        H. Con.
