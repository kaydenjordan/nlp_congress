 Madam President, today I have the distinct honor of  recognizing Jane Lee Hamman of Jefferson County as Montanan of the  Month, for her patriotism, her dedication to serving her community, our  great State, and our great Nation.   Jane's selfless contributions began at a young age when she started  volunteering for Meals on Wheels with her parents. Jane also joined her  parents in supporting Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the civil  rights movement as well, believing in equal opportunity and advancement  for all people based on their character, not the color of their skin.  In fact, her life mantra is ``Living to advance freedom, knowledge, and  justice for all.'' I think I can speak for all who know her when I say  that she truly embraces these ideals.   Jane's love for her country is on full display in the monthly column  she writes for the Boulder Monitor newspaper. The goal of Jane's column  is to preserve liberty, to educate readers about America's vision of  the Declaration of Independence, and to celebrate our Constitution.   She also shares her values of patriotism and volunteerism with others  while serving as the lay leader of the Clancy United Methodist Church  and as the Oro Fino Chapter Registrar of the Daughters of the American  Revolution.   Additionally, Jane has been appointed by Gov. Greg Gianforte to the  Montana State Board of Education and is the chair for the North  Jefferson County Public Library District Board of Trustees.   I have no doubt that her love for the great State of Montana and the  United States of America influences every person she meets.   It is truly my honor to recognize Jane for her commitment to serving  her community, her State, and her country while spreading Montana's  values of service and patriotism.   Jane, keep up the great work.   I yield the floor.
