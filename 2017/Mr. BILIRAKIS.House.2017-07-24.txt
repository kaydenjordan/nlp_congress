 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman. I think he outdid  himself on this one. This is outstanding stuff. There is no other word.  It is huge. It really is. He is helping our true American heroes with  this, and I am so proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation.   The challenges our Nation's heroes face do not end on the  battlefield. Education and career training programs offer veterans the  opportunity to enter a new chapter of their lives when they return home  from their service.   I recently visited AmSkills, a manufacturing apprenticeship center in  New Port Richey, Florida, to learn more about the good work they are  doing locally to help veterans transition to civilian careers.   The Forever GI Bill helps ensure that veterans nationwide have the  resources to access career education programs such as AmSkills, of  course, going to a university maybe, a community college, vocational  training, whatever they want to do.   Importantly, this bill allows future eligible GI Bill recipients to  use their benefits at any point in their lives. That is incredible. It  is long overdue, as opposed to the current 15-year time limit, which is  so unfair.   It also includes my provision, the VETERAN Act, which authorizes $30  million to help the VA invest in modernizing their information  technology systems for claims processing.    Congress and the House Veterans' Affairs Committee would have  oversight of the VA's proposed changes and monitor its progress. The  provision would be a major step in helping veterans receive their  benefits in a more timely and efficient manner.   Overall, the legislation before us today will improve, expand, and  modernize the GI Bill program for veterans and their surviving spouses  and dependents. That is so very important.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of this great bill.
