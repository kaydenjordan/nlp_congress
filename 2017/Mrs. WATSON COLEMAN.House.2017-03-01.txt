 Mr. Speaker, today begins Women's History Month,  and I am proud to use this occasion to lift up our achievements, our  perseverance and dedication to a more equal and balanced world. That is  why it is so unfortunate that my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle and President Trump's White House insist on harming women through  their stubborn adherence to antiwomen policies.   One prime example is their assault on the Affordable Care Act. The  facts are clear: ACA prohibits charging women more than men for  insurance; ACA establishes preventive services to be provided at no  extra cost to women, including annual well-women exams, breastfeeding  support, supplies for new moms, birth control, and screening and  counseling for domestic and intimate partner violence; 9.5 million  previously uninsured women now have coverage through ACA; 55 million  now have access to vital preventive care at no cost.   These are not alternative facts or fake news. If this is the Trump  Republicans' gift to us in celebration of Women's History Month, I hope  they keep the receipt.                            ____________________
