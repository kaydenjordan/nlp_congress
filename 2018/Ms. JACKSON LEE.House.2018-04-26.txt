 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Houston for  yielding, and I would like to address all of us on the floor tonight as  my fellow Texans. That was a favorite of George W. Bush, the son of  Barbara Bush, when he would greet us during his Presidency, which I had  the privilege of being here in the United States Congress, and he would  always greet me as his fellow Texan, and how proud we are to be able to  call President George H.W. Bush and the extended family, and his  wonderful First Lady, the matriarch, the first girlfriend, if you will,  and as has been told over and over during the time of her memorial, the  first man that she kissed. How proud we are to call both of them our  fellow Texans.   Now we are standing here today to mourn Barbara Pierce Bush. And as I  do that, let me, first of all, acknowledge President George H.W. Bush,  and wish him a speedy recovery for him to regain his strength; for all  of us watched as he sat in the viewing of her repose on that Friday, as  he came and sat and remained for a period of time to greet the many  people that came to honor her during that viewing. I was one of those  who had the privilege to go and to pay my respects on that day.   But again, they are one of America's greatest families, although  Barbara Pierce Bush would never acknowledge that by her attitude or the  way she addressed people. She was just Mrs. Barbara Bush, a very humble  but strong and firm and straightforward First Lady.   Barbara Bush was a descendant of the 14th President of the United  States, Franklin Pierce; the wife of the 41st, George Herbert Walker  Bush; and the mother of the 43rd, George W. Bush.   Of course, she finds her place in history for many, many reasons;  but, of course, we take note of the fact there was only one other woman  who was both the wife and the mother of a President of the United  States, Abigail Adams. So that is a very high-ranking and honorable  place to be.   Barbara Bush, the widely admired and fiercely loyal wife, mother, and  grandmother, was born in Rye, New York, but she got to Texas as soon as  she could. She met a dashing young George Herbert Walker Bush in  Greenwich, Connecticut, at a school dance when she was 16 and he was a  year older. What an amazing story. In fact, what an amazing love story.   Three years later, Barbara Bush married her sweetheart, and their  love lasted for 73 years. I remember, as we mourned her last weekend,  over and over again, the commentators would say, 73 years of marriage.  That, alone, is a historic tribute to integrity and the beauty and the  love of both of them. And, of course, they were married until she  departed in death.   George and Barbara raised their family from west Texas to Houston. Of  course, we know that he was a war hero and a remarkable set of action  that he saw in World War II, and a miraculous recovery from when his  plane fell, and, as well, miraculous in the fact that he survived; but,  more importantly, the actions that took place as he pursued the enemy.  He truly was a hero as well.                                time  1930    Barbara Bush was plainspoken, but she had that wonderful white hair,  pearl necklace and earrings. And so many in Houston, on the day of both  her funeral and as well the day that we viewed her remains at St.  Martin's Episcopal, as she lied in repose, she was there, and we were  wearing pearl necklaces and earrings, just to be able to say she is  someone that we admired, not for those external things, but for the  goodness of her heart.   She was an early supporter of the civil rights movement, the equal  rights movement, and we repeated over and over again that very famous  story of her going to an AIDS clinic and picking up a baby and hugging  and touching those individuals who were HIV infected, to let the world  know that they needed love and comfort, and that we needed to fight for  the cure and to recognize the humanity of those who are suffering from  HIV/AIDS.   Certainly she loved literacy, and that became one of her major  efforts, and that is where, during her time in Houston, I would see  her--often with her son Neil Bush--efforts dealing with literacy.   Her work and dollars came to places way beyond where she might expect  them. Certainly a lot of work on literacy was done in my congressional  district.   Barbara Bush raised more than $1 billion for literacy and cancer  charities. And as my colleague has indicated, it was both in tribute  and in recognition of the devastation of childhood cancer, leukemia,  which she lost her firstborn to.   Barbara Bush recognized that education was the key that unlocked the  door of human potential, and so her foundation, again, as I indicated,  focused on family literacy.   I have met people who, through her literacy program, were able to  restore their lives and to secure employment because they were then  able to move forward because they learned to read. And, unfortunately,  they learned to read after they finished all of their education. She  understood the value of that.   As they came back to Houston, we were delighted to call them  Houstonians, and as well we recognize what a valuable couple they were  to us. And anything you asked them to do, from being with the Texans  and supporting them and rooting them on and being with the Astros or  the Rockets or any of our teams or any of our universities or anything  that was needed, they were there.   So I am always amazed at the breadth and depth of Barbara Bush; how  many people she touched, how many people loved her, how many people  stood in line just to pay their respects.   We know her book with her dog, Millie, and her puppies, written  during her White House years, was a best seller, as were her other  books. And all of it was donated to charity.   We also realize that as she and her husband ended their service--and,  by the way, she was by his side for being the representative in China,  for being the CIA director, for being the Congressperson that  previously overlapped the 18th Congressional District. Many of my  constituents were his constituents, and so we have had a full circle of  their wonderful service to this Nation.   On a personal note, I want to offer my tribute from my husband, Dr.  [[Page H3700]]  Elwyn C. Lee, because as a young man growing up, it was the Bush family  who helped him go to Andover and opened his eyes to go to the same  school that Mr. Bush, H.W. Bush, went to, and his years of finishing  high school.   We know that when we got married, we received a gift from the Bushes.  We just couldn't even imagine it, that they would even remember us. We  sent them an invitation, they remembered, and they provided us with a  very special gift.   They are very, very special people, and I speak in present tense  because her spirit continues to thrive, and we are reminded of the  charity, the love, and the standard bearer that she was for what is  great about America.   We know that she is survived by her husband, their children--George,  Jeb, Neil, Marvin, and Dorothy--and that, as has always been said, she  will join her firstborn Robin at her final resting place.   It is important to pay tribute to such a wonderful American, such a  wonderful woman, and to be able to thank her for teaching us and to  remind us what is important in life, and it is family, friends, and  faith.   Thank you, Mrs. Barbara Pierce Bush. May you rest in peace, but let  it be known that we will never forget your spirit, your strength, and  what you did for America, and you gave it to us straight: Family,  friends, and faith.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in remembrance of Barbara Pierce Bush, the  matriarch of one of America's great families, and former First Lady of  the United States.   Barbara Bush was a descendant of the 14th President of the United  States, Franklin Pierce; the wife of the 41st, George Herbert Walker  Bush; and the mother of the 43rd, George W. Bush.   Barbara Bush, the widely admired and fiercely loyal wife, mother, and  grandmother, was born June 8, 1925 in Rye, New York.   Barbara Pierce met the dashing young George Herbert Walker Bush in  Greenwich, Connecticut at a school dance when she was 16 and he was a  year older.   Three years late Barbara Pierce married her sweetheart and their love  lasted for 73 years, until she was departed from her beloved by death.   George and Barbara raised their family mainly in West Texas, where  they settled after the end of World War II and where the future  President went into the oil business.   Barbara Bush was a plainspoken woman who was instantly recognizable  with her signature white hair, pearl necklaces, and earrings.   Mrs. Bush was an early supporter of the Civil Rights Movement,  Planned Parenthood, the Equal Rights Amendment, and was a tireless  champion of many charitable causes, especially literacy.   Barbara Bush raised more than $1 billion for literacy and cancer  charities.   Barbara Bush recognized that education was the key that unlocked the  door of human potential.   Literacy was Barbara Bush's special cause, which led her to establish  the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy.   Shortly after the end of her husband's presidential administration,  the Bush Family returned to Texas, and all Houstonians were lucky to  call her and her husband, George H. W. Bush, the 41st president, our  neighbors and dear friends.   Barbara Bush's books include an autobiography and one about post- White House life.   Her children's book about their dog, Millie, and her puppies written  during her White House years was a best seller, as were her other  books.   In 2001, when George W. Bush took office, Barbara Bush became the  only woman in American history to live to see her husband and son  elected president.   Barbara Bush lived a full life and will be remembered in American  history, alongside only Abigail Adams, for the impact her life had on  this country.   Barbara Bush is survived by her husband and their children George,  Jeb, Neil, Marvin, and Dorothy. She will join her first born, Robin at  her final resting place.   I ask the House to observe a moment of silence in memory of Barbara  Pierce Bush, the Former First Lady of the United States.
