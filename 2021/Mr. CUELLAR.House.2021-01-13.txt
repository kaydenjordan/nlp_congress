 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the impeachment.   It is very simple. What we saw on January 6 was a person, the  President of the United States, incite a crowd to come and attack the  Capitol. We have to make sure that we stand up for democracy.   If we don't do this, then what are we going to stand for?   We stand for democracy. We stand for American values. And I stand for  the impeachment of Donald Trump.
