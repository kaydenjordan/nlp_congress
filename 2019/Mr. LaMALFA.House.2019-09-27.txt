 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Meadows, for the  opportunity here today.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, my Democratic colleagues passed a  measure that would install an ombudsman within DHS to monitor the  practices of our Border Patrol and detainment officers. Thankfully, the  Senate immediately tossed that idea aside.   I have some good news for my colleagues across the aisle, however,  because I can tell you that any inspection of our border facilities  would find an agency, though underfunded, standing strong, despite a  record-setting deluge of people coming at our southern border.                                time  0930    Looks like today is Groundhog Day because we are voting on yet  another resolution to stop being able to legally call what is happening  on our southern border an emergency.   My colleagues justify this by calling the President's actions  unprecedented. Unprecedented is what you call it when our immigration  system is on pace to be overwhelmed by a million immigrants pleading  asylum. Maybe Democrats call this policy.   Unprecedented is what you call it when Congress refuses to fund our  national security agencies and starts threatening to abolish an agency  and fire our enforcement officers for doing their job.   The situation is unprecedented, but it is not because the President's  actions are unprecedented. It is the actions from my Democrat  colleagues.   Rather than further consider this resolution, I hope the majority  leader and Speaker immediately allow us to recognize the crisis--as  some Democrats have, inadvertently--that we are facing on the border.   Let's address the root causes of the emergency. Fund the Border  Patrol's $3 billion backlog, and install physical barriers and security  measures necessary to ensure the whole length of our southern border is  secure.
