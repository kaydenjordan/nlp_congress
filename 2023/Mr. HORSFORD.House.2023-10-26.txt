 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with great pride to  congratulate our own Las Vegas Aces on their remarkable achievement of  back-to-back WNBA Championship wins.   This team has done it again. Their hard work, talent, and teamwork  have demonstrated what a never-give-up attitude can achieve, battling  past setbacks from injuries, including star and last year's Finals MVP  Chelsea Gray.   I recognize this year's Finals MVP, A'ja Wilson, and the Aces' coach,  Becky Hammon.   Mr. Speaker, it is not every day that a city gets to celebrate three  championships in just over a year, two from the Las Vegas Aces. That is  why I was proud to join Vice President Kamala Harris in recognizing the  team at the White House in August.   Las Vegas is a city of champions. For the second straight year, the  team finished with the best regular season record.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate everyone on this achievement, especially  the players and coaching staff.    Southern Nevada is excited to see more of what this team has, and we  look forward to many more successes.                            ____________________
