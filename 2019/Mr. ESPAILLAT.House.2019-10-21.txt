 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Velazquez and also  Ranking Member Chabot for their leadership. I would also like to thank  my colleague, Congressman Balderson, for working with me on this  bipartisan legislation.   One of the most widely successful tools the Small Business  Administration utilizes to grow and support small businesses is the  Growth Accelerator Fund Competition. Since this program began in 2014,  the Growth Accelerator Fund Competition has small businesses and  entrepreneurs in almost 40 States.   This competitive program provides some of the most innovative and  promising small businesses in high-growth sectors with early-stage  education, financing, mentorship, cohort-based training, and technical  assistance. Importantly, these entrepreneurial development models  create a pipeline of talented entrepreneurs--especially women and  minorities--to grow and succeed.   According to the Small Business Administration, since this Growth  Accelerator Fund Competition began in 2014, the first 50 awardees have  led directly to almost 1,500 companies across the country.   Codifying this program and authorizing $2 million for 4 additional  years is a commitment to American innovation. The legislation reflects  our bipartisan support and priority investment in the growth,  development, and expansion of small businesses.    I am proud to support this program, and I am glad to work with  colleagues on both sides of the aisle on this meaningful and important  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
