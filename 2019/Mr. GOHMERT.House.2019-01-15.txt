 Madam Speaker, we hear that walls don't work, yet this  is a picture of the Democratic National Convention in 2016. They put up  a barrier. They put up a fence because they wanted to protect  themselves like people in America want to protect themselves.   And there is a lovely gate, wall. They have them everywhere there is  something that needs to be secured. Every single Democrat who is  standing against securing our border has an outer wall to their home.   If walls don't work, they can eliminate that. People can come and go  as they please. But they know deep down in their hearts, they secure  their dead bolts. They secure their home. They may even have a wall  around their outer wall because walls work.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for yielding to  me.
