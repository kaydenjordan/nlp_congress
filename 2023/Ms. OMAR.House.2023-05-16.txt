 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of small businesses  and to celebrate my friend Abdirahman Kahin, the owner of Afro Deli in  my district who was named Small Business Person of the Year by the  Biden administration.   My district was also chosen as one of the stops for SBA's national  tour in honor of Small Business Week.   It was great to welcome Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff and Small  Business Administrator Isabel Guzman to discuss economic development  for new Americans and underserved communities at Adama Restaurant and  Awash Bakery in my district.   We also discussed the critical role community development financial  institutions play in helping small businesses. Also in that week we  were able to host BIPOC women small business owners at a roundtable at  Wildflyer Coffee in Minneapolis.   The Fifth District is full of thriving small businesses, many owned  by immigrants and people of color, and we will continue to support them  to make sure they have the resources they need to thrive in the future.                            ____________________
