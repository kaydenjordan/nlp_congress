 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Dr. Califf, and I  have spoken before on this. I just want to say this for a minute or two  here.   I respect everyone's position on this and their decision, but I have  never had anything that has affected my State and constituents in my  State and our country more than the opioid addiction.   This opioid addiction started because of the FDA's decision to bring  a product to market in 1995 that has destroyed many families, many  communities, many businesses, people's lives forever. In story after  story--there is not a Senator in this body who doesn't have someone in  their family, immediate family or extended family, or a constituent who  hasn't been affected.   With that, you need to change the dynamics of the leadership over  there. Dr. Califf was there 5 years ago. He is coming back. Nothing has  changed. Four hundred thousand people have died since he was there, and  we are going down the same path.   Unless we change that dynamic, that leadership position on trying to  protect the people of America without putting more and more horrible  drugs on the market--there was one drug back in, I think it was 2014,  2013 or 2014, called Zohydro, and the advisory committee recommended 11  to 2: Do not bring this drug to market. They did it anyway. It was 11  to 2, don't do it. These are experts. They said two pills can kill a  human being. They brought it continuously. They continue to bring more  opiates to the market.    We don't need this product on the market to kill more Americans. This  Administration, under Robert Califf, will take the same old, same old  as they did before. Nothing will change.   I urge all of my colleagues, please consider what you are doing.  Consider your family and your constituents and please vote against  Robert Califf.
