 Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1423, the  FAIR Act.   Forced arbitration clauses were originally intended to mediate  business disputes among businesses, not between businesses and  individuals, but now they are found in every aspect of  [[Page H7847]]  our lives. From employment contracts to student loans, to cellphone  plans, to credit cards and numerous other goods and services, every  American has agreed to forced arbitration, whether they want to or not.   This bill ensures that individuals have the right to choose how they  seek justice: the choice to go to court, the choice to join a class  action lawsuit, and, yes, even the choice to go to arbitration.   But these choices should not be made for them by somebody else.  Passage of the FAIR Act will restore that choice, and I urge all of my  colleagues to support this important legislation.
