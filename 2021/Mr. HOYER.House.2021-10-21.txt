 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Rules Committee  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, this resolution ought to be supported, and the  underlying action that the rule provides for ought to be supported by  every Member of this House who believes that this House has a  constitutional responsibility of oversight, of protecting the  Constitution and the democracy in which we all are privileged to live,  and the integrity of this House.   Oversight is not possible for this House if, in fact, it cannot  request and, indeed, demand the testimony of those who have information  which this House, the people's House and the protector of our democracy  and our Constitution, needs to protect our democracy. This rule and the  underlying action for which it provides is essential.   Mr. Speaker, if I were trying a case, I would offer as Exhibit A a  statement by the man who would be dictator, Donald Trump, who absurdly  and, of course, incorrectly says the insurrection took place on  November 3, election day. January 6 was the protest.   My view is that man, Donald J. Trump, protests too much, because I  believe that he recruited, incited, and deployed an insurrectionist mob  to threaten this institution, its Members, its constitutional  responsibility in the electoral process of the Presidency of the United  States, and democracy itself.   Mr. Speaker, the events of January 6 exposed threats to our democracy  that must be fully understood and addressed. It is a weighty  responsibility that falls to the House Select Committee to Investigate  the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, a bipartisan  committee.   I want to thank Chairman Thompson, Vice Chair Cheney, and all of  those serving on this committee for their commitment to seeking the  truth, defending our democracy, and to giving sufficient information to  our public and our constituents, our people, that they know this to be  a stark and dangerous lie.   The committee is doing a diligent job at finding the truth. This task  should not have fallen to the members of a select committee, this  subpoena for contempt. We should have been able to come together,  Democrats and Republicans, to create a bipartisan commission in the  style of the 9/11 Commission, recognizing that such consequential and  transformative attacks require us to come together as one nation  indivisible to seek answers and identify solutions to make our country  safer.    Sadly, however, we have come to a place where one party is so focused  on defending the indefensible that this institution cannot act as  Americans but, rather, are relegated to acting simply as partisans.   Nevertheless, Mr. Speaker, I am heartened to see Democrats and some  courageous Republicans working together to uncover the truth of what  happened that day. These Republican Members are exhibiting what  President Kennedy would call profiles in courage.   In order for this committee to perform its work in full--indeed any  committee of the Congress to perform its work in full--ultimately it  has to be able to get the information that it needs from those who know  the information it needs. It must hear testimony from all those who may  have information regarding the events of January 6 in this particular  case. That is why we provided the committee with subpoena authority.   Steve Bannon's refusal to appear, even when subpoenaed is, A, a  demonstration of his contempt, not only for Congress but his contempt  of the Constitution and his contempt for the law. It is unacceptable  and obstructive to this process of uncovering the full story of that  day's attack on the Capitol. He must be found in contempt, not as a  Democrat and not as a Republican, but on behalf of this institution and  the people whom we represent.   Withholding information on the events of that day from the committee  is no less than an act of betrayal of the American people and of our  constitutional democracy.   The American people need to understand what led to the violent  insurrection that sought to overturn our election and led to the deaths  of multiple police officers and others; although, as I said, Exhibit A,  the former President's comments, should be the proof in and of itself  the American people need to understand what led to the deaths of those  police officers and the placing at risk the democratic process of  electing a President of the United States.   We need to understand, Mr. Speaker, how this could have happened, why  it happened, and what ought to be done to hold the perpetrators  accountable and prevent the events of the day from being repeated.   That appears to be the fear on the floor of this House today:  accountability, responsibility, and consequences.   In refusing to appear before the commission, Mr. Bannon has made it  clear where his loyalties lie. He has chosen Trump first and America  last, not America first. Trump first, America last. Trump first, our  Constitution last. Trump first, our democracy last. Trump first, the  House of the people, this House of Representatives last. And he will  have to answer for that to us.   This is a moment of reckoning for our country, reckoning with hard  truths and painful memories, a reckoning that, above all, requires  truth and understanding.   Can't we, Mr. Speaker, in a bipartisan way summon the courage to look  the truth in the eye and vote the truth?   We cannot allow anyone to shirk their responsibility to share that  truth and help the American people understand.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to vote ``yes'' on this  resolution and to vote ``yes'' on the citation for contempt so that  Chairman Thompson, Vice Chairwoman Cheney, and the members of the  select committee can make it clear to Mr. Bannon and to all others  summoned to testify they will seek the truth, the whole truth, and  nothing but the truth as they determine what we must do to protect our  beloved country, our beloved Constitution, and our beloved democracy.                                time  1315
