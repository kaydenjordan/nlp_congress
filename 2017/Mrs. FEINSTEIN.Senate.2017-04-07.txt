 Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues  Senators Leahy, Brown, Cardin, Durbin, Franken, Klobuchar, Murphy,  Murray, Markey, Merkley, Sanders, Udall, and Whitehouse to introduce  the Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act of 2017.   First and foremost, the legislation would limit the use of cluster  munitions by the U.S. Armed Forces. In June 2008, then-Secretary of  Defense Robert Gates signed a memo stating that after 2018 the United  States will not use cluster munitions with a greater than 1 percent  unexploded ordnance rate. The Cluster Munitions Civilian Protection Act  would codify the Gates policy by immediately prohibiting the use of  cluster munitions with a greater than 1 percent failure rate.   Second, this bill would make it clear that the export of U.S.-made  cluster munitions must be contingent upon the receiving country not  using these weapons inappropriately. Since 2008, the Congress has  required that U.S.-made cluster munitions can only be used by the  recipient country against clearly defined military targets and will not  be used where civilians are known to be present or in areas normally  inhabited by civilians.   During the 114th Congress, the Defense Department discovered that  several export agreements for U.S. cluster munitions--known as letters  of offer and acceptance--failed to mirror congressional restrictions on  their use. Specifically, the Pentagon found that letters of offer and  acceptance with South Korea and Saudi Arabia were either incomplete or  missing. While the Pentagon is attempting to amend the mistake, it is  imperative that the Congress make clear that U.S.-made cluster  munitions must not be used where civilians are known to be present or  in areas normally inhabited by civilians. As a result, the legislation  requires export policies and licenses to restrict cluster munition use  against clearly defined military targets and not in civilian areas.   Today 119 countries have signed or acceded to the Convention on  Cluster Munitions. In fact, four of our closest allies--Canada, Great  Britain, Germany, and France--are states parties, legally bound by all  of the convention's provisions.   The convention prohibits the use, production, transfer, and  stockpiling of cluster munitions. The convention also requires the  destruction of stockpiled cluster munitions within eight years,  clearance of cluster munition remnants within 10 years, and assistance  to victims, including those injured by submunitions.   I am disappointed that the United States has not signed the  convention but believe we can move toward doing so. This legislation  states that it is the sense of Congress that No. 1, the U.S. Government  should phase out the use of all cluster munitions as soon as possible;  No. 2, any alternatives that the United States develops to replace  cluster munitions should be compliant with the Convention on Cluster  Munitions; and No. 3, the United States should accede to the convention  as soon as possible.   The United States has not widely used cluster munitions since the  first weeks of the 2003 Iraq war. Unfortunately, cluster munitions have  been used by others around the world with devastating effect on  civilians in the past year.   According to the Cluster Munition Monitor, since 2012, Syrian  government forces have used at least 13 different types of cluster  munitions in 360 recorded attacks. Additionally, the United States and  the United Kingdom have publicly accused Russia of using these weapons  in Syria, including against the moderate opposition.   In Yemen, the Saudi-backed coalition has employed cluster munitions  against the Houthis. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have  documented at least 19 instances of cluster munitions use in Yemen,  including with U.S.-made weapons. The U.S. Defense Department has  acknowledged that U.S.-made weapons were employed in Yemen, though the  Pentagon has said their use didn't violate export restrictions.   Finally, there is evidence that cluster munitions were also used in  the Nagorno-Karabakh region and by Kenya in Somalia.   According to the Cluster Munitions Monitor, over the past 50 years,  there have been 20,300 documented cluster munitions deaths in 33  nations. The estimated number of total cluster munitions casualties,  however, is an astonishing 55,000 people.   While cluster munitions are intended for military targets, in  actuality civilians accounted for 97 percent of cluster munition  casualties in 2015.   Worldwide casualties caused by cluster munitions demonstrate that  they are indiscriminate weapons. While U.S.-made cluster munitions  reduce the likelihood of civilian casualties when they are used  correctly, U.S. ratification of the Convention on Cluster Munitions  would help move the world toward a global ban.   This legislation moves the United States toward accession by  codifying the Gates policy and encouraging the Pentagon to develop  alternatives to cluster munitions that are compliant with the  convention.   Mr. President, the Congress cannot compel the administration to sign  the Convention on Cluster Munitions. But, we can surely take steps to  abide by its spirit. Passing the ``Cluster Munitions Civilian  Protection Act'' would do exactly that.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
