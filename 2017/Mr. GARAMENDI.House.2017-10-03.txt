 Mr. Speaker, there are so many things on the minds of  Americans: three hurricanes in a month, disasters in Houston, Florida,  Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands. We just heard our colleague from the  Virgin Islands speak of the problems that that island has. Millions of  Americans harmed in so many ways, lives lost, just yesterday, the  tragedy in Las Vegas.   It is hard not to focus only on those issues, but in many, many ways,  Las  [[Page H7732]]  Vegas aside, the issue of the hurricanes and what we will do as  Americans going forward is on my mind and, I suspect, on the minds of  many.   As we review and as we figure out how to deal with those disasters  and how we rebuild, I would like us all to keep in mind that our goal,  in addition to bringing these economies back together again, putting  people back in their homes, their businesses, and the infrastructure,  that we keep in mind that we ought to be looking for better jobs and  better wages for all Americans--and certainly for those in the low- and  middle-income brackets--and a better future.   We think about Puerto Rico and their future. How do we make it a  better future? Well, we certainly know that there is a problem in much  of America, stagnation of wages, so higher pay becomes critically  important.   We need to deal with the cost issues that go into this, and we need  to make sure that all Americans, wherever they may be, in Puerto Rico,  the Virgin Islands, or Washington, Virginia, wherever, that they have  the tools to compete.   So today we are going to take 1 hour, and we are going to talk about  ideas that need to be discussed here in the House of Representatives:  legislation, existing programs such as the Jones Act, shipbuilding, and  the like.                                time  1830    I would like to ask my colleague, Brendan Boyle, to begin the  discussion with a bill that he and his colleagues, or our colleagues,  are introducing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan  F. Boyle).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle) for his thoughts. I started off with a better  deal, better wages, better jobs, or jobs at all. The Make It In America  agenda, which we have been talking about here for 5 or 6 years, long  before President Trump came along, involves tax policy. I am bringing  to our attention tonight a tax issue that will create jobs in America  and, frankly, no longer promote the offshoring of jobs.   Another piece of our puzzle on making it in America, and better  wages, better jobs, and better future, is something that has been much  discussed in recent days, particularly with regard to the Puerto Rican  situation, and that is the Jones Act.   Joining me tonight to discuss the Jones Act, why it is important to  America, why it is a major job opportunity and continuation for  American mariners, American shipowners, as well as America's shipyards,  is Ms. Jayapal.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the State of  Washington for very clearly laying out why the Jones Act is good for  all of us.   We held a hearing today, an extensive hearing on the maritime  industry and on the Jones Act in the Transportation and Infrastructure  Committee, the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee,  and it was laid out with facts and figures, many of those behind you on  the chart. There has been a lot of talk about the Jones Act somehow  harming Puerto Rico. The fact is, the truth is exactly the opposite.   The Jones Act allows for three American shipping companies using  American ships with American mariners to deliver twice a week--each of  those companies--twice a week on what amounts to a milk run from  Jacksonville, Florida, to Puerto Rico, all the goods and services that  they need.   With the hurricane having happened, these three companies are  providing all of the FEMA, all of the emergency aid, and they have  additional capacity that has not yet been used in delivering the goods  and services that Puerto Rico needs in the wake of the hurricane.   In addition to that, the Jones Act is not just between the islands of  Puerto Rico, Guam, or Hawaii. It is the inland waterways of America-- the great Mississippi River system, all of the barges and tugs and the  rest. If the Jones Act didn't exist, we would have companies, mariners,  and sailors operating in the heart of our country from everywhere in  the world. This is a major national security issue beyond what we will  talk about.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Jayapal) so  very much for participating in this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey) to  carry on with these issues.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Veasey very much for bringing  to our attention the role of the unions in maintaining wages throughout  the United States. If we are looking for a better deal, better jobs,  better wages, and a better future, certainly the union members in the  maritime industry will--and have been able to--achieve that.   The great risk is legislation may be moving through the Senate and  the House that would terminate the Jones Act and, along with it, some  400,000 jobs in the United States, 100,000 of those directly in the  shipyards that are building these American-built ships for the  intercoastal and for the brown water, the river transportation, as well  as the open ocean transportation.   So we have got something here that is very important, and that is  Make It In America, a better deal for Americans comes through the Jones  Act.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Veasey very much for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I notice that my colleague from Chicago, Ms. Schakowsky,  is here once again to pick up on something we talked about earlier in  our Make It In America agenda. If she would look here, number two on  the Make It In America agenda is taxes.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms.  Schakowsky) to talk about taxes.    Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman is properly dressed for  the Blue Collar Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, excuse me for a moment, forgive me for  interrupting, but the gentlewoman said something that caught my  attention.   American corporations that build a factory in China are able to  deduct that cost of that factory against their American taxes?   Unbelievable. Unbelievable.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman so very much for  bringing the voice of Chicago to the floor on a very good piece of  legislation. I believe that has already gone across the desk, and I  didn't get a chance to sign on to it before the gentlewoman put it  across the desk, but I will forgive the gentlewoman for that.    As a proud member of the Blue Collar Caucus, I thank  the gentlewoman for both wearing blue and bringing a message from that  caucus. It is extremely important.   The Make It In America agenda, which we have been talking about here  for at least the last 8 or 9 years, has all of these pieces. The  gentlewoman talked about trade, taxes, infrastructure, education, and  labor--all the pieces of this puzzle.   As we discussed today, there are programs that are clearly going to  be at risk. If the Jones Act somehow gets repealed or gets waived or  otherwise is made less effective, then there are some 400,000 jobs in  American shipyards across the Nation that will be lost. These are  shipyards in Philadelphia, the Gulf Coast, and out in the West, as we  heard Ms. Jayapal talk about Seattle.   San Diego has a major shipyard, the NASSCO shipyard. These are places  where the Jones Act allows for American ships to be built not in China,  but, rather, in America. Make It In America. The Jones Act does that.   Mr. Speaker, I will give you a couple of examples. One of the  companies that ships goods from Jacksonville, Florida, to Puerto Rico  is the TOTE shipping company. They recently spent nearly $400 million  on two of the most advanced clean energy ships anywhere in the world.                                time  1900    These ships were built in San Diego. They are LNG-powered, natural  gas-powered ships, and they are now plying the Jacksonville-Puerto Rico  trade twice a week, back and forth.   Crowley is another company operating in that same area, again, twice  a week, back and forth. They, too, will soon have LNG-powered ships  operating in that area--ships built in America with American workers  and American steel, American engines, and the rest.   So this is critically important. There are 100,000 jobs in the  shipyards. If we repeal the Jones Act, they are gone and, along with  it, the ability of the American shipbuilding industry to supply  commercial ships to move critical national security men and equipment  wherever it needs to go in the world.   The U.S. military is dependent on the American merchant marine system  to move 90 percent of the personnel, equipment, supplies, tanks,  artillery, and all the rest around the world. We have huge airplanes.  They are essential. We see those operating in Puerto Rico now. But they  are not supplying the great mass of goods and services that are needed.   So the plea from all of us who understand what the Jones Act is  really about is to say don't do away with this critical piece of  America's infrastructure.   At the hearing today, I heard my Republican colleague, Mr. Hunter,  chairman of the committee, quote the great free market idol, Adam  Smith.   All too often, the free marketers of the world read those paragraphs  that serve their purposes, but if they were to read the next few  paragraphs in Adam Smith's work, ``The Wealth of Nations,'' they would  read that Adam Smith said very clearly at the period of time he was  writing that it was absolutely essential for the British Government to  protect the British merchant marine and the British maritime industry.   That same admonition should come to the American Congress the same  way: protect this vital industry, protect the merchant marines.   We do not want and we cannot have foreign ships, foreign tugboats,  foreign barges operating up and down the Mississippi River.   What are they carrying? They are carrying gasoline, diesel oil,  natural gas, volatile substances. They are carrying cement. They are  carrying grain.   Do you want to have Yemeni sailors on the Mississippi? Do you want to  have ships owned by China, tugboats, barges owned by China on the  Mississippi River?   If that is what you want, then do away the Jones Act, because that is  exactly what would happen. If you want good American wages with good  American mariners operating on the inland waterways through the Gulf  Coast and up the East Coast, if that is what you want, then you better  keep the Jones Act.   If you do away with the Jones Act, it is guaranteed we will have the  elimination of the American maritime industry.   If you want American ships operating on the West Coast from Seattle  to Anchorage, then you better keep the Jones Act, similarly with Hawaii  and Guam.   Most of all, do you want to have the United States military phone  China and say: We need to ship a few things to the South China Sea to  deal with your encroachment on the islands in the South China Sea; gee,  Mr. China, would you please send us some ships so that we can put the  military equipment on those ships? Is that what we want?   For those men and women here in this Congress and the Senate that  want to do away with the Jones Act, think about it. If you do away with  the Jones Act, you do away with the American merchant marine. Then this  country relies upon China, the largest ship-owning nation in the world,  or maybe sailors from wherever. What background would they have?   So let's pay attention here. Adam Smith said to the British  Government: Maintain the cabotage laws. Do not allow the maritime  industry for Great Britain to go away.   So we should be paying attention to the master of the free market  system, who wasn't totally for the free market but understood the  necessity of protecting certain industries that are critical to the  future of a country.   One more thing is on my mind. Two years ago, the Congress of the  United States decided that we ought to, for the first time in some 50  years, export our crude oil. We have been exporting natural gas in the  form of liquefied natural gas for some time. We added to that the  export of oil.   Is that strategic national asset on American ships with American  sailors? The answer is no. But if we passed a couple of paragraphs of  law and required, as we once did with the North Slope oil when that  opened up in the sixties, that that oil be transported on American- built ships with American sailors, if we were to reinstitute that law  for just a small percentage of the strategic national asset, crude oil  and natural gas, just a small percentage of that on American-built  ships with American sailors, we could build ships in America. Not just  a few ships, but over the course of the next 20 or 30 years, 50 or 60  ships, providing thousands upon thousands of jobs in our American  shipyards.   Right now, where are those ships built? China, Japan, and Korea, but  not in America. We ought to pay attention to the 1960 law that opened  up the North Slope of Alaska that required that oil from Alaska be on  American-built ships with American sailors. That  [[Page H7736]]  lasted for almost 40 years. Then slowly, slowly it was set aside. Now  that oil is on ships that are built in China, Korea, and Japan.   If we want good-paying jobs in America, if we want a better future,  if we want better jobs, if we want an opportunity for Americans to earn  a good middle class wage in the shipyards on the ships, then maintain  the Jones Act and think seriously about a law that would create even  more jobs in American shipyards.   We will soon be introducing a bill called the Energizing American  Maritime Act. Using a strategic national asset that we are now able to  export, natural gas and oil, we require that a small percentage of  that--not 50 percent, not 70 percent, not even 40 percent, but maybe 20  percent--be on American ships with American sailors.    There are many, many things we can do to create good-paying jobs in  America. The Jones Act is one such law that has been in place for  nearly a century. It served America well and will continue to serve  America well if we maintain it and if we don't allow waivers that  simply blow holes in that law, and if we take a strong Make It In  America agenda. The President likes to talk about it, but talk is  cheap. Legislation makes that talk real.   Trade policy, taxes: We just heard about the patriot tax encouraging  American businesses with real tax incentives and discouraging American  businesses that want to offshore the jobs.   Energy policy: I think I just talked about energy policy a moment  ago. Put that oil and natural gas on American ships.   Labor: Good-paying jobs in the shipyards, good-paying jobs on the  ships.   Education: The maritime academies provide the education that is  necessary to do that.   Infrastructure: Freight movement, the ports, channels deepening,  maintaining the locks on the Mississippi and the Ohio. Infrastructure,  again, good-paying jobs.   We can do a lot. It takes laws and it takes men and women on the  Democratic side and the Republican side that come together and say: We  can do this. We can do this for America and for America's workers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
