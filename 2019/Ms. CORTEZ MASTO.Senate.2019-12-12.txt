 Mr. President, I come forward today to  recognize the 25th anniversary of the Veterans Guest House.  [[Page S7025]]    The Veterans Guest House has long been one of Reno's best kept  secrets. This ``home away from home'' is one of the only facilities of  its kind in the country serving U.S. military veterans and their  families, providing temporary overnight accommodations for veterans  receiving treatment at a medical facility in the Reno-Sparks area. In  the early 1990s, veterans visiting the Veterans Administration Medical  Center of the Sierra, VAMC, in Reno noticed that the family members of  veterans were sleeping in their cars because they couldn't afford  lodging while their loved one was in the hospital. Even some veterans  were sleeping in their cars so they could arrive for appointments and  other treatments. It was clear that this was not acceptable, and so our  generous Northern Nevada community went to work to do better for our  veterans.   In 1994, Reno's Spouse House opened its doors in an old bungalow- style home right near the VAMC in Reno. It had a handful of beds, and  in those early years, the House provided lodging to about 800 guests  each year. In the 25 years since that time, the Veterans Guest House  has evolved and expanded to better meet the needs of our veterans and  their families. In 2002, the nonprofit took the name ``Veterans Guest  House'' to reflect its broader mission of assisting both veterans and  their families, and in 2004, a new 12-bed home was built. By 2012, the  nonprofit had acquired another property and expanded the bed total to  17, allowing them to provide more than 5,000 guest nights that year.  Recently, construction concluded on the latest expansion bringing total  capacity to 33 beds.   The Veterans Guest House is key to connecting our community to our  veterans, providing a variety of ways to show our support for our  veterans and their families and the sacrifices made by both. Volunteers  are welcome at the Veterans Guest House to help provide the  organization ongoing support doing everything from cleaning rooms, to  assisting in small repairs, to helping with fundraisers. Community  groups, families, and businesses also are encouraged to provide a home- cooked meal for the guests or help fill the needs of the agency's  ``Wish List.'' Most guests reside more than 30 miles away from the  hospital, and so having that support for them and their families is  crucial. Guests are asked to make a donation to support the work of the  House, but no one is turned away because they can't pay. The  organization relies completely on donations and receives no Federal or  State funding.   I am so pleased to recognize the 25th anniversary of the Veterans  Guest House and the critical services and support it provides to our  veterans and their families.                            ____________________
