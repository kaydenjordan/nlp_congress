 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as chairman  of the Congressional Sportsmen's Caucus--the largest bipartisan caucus  within the Halls of Congress--to talk about the recent May 16  congressional shoot-out, a competition of sporting clays, skeet, and  trap that pit Republican and Democrat Members of Congress against each  other in a great afternoon of enjoying outdoor shooting sports.   We had a bipartisan shoot. The Republican team won this year. I am  just the chairman and team captain.   I would like to say that I won one of the individual awards this  year--I have in the past--but this year we had Members on our side that  won. The top gun Member of Congress was Richard Hudson from North  Carolina. The top shot Democrat was Tim Walz. The best shooter for  skeet was Collin Peterson. The top sporting clays was a freshman Member  from North Carolina, Ted Budd. I am saving the best for last: the top  trap was none other than Don Young from Alaska.   It is a great afternoon where we can honor the outdoor economy, the  largest industry of the United States, serve the outdoors in a lot of  ways, and the heritage of sportsmen outdoor community activity is  critical to the American story.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green),  who is the Democrat co-chair.  [[Page H4687]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Veasey).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott), who is Marc Veasey's co-chair on the  caucus.    What a great event. It was a great  opportunity for us to get together, get to know each other better, and  spend some time in the outdoors.   I invite all Members to join the caucus. Come and be a part of this  next year. Republicans retain the trophy this year, and I hope we will  next year.                            ____________________
