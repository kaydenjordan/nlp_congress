 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the first 100 days of  President Donald Trump's administration.   In his first 100 days, President Trump has enacted more pieces of  legislation than any other President since Truman, facilitated the  earliest Supreme Court confirmation since 1881, eliminated many onerous  regulations to restore economic optimism and opportunity, protected the  sanctity of life, and driven illegal border crossings to a 17-year low.  His accomplishments are truly remarkable.   I have appreciated President Trump's willingness to listen and work  with Congress on major pieces of legislation. His effort to work with  Congress is a breath of fresh air.   President Trump made several promises to the American people, and I  am encouraged by his efforts to fulfill them. Mr. Speaker, the American  people are watching--they are watching both the President and those of  us in Congress. They will not accept broken promises or half-hearted  measures. They want results. I look forward to working alongside  President Trump to keep our promises.                            ____________________
