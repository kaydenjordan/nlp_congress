 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, yesterday was the deadliest day yet  in the continued fighting between the terrorist forces attacking Israel  and Israel's measured, precise, and defensive response.   Hamas unleashed another round of rocket barrages, intentionally  targeting civilian areas all across Israel. Israel intensified its  campaign to, among other specific military objectives, destroy the  terrorist group's underground networks of weapons storage and command  and control.   Last week, Hamas's rocket attacks took the life of a 5-year-old  Israeli boy. And because Hamas, in stark violation of the laws of war,  intentionally co-locates its terrorist facilities in civilian buildings  in neighborhoods, Israeli strikes have regrettably led to civilian  casualties in Gaza.   No one is glad to see the fighting, but we are already seeing some  push the false narrative that this conflict is a tragic dispute between  two legitimate combatants where both sides share blame that is roughly  equal--what nonsense. This yields calls for blanket cease-fires and  people wagging their fingers at both sides. This camp apparently  includes some of our own Senate colleagues.   To say that ``both sides'' need to deescalate downplays the  responsibility the terrorists have for initiating the conflict in the  first place and suggests Israelis are not entitled to defend themselves  against ongoing rocket barrages. I completely reject this obscene moral  equivalence.   Now, the second false narrative is the view on the increasingly vocal  far left that Israel is, to quote one far-left Member of the House, an  ``apartheid state.'' Another says Israel has perpetrated ``an act of  terrorism.''   Look, this is not a conflict between Israel and the Palestinian  people. Hamas has sought to hijack recent tensions to advance its own  narrow, violent objectives. In that sense, it is a conflict between  Israel and a terrorist rump state in Gaza that uses its civilian  population as human shields and exploits their suffering for political  gain. These terrorists set up shop in apartment buildings and under  press offices. They direct rocket attacks from the cover of schools and  markets. In the past, when their operatives have been killed, they  passed them off to the international community as civilian victims of  Israel.   Few countries in history spend as much effort to avoid civilian  casualties during war as Israel and the United States. We hold our  militaries to the highest standard. Our Israeli friends take pain to  defend themselves in ways that are responsible and spare the very  civilians Hamas is willing to sacrifice for its propaganda. Israel  invests heavily in precision munitions. They spend precious time after  attacks confirming target identification. And listen to this: They even  provide advance warning to civilians in Gaza before specific buildings  are targeted, even when doing so means the terrorists may also  evacuate.   It is all well and good for President Biden to speak with the  President of the Palestinian Authority, but he holds little sway in  Gaza. And twice he has rejected generous offers from different Israeli  Governments aimed at establishing an enduring peace.   But if the so-called international community wants to actually make a  [[Page S2535]]  difference--really make a difference--they can impose real costs on  those who fund the terror weapons of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic  Jihad.   We know where their return address is. It is over in Tehran.   I have been proud to stand with Israel for years, and I am proud to  stand with Israel today. The United States needs to stand foursquare  behind our ally. President Biden must remain strong against the growing  voices within his own party that create false equivalence between  terrorist aggressors and a responsible state defending itself.   Israel deserves an opportunity to restore deterrence and to impose  costs on terrorists the international community has been unwilling or  unable to impose. There is a saying that has been around for quite a  while: If Hamas laid down its weapons tomorrow, there would be no more  fighting; if Israel laid down their weapons, there would be no more  Israel.   So let's leave no doubt where America stands                            ____________________     On an entirely different matter, when the 117th  Congress and President Biden were sworn in back in January, our Nation  had already turned the corner in our battle with the coronavirus. New  cases and deaths had already peaked and actually started to plummet.  The vaccines, made available in record time thanks to Operation Warp  Speed, had already started to roll out nationwide at a rate which the  Biden administration inherited and sustained until April. The five  bipartisan COVID packages that Congress passed in 2020 had the American  economy packed with dry powder and primed for an epic comeback.   Economists across the spectrum agreed. One of President Obama's CEA  chairmen said: ``We have no historic parallel with anything like this  level of excess saving.'' Larry Summers, another top Obama adviser and  President Clinton's Treasury Secretary before that, said the bipartisan  December package was already enough to elevate a measure of household  income to ``abnormally high levels, unheard of during an economic  downturn.'' We were already adding back jobs.   But instead of tailoring another bill to build on this momentum, they  pushed ahead with the $2 trillion partisan plan that the far left  wanted. Republicans predicted it would hurt our recovery if Washington  kept taxing working people so the government could pay others a bonus  to stay home. I stood here in February and quoted an expert who said:         In an expanding economy that is putting the virus behind       it, paying people more in unemployment than they could       receive from working is an act of substantial economic self-      harm. It would keep workers on the sidelines, stop the       unemployment rate from falling as rapidly as it otherwise       would, and slow the overhaul recovery.    Well, we all knew what would happen, but Democrats insisted on  continuing to pay people more not to work.   In April, as the President's policies took effect, we only added  266,000 jobs. That is nearly 800,000 under estimates, just as jobs  openings soared to more than 8 million, the biggest number ever  recorded. We are literally taxing the American workers who are back on  the job for the sake of slowing down our economic recovery.   Instead of an agenda to reopen America, Democrats muscled through  policies that would actually prolong parts of this crisis. And, of  course, that is what happened. A record number of small businesses say  they have open jobs they cannot fill.   Governors across America are having to take matters into their own  hands and turn off these extra-generous benefits. In States like  Arizona, Georgia, Montana, Ohio, and West Virginia, we have Governors  having to clean up this mess, which at least one of their own Senators  actually voted for.   The policies that we needed in March of 2020 are not the policies we  need in May of 2021. That has been obvious to Republicans, to  economists, and to the American people.   The sooner that my Democratic friends here in Washington can catch  up, the better.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, throughout a year full of new and  difficult challenges, the greater Louisville region has been fortunate  to have my friend Brian Riendeau helping lead the response. As the  executive director of Dare to Care food bank, Brian has been  instrumental in delivering tens of millions of quality and nutritious  meals each year around this community. His vision and talent support  families when they need it most, and we owe him a major debt of  gratitude. This summer, Brian will bring to a close his 12 years of  remarkable leadership at Dare to Care. I would like to take a moment  today to recognize his accomplishments and thank him for his vast  contributions to Kentucky.   This last year wasn't the first time I've watched Brian deliver for  Kentucky. Before we worked together in  [[Page S2543]]  his current role, I had the privilege of having Brian on my Senate  staff. For 5 years, he was an important adviser on legislation and  Kentucky-focused priorities. While I was sorry to see him leave my  office, I was pleased to know he was headed to the Bluegrass. He spent  more than a decade in corporate leadership at one of Louisville's  biggest employers before dedicating himself full-time to combating food  insecurity.   In 2009, Brian joined Dare to Care with a plan. He wanted to expand  the food bank's physical footprint and its reach. Founded in Louisville  more than 50 years ago to address a troubling rise of malnutrition,  Dare to Care partners with nearly 300 local organizations to promote  healthy and active lifestyles across the community. Brian grew the  staff to 60-strong and developed a strategy to further invest in  Louisville and the surrounding region. In the last few years, he  completed a $7 million-plus capital campaign to build a new community  kitchen to serve even more Kentuckians.   I had the opportunity to see Brian's operation firsthand last July.  In the first months of the pandemic, demand for Dare to Care's help  jumped around 35 percent. Brian and his team overcame supply-chain  disruptions, implemented social distancing and other medical  precautions, and continued serving those in need. In fact, once Brian's  team stocked its shelves, Dare to Care was even able to help other food  banks in Kentucky fill their own. Brian's forward-thinking and  commitment to service helped countless Kentucky families during the  hardest days of this pandemic. I am so grateful to him and his team for  working around the clock to feed Kentucky.   Dare to Care is well-positioned to continue fulfilling its mission  for years to come, and Brian's outstanding leadership helped get it  there. Whatever comes next for Brian and his wife Judy, I know I speak  for his many admirers in wishing him all the best. I would like to  express my personal gratitude for his years of dedication to Kentucky,  and I encourage my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating Brian  for his many successes.                            ____________________
