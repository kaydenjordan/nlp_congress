 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my manager's amendment makes a number of  minor technical changes to the reported version of the bill and would  significantly reduce discretionary costs while maintaining the overall  intent of the bill.   The biggest change that would be made in the manager's amendment is  the removal of section 11 of the bill, which would require the  Department of Veterans Affairs to track a number of hiring  effectiveness metrics.   That section alone scored at $6 million because the Congressional  Budget Office expected that the VA would have to hire an additional  employee in each Veterans Integrated Service Network in order to gather  that information. I disagree with that assertion and I intend to  continue working on that provision to, hopefully, include it in future  legislation in some form.   In addition, the manager's amendment would authorize but not require  the VA to track and match qualified job applicants for vacant positions  using the recruiting database that the bill would establish. The CBO  estimated that the VA would have to hire up to 40 additional employees  with an average compensation of $100,000 per year to accomplish that  task, meaning that provision in total would cost $19 million. Again, I  disagree with the assertion that such a task could not be accomplished  using existing staff.   The Subcommittee on Health, which I am proud to chair, is holding an  oversight hearing next week where I intend  [[Page H2159]]  to ask the VA how the Department would utilize the recruiting database  and whether it would entail additional employees. Should it appear that  the VA would not use the recruiting database to identify qualified  candidates for open positions in a timely manner and to promptly fill  prolonged vacancies, I will certainly reconsider mandating that in  future legislation.   The manager's amendment would also stipulate that the additional  human resources training that the bill would require be done virtually.  Finally, it would extend the timeline to implement the executive  management fellowship program from 90 days to 1 year, which would  provide the VA additional time to set up this important new leadership  development program and would extend the GAO reporting deadline from 1  to 2 years, which would provide the GAO additional time to complete  their investigation into the VA succession planning.   Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr, Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Representative Meng's amendment,  which would stipulate that the annual determination of Veterans Health  Administration staffing shortages must include at least five clinical  occupations and five nonclinical occupations within each VA medical  center.   This amendment rightfully recognizes that some VA medical centers may  have staffing challenges that extend beyond just 10 occupations and  provides sufficient flexibility for this reporting requirement--which  triggers the VA's direct hiring authority--to accommodate that by  reporting more than five clinical and five nonclinical occupations, as  needed.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.  I thank Representative Meng for submitting it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time in  opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Representative Sewell's  amendment, which would authorize the Secretary in selecting employees  to participate in the executive management fellowship program  established by section 3 of the bill, to provide a preference for  employees in rural areas.                                time  0930    According to VA's Office of Rural Health, there are currently 3  million veterans living in rural communities across the country who  rely on the VA healthcare system for their care.   It is critical that VA medical facilities in rural areas are given  access to leadership development opportunities like the executive  management fellowship program so that rural veterans benefit from them.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment,  and I thank Representative Sewell for submitting it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to Representative  Hanabusa's amendment, which would strike section 6 of the bill.   Section 6 would allow the VA to noncompetitively reappoint a former  VA employee to a position not more than one grade higher than their  former position, as long as the employee left voluntarily within the  prior 2 years, had a satisfactory performance record, and maintained  necessary licensures and credentials.   The former employees who would be helped by this section had  performed admirably, left voluntarily, and gone on to gain relevant  education or experience that the VA needs. They should be encouraged to  come back to the VA and put their new skills to work for our veterans,  not required to go through a lengthy competitive selection process at  the VA for the second time.   Striking this provision would deprive the VA of an authority that  could be used to address access and other challenges by recruiting  high-performing former employees back to VA employment.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in opposing this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Representative  Buck's amendment, which would prevent former VA political appointees  from receiving nonpolitical, competitively selected positions pursuant  to section 6 of the bill without going through the proper competitive  selection process.   This amendment would prevent political appointees from  inappropriately burrowing in across VA, and I am in full support of it.   I thank Representative Buck for submitting this amendment, and I urge  all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition, although I am not opposed.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Representative Shea- Porter's amendment, which would require the VA to ensure that the  recruiting database established by section 7 of the bill includes a  list of open mental health positions.   Though I am glad to report that, as of January, only 3,469 of VA's  45,360 vacant positions were specific to mental health, it is critical  that the VA closely track to mental health vacancies on an ongoing  basis so that they can be prioritized and filled to prevent any  disruptions in care to our most vulnerable veterans.   I am fully supportive of this amendment and grateful to  Representative Shea-Porter for submitting it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition, although I am not opposed.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Representative  Brownley's amendment, which would stipulate that the Government  Accountability Office report on VA succession planning should include  an assessment of succession planning at VA medical centers, domiciliary  facilities, outpatient clinics, community-based outpatient clinics, and  vet centers.   I appreciate this clarifying amendment and my friend and colleague  Representative Brownley, the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Health, for submitting it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition, although I am not opposed.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Representative Welch's  amendment, which would ensure that the GAO report on VA succession  planning includes an analysis of succession planning in rural areas.   Rural facilities undoubtedly face unique challenges in recruiting and  retaining employees and in planning effectively to ensure leadership  continuity as employees retire or depart. I am glad that, with the  adoption of this amendment, GAO will be reviewing these issues  specifically and will be able to offer recommendations as to how VA can  improve succession planning in rural areas where approximately 40  percent of our veterans reside.   I appreciate Representative Welch for submitting this amendment, and  I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition, although I am not opposed.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Representative  Gottheimer's amendments which would ensure that veterans who are recent  graduates and/or recipients of the  [[Page H2164]]  post-9/11 GI Bill are also eligible for excepted service appointments  under section 12 of the bill.   As a veteran and as the former chairman of the Subcommittee on  Economic Opportunity, there are few things I support as strongly as  assisting veterans in seeking and receiving employment opportunities,  particularly in the Federal Government.   The skill sets and commitment to service that veterans display while  in uniform often make them particularly suited to government work once  they transition to civilian life. The adoption of this amendment would  provide yet another tool to support veterans looking to continue their  service to our Nation, and I am grateful to Representative Gottheimer  for submitting it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of Representative  Hanabusa's amendment, which would tweak the report on exit surveys the  VA is required to submit in section 13 of the bill to stipulate the VA  provide the total number of employees who voluntarily separated from VA  service and the percentage of those who took an exit survey.   This information will be very helpful for Congress to receive in  order to track how many employees are choosing to voluntarily leave the  VA and are taking advantage of the opportunity to complete an exit  survey prior to their departure.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment, and  I am grateful to Representative Hanabusa for submitting it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Representative  Meng's amendment, which would encourage military medical professionals  who are transitioning out of the Armed Forces to seek employment within  the Veterans Health Administration.   Wherever possible, the VA should be filling vacant positions at VA  medical facilities with eligible, qualified veterans. And I am fully  supportive of any amendment like this one that recognizes the highly  specialized skills that many veterans gained while in uniform, skills  that, in this case, could be used in service to fellow veterans by  addressing access to care challenges across the country.   I am grateful to Representative Meng for this important amendment,  and I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Representative  Bost's amendment, which would require the Department of Veterans  Affairs to develop and implement a plan to hire directors at each VA  medical center that lacks a permanent director.   Twenty-five percent of current VA medical center directors are  eligible to retire, and the VA testified last year that it can take  more than 6 months and multiple reannouncements to recruit new VA  medical center directors.   The VA must begin planning now to ensure that leadership at VA  medical centers across the country remain stable and that medical  center director vacancies are closely monitored and prioritized.   The text of this amendment passed the House last year with unanimous  support, and I am grateful to Representative Bost for submitting this  amendment again this year to H.R. 1367.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it.    Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the time  in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Representative  O'Rourke's amendment, which would allow the VA to offer physicians  conditional job offers 2 years prior to the completion of their  residency, and also require VA recruiters or other officials to visit  each teaching institution with a residency program at least once a  [[Page H2167]]  year. It is a great idea and one that I greatly appreciate.   The VA's existing workforce is increasingly retirement-eligible, and,  historically, the VA has performed poorly in comparison to other  Federal agencies when it comes to hiring younger employees.   By creating a pipeline of young, up-and-coming physicians willing to  practice in VA medical facilities and committed to VA service, this  amendment would help ensure that the VA healthcare system is fully  staffed to care for our veterans for years to come.   The text of this amendment passed the House last year as an amendment  to H.R. 5620, and I am grateful to Representative O'Rourke for  submitting it as an amendment to H.R. 1367 today.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Collins of Georgia) having assumed the chair, Mr. Hultgren, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 1367) to improve the authority of the Secretary of Veterans  Affairs to hire and retain physicians and other employees of the  Department of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
