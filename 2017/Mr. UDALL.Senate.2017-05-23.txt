 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today many of my colleagues will come to  the floor to speak about the devastating impact that TrumpCare will  have on rural communities. I rise to join them in speaking on this  topic and on the many other serious flaws in the Republicans' bill to  replace ObamaCare.  [[Page S3084]]    When he was elected, President Trump promised he would provide  healthcare for everyone, but President Trump and our Republican friends  have turned their backs on that promise. The Republican healthcare  proposal would put insurance companies back in the driver's seat, and  that means less quality and more costs for all of us. Rural  communities, working families, and people with medical conditions would  be hit the hardest.   Today, we got a taste of how devastating TrumpCare would be. The  President's budget proposal slashes billions of dollars for Medicaid  and the Children's Health Insurance Program. President Trump takes  direct aim at bipartisan programs that have made historic progress for  kids, for the disabled, and for the elderly.   Former Senator Hubert Humphrey once said: ``The moral test of  government is how it treats those who are in the dawn of life, the  children; those who are in the twilight of life, the aged; and those in  the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped.''   When Senator Humphrey spoke those words, he had been diagnosed with  terminal cancer. He died a few months later. His words are just as  meaningful today.   TrumpCare fails Senator Humphrey's moral test. It doesn't cover more  people or more services or improve healthcare. It raises costs and  reduces quality. Compared to the ACA--or ObamaCare--TrumpCare would be  a disaster for families in my home State.   In New Mexico, tens of thousands of people have healthcare, thanks to  ObamaCare and the Medicaid expansion. Before the Affordable Care Act,  New Mexico had one of the highest rates of uninsured in the country. It  was almost 20 percent, at 19.6 percent. That rate has been cut in half  to 8.9 percent.   Approximately 300,000 more New Mexicans now have healthcare. And each  one of these 300,000 people has a story about how having healthcare has  made a difference--even saved lives.   Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, hundreds of thousands of New  Mexicans now have essential health benefits, including doctor visits,  hospital care, prescription drugs, pregnancy and childbirth, and mental  health services, and a range of preventive services, like mammograms  and other cancer screenings, are available at no cost.   I am not saying that the ACA is perfect. Premiums are still too high,  deductibles are increasing too much, and we still must bring down the  cost of prescription drugs. We absolutely need to work to bring down  costs. But, on balance, the Affordable Care Act passes all tests--many  with flying colors. TrumpCare does not come close. TrumpCare gets an F.    Test No. 1: Does TrumpCare increase the number of Americans who will  have healthcare? No, it decreases coverage and decreases it  dramatically.   According to the most recent figures from the CBO, 24 million  Americans will lose healthcare coverage under TrumpCare over the next  decade. TrumpCare would dismantle the Medicaid expansion provisions  that help so many working Americans, including 265,000 people in New  Mexico, and TrumpCare would hit rural communities the hardest.   The National Rural Health Association has said that TrumpCare ``does  nothing to improve the health care crisis in rural America, and will  lead to poorer rural health outcomes, more uninsured and an increase in  the rural hospital closure crisis.''   Rural areas like the ones we have in New Mexico have more elderly and  disabled people, and fewer people have insurance through their jobs.  TrumpCare is the hardest on these groups.   Rural hospitals are already struggling. They will have an even harder  time keeping their doors open.   Many New Mexicans would have to drive an hour or more if their local  hospital closed. And not only would closed hospitals mean less access  to healthcare, it would also hurt the economy. In rural areas,  hospitals are a big employer. If they close, the rural economy takes a  hit too.   The administrator of the Guadalupe County Hospital in New Mexico, a  fine woman by the name of Christina Campos, fears what might happen if  TrumpCare becomes law. She is urging me to protect access to care in  rural areas.   Guadalupe County is one of our smallest counties by population. The  hospital's uninsured payer rate declined from 14 percent to 4 percent  from 2014 to 2016, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, and its  uncompensated care increased 23 percent in that same period.   I can tell my colleagues that I will fight tooth and nail to keep  residents in our rural areas insured and to keep rural hospitals in New  Mexico open.   Test No. 2: Does TrumpCare increase coverage of healthcare services?  No, it fails this test too. Under the ACA, insurance companies must  cover essential healthcare services, period. But under TrumpCare,  starting in 2020, States can get a waiver and define their own  essential benefits for individual and small group plans. So States  would be able to cut the benefits that people count on--and that are  making patients healthier.   Test No. 3: Does TrumpCare make healthcare more affordable? It  doesn't. It takes aim at the most vulnerable working and low-income  families and seniors--the people most in need of care--and it cuts  access to healthcare out from under them. If you are older and poorer,  you lose big under TrumpCare. If you are young and wealthy, you win.   What is wrong with this picture? What is wrong is that it is unjust.  And it is bad for healthcare costs over the long run. Trump and the  Republicans are proposing drastic changes to our healthcare system--and  they are changes for the worse. They want to go backward to a time when  insurance companies could decide who gets healthcare and who doesn't.   Finally, TrumpCare would hurt anyone with a preexisting condition.  One of the most popular provisions of ObamaCare is that it prohibits  insurance companies from dropping you if you get sick and from refusing  to cover you because of a preexisting condition. A preexisting  condition could be something serious like cancer, but insurance  companies have considered everything from childbirth to hand warts a  preexisting condition.   Under TrumpCare, States would be able to decide whether to get a  waiver from those patient protections. And then we would go back to  that time when insurance companies decided who could get healthcare and  who couldn't. States would have to set up high-risk pools to provide  people with the option of insurance in catastrophic situations. But in  the best cases, high-risk pools wouldn't protect many people from going  bankrupt just to get healthcare, and TrumpCare wouldn't provide nearly  enough funding for States to run them successfully.   Take Alexis from Albuquerque. Alexis is here in the photograph with  her husband. Alexis had a stroke and brain surgeries when she was 28  years old. Even though she had no lingering effects, she was denied  insurance in the private market and had to get insurance in New  Mexico's high-risk pool. According to Alexis, ``It broke us  financially.'' Alexis now has affordable health insurance with the help  of the Affordable Care Act subsidies. Like most people, she doesn't  want to risk going broke just to get healthcare. She shouldn't have to.   Finally, I want to tell you about a 1-year-old from Albuquerque, NM,  whose name is Rafe. Rafe was born with cortical visual impairment--a  kind of legal blindness--and significant developmental delays. His  parents--Jessica, his mom, and his father, Sam, a veteran--have been  able to access the intensive medical care, early intervention services,  medical equipment, and therapy he needs through a combination of the  military's insurance and Medicaid. But TrumpCare jeopardizes Medicaid  by turning it into a block grant for States, which will most certainly  result in deep cuts to Medicaid. It threatens Rafe's chances of a  better life.   The President promised he would keep protections for people with  preexisting conditions--people who are sick. His broken promises can  hurt tens of millions of Americans.   In the end, TrumpCare is not a real healthcare bill. It is a tax  relief bill for the richest 1 percent. The CBO estimates that TrumpCare  would cut taxes by $346 billion over 10 years, at the expense of the  healthcare of working families and seniors.  [[Page S3085]]    Our priorities for healthcare reform should be increasing coverage,  increasing the services provided, making people healthier, and  providing affordable healthcare. I strongly and unequivocally support  all Americans having healthcare.   Let's get to that goal, and let's get to that goal now. Ninety-one  percent of the American people are insured, thanks to the steps taken  under the Affordable Care Act. Rather than repealing it, let's build on  its strengths so 100 percent of people can afford to see a doctor when  they are sick. We can do this. We can do better. Let's ensure that  Americans in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the  twilight of life, the aged; and those in the shadows of life, the sick,  the needy, and the disabled, have the right to healthcare so that  America meets the moral test of good governance.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
