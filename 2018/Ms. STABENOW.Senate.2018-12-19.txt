 Mr. President, the 2018 farm bill was a true bipartisan  victory, and I am very proud of the historic vote Senator Roberts and I  were able to achieve on this bill. It serves as an example of how  Congress, on a bipartisan basis, can produce important legislation  through debate and compromise. On the Agriculture, Nutrition, and  Forestry Committee, we have a long history of working together to  ensure a strong safety net for farmers and for families. This bill  continues that long-standing, bipartisan tradition. I know that the  chairman did not get everything he wanted in this bill, and neither did  I. I would have preferred to make more progress on reforming farm  payments, a cause championed by my friend, Senator Grassley, and on  improving the adequacy of benefits in the Supplemental Nutrition  Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and our other food assistance  programs, but, overall, this is a good bill that protects and advances  many critical food and farm policies that deserves the strong  bipartisan support it received.   The nutrition title of this bill is no exception. We know that SNAP  is largely working, and spending has been declining as more people get  back to work and get off SNAP the right way. We also know that it is  our job to make sure the program is working as intended and that we  address any integrity issues that arise. That is why we included  important improvements to SNAP program operations, oversight, and  employment and training in this bill. In this conference report, we  have protected SNAP, made modest, but important improvements, and  excluded the very harmful House provisions that would have cut SNAP by  more than $20 billion over 10 years, taken food assistance away from at  least 2 million people, and imposed new, unworkable mandates on States.   I wish we also could have made more progress in expanding SNAP  eligibility, benefits, and access in ways that would address food  insecurity and help low-income Americans who are struggling to make  ends meet. That said, we were able to include an important benefit  improvement that will provide additional SNAP benefit to certain  homeless households that, despite lacking a permanent nighttime  address, may still incur expenses for shelter for temporary  accommodations or to stay with friends or family. The program's $143  homeless shelter deduction will now be available in all States,  including in my home State of Michigan, and will keep pace with  inflation each year. If a  [[Page S7919]]  household could get more SNAP benefits by claiming the regular shelter  deduction, it must continue to be able to do so, but for the many  households that have had difficulty proving the amount of their shelter  expenses, this change will enhance their SNAP benefits and reduce  paperwork for both the household and for State agencies. Specifically,  the conference report allows, for example, when a homeless household  incurs a cost for shelter, but does not have paperwork available to  prove the expense, an eligibility worker to provide the standard  homeless shelter deduction based on her or his assessment of the  households' claims about the expense. The worker can examine the  totality of the household's circumstances and provide an appropriate  deduction based on the information that is available.   Another improvement we include in this conference agreement is a  requirement that USDA reassess the adequacy of SNAP's Thrifty Food  Plan, TFP, by 2022 and every 5 years subsequently. The TFP is the  foundation for SNAP benefit levels and is meant to reflect the actual  food costs that households face in obtaining a nutritionally adequate  diet. In recent years, mounting research evidence has found that the  TFP is out of step with actual food purchasing practices and  nutritional recommendations and that, for the vast majority of  households, SNAP benefits are inadequate when considered in tandem with  income that the household is assumed to have available for food. In  part, the low SNAP benefits are a result of USDA in the past requiring  that revisions not increase the cost of the TFP. Over many years, the  factors behind food costs have evolved, i.e., purchasing and  consumption patterns, dietary guidelines, women's work patterns, and  transportation costs. Our intention for the future is that USDA not be  compelled to achieve a cost-neutral revision to the TFP, but that it  bring to bear the best scientific evidence about the appropriate cost  of a ``thrifty,'' but nutritionally adequate food basket. We recognize  that this may mean that SNAP benefits need to be adjusted as a result  of the reassessment.   We also recognize that food insecurity is an ongoing issue amongst  military families. While the conference report did not include a  critical change I support related to the treatment of the Base  Allowance for Housing in SNAP, I want to encourage USDA to look for  ways to address military hunger. Specifically, I ask that USDA  designate an office or liaison within the Office of the Secretary of  Agriculture to coordinate with Department of Defense to gather data  about currently serving military families experiencing food insecurity.  I would ask USDA to gather key information such as estimates of SNAP  participation by currently serving military families; estimates of  currently serving military families experiencing food insecurity, but  not able to qualify for SNAP benefits because the inclusion of their  Basic Allowance for Housing allowance as counted income; estimates of  currently serving military households with low household incomes--below  200 percent of federal poverty line; below 185 percent; below 130  percent; and estimates of participation in WIC by military households  in comparison to SNAP.   Food consumption and buying behaviors are not the only changes  affecting SNAP. Technology, both in administration and in the retail  landscape, also continue to evolve. The conference report makes several  important changes to help USDA to modernize to address consumer  preferences and to help States to continue to strengthen their  stewardship of SNAP.   First, we expand a pilot from the last farm bill, known as the  National Accuracy Clearinghouse, NAC, to be a nationwide program within  a few years. The NAC gives States tools to ensure that individuals do  not simultaneously receive SNAP benefits in two or more States by  conducting cross-State matches of SNAP applicants and participating  households and setting up a process for States to resolve instances of  apparent dual participation. An evaluation of the NAC pilot found that,  although duplicate participation is small--less than 0.02 percent of  SNAP participants--it is feasible for States to conduct a match to  identify and prevent duplicate participation.   We know that duplicate participation, when it does occur, is rarely  intentional fraud, but rather is a result of a household or household  member simply moving from one State to another and not successfully  disenrolling in their previous home State. This could be caused by  households not being able to get through to a call center to report the  move or a State not taking the proper subsequent action to close the  case or remove the household member. The NAC helps States to address  this issue more effectively using technology, saving money within SNAP  in the process. As with any error, without evidence of a client's  intent to defraud the program, States should assume that dual  enrollment discovered through the NAC is unintentional.   Because duplicate participation is so rare and a household's need for  food assistance may be urgent, the conference committee expects that  USDA's Food and Nutrition Service, FNS, and States will establish  procedures for the NAC that will not interfere with current application  and enrollment procedures, particularly the speedy processing of  applications. Some States are able to process matches in ``real time''  or provide same-day or other fast service to SNAP applicants. Given  that only a tiny fraction of applications are expected to result in a  positive match via the NAC, we expect that States will often run the  match after approving SNAP.   In developing the NAC provision, the members were sensitive to recent  problems with data security breaches and the risk that any large data  set may be a target for hacking, identity theft, or other ``big data''  goals that are not associated with the administration of SNAP. The  Conference Committee intended that the NAC have state-of-the art  privacy and security protections and that the information shared across  States as part of the NAC be used only for the purpose of identifying  and preventing dual participation in SNAP. We expect FNS to exercise  strong oversight of any contractors that are engaged in the operation  of the NAC to ensure that contractor is not using information about  SNAP participants for any other purposes.   Finally, as part of the NAC, we expect that FNS will be developing  procedures for standardizing, streamlining, and in some cases  automating cross-State communications. We urge FNS to ensure that these  processes provide SNAP recipients with services that take into account  the difficulty they may have in navigating cross-State communications.  For example, we expect FNS's policies to include procedures to help  households appeal and resolve decisions across State boundaries. If a  noncustodial parent applies for benefits on behalf of a child who lives  with the other parent, it may be difficult for the custodial parent to  know how to navigate an eligibility decision made in another State  where the individual does not reside.   Similarly, when overpayments occur because of duplicate  participation, we expect the cross-State claims process to take into  account difficulties households may have had in closing their case in  their prior State of residence. For example, if a State was delinquent  in closing the case after the household reported the change, or the  household could not get through on the telephone to report the change  because of a major problem in call center operations, this should be  considered an agency error, and households should be given  consideration in the claims establishment and collection process. If  the household did not use the benefits in the State in which they  previously resided because they were receiving SNAP where they live now  and simply could not close their old case because of a problem with the  States' reporting procedures we assume they will not be held  responsible for repaying an overpayment.   Another provision of the bill offers States an opportunity to  collaborate with FNS to establish longitudinal data sets about SNAP  participation. The goal of this provision is in some ways the opposite  of the NAC. Where the NAC aims to share very specific identifying  information about SNAP applicants and participants to prevent dual  participation, the conference agreement specifically prohibits the  longitudinal database from collecting or sharing any personal  identifying information. Instead, the information in these data sets  will be used only for research purposes to study the characteristics of  SNAP participants over time  [[Page S7920]]  and improve SNAP program operations. Because most data that is  available about SNAP participants looks just at 1 particular month,  these data sets will fill in a gap in our understanding of SNAP and  allow States, FNS, and other researchers to learn about patterns of  participation and other factors such as work experience and income  volatility.    The SNAP quality control, QC, system, which measures SNAP payment  accuracy, has recently been the subject of oversight by USDA's Office  of Inspector General. The Senate Agriculture Committee also held a  hearing to review problems with the quality control system. This led  FNS to conduct a subsequent investigation and revise its guidance and  processes. We acknowledge that FNS and States have made substantial  progress in addressing the problems these investigations exposed. The  conference agreement requires FNS to issue regulations to codify the  quality control improvements and other changes in order to ensure the  statistical validity of the measures the QC system produces. The  conferees are not expecting any major changes in how the QC system  measures payment error. We expect that the basic tenets of the quality  control measures will remain. For example, a payment error will be  determined based on the outcome of the eligibility decision, rather  than on the State's procedural compliance, and that the certification  and reporting rules under State and Federal policy will be taken into  account in assessing payment errors.   The QC system needs to balance the twin goals of payment accuracy and  program access. We urge FNS to not include changes to the QC system  that would make it harder for individuals to participate in SNAP if  they live in unstable conditions as a result of them moving more often,  do not have a permanent address, or if they are likely to be more  ``error prone'' because they have variable earnings that are more  difficult for States to track.   The conferees are aware that the OIG and USDA both identified uneven  Federal application and enforcement of quality control rules, as well  as State practices, as an underlying cause of the problems identified  in the investigations and reviews. We expect that improving quality  control reviews will involve a more rigorous Federal rereview and more  consistent practices across FNS regions.   The conferees chose not to include a House provision that would  eliminate the quality control error tolerance threshold. Currently set  at $37, this is the threshold below which error amounts do not count  toward the State's error rate. The threshold encourages States to focus  their efforts on larger, costlier errors. Minor mistakes in calculating  benefit amounts are not a threat to SNAP integrity and are  understandable, given the volatility in the lives of many low-income  households. If States were encouraged to increase their efforts to  drive SNAP errors in every case to zero, some States experience shows  they likely would respond by requiring more paperwork, which would be  burdensome and inefficient.   Finally, the conference report eliminated SNAP bonus payments to  States out of concern that that they may have contributed to State  practices that introduced bias into the quality control process. The  conferees continue to think that customer service measures, such as  measures of timeliness and program access, are important indicators of  SNAP's success, and we expect FNS to continue to measure and publish  these data for all States and to emphasize their importance in  conducting program oversight. The same is true for enforcing clear  standards. We are concerned that FNS is not following its own guidance  with respect to how it will follow up with states whose timeliness has  fallen below established Federal standards. This is important for the  agency to address.   Another provision involving program integrity involves when States  may follow up with households to seek additional information based on a  data match. The provision identifies the circumstances under which such  follow up is allowed and when it is prohibited. The conferees intend  this provision to codify FNS's recent regulation of January 6, 2017, at  7 C.F.R. 273.12(c)(3). We do not intend for USDA to issue any new  regulation beyond simply the addition of the new National Accuracy  Clearinghouse to the list of matches that might require action.   Another provision in the program integrity area changes how SNAP  benefits are treated when households have not accessed them recently.  The provision allows States to move SNAP benefits ``offline'' after 3  months of inactivity instead of 6 months and requires benefits be  ``expunged'' or completely taken away after 9 months instead of 12  months. Because inactivity in households' SNAP accounts is often the  result of a misunderstanding, the provision requires that households be  notified 30 days before benefits are scheduled to be expunged and offer  an opportunity for the household to request that any benefits that have  been moved offline be swiftly restored. On balance, my expectation is  that this provision will improve households' access to benefits because  households will be better informed.   In our negotiations on the SNAP provisions of the farm bill, the  conferees spent substantial time debating the SNAP employment and  training program and proposals to add requirements in SNAP that would  take food assistance away from households that fail to meet harsh work  requirements. I am proud that this bill does not include the House's  proposals to severely restrict waivers from the existing harsh 3-month  time limit and the House bill's new requirements that would have taken  food assistance away from families with children and older adults who  struggle to find work. This was no accident. The conferees rejected  these proposals. In fact, the Senate resoundingly rejected on a  bipartisan basis an amendment that included many of these harsh  changes. The administration should take note of this and follow  congressional intent and not attempt to advance an inconsistent agenda  through rulemaking that is not supported by the law we just passed.   Rather than harsh new requirements, the conference agreement focused  on helping families get back to work the right way. The conference  agreement will strengthen State flexibility to design employment and  training systems that meet local workforce needs and labor market  conditions. We added workforce partnership arrangements, which could  involve private employers, trade groups that represent such employers,  or nonprofit organizations to the options available to States and  individuals for meeting SNAP employment and training and work  requirements. We also focus additional funding provided in the bill for  employment and training on programs with a proven track record based on  the pilots from the 2014 farm bill and on populations that face  substantial barriers, such as individuals who were incarcerated in the  past, workers age 50 and older, and those at risk of multigenerational  poverty.   In order to help employment and training participants succeed in  their placements, we now expect States to include case management as a  component in all States' employment and training programs. We envision  that States will continue to have wide latitude in what counts as case  management, and we intend that case management be a resource to  employment and training participants, not an extra hoop for  participants to comply with to satisfy their employment and training  obligation. Not every participant will need case management, and not  every component of a State's employment and training program must offer  case management. We also revise the job search component under  employment and training to add a supervision requirement, but  anticipate that States will be creative in developing innovative models  for supervision that are not burdensome on participants, for example,  by using technology to include online job search, or other automated  and remote options. We recognize that States will need time to update  their employment and training plans and build capacity to roll out new  approaches, so we expect FNS will provide adequate time for States to  transition to compliance with the new requirements. I should note that,  while self-initiated job search may no longer be a standalone component  within employment and training, it is not disallowed as a part of  another component. For example, if a job training program offers 12  hours of job training and 8 hours of job search, this should  [[Page S7921]]  still be allowable under this change. The conference report also does  not preclude self-initiated job search that is not specifically managed  within the SNAP employment and training.   The Agriculture Committee has a long history of bipartisan oversight  of SNAP, and every farm bill includes provisions that strengthen SNAP  by taking advantage of new technologies and other advancements in other  areas of the human services field. This farm bill is no exception. For  example, we include provisions to adjust SNAP's electronic benefit  transfer, EBT, program to account for new technologies like mobile and  online payments and to add flexibility for farmers' markets. While we  recognize the need for SNAP to evolve to survive in the modern  marketplace, it is equally important that we continue to maintain  program integrity. The Secretary must maintain the ability to monitor  retailers and ensure they are not engaging in fraudulent activities.  Retailers without a physical storefront may require new approaches to  oversight, and FNS should continue to work with retailers and Congress  to ensure appropriate controls are in place.   EBT is a critical link in the SNAP program for delivering benefits to  eligible families and our retailers, and EBT contractors are important  partners. The Senate-passed farm bill included requirements on USDA and  GAO to conduct broad reviews of SNAP EBT, including transfer-related  fees, equipment issues, data security, and customer service, especially  the unfortunate increased frequency of systems outages. We also  required USDA to issue regulations and guidance on these issues based  on the findings from the studies. Although we were not able to include  these provisions in the final conference agreement, both USDA and GAO  have the authority to engage in these activities without specific  statutory direction, and I urge them to do so.   Child support collections is another area where we determined that  the proper course of action is for the Secretary to obtain more  information. The House included a sweeping provision to require States  to mandate cooperation with child support enforcement as a condition of  SNAP eligibility. While we strongly support custodial and noncustodial  parents financially supporting their children, we rejected the mandate  out of concern that taking away food assistance would do more harm than  good for children and that the mandate would be costly for States and  the Federal Government. Instead, we direct the Secretary to collect  evidence on the impact on families and children and the cost for States  and the Federal Government. We also want information on the experiences  in States that have adopted the mandate, those that rejected it, and on  some of the practical issues such as how States guarantee a robust  determination of good cause for noncompliance. It is key that the  Secretary in carrying out this study collect information on those who  would be dissuaded from participating in SNAP as a result of the  mandate. Research on those who do not receive SNAP as a result of a  policy change can be difficult to obtain, but because our concern about  the provision relates to the impact on children whose parents are  afraid to participate in SNAP because of a fear of domestic violence or  out of other concerns about their relationship with another parent--for  example, when grandparents care for grandchildren--the Secretary must  seek to paint a full picture of the impact such a change would have on  children. We also instruct the Secretary to examine what alternative  options are available in this area that would achieve similar goals but  without putting food assistance for children at risk.   In addition to these critical issues within SNAP, I also want to note  that we made some critical improvements to programs to support  beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers, organic producers and  local food systems, including providing permanent mandatory baseline  funding. This important step will ensure these programs continue to  support the next generation of sustainable farmers. The conference  report also directs Secretary to have the Agriculture Marketing Service  and Rural Business Cooperative Service work together to implement the  Local Agriculture Market Program, using the agencies' respective  structures and expertise to deliver an effective program. One important  aspect of the Local Agriculture Market Program is food safety  assistance, an area where the primary expertise at USDA resides with-in  the Agriculture Marketing Service. I would ask USDA to ensure food  safety components of the Local Agriculture Market Program be  coordinated between the agencies, but be led by Agriculture Marketing  Service, who has the most expertise.   This farm bill was truly historic, both in its broad level of  bipartisan support and also in its steps toward supporting the great  diversity of American agriculture. I also believe it was noteworthy  that we were able to overcome strong partisan attacks on food  assistance to produce a bill in the bipartisan tradition this committee  maintains continues to protect the family safety net in a bipartisan  way. I hope the administration follows our lead and rejects harmful  attacks on food assistance for families needing short term support.                            ____________________
