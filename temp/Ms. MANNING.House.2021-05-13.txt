 Mr. Speaker, I rise in solidarity with our staunch ally,  Israel. For days, Israel has been under attack by Hamas terrorists who  have fired more than 1,700 rockets from Gaza, targeting civilians and  targeting Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Were it not for the Iron Dome missile  defense system, the loss of life would be enormous.   Thousands of Israelis--Jews and Arabs alike--have taken cover in bomb  shelters. I have been in Israel when rockets were fired from Gaza into  Sderot. I know the terror of running for cover with sirens blaring  overhead, not knowing whether I would make it in time. My heart goes  out to the Israeli people.   Yesterday, I attended an IDF briefing. Unlike Hamas, the Israeli  defense forces target the terrorists, their rocket launchers, weapons  stocks, and command centers--not civilians. When a democratic country  is attacked by terrorists, it has the right and indeed the duty to  protect its people.   We must continue to stand with Israel. I pray for peace and all those  who have lost loved ones.                            ____________________
