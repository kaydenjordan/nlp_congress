 Madam Speaker in 2016, my deputy chief of staff, Kate  Jennings, first joined our office. After working with political greats  like then-Senator Barack Obama and Senator Dick Durbin, our team was  lucky that Kate would be bringing her passion and her dedication to our  work.   Over the next 5-plus years, there would not be one day when Kate  didn't put the people who we serve at the very heart of everything she  did. When COVID-19 hit Illinois last year, our office learned of a  family sheltering in a hotel, unable to feed themselves or feed their  children. So in the middle of this spreading pandemic, what did Kate  do? She put herself at risk, went to the grocery, packed a box full of  food, and delivered it to the door at the hotel where this family was  sheltering so the children would not go hungry.   And every year, Kate would take Valentines to our veterans to make  sure that they knew that they were appreciated and that they were  loved. She would travel thousands of miles across our vast  Congressional district, and was unwavering in her hard work for all  14 counties in our district. She never tired and always worked to lift  up the voices of the people that were fortunate enough to be able to  serve.    Madam Speaker, Kate recently began her next chapter, and our entire  team and our office and I wish her well on her new adventure. This  week, as we continue to strive to always deliver for the people, I can  think of no better celebration than to thank the person who spent  nearly 2,000 days in our office putting the people we serve first.   Madam Speaker, I thank Kate for her dedicated service, her hard work,  and her friendship for so many years. Everyone on our team knows that  she will continue to deliver for the people of Illinois.                            ____________________
