 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  continuing resolution to fund our government.   Unfortunately, it breaks my heart that we have not been able to do  our job and reach a consensus on a budget, but we will not be shutting  down our government. The bill ensures that the Federal Government does  not shut down a week before Americans celebrate Thanksgiving with their  families, preventing countless Federal employees from being forced to  work without a paycheck.   For my home State of Michigan, this continuing resolution repeals  section 1438 of the FAST Act, which would rescind over $7 billion in  highway funding from the States. This repeal would protect over $300  million in critical funding for Michigan, which is needed for our  highways.   I am also thrilled that the continuing resolution provides a 3  percent pay increase for our Nation's servicemembers who devote their  lives to protecting our Nation.   While the House and Senate use this additional month to continue  negotiating complete fiscal year funding, I urge the Senate to include  House language that would include increased funding for maternal  mortality, environmental protection, and programs that give women and  families a better chance.                            ____________________
