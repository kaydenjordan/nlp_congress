 Mr. President, Idaho's entrepreneurs are passionate  individuals who consistently innovate and create high-quality products.  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, it is my distinct privilege to recognize Bear  Knuckles as the Small Business of the Month for September 2018. Located  in Blackfoot, ID, Bear Knuckles manufactures gloves with a unique  design that allow for a stronger grip while still protecting the  wearer's hands.   Bear Knuckles' founder, Shawn Schild, is one of three brothers who  own B Bar B in Blackfoot. B Bar B is a family-owned leather shop  founded by Shawn's parents, Bob and Gay Schild. Bob Schild began his  career as a professional rodeo rider in 1954. Throughout his rodeo  career, Bob carried a sewing machine and other tailoring supplies in  his camper to craft his own equipment. He often sold rodeo chaps and  other items that he crafted to make extra income while on the road. Bob  continued his rodeo career until he settled down in Blackfoot with his  wife Gay and founded B Bar B Leather in 1961. He continued to compete  in the rodeo part time to help support the business until 1969. Bob and  Gay passed along this entrepreneurial spirit and the values of hard  work and integrity to their three sons: Jeff, Shawn, and Kelly. After  taking the reins of the business from their parents in 1994, the three  brothers founded B Bar B Wholesale in 1996.   Shawn began designing his own line of gloves over 20 years ago, while  competing in the rodeo like his father had done before him. He wanted  to make a glove that could protect his hands, while providing a better  grip on bucking bulls. After a great deal of experimentation, Shawn  created gloves with curved fingers to better conform to the natural  shape of the hand. This resulted in a glove that allows for a strong  grip, while also reducing grip fatigue. Shawn's patented double wedge  ergonomic design worked so well that it was adopted by several  professional bullriders who still use it to this day.   Shawn saw the potential for this new glove to benefit working men and  women. He began making different types of gloves and approached local  stores and industrial businesses asking them to test his new products.  Several employees at a local natural gas distributor, who tested the  welding gloves, praised Shawn's design and claimed that they no longer  wanted to use any other type of glove. After further tinkering and  experimentation, he received a patent for the design in 2015. Following  the patent, Shawn took the next step and decided to pursue a  manufacturing and distribution agreement with a large glove  manufacturing company. Shawn overcame multiple challenges in the  manufacturing of his glove, which ultimately led him to start his own  small business, Bear Knuckles. Today Shawn's gloves are sold in stores  throughout the area.   The State of Idaho is proud to be home to innovative, hard-working  entrepreneurs like Shawn. The entire B  [[Page S6338]]  Bar B and Bear Knuckles family shows how one innovative idea and a  dedication to hard work can lead to small business success. They  exemplify Idaho's unique entrepreneurial spirit, as well as the  importance of always continuing to press on when difficulties arise. I  would like to congratulate Shawn, the Schild family, and all of the  employees at Bear Knuckles for being named the Small Business of the  Month for September 2018. I look forward to watching your continued  growth and success.                            ____________________
