 Mr. Speaker, while most Americans were  sitting down to dinner and enjoying a relaxing evening with their  families on November 23, a young California Highway Patrol officer by  the name of Andy Ornelas was on duty in the bucolic city of Palmdale.   At 7:05 p.m., a vehicle turned directly into the path of Officer  Ornelas' motorcycle, causing a terrible accident. After a valiant fight  for his life, Andy succumbed to his injuries and passed away 9 days  later on December 2.   I rise today to pay tribute to this precious hero who was taken from  this world too soon.   Men and women like Officer Ornelas make sacrifices and face danger on  a daily basis while we, the average citizens of this beautiful country  and the beneficiaries of their service, remain wrapped in the warmth of  the security blanket which they provide.   While he was alive, we didn't thank Officer Ornelas enough. We didn't  appreciate him enough, and we certainly didn't support him enough.   As a society, we need to remember that these precious guardians of  peace and security that they provide are subjected to dangers that the  average American cannot fathom. While they are alive, we need to honor  our first responders more.   Andy did things right. He did things for the right reason. He worked  hard, he played hard, and he loved his friends and his family with  purity and intensity. We were all blessed to have him on his watch.   My deepest condolences and prayers go out to Andy's family. His mom  and dad, his brother and uncle are all law enforcement officers. His  wife, Taylor, now, more than ever, needs the full support of her  Nation, the support of her State, and the support of her community.   Andy is with God, and, Taylor, we are with you. At all times, we are  at your  [[Page H7052]]  disposal to support you in any way that we can.                      Honoring the Service of Bob Kellar     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to  a good friend who is retiring after nearly six decades of noble and  loyal service to our Nation and to our State of California.   Today, Mr. Bob Kellar is officially retiring from the Santa Clarita  City Council after more than 20 years in that role. During his tenure,  he also served as mayor four times.    Before his time on the city council, Bob Kellar also served our  community as an LAPD officer for 25 years, and before that, he was a  Green Beret in the U.S. Army.   His list of accomplishments and leadership roles in our community is  too long to list here today. In the end, it is his kind character, his  humble comportment, and his playful sense of humor that makes this  patriot and public servant so special.   I want to also thank Bob's wife, Kathy, for making so many sacrifices  in support of our community and country.   Bob, I am proud to call you my friend, and I am honored to know you.  Sir, you are one of the best Americans I have met. Congratulations on  your retirement.            Honoring the Life and Service of General Chuck Yeager     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of an American legend and aviation pioneer, General Chuck Yeager, who  passed away this past Monday, December 7.   Daring to be the first to break the sound barrier over California's  Mojave Desert, General Yeager achieved aviation history in 1947 and  launched the modern jet age. He did what many thought was impossible,  and he did it over the skies of my district.   But his dedication to our Nation and contribution to aeronautical  sciences was greater than this one crowning achievement. He served in  World War II as a fighter ace, shooting down 13 German planes--5 in one  day.   In 1953, he set a world speed record by flying at nearly 2\1/2\ times  the speed of sound.   From commanding the school training astronauts at Edwards Air Force  Base, to flying 127 missions as commander of a fighter wing in Vietnam,  to testing a Russian MiG-15 obtained from a defector, Chuck Yeager's  service to country and advancement of aviation never stopped throughout  his lifetime.   These accomplishments might have seemed unlikely in the beginning.  Possessing only a high school degree and becoming sick riding in his  first military flight as a passenger, he might have seemed an unlikely  milestone maker in military aviation. But, as he said in his memoir:  ``All I know is I worked my tail off learning to learn how to fly, and  worked hard at it all the way.''   As a fighter pilot myself, this is difficult for me to say, but Chuck  Yeager was truly the best fighter pilot this world has seen. Hard work,  determination, bravery, and service made Chuck Yeager a role model and  a uniquely American hero.   May God bless Chuck Yaeger, his family, and the Nation that he  served, and I hope Chuck is up there in Heaven setting more records.                            ____________________
