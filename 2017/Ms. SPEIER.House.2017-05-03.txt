 Mr. Speaker, in advance of the 20th annual Letter  Carriers' Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive next Saturday, let us recognize  the unsung heroes within our communities: our letter carriers.   Take David Crestik from San Diego, who carried an injured elderly  woman out of a burning mobile home, called 911, and then finished his  route; or Shawn Kang from Stockton, who rescued a person trapped  underneath his car.   On May 13, letter carriers will stock struggling food pantries across  our country through the Stamp Out Hunger Food Drive. Last year, they  collected over 80 million pounds of nonperishable canned goods, a  record. Let's remember, one in six Americans don't know where their  next meal is coming from. So let's honor and recognize the tremendous  leadership, compassion, and dedication of our letter carriers. They  serve our communities and they are a vital part of them.                            ____________________
