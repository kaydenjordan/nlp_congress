 Madam Speaker, 1 year ago, on July 23, the Carr fire  broke out in Shasta County, California, near Reading, sometimes  referred to as a ``firenado'' that burned nearly 230,000 acres and  destroyed 1,600 structures. Most tragically of all, it took eight  lives.   It took over a month to fully extinguish what became one of the most  destructive fires in California State history. For those impacted by  it, it must have felt like the blink of an eye. Everything they owned  went up in smoke.   Now, a year later, everyone is still working the recovery process as  best as can be done. It is still not easy.   In the aftermath of this disaster, and even during it, our community  showed just how strong and resilient our people are. Families, friends,  and neighbors came together to help each other in any possible way,  with water, food, clothes, everything they needed, and they have  continued to do so for the whole year.   Some of the first homes are now being completed as people are moving  forward, a good sign.   Preventing another fire like this is one of my top priorities. The  Carr fire was started when a flat tire caused a wheel to scrape against  the asphalt and create a spark in the nearby forested area; so I have  introduced legislation called the CARR Act, Combustion Avoidance on  Rural Roads Act, which helps avoid this sort of combustion on rural  roads by allowing categorical exclusions to clear vegetation within 300  feet of a roadway.   We have got much to do, and for people who lost everything, this is  prevention that will help keep it from happening again.                            ____________________
