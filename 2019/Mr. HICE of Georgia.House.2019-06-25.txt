 Madam Speaker, we have been hearing for quite  some time Democrats saying that the President and Republicans have not  been coming to the table on this issue. What nonsense.   For months, we have watched Democrats absolutely deny that there is a  crisis. Actually, I have, on my desk, a list of page after page after  page of quotes from my colleagues who are denying a crisis at the  border.   Not only have Republicans for nearly 40 years been ringing the alarm  on this issue, but we have been highlighting caravan after caravan  after caravan coming to our southern border.   In May, we had 144,000 apprehended, nearly 700,000 to date, and that  number is expected to go well over a million.   Do we have a humanitarian crisis at the border? Yes. Do we have a  border security crisis? Yes.   But this bill does not even adequately fund ICE. It does not pay  overtime for border personnel.    Madam Speaker, it does not have any means to  investigate human traffickers. It lacks funding for the Department of  Justice immigration courts. It ties the hands of the President to take  action on securing our borders.   Madam Speaker, it is time for Democrats to come to the table. Let's  address this issue the way it ought to be addressed.                                time  2045
