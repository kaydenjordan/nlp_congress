 Madam Speaker, right now, the United States continues to  support Saudi Arabia's genocidal war in Yemen. This support has been  ongoing since 2015 yet has never been authorized by Congress. It must  end now.   U.S. support for this war has resulted in dire consequences. Just  last week, the Saudi coalition bombed a hospital. They have bombed  school buses, weddings, markets, funerals--tens of thousands of Yemen  civilians killed. Millions more are in dire need of humanitarian aid,  starving and sick, without access to food and water or basic medicine.  This has created the worst humanitarian disaster in the world.   We are voting later today on an important resolution to finally end  U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. We need to put politics  aside. Lives are at stake. We cannot afford to delay.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to recognize the urgency with  which we must act, to vote against any attempts to delay or block this  resolution, and to vote to pass S.J. Res. 7 today.                            ____________________
