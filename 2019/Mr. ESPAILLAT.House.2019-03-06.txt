 Madam Speaker, the Dominican Republic lost one of its  brightest stars this week, with the passing of singer and composer  Froilan Antonio Jimenez, known in the artistic world as Anthony Rios.   Rios' ascent was rapid due to his remarkable work ethic,  perseverance, and an undeniable God-given talent. Even as a child, Rios  demonstrated a unique ability to intertwine music into his life.   As a young shoeshine boy in the city of Hato Mayor del Rey, Rios  would serenade his customers. During Christmas season, he sang  Christmas carols door to door. The world and the Dominican Republic  have lost a true talent.   May he rest in peace and may God comfort his friends, family, and all  those who knew and loved him dearly. He will be missed. ``Rest in  peace,'' ``De descanse en paz,'' Anthony Rios.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, as the whip of the Congressional  Hispanic Caucus, I am pleased to lead our second monthly Special Order  hour.   Last month, my colleagues and I spoke about the importance of  comprehensive immigration reform. Since then, the Congressional  Hispanic Caucus Immigration Task Force, led by Congresswoman Linda  Sanchez of California, drafted a set of immigration principles, which  our caucus has now adopted. We plan to use these as a guide as we work  on developing a comprehensive immigration reform proposal. Chief among  these principles is a timely path to citizenship for Dreamers and a  permanent solution for those with temporary protected status and  deferred and forced departure.   Democrats made an important commitment to these communities. After a  failed attempt at a bipartisan solution for Dreamers and TPS recipients  last year, and again a few weeks ago, we said that if we regained  control of the House, we would move quickly to fix this. Democrats have  spent the last few weeks working just on that.   In particular, two of our CHC colleagues, Congresswoman Lucille  Roybal-Allard and Congresswoman Nydia Velazquez, along with  Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, have been putting together a proposal that  will provide overdue needed relief. Their Dream and Promise Act, H.R.  6, will be introduced next week. We are also grateful for the time and  effort they have put into this critical legislation.   That is why we wanted to take this month's CHC's Special Order to  focus on Dreamers and TPS recipients. These are unique groups within  our broader immigration community and their current plight--the  uncertainty of their status--is entirely the fault of President Donald  Trump and actions he took against them.   For Dreamers, the American people have heard us talk about them for  many years, but I think it serves reminding just who those folks are.  Dreamers are mostly young adults whose parents brought them to this  country when they were minors. They do not have legal immigration  status in the United States. They are undocumented, just like I was  once. They came here through no fault of their own. For the vast  majority of them, the United States of America is the only country they  have ever known. A good number of them grew up not even knowing they  were in immigration limbo and at risk of being deported.   Some only found out when they applied to college. Just think about  that, Madam Speaker. You are a young high school student with your  whole life ahead of you. You have dreams and aspirations for future  careers and you are excited to take on a new chapter of your life. Then  one day you find out that you are one of those undocumented folks you  have been hearing about. There is now a barrier to your ability to get  a higher education, to get a good job, to establish yourself in our  society.   President Obama recognized this injustice and he created a program  that would give Dreamers relief from deportation, known as the Deferred  Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. This gave them some sense of  certainty, and, most importantly, it gave them the legal status they  needed to pursue an education and career, to buy a home, and begin  raising a family.   Nearly 800,000 individuals across the country receive DACA, and  thousands more were still eligible. But President Trump abruptly chose  to end the program as part of his anti-immigrant policies. Not only is  this cruel and unjust, it is economic malpractice.    According to the Center for American Progress, ending DACA will cost  our GDP $460 billion. Let me say that again, Madam Speaker. Ending DACA  will cost our GDP $460 billion. That is because it will mean removing  685,000 workers out of the workforce.   If President Trump wants to promote economic growth, as he says, then  why would he make such a horrible decision? I leave it up to the  American people to sort out that mystery. Perhaps they can do it at the  ballot box in a couple of years.   TPS recipients. Now, what is worse, Madam Speaker, is that Dreamers  aren't the only group President Trump has decided to throw into legal  limbo.  [[Page H2499]]  Over the course of his 2 years in office, the President has ended also  temporary protected status. I know you know that very well, Madam  Speaker, because you represent the State of Florida.   For thousands of individuals, the temporary protected status has been  attempted to end. TPS is an incredibly important program. It allows  individuals to stay and remain in the United States for an extended  period of time if some emergency erupts in their home country that  prevents them from being able to return. TPS has been using cases of  severe natural disasters, as well as armed conflict.   Only a few countries have been granted TPS. The program is so  important because it allows these people, who would otherwise be in  limbo for an unknown amount of time, to live their lives here in the  United States, giving them the ability to work and establish  themselves. Some countries have been designated under TPS for many,  many years and are still not safe for individuals to return back home.   That is why it has been routinely extended by Presidents of both  parties. This is not a Republican or a Democratic program. Presidents  of both parties have extended TPS.   TPS holders are established members of our communities. They are  workers, they are homeowners, they are our neighbors and they have  children and families that have built their lives here. They deserve to  stay, Madam Speaker.   And the truth is our economy really needs them. More than 300,000  individuals are currently beneficiaries of TPS, but they account for  more than $10 billion in spending power in our economy according to  CAP. They pay local, State, and Federal taxes. Once more, so many TPS  holders are the parents or relatives of thousands of U.S. citizen  children, children who deserve to have their families stay together.   In conclusion, Madam Speaker, families belong together. Whether they  are separated at our border, whether they came here with a young child  who only recently learned he or she was undocumented, whether they  cannot return to a nation that is not able to receive them, they  deserve to stay together, and they deserve to remain here in the United  States, the place they now call home.   During the rest of this hour, you will hear from a number of CHC  colleagues from across the country about how important Dreamers and TPS  recipients are to their respective districts, how these hardworking  individuals are part of the very fabric of communities they represent.  I look forward to hearing from them and sharing their stories with you,  Madam Speaker.   Madam Speaker, I yield to my colleague from the State of Illinois  (Mr. Garcia) whose State is home to nearly 3,000 TPS holders and more  than 42,000 DACA recipients. The GDP law, if DACA were to be removed,  is $413 million, and TPS spending power in that State is $91.7 million.    Madam Speaker, let me just share some numbers with you  from respective States across the country.   The number of TPS holders, for example, in the State of California,  over 50,000 of them; in your home State of Florida, Madam Speaker, over  44,000 of them; in Illinois, close to 3,000 of them; in Massachusetts,  over 5,000 of them; in New Mexico, no data, but fewer than 1,500; in  New York, over 25,000 of them; in Texas, over 46,000 of them.   And the children living with these TPS recipients are, in California,  over 43,000; in Florida, again, over 37,000; in Massachusetts, over  3,000; in New York, over 23,000; and in Texas, 49,000 children are  living with TPS recipients.   DACA recipients are also in large numbers. In the State of  California, you have close to 223,000 DACA recipients; in Florida,  close to 33,000 recipients; in Illinois, Madam Speaker, you have close  to 43,000 DACA recipients; in New York, 41,000.   So these are huge numbers for people who are so important to the  fabric of our country, and that is why we are here to support them,  because families that stay together are stronger together. When a  family is divided, our Nation is weaker; when our family is together,  our Nation is stronger.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Florida (Ms. Mucarsel- Powell), whose State is the home State to 45,000 TPS recipients and  nearly 33,000 DACA recipients    Mr. Speaker, as has been said here tonight, bringing  relief, permanent relief to DACA recipients and TPS beneficiaries must  not be delayed. Comprehensive immigration reform cannot continue to be  delayed.   That is why I am so happy, as I mentioned earlier, that in a week or  two, H.R. 6, the Dream and Promise Act, which promises to bring about  comprehensive immigration reform in many ways for DACA recipients and  TPS recipients and other immigrants, will hit this floor.   We are hoping that all our colleagues from both sides of the aisle  will recognize that this is an important effort to finally bring over  800,000 young people permanently to the United States, young people who  are teachers, nurses, police offers, members of our Armed Forces. They  are business owners. They purchase their own homes, in many cases.  These are important members of our communities across the country, and  we must allow them to stay in the United States of America.    TPS recipients, many of them cannot return back to dangerous settings  in their homeland. Many of them, their countries are reeling from  natural disasters. It would be a travesty if we send them back home.  They must be allowed to stay here in the United States of America. This  is an important moment in our time.   Families that stay together are stronger; families that are divided  are weaker. Our country is made stronger when a family is together.  That is why I am asking all in this Chamber from both sides of the  aisle, next week, to support H.R. 6, the Dream and Promise Act, which  will finally bring relief to many, many young people and undocumented  people from this Nation, as well as TPS recipients will finally breathe  some fresh air and be able to stay here in this great Nation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
