 Madam Speaker, 4 years ago yesterday,  Republicans were tragically attacked by a liberal gunman with an agenda  to shoot and kill Republican Members of Congress.   That day, United States Capitol Police Officers Griner and Bailey,  along with Alexandria police, acted swiftly to neutralize the gunman  and prevent what could have been an extraordinarily deadly event that  changed the course of our country.   I stand here today because of their heroism, and I, along with my  Republican colleagues present that morning, are forever grateful.   We must always support our men and women in blue and oppose any  efforts to defund the police and make communities less safe.   Law enforcement officers go to work in their communities every day to  make a difference, protect their neighbors, and prevent crime, a solemn  duty we should commend and not tear down.   We will forever owe a debt of gratitude to the officers present 4  years ago and are grateful for every brave and honorable law  enforcement officer who is willing to sacrifice themselves to keep us  safe.   In God we trust.                            ____________________
