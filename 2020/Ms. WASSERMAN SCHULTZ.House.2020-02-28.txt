 Madam Speaker, today we finally  comprehensively address America's resurgent youth nicotine epidemic.   In 2019 more than 5.3 million middle and high school students used e- cigarettes, double the number who reported vaping just 2 years before.  It is no surprise when flavors like gummy bear and cotton candy are  used to lure children to e-cigarettes. And the aggressive digital  marketing aimed at minors, like the campaigns Juul admitted to running,  obviously work.  [[Page H1269]]    But this Republican administration failed to holistically address  this issue. Worse, they caved to Big Tobacco by embracing a woefully  inadequate flavor ban. So this bill does just what this administration  refused to; it bans flavors and proactively combats this epidemic.   I am grateful to Chairman Pallone for including language from my  legislation, the PROTECT Act, that directs the CDC to implement a  successful--like the anti-tobacco youth campaign was--youth anti-vaping  education and prevention campaign. That is vital because if a child  never starts vaping, we keep them off this perilous path to nicotine  addiction.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill to stand up to Big  Tobacco and to protect the health of young people.
