 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to offer this amendment with  Dr. Michael Burgess, also a member of the House Rules Committee, and  also a gentleman from my home State of Texas.   The goal of our amendment is to strengthen the underlying legislation  by clarifying the point at which the statute of limitations begins to  run.   In Texas, the statute of limitations begins to run from the date the  alleged negligence occurs or date of last treatment. This is a certain  date that does not leave room for controversy. I believe aligning the  underlying text with this approach will benefit both physicians and  patients to clarify exactly where harm might occur.   My amendment clarifies that when the date of the breach or tort is  known, the statute runs from that date. When the date of the breach or  tort is not known, the statute runs from the last date of treatment. By  this method, certainty is provided to defendant, plaintiff, and the  court. Easy understanding. For example, if there is a surgical mishap,  the statute would run from that date. On the other hand, if the injury  is from the prescription medication over a long period of time, it  would run from the date of last treatment.   I am pleased that the Texas Medical Association, the Texas Alliance  for Patient Access, the Health Coalition of Liability and Access, as  well as the National Physicians' Council for Healthcare Policy support  this process and this amendment. I hope my colleagues on both sides of  the aisle will support this commonsense, reasonable reform that comes  to us today in an amendment.   I thank Chairman Bob Goodlatte from Virginia and his awesome staff  for their work to make sure this amendment and the underlying  legislation conform with their ideas consistent with the legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, perhaps the debate that the gentleman  from Iowa (Mr. King) had was completely clear, which I would disagree  with that statement. The gentleman from Iowa stated very clearly that  there are surgeries, there are procedures, and there are processes that  cost the Federal Government hundreds of millions, and the gentleman  even went into the billions of dollars, which are parts of practices of  medicine that doctors do as a defensive part of medicine to avoid  exactly what we are talking about: getting sued. It is costing the  Federal Government an enormous amount of money.   The gentleman did refer to two Members of Congress from Texas. We  will see how they vote.   But the clarifying amendments that we are offering now, amendment No.  1 and amendment No. 2, come directly from negotiations with and  understanding with the Texas Medical Association and the National  Physicians' Policy Council to ensure that, in fact, the compliance is  made that people not only in Texas, but also in other States, would  have that would offer a physician the ability for them to use their  knowledge, their training, and their expertise as opposed to practicing  defensive medicine that harms every single taxpayer. That is why we are  offering this today.   I am delighted. I believe what we have done is right.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Iowa (Mr. King).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I believe the gentleman, Mr. King, has  argued the point very successfully, and that is we believe it is in the  best interests of not only the taxpayers, but physicians, physicians  who have used their training, their expertise, and their knowledge to  perform the necessary missions that are necessary. When those  physicians do make mistakes--and mistakes will happen--then we believe  that the rights of those that are reported in California and Texas  would be consistent with those that would be great for the country. We  are willing to share, and we appreciate the opportunity to present  this.   Mr. Chairman, I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment  that I have presented today, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk as the  designee of the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).    Mr. Chairman, I offer my thanks not only to Chairman  Bob Goodlatte, but also the distinguished gentleman from Iowa (Mr.  King) for his work on behalf of all Members on the floor today, for his  work not only for the Judiciary Committee, but people of faith and  confidence that this country can address the issues and needs.   Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment with Dr. Michael Burgess, who is  also from my home State of Texas as well as a member of the Rules  Committee.   The goal of our amendment is to clarify that healthcare liability  claims covered by the legislation include safety, professional, and  administrative services directly related to healthcare. In other words,  we are bringing in the entire scope, not just necessarily the medical  procedure.   I was glad to see that H.R. 1215 adopts many of the reforms that  States across this country have thoroughly tested in their efforts to  improve medical liability law, including my home State of Texas.   Not all claims asserted against healthcare providers arise from the  direct provision of medical care. My amendment addresses the full  spectrum of healthcare claims by following the model that Texas has  successfully implemented.   Common examples of administrative claims related to healthcare are  cases for negligence involving credentialing fraud against hospitals  and those serving on their professional committees. In these cases, the  plaintiff typically is not a patient of the physician serving on the  committee; however, there is significant exposure to liability for the  physician.   Safety claims are another necessary component in the scope of this  bill. In these cases, a patient's injury does not arise out of the  rendition of healthcare, but pertains to the safety of the patient.   The Texas Medical Association, the Texas Alliance for Patient Access,  and the National Physicians' Policy Council are among those  organizations who not only support this narrowly tailored amendment,  but also their support of the entire bill and the inclusions of this  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, the gentleman I respect very much, not only the  perspective that the gentleman holds, but perhaps some of his argument  could be true.   Mr. Chairman, what we are trying to do is to balance out the  opportunity for the American people to have access to healthcare where,  many items, they are denied.   I was reminded by the gentleman, the young chairman of the Veterans'  Affairs Committee, Dr. Phil Roe, who served his great State of  Tennessee and the American people as an obstetrician and gynecologist,  I was reminded of the facts of the case, as it were, where, when Texas  passed this, counties all along our Texas borders received, instead of  midwives and others who might perform these important services to  deliver babies, all of a sudden medical professionals, doctors, came  into play who had been shut out because of the fear of malpractice  lawsuits against them. Texas added, in the first year, some 4,500  doctors who came to Texas knowing that it was a level playing field.   In this case, Mr. Chairman, we are arguing that the United States of  America and the citizens would not have to pay outrageous amounts of  money for defensive medicine, whereby physicians, in order to protect  themselves and to protect themselves in a difficult circumstance, might  order, as a defensive mechanism, excessive amounts of either X-rays or  other procedures that really cost the government money instead of  providing better healthcare.                                time  1545    This has been an advantage in the State of California, and in the  State of Texas, where physicians use not only their training and their  professional conduct, but they use what is in the best interest of the  patient. That is why we are here today.   Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from  Iowa (Mr. King).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
