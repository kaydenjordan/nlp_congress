 Mr. President, I just wanted to add my congratulations  to my friend and colleague Senator Murray for casting her 10,000th  vote. She has been such a remarkable leader, a steady force, a hard  worker, and it has been wonderful to work in partnership with her on  the Appropriations Committee.   Patty, congratulations, and we look forward to many more  extraordinary accomplishments.
