 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 8294, the  National Apprenticeship Act of 2020.   We are in the midst of our country's worst economic crisis in  decades, and to better serve the American people, we must invest in our  workforce and invest in the American Dream.   Registered apprenticeships prepare people for the jobs of the 21st  century, and with the evolution of technologies like 5G, Congress and  the Department of Labor should be laser focused on encouraging and  incentivizing apprenticeships for advanced wireless deployment. By  supporting these programs, we can ensure that Georgia remains the best  State in the country to live and to do business.   For decades, the registered apprenticeship program has proven to be  an entry into the middle class for many people. Congresswoman Davis'  National Apprenticeship Act would support a successful workforce  program at a time when our Nation needs it the most.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  [[Page H5976]]                                     time  1615
