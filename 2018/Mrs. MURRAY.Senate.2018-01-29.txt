 Mr. President, today in communities across our country,  young people are asking whether they will be able to stay in the only  country they have ever called home. Struggling patients and veterans  are wondering whether their local community health center will be able  to stay open and provide the care that they can't otherwise afford.  Workers and business owners are wondering--again--whether the  government will even be open in a week or two.   Instead of addressing the serious and pressing challenges that people  are facing, Republican leaders today are debating whether to trust  women to make their own healthcare choices. That is right. While this  country is waiting for us to come together and solve problems,  Republicans are wasting precious time with a politically motivated,  partisan bill that is engineered to drive us apart and hurt women.   I have come here today to oppose, in the strongest terms, the  extreme, ideological abortion ban that Republican leaders have brought  to the floor today. It goes against the Constitution, against medical  experts, and against the rights of women across the country. However, I  don't merely oppose this partisan bill. I oppose the very fact  Republicans are once again bringing this bill--which they know is a  nonstarter--to the floor.   I oppose the very idea that in the 21st century, we are going to  waste time on a question that has already been answered and shouldn't  even be up for debate. I oppose the fact that we are still voting on  whether women and doctors are best equipped to make healthcare  decisions--or politicians here in Washington, DC. We are still voting  on whether we should criminalize doctors for making sound medical  decisions. We are still voting on whether we should turn back the clock  and put women's lives at risk.   Roe v. Wade was decided 45 years ago. We celebrated the anniversary  of that historic decision last week. I would like to think that after  almost half a century, we could move on from debating this settled  issue. Yet here we are.   In 2015, the Republican leaders stated quite flatly that a vote to  defund Planned Parenthood would be an exercise in futility because  there was no way it was going to pass. The same is true of this  extreme, harmful legislation. Yet here we are.   Bringing this bill to the floor is an exercise in futility, and  passing it would be an exercise in cruelty. Just look at the story from  a Washington State mother, Judy Nicastro. A few years ago, she wrote an  op-ed in the New York Times, and she courageously shared a story that  is every expecting woman's worst nightmare. Judy shared her experience  of learning that one of the twins she was carrying had a lung  condition. One lung chamber had not formed at all, and the other was  only 20 percent complete. She wrote:         My world stopped. I loved being pregnant with twins. . . .       The thought of losing one child was unbearable.    She went on to say:         The MRI at Seattle Children's Hospital confirmed our fears:       the organs were pushed up into our boy's chest and not       developing properly. We were in the 22nd week.    I am grateful her doctors were able to give her sound medical advice.  I am grateful that she and her husband were able to make the decision  they felt was best for their own family. And I am so grateful to Judy  for sharing her story, which represents the incredibly painful decision  she and so many other women have faced.   My colleagues might recognize that story. I have shared it before,  just as Republicans have introduced this deeply harmful legislation  before. I hope this time the Republicans listen. I hope they will stop  trying to pretend they are in any way qualified to interfere with  decisions that a woman has the  [[Page S533]]  constitutional right to make on her own. I hope they will stop trying  to criminalize a doctor's ability to provide sound medical advice and  protect the lives of patients. I hope they will stop wasting our time  with bills that are so out of date, extremely out of touch, and  obviously unconstitutional.   But if Republicans will not stop this exercise in futility and their  attacks on women's rights, they should know that I will not stop  standing up and making clear exactly why they are wrong. They should  know I am going to keep fighting for Judy and so many other women and  their families, and I will keep urging them to work with Democrats on  the serious challenges that face our Nation--none of which, by the way,  have to do with trusting women or controlling their healthcare choices.   I do want to thank the many Democrats who will be joining me here on  the floor to stand up for women and deliver this same message to our  Republican colleagues. Again, I hope they listen because Democrats  would like to get to work.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.
