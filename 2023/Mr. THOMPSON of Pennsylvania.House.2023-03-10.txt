 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate Carl and Betsy Long of Coudersport, Pennsylvania, in  Potter County for receiving the 2023 National Outstanding Young Farmers  award. The National Outstanding Young Farmers award recognizes that:  ``Today's farmer has become an active citizen, participating in  everything from local and State government to civic groups and  charitable organizations.''   Beginning in 2007, the Longs began farming sweet corn on rented land  in central Pennsylvania. With hard work, dedication, and help from  their three children, the Longs have built a successful farm for green  beans, wheat, oats, and potatoes across several thousand acres.   Though the Long Farm is just 15 years old, it now cultivates 10  million pounds of chipping potatoes each year, helping to supply 11 of  Pennsylvania's renowned snack companies.   The Longs' love for agriculture extends beyond their family farm.  Carl and Betsy are active on several agricultural advisory boards in  Pennsylvania and participate in Ag Literacy Week and Farm Fridays in  local schools.   The Long family is a model for hardworking Americans with a love for  agriculture and community. I commend them on this outstanding  achievement.                            ____________________
