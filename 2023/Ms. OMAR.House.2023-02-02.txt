 Madam Speaker, this debate today is about who gets to be an  American. What opinions do we have to have to be counted as Americans?   This is what this debate is about, Madam Speaker.   There is this idea that you are suspect if you are an immigrant or if  you are from certain parts of the world or a certain skin tone or a  Muslim.   It is no accident that members of the Republican Party accused the  first Black President, Barack Obama, of being a secret Muslim. It is no  accident that former President Donald Trump led a birther movement that  falsely claimed he was born in Kenya because, to them, falsely labeling  the first and only Black President of the United States of America a  Muslim and an African immigrant somehow made him less American.   Well, I am Muslim. I am an immigrant and, interestingly, from Africa.  Is anyone surprised that I am being targeted? Is anyone surprised that  I am somehow deemed unworthy to speak about American foreign policy, or  that they see me as a powerful voice that needs to be silenced?   Frankly, it is expected because when you push power, power pushes  back.   Representation matters. Continuing to expand our ideas of who is  American and who can partake in the American experiment is a good  thing.   I am an American, an American who was sent here by her constituents  to represent them in Congress, a refugee who survived the horrors of a  civil war, someone who spent her childhood in a refugee camp. I am  someone who knows what it means to have a shot at a better life here in  the United States. I am someone who believes in the American Dream, the  American possibility, and the promise and the ability to participate in  the democratic process.   That is what this debate is about.   There is an idea out there that I do not have objective  decisionmaking because of who I am, where I come from, and my  perspective, but I reject that.   We say there is nothing objective about policymaking. We all inject  our perspectives, our points of view, our lived experiences, and the  voices of our constituents. That is what democracy is about.   What is the work of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Madam Speaker? It  is not to cosign the stated foreign policy of whatever administration  is in power. It is about oversight. It is to critique and to advocate  for a better path forward. Most importantly, it is to make the myth  that American foreign policy is intrinsically moral, a reality.   I will continue to speak up because representation matters. I will  continue to speak up for little kids who wonder who is speaking up for  them. I will continue to speak up for families around the world who are  seeking justice whether they are displaced in refugee camps or hiding  under their beds somewhere, as I was, waiting for the bullets to stop  because this child survivor of war would have wanted that.   The 9-year-old me would be disappointed if I didn't talk about the  victims of conflict on behalf of those who are experiencing unjust  wars, atrocities, ethnic cleansing, occupation, or displacement, as I  did.                                time  1200    They are looking to the international community and the United  States, asking for help. They look to us because the international  community and the United States profess the values of protecting human  rights and upholding international law. We owe it to them not to make  this a myth but a reality.   I didn't come to Congress to be silent. I came to Congress to be  their voice, and my leadership and voice will not be diminished if I am  not on this committee for one term. My voice will get louder and  stronger, and my leadership will be celebrated around the world, as it  has been.   So take your vote or not, I am here to stay, and I am here to be a  voice against the harms around the world and advocate for a better  world.
