 Mr. Speaker, in just a few years we have  had a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, a worldwide energy crisis, and as a  result, the fastest inflation in 40 years.   The cost of living is too high, and the financial strain on American  families is real.   Americans just needed help; so last Congress, Democrats took action:   The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is creating 600,000 good- paying union jobs next year alone, with many more to follow.   The Chips and Science Act is bringing manufacturing back to the  United States.   The Inflation Reduction Act is reducing the deficit and lowering  household costs from energy to prescription drugs.   While we acted, Republicans parroted misleading talking points,  falsely claiming that this legislation somehow hurts Americans.   Instead, America sees progress. Annual inflation fell to its lowest  in more than 2\1/2\ years. Gas prices have declined nearly 40 percent.  The IRS collected $122 million from wealthy tax evaders.    As we end this year better than we started, I urge House Republicans  to reject the politics of disinformation and tearing down. Instead,  join us and build this strong economy.                            ____________________
