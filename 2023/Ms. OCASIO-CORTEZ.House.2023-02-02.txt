 Madam Speaker, as a fellow New Yorker, I think one  of the things that we should talk about here is also one of the  disgusting legacies after 9/11, which has been the targeting and racism  against Muslim-Americans throughout the United States of America. This  is an extension of that legacy.   Consistency? There is nothing consistent with the Republican Party's  continued attack, except for the racism and incitement of violence  against women of color in this body.   I had a Member of the Republican Caucus threaten my life, and the  Republican Caucus rewarded him with one of the most prestigious  committee assignments in this Congress. Don't tell me this is about  consistency.   Don't tell me that this is about a condemnation of anti-Semitic  remarks when you have a Member of the Republican Caucus who has talked  about Jewish space lasers and an entire amount of tropes, and also  elevated her to some of the highest committee assignments in this body.   This is about targeting women of color in the United States of  America. Don't tell me--because I didn't get a single apology when my  life was threatened.
