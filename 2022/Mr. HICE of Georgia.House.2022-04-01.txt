 Mr. Speaker, I rise in objection to Judge  Ketanji Brown Jackson's appointment to the Supreme Court. She is an  activist, not a constitutionalist.   Repeatedly, she has reduced sentences for convicted child sex  torturers and pornographers. One example, for an individual who  deserved 10 years, she gave only 3 months of a sentence.   She was in favor of an extended buffer zone around abortion clinics  in Massachusetts, which is a blatant attempt to limit the free speech  rights of peaceful protesters who stand for life.   In her confirmation hearings, she would not even define the word  ``woman,'' which is an indication of potential future attacks on  religious liberties, among other things.   Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson would ensure a radical leftwing agenda on  the Supreme Court for decades to come.   America deserves better. America deserves a constitutional Justice on  the Supreme Court.   I urge my Senators from Georgia and other Senators to vote ``no'' on  her confirmation.                            ____________________
