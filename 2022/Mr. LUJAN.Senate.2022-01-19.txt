 Mr. President, I want to start by thanking all the  Senators who have come to the floor to make the case for democracy and  for voting rights. The right to vote is the heartbeat of our democracy.  It is a symbol of the progress that we have made in this Chamber and  the promise that we have made to the next generation of Americans.   This legislation will protect the right to vote for all, safeguard  against election sabotage, end partisan gerrymandering, and limit the  influence of dark money in politics so that billionaires and  corporations cannot buy elections. Protecting our democracy should not  be partisan; it should be a moral and civic imperative for every one of  us.   As a former U.S. Senator from New Mexico, the late Dennis Chavez, who  served in this Chamber for 27 years until his passing in 1962, said:         Either we are all free, or we fail; democracy belongs to       all of us.    Our democracy faces clear and present dangers posed by Republican-led  State legislatures across the country. Some lawmakers want to curtail  the right to vote--not for all Americans but for the most vulnerable  and historically disenfranchised. And if we think it is bad now with  what has happened in these State legislatures over these last few  months, it is about to get a lot worse.   History will not look kindly on inaction at this critical moment, and  we must show the American people that we will not flinch when faced  with a choice to protect our democracy and let it crumble before our  eyes.   There is a pattern of rampant discrimination that is disenfranchising  countless Black and Brown voters across this country.   In 2005, Jesus Gonzalez became a naturalized citizen. On the same day  he swore an oath to the United States, he sought to register to vote in  Arizona. He was rejected, so he tried again after he obtained a  license, but again he was rejected. It was then that Mr. Gonzalez, a  school janitor, sued the State. His case made its way to the Supreme  Court, which in 2013 ruled in his favor and struck down Arizona's law.  Mr. Gonzalez was 1 of 31,000 voters in Arizona affected by such a  discriminatory law.    Just this past September, the Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund  joined other civil rights organizations in suing Texas over its  discriminatory voting legislation known as S.B. 1. We have heard a lot  about it today. Among other things, S.B. 1 seeks to curb the assistance  available to limited English-proficient voters.   In 2006, MALDEF successfully sued Texas after the State legislature  sought to dilute the Latino vote. In that case, LULAC v. Perry, the  Supreme Court found that Texas violated the Voting Rights Act by  denying Latinos the ability to elect a candidate of their choosing.   In 2017, MALDEF again sued Texas after the city of Pasadena sought to  weaken the Latino vote by changing the way the city elected city  council members.   These are just some of the chapters of a long history of voter  suppression.   We also know that voter suppression of Native Americans is real, and  it is intentional.   Until 2020, North Dakota voter ID laws required a residential street  address. Now, that may sound like common sense to some folks, but for  those of us who live in rural communities and for my brothers and  sisters who live in Native American communities, we all grew up with  rural route boxes. My address growing up was Route 1, Box 102, not  because I didn't want a street address named after my grandparents like  it is today; that was the address.   Because of that law in North Dakota, many Native Americans, like  Richard Brakebill, who is a Navy veteran, have been denied the right to  vote because of an expired driver's license and a Tribal ID that--get  this--did not have a current residential address. It had the post  office box that was his address.   In 2020, the candidacy of Joseph Dedman for county sheriff--a member  of the Navajo Nation--was challenged in Arizona because he included  post office boxes, which are often the only form of address for rural  Native American households--it is the only one they can obtain--on his  petition for office.   In 2020, Arizona's Pima County closed the early voting center on  Pascua Yaqui lands and spent nearly $200,000 in legal fees rather than  reinstate the voting center.   South Dakota provided a fully funded polling place and early voting  and registration opportunities to the 12 non-Native American residents  in Gann Valley, but--get this--they refused to provide the same  services to the 1,200-plus residents in Fort Thompson on Crow Creek  Tribal lands.   In 2021, Kimberly Dillon, a citizen of Rosebud Sioux Tribe, joined  the Oglala and Rosebud Sioux Tribes in suing South Dakota for requiring  voters to register at State agencies and DMVs, which were hours away  from Tribal lands. They were making it harder for people to register to  vote by saying: Drive 3 or 4 hours away. Those are tough roads to drive  on.   Many Native Americans like Kimberly went to great lengths to submit  their voter registration applications to those State agencies, but the  agencies never sent them to the local election offices even after they  traversed and got the job done in making that journey. They just want  to submit them to let them get registered to vote. As a result, her  right to vote in the 2020 Presidential election was taken away.   Kimberly asked:         How many other people faced this violation of our basic       freedom to vote? We cannot allow voter suppression to       continue in South Dakota or anywhere in Native America.    These are American citizens whose rights were taken away from them  for partisan advantage. Jesus and Kimberly's voices were taken away  from them just like countless other Americans who face the same  discrimination.   Nineteen States have passed 34 laws making it easier to sabotage  election laws and target voters of color, and not all of them had a  supermajority of two-thirds vote.   In 2016, Representative David Lewis, a Republican State lawmaker in  North Carolina and member of the general assembly's redistricting  committee, said:         I propose that we draw the maps to give a partisan       advantage to 10 Republicans and three Democrats       [representatives] . . . because I do not believe it's       possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats.   [[Page S326]]     This is not new. This has been going on decade after decade. The only  thing that is different now is that in 2013, when the Supreme Court  gutted the enforcement provisions of the Voting Rights Act, Republican- led legislatures don't have to hide behind it any longer. Now they just  say they are going to draw for partisan advantage. They are going to  change the rules to keep certain communities from voting, making it  harder for people to get to that ballot box.   This is nothing new, and shame on all of us for not acting when the  Supreme Court told us this in 2013. That is on all of us. But we are  here today.   We are also seeing an uptick in violence as a result of the lies  across the country--the Big Lie. The Department of Homeland Security  has seen an increase in calls for violence as a result of these  baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election. We are losing honest  election officials and poll workers because of threats against their  lives due to conspiracy theories and lies pushed by the former  President.   The Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act will protect the vote of  working families across the country. Only one archaic parliamentary  measure prohibits all this progress.   The filibuster does not increase deliberation in this Chamber. It  does not incentivize compromise. So while some claim that amending the  filibuster will further the country's division, I disagree. Right now,  it is only aiding and abetting obstructionists and opponents of  progress when it comes to voting on civil rights legislation.   While the filibuster is not mentioned a single time in the  Constitution--    So the importance of us being here today goes right in the  face of having this conversation as a debate. I appreciate my  Republican colleagues who have come to the floor to engage in some  debate, in some colloquy.   I, like Senator Kaine, came to the Senate a bit naive. I thought  debate happened here all the time. I came here thinking that I could  offer an amendment at any time, that I could offer a unanimous consent  at any time. That is not the case. This is not the Senate that our  Founders envisioned.   Now, if you feel moved to oppose a piece of legislation, if you are  passionate about an issue, you should have the courage to come to the  Senate floor in front of your colleagues and the American people.   You should not be allowed to vote it in from behind closed doors.  This Chamber has changed, just as the times have changed. So it is the  responsibility of every one of us to make sure that the Senate works  better, not for us but for the American people.   Now, in closing, in 1805, Vice President Aaron Burr suggested that  the Senate remove from its rules the ``previous question motion,''  which allowed the Chamber's simple majority to end debate on a bill. He  viewed the rule as completely unnecessary and urged the Senate to clean  up its rule book because after everyone had spoken and debated, they  would vote.   A year later, the Senate removed the previous question motion,  leaving a loophole that allowed the minority to take advantage and use  what we now know as the filibuster. Unfortunately, Burr could not  foresee the obstructionism of decades to come.   In the following decades, pro-slavery Senators co-opted the  filibuster to protect the interests of White southern enslavers. Men  such as John Calhoun abused the filibuster to obstruct civil right  efforts.   And according to historians, between 1917 and 1994, 30 measures  favored by the sitting President and simple majorities in the House and  Senate--half of which addressed civil rights--they all died, thanks to  the filibuster.   The same procedural tool proved to be even more useful to southern  Senators who sought to block civil rights legislation, including  antilynching bills. Not until 1964 did the Senate successfully overcome  a filibuster to pass important civil rights legislation and subsequent  voting rights legislation.   Now, history should act as a teacher to all of us, and history will  remind us who voted today on the side of the people. I am proud that  this effort includes my Native American Voting Rights Act, which will  ensure Tribes and Native Americans and Alaskan Natives and voters on  Tribal lands will have equal access to the electoral process. Access to  the ballot box is the cornerstone of our democratic system, and without  equitable access to it, we cannot stand on the world stage and claim  that we are all leaders in the fight for liberty and justice for all.   Now, my Republican colleagues have proven time and again that they  are not interested in acting on this issue. Washington Republicans have  made the political calculation that they have a partisan advantage  here. They are too comfortable shrugging their shoulders and sitting on  the sidelines while States chip away at the right to vote.   I know where I stand. All we are asking for today is the opportunity  to vote on this critical piece of legislation after everyone here has  said their piece.   I urge my colleagues to do the right thing today, to do right by our  democracy, and to send the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act to the  President's desk.   I yield the floor.
