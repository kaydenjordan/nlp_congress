 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize the  small business, Kelsey's On Main of Jackson, KY, as the Senate Small  Business of the Week.   Like a good Southerner, Kelsey Sebastian is passionate about  hospitality. After leaving her native Jackson, she pursued a degree in  hospitality management and tourism from University of Kentucky.  However, instead of taking her university expertise to the  opportunities of the big city, Kelsey returned home to put her  knowledge and skills to work. Thus in 2014, with the help of her  family, Kelsey Sebastian opened Kelsey's On Main.   The idea for Kelsey's On Main was born out of several needs for the  little town of Jackson. With only a small number of sit-in dining  establishments in Jackson, local residents needed more restaurant  options. Moreover, there was a need for revitalization in the heart of  downtown Jackson, a heady mission that Kelsey and her family bravely  took on. The Hogg building, now home to Kelsey's On Main, was 98 years  old when she and her family began the renovation process in 2012. A  former pharmacy and pool hall, this historic building located in the  center of downtown needed a healthy dose of tender love and care.  Renovating the establishment was by no means an easy task but the town  of Jackson and its residents will tell you that it was worth it. In  2014, the centennial anniversary of the Hogg building, Kelsey's On Main  opened their doors.   Kelsey's desire to restore beauty to the dilapidated old Hogg  building corresponded with her mission to provide great food and top  quality service to her hometown. In keeping the original tin roof and  leaving one of the old walls exposed in its brick, customers can see  that this building is mature in age but well taken care of. To that  end, Kelsey and her family keep old photos of downtown Jackson as well  as photos of her friends and family throughout the historic building.  Of course, her family is not just present in the photographs that hang  on the wall; her parents often come by to pick up a shift or two to  support their daughter. And as a tenant in her aunt's building,  Kelsey's On Main is a true family affair.   Returning to Jackson to open her own business is not the only way  Kelsey supports her community. She is an active member of the Jackson  Women's Group and as a Jackson City Council member, Kelsey always  volunteers her restaurant to host the monthly Jackson Chamber of  Commerce lunch. Kelsey is also involved in the Breathitt County Honey  Festival, a tradition that has been around for over four decades, by  supporting the festival's musical committee. As someone so involved in  the goings-on of her town, Kelsey does her best to bring life to the  Jackson community, as illustrated by she and her family's decision to  revitalize a historic downtown building. Moreover, as a recent  participant in Kentucky's BRIGHT program, a professional and  entrepreneurial development program, it is clear that Kelsey is  headstrong in her desire to keep improving and impacting the community  around her.   All across the country are little towns like Jackson whose downtowns  have been left empty by a shift in industry, and it is businesses like  Kelsey's On Main that bring life back into those empty storefronts and  keep historic communities thriving.   Congratulations to Kelsey and her family and the entire team at  Kelsey's On Main. I wish them the best of luck and look forward to  watching their continued growth and success in Kentucky.                            ____________________
