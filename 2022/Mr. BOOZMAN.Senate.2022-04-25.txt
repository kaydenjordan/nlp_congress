 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Arkansas  State Trooper Spencer Morris who has been  [[Page S2129]]  named the National State Trooper of the Year by the International  Association of Chiefs of Police, State, and Provincial Division. Morris  has demonstrated his dedication to serving his community, and this high  honor is certainly hard earned and well deserved.   Hailing from Crittenden County, Trooper Morris graduated from the  Arkansas State Police Training Academy in 2018 and began his career  serving and protecting his neighbors and fellow Arkansans. As with all  law enforcement positions, this role comes with considerable risk and  uncertainty, which he understood and agreed to step into for the sake  of public service.   Morris has shown his commitment to the people of Arkansas each day he  puts on his badge and uniform, but exhibited incredible bravery on  December 16, 2021, during an attempted traffic stop. While on patrol,  Morris answered the radio call from the U.S. Marshals Service  requesting assistance in the apprehension of a wanted fugitive believed  to be armed and dangerous. Morris sprang into action and attempted to  pull the suspect's vehicle over when he sustained a shot in the chest.  After returning fire and calling for backup, the suspect was  successfully apprehended.   Colonel Bill Bryant, director of the Arkansas State Police, said of  Morris' heroism, ``Trooper Spencer Morris is just one example of more  than 500 other Arkansas state troopers, just like him, who set aside  awesome risks to themselves each day to make their state a safer and  better place to call home.''   I am extremely thankful for Trooper Morris and his colleagues who  patrol our State highways and serve Natural State citizens each and  every day. It is because of their dedication and bravery we are able to  travel across our beautiful State and feel safe on our roads, highways,  and beyond.   Congratulations to Trooper Spencer Morris on this distinguished and  prestigious honor. He represents the best of his community, his  brothers and sisters in law enforcement, and our wonderful State. We  are tremendously proud of him and celebrate this milestone in his  career and protecting the Natural State.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the  Buffalo National River as we mark the 50th year since it was designated  as our country's first National River. Enjoying wildlife and the  outdoors is a way of life for residents of the Natural State, and the  Buffalo National River has helped countless Arkansans do just that.   Congress formally afforded the Buffalo River Federal protection on  March 1, 1972, to preserve its 135 miles of free-flowing river and  conserve natural, scenic and scientific features like the deep valleys,  towering bluffs, rugged wilderness, and beautiful landscapes of the  Ozark Mountains. That act has helped safeguard one of Arkansas' most  prized gems for five decades.   This was the result of the leadership and vision of Congressman John  Paul Hammerschmidt, the longtime representative of the Third  Congressional District. Using his position on the House Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee, he helped protect the Buffalo River under  the designation as a national river.   This incredible attraction welcomes Arkansans and travelers from all  over the world, to take in the State's natural beauty.   From Big Bluff and Hawksbill Crag, to its famous herd of elk, images  of the area are instantly recognizable.   The Buffalo National River provides something for everyone. Outdoor  enthusiasts come to enjoy the excitement of the river, take in the  beauty and serenity of the surrounding wilderness, and experience the  friendliness of the Arkansas community. This unique, natural treasure  has also been a steady source of economic growth and a staple of our  tourism industry for years. Helping to grow businesses and communities,  the Buffalo National River has contributed to the betterment of  Arkansas in countless ways.   I am so thankful for all the men and women who have worked over the  years to make this park what it is today and helped maintain it for all  Arkansans to enjoy. It is because of these dedicated individuals and  organizations that future generations will be able to experience the  river's beauty and inviting atmosphere just as we do today.   In celebration of this historic milestone, an incredible group of  park and community workers and volunteers has planned some great events  throughout the year, and I am excited to follow along. Congratulations  to all those, past and present, who have helped conserve and protect  this iconic natural resource that has helped define and differentiate  Arkansas for the last 50 years and many more into the future.                            ____________________
