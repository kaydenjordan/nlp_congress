 Mr. Speaker, I want to enter into the Record two  haunting stories from migrant mothers reported this month.   The first, ``Don't take my child away,'' said a mother, and her child  started screaming and vomiting and crying hysterically. And she asked  the officers, ``Can I at least have 5 minutes to console her?'' They  declined.   And next, another mother set her 2-year-old daughter down and an  agent began to run gloved hands across her body. Immediately, the girl  began to scream. It all happened so quickly, and the girl's despair was  so complete in those few seconds. She would be taken from her mother  when the van reached its destination.   There are more than 2,300 similarly heartbreaking and unimaginable  stories.   The Trump administration cannot undo the trauma and terror they have  caused, but they must immediately outline their plan to reunite these  loved ones.                            ____________________
