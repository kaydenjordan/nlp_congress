 Mr. President, here we are--another Thursday  afternoon in the Senate. It is pretty quiet around here. It is amazing  how quickly this place gets quiet when the Senate majority leader, the  Republican leader, Senator McConnell, tells people: We don't have any  more work to do today. By the way, we don't have any more work to do  tomorrow, Friday. By the way, don't worry about Saturday or Sunday.  Monday, you know, I will be here, says the Majority leader, but the  Senate doesn't need to be here doing its work--maybe not Tuesday or  Wednesday either.   I want to thank the Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, for being  down here, standing up for working men and women and families and small  businesses because, for them, it is not business as usual. It is not  business as usual for all the folks who are out of work.   Thirty million Americans are on unemployment insurance, but here in  the Senate, for the Senate majority leader, it is business as usual.  Take a day off. Take the weekend off. Be on standby next week. Maybe we  will start doing something real.   I can tell you the coronavirus is not on standby. The coronavirus is  not taking a day off or 2 days off. It is continuing to spread in many  parts of the country. We don't have enough testing equipment. We are  not able to test people quickly. It takes people days and days and days  and, in some cases, weeks to get their results.   We hear the President of the United States saying he wants to open up  the economy and open up schools. We all want to open up the economy. We  all want our children back in school, for classrooms are the best place  for learning. But do you know what? You can't just wish for that to  happen, just like you can't wish for the coronavirus to go away, and  that makes it go away. You need to do real work. You need the testing  equipment so that we can test people in realtime and make sure that we  prevent further outbreaks. We don't want bonfires to turn into brush  fires to turn into prairie fires. You need to catch the virus and  contain it. You can't do that if you don't have testing equipment.   So the virus is not taking a day off or 2 or 3 or a week, and we  shouldn't either. This Senate needs to do its job. We are in the middle  of a pandemic. This is not a normal August. This should not be business  as usual, and as Senator Stabenow said, we should not be here, at this  moment, with important protections having already expired. This Senate  sat by and did nothing while the protections against evictions expired.  The eviction moratorium that was protecting millions of Americans-- gone. The extra $600 a week in unemployment--gone. Yet here we are with  the majority leader saying: Take Friday off. Take Saturday off.  Business as usual.   Well, that is a difficult thing to tell families and workers and  small businesses around the country, and it cannot be business as  usual.   The House of Representatives passed the Heroes Act more than 2\1/2\  months ago. It realized that after we passed the CARES Act in a  bipartisan way, important protections were going to expire, and it  acted. The House made sure it passed legislation to extend the enhanced  unemployment of $600 a week. It passed legislation to extend the  eviction moratorium. It provided additional food assistance for our  kids. It provided important funds for rental assistance, which not only  helps tenants stay in their apartments and homes but provides the  payments to the landlords so the landlords can make the payments to the  people they owe money to and on up the economic food chain.   The House did all of that, and what did the Senate do for 2\1/2\  months? Nothing. Nothing. It is like a train is heading right for you,  and you stand in the middle of the tracks until it hits you when any  commonsense person would do what the House of Representatives did,  which was to take action to make sure that we didn't cross these  deadlines and cause unnecessary harm to millions of American families,  workers, and small businesses. That is what the Senate has done.   Now, even after we are into those deadlines--we have crossed those  deadlines--what does the majority leader here, the Republican leader,  say? Take tomorrow off. Take the weekend off. Take Monday off. In fact,  the Senate may not come in for a while. I mean, we will come in, but  there will be no voting, no real business.   Let me tell you what I am hearing from my constituents, because I  know it is not different from what other Members are hearing from  theirs. Here is a letter I received from a single mom.         I live . . . with my 15-year-old son as a single mother. I       am asking for your help in voting to extend the $600 Federal       unemployment benefit. I understand a lot of politicians do       not want this extended due to the thought that the benefit is       too great and will prevent Marylanders from wanting to return       back to work, in that they make more money from staying at       home off of the State/government this way. Now, we all know,       if your job calls you back during this time and you choose       not to return, your benefits are going to be cut off anyway.        As for me, I am losing thousands of dollars each month       being out of work and am barely scraping by as it is now with       the extra $600. I desperately WANT TO RETURN to work and make       my regular salary, which is more. I am very thankful for the       extra $600 a week and have no idea how I would have survived       without it during this time. I have zero other means to any       money or credit. I have been able to pay my rent, feed my       son, and pay some bills. I have deferred my car payment until       August and am behind on car insurance. I am desperately       asking for your help  [[Page S5254]]       and the help of the government to extend this extra $600 a       week benefit for a little while longer. Not to sound       ungrateful, but an extra $100 or $200 per week is just not       enough to help pay rent and other bills. Cutting this benefit       abruptly will cause such economic hardship and devastation to       so many Americans.    This is a single mother, with a 15-year-old son, who is pleading with  the U.S. Senate to do its job. And what does the majority leader say to  Senators? Take tomorrow off. Take Saturday off. Take Sunday off. Take  Monday off.   I want to read another letter I received on this subject. Here is  what my constituent wrote:         I am emailing in hopes of asking for your support to extend       the $600 Federal assistance in addition to unemployment.       While I realize that the country has to spend more and more       during this pandemic, many of us are learning our temporary       layoffs are now permanent (I received the call yesterday) and       our industries are still completely shut down. I have always       worked in the hotel industry and have no further education or       experience than that. The hospitality industry is the hardest       hit during this pandemic. While I search multiple times a day       for jobs, they simply are not open because the industry has       not yet recovered. In fact, our industry is downsizing       immensely        I am a single mother to one 5-year-old boy who will start       kindergarten in the fall. We do not receive any financial       assistance through the State, such as housing assistance or       child support. Maryland unemployment of $430 per week will       not even cover the rent costs, and we will quickly be evicted       with no options for housing.        I am not looking to make more money than I was at my job.       That is not possible. I grossed $75,000 in 2019, but I am       looking to be able to pay my rent and bills and part-time       childcare because it is in the best interest of my son to       have social interaction and education during the pandemic       even if I am not working. Please--I beg you--please support       the extension of the $600 per week benefit.    Now, I have heard a lot of Senators on this floor over weeks and  months talk about how we just cannot extend $600 a week. Yet we hear  from these moms and parents who are pleading for that help so that they  can simply pay their bills and get by. Even with that, they are not  able to pay all of their bills.   The Republican leader says to the U.S. Senate: Take a day off. Take 2  days off. Next week, I will be in, says the majority leader, but I  don't need for the Senate to be in, doing its work.   What are we all here for? We should be here 24/7, working around the  clock together to resolve these issues.   We have a lot of multi, multi, multimillionaires in this U.S. Senate,  and it is really rich for all of us to be telling families out there  that the extra $600 per week is too much. That is just too much.   These are individuals who want to go back to work. I just read to you  a letter from someone who works in the hospitality industry. That is  her experience. That is what she knows.   I don't know if our Republican colleagues have checked recently, but  the unemployment rate is around 15 percent. There are a lot of people  out there who are looking for work who can't find it. They can't find  it because we are in the middle of a pandemic, and that has caused a  lot of small businesses and others to shut down in order to make sure  that we stop the spread of the virus.   These are people who want to get back to work. They want nothing  better than that. They want their children back in school. All of us  do. Yet we have a failed, botched Federal response, starting with the  White House--starting with the President, who has made this a political  issue when it has to be a health issue. It has made the problem a lot  worse, and we all know it. We all know that this pandemic is lasting  longer in the United States and has killed more people in the United  States because of a totally failed response right from the top, and we  should not be complicit in that. We should do our job.   We have the majority leader, the Republican leader. What is he  saying? He is not even part of the negotiations, right? He says: You  know, I am in my Republican caucus lunches, and, reportedly, only half  of the Republican Senators want to do anything.   I don't know if that is true or not, but that is what Republican  Senators are saying on national television. That is what we are hearing  from the Republican caucus. So, if that is not true, it would be great  to hear all of the Republican Senators come down to the floor and talk  about what they are willing to do, not what they are not willing to do.  Because there are not the votes there, the majority leader has  contracted out his negotiation authority to the White House, and he has  told the Senate to go home.   Let's just start doing our job here in the U.S. Senate. Nobody should  be contracting out his job and his vote and his negotiating authority  to the White House. This is the U.S. Senate. I don't know what people  ran for if they just want to say: Oh, I can't deal with this because my  caucus doesn't support any response. Go talk to the White House.   In the meantime in the Senate, take Friday off. Take Saturday off.  Take Sunday off. Maybe take Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday off, too.   That is a hell of a message to send to the American people in the  middle of a pandemic during which so many people are hurting.   I will end with this. Instead of the majority leader's coming down to  the floor today and telling everybody to go away, we should stay here.  We should stay here, and we should do our job. Doing our job means  coming together with the next round of emergency legislation to slow  down and then stop the spread of the virus and help the millions of  Americans who are in tremendous economic pain right now. This is not  business as usual. The Senate needs to do its job. Let's stay here and  get it done.   I yield the floor.
