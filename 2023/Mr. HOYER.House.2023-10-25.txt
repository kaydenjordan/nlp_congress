 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   For millennia, the Jews of the world have been subject all over the  world to prejudice, hate, and violence.   Mr. Speaker, I have visited the Kfar Aza kibbutz over four times in  the last 25 years. It was a place of community. On October 7, Hamas  turned it into a place of slaughter.   This brutal terrorist organization will pursue its genocidal, anti- Semitic mission to fight and kill Jews. That is their purpose.   The Jewish State of Israel will cease to exist if their objectives  are achieved. Hamas will not yield, and neither can we.   As the resolution makes clear, we will stand by our ally Israel; have  their back, Mr. Chairman.   Dozens of American civilians have been killed, wounded, and held  captive in this war. We have also seen the scourge of anti-Semitism  here in America.    Mr. Speaker, we must follow this resolution with action.  We must all vote for this resolution and speak with one voice; action  that shows the world that America will defend its allies in Israel, in  Ukraine, and around the world.
