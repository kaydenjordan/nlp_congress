Madam President, I would just say to Senator Collins: You  are my colleague and my friend. If they write the history of this  place, they might make a footnote that we had a book club--a little  one--between us. We exchanged a lot of books over the years. I thank  you for your friendship and kindness, all the way through, and  congratulations on this milestone.                            ____________________     I ask for the yeas and nays.

I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein) and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily  absent.    Mr. President, as our students return to in-person  instruction, they also will return to school sports. We encourage our  students to be active and play schools sports to promote healthy  habits, team-building skills, and socialization, which are especially  important after a year of remote learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Yet every year, more than 140,000 estimated student athletes sustain a  concussion, and that is just the reported count. We can be sure that  many more go unreported and untreated.   The health benefits of competing in school sports are undermined if  students are staying out on the field after an injury, especially  concussions. Unfortunately, many student athletes return to play  prematurely, and there is growing evidence that untreated concussions  can have detrimental, long term effects on their health and academic  performance.   That is why last week I reintroduced the Protecting Student Athletes  from Concussions Act. My bill would direct states to develop concussion  safety plans for public schools that include a concussion safety  awareness component. Certain States, like Illinois, already have such  procedures in place, but it is high time we make this true for all  States. By equipping our schools and communities with evidence-based  guidance for responding to concussions, we can keep our students and  their futures safe.   The bill also would require States to adopt a ``when in doubt, sit it  out'' policy. If there is even the possibility that a student athlete  has suffered a concussion, their health and safety ought to be the No.  1 priority. That means, if an athlete is suspected of having sustained  a concussion, they should sit out and not be allowed to return to play  the same day. They should return to play only once evaluated and  cleared by a qualified healthcare professional.   Let's be clear: A concussion is a traumatic brain injury that affects  brain function. It is, by no means, something we can simply shake or  walk off. Getting your ``bell rung,'' like they used to say in my day,  is a serious threat to a young person. The still-developing brains of  students make them more susceptible to injury, making concussions all  the more dangerous.   A ``when in doubt, sit it out'' policy, endorsed by the American  College of Sports Medicine and the American Academy of Neurology, will  put the decision to return to the game in the hands of qualified  healthcare professionals. It will prevent student athletes from  experiencing successive injuries by staying in the game when they are  not fit. It will give student athletes time to heal and help ensure  that short-term symptoms do not become long-term effects.   As we return to in-person instruction, we must use common-sense and  evidence-based approaches to ensure student safety. For school sports,  this means we have to put the necessary procedures for preventing,  detecting, responding to, and treating concussions in place. This bill  would help do that.   It is why my bill is endorsed by the American College of Sports  Medicine; American Academy of Neurology; National Football League  (NFL); National Basketball Association (NBA); Major League Baseball  (MLB); National Hockey League (NHL); National Collegiate Athletic  Association (NCAA); American Academy of Sports Physical Therapy;  Academy of Neurologic Physical Therapy; American Physical Therapy  Association; Easterseals; Illinois High School Association; National  Association of School Psychologists; National Association of Secondary  School Principals; National Disability Rights Network; National  Interscholastic Athletic Administrators Association; National Parent  Teacher Association; Pop Warner Little Scholars; U.S. Soccer  Federation; USA Cheer; USA Football; Safe Kids World Wide; and Sports &  Fitness Industry Association.   I hope my colleagues will join me in this common-sense, evidence- based approach to protecting student athletes. Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
