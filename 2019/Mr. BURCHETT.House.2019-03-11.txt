 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend Bryson Watkins, a  13-year-old from Lenoir City in the Second Congressional District of  Tennessee, for his selflessness and quick thinking.   On February 13, Bryson saved another young man's life after receiving  a message through social media. Bryson sprinted to inform a sheriff's  deputy, and together, they initiated a response by law enforcement.   In the aftermath of the event, Loudon County Sheriff Tim Guider  [[Page H2629]]  honored Bryson with the Sheriff's Citizen Lifesaving Award.   On behalf of the Second District, I extend my appreciation for  Bryson's actions. We should recognize Bryson for his integrity,  compassion, and maturity. Not many 13-year-olds, Mr. Speaker, have the  wherewithal to encounter a crisis situation and act so responsibly. He  acted quickly and appropriately.   Bryson's leadership in this situation speaks volumes of the values  that his parents had instilled in him and the community in which he was  raised.   His ability to work with local law enforcement is also a tribute to  the dedication of the Loudon County Sheriff's Department, Mr. Speaker,  and I thank them all for their commitment to the community.                            ____________________
