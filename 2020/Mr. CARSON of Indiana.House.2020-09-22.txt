 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the  200,000 Americans, including the 3,500 Hoosiers who have lost their  lives to COVID-19. We won't forget those we lost, our family, friends,  neighbors, coworkers, teachers, spiritual leaders, and much more.   I also want to remember my cousins, who passed away from the virus  earlier this year. Who knows how many lives could have been saved if  our leaders had been honest about the severity of COVID-19 from the  start? Who knows how many millions could have avoided this illness and  possible lifetime complications from it, if those leaders had not made  them make the impossible choice between their health and their  livelihoods?   I introduced H.R. 7161, the COVID-19 Memorial Quilt Act of 2020, to  create a national memorial, Madam Speaker, to everyone we have lost. We  can't change the past, but we can impact the future.   The Senate must pass the HEROES Act, which we passed in May, to  provide strong relief from COVID-19. We can save countless lives if we  put partisanship aside and work together.                            ____________________
