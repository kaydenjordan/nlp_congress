 Mr. Speaker, there is nothing more important than  character, and I rise today to recognize an educator from Bucks County,  Pennsylvania, who was recently honored as Character Builder of the Year  by the Pennsbury LYFT. Blair Greiner, an art teacher at William Penn  Middle School, received the award from Pennsbury LYFT leaders Vicky  Allen and Gary Sanderson.   The Character Builder of the Year Award is a unique distinction  bestowed upon gifted teachers and faculty members who encourage their  students to make upright decisions and conduct themselves in a positive  manner.   Blair was nominated by several of her colleagues, who described her  as a kind and passionate person who is always passionate about her  work. They cite a project she spearheaded designing a mural for a  retiring colleague and creating a give one, take one initiative that  gives students and teachers the ability to write uplifting messages for  peers having a tough day.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Blair on this well-deserved award and  would like to thank LYFT for honoring heroes in our community and for  advocating for the youth in Bucks County.               Recognizing the First Baptist Church of Perkasie     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a faith  community in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, for its innovation in  providing pastoral care to members of our community.   The First Baptist Church of Perkasie recently unveiled a community  center known as Revivals that serves as a soup kitchen, a counseling  center, and a food pantry, among many other purposes.   Throughout the summer, members of First Baptist Church of Perkasie  will hit the road with the Revivals block party trailer mobile unit to  offer services to our community throughout Bucks County. These family- friendly events, in addition to other faith services, have an array of  food and games to serve to bring people together.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud the faith community of First Baptist Church of  Perkasie. I would like to especially thank Teaching Pastor Chris  Heller, Family Care Pastor Doug Henning, and Ministries Pastor Jon  Adams for all of their work that they do for our Bucks County  community.                   Honoring Jessica Wilcox and Alex Goldsby     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize two student  athletes in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that were recently honored at  the 21st annual Kiwanis-Herald Scholar-Athlete Awards Banquet in  Langhorne.   Jessica Wilcox and Alex Goldsby, seniors at Conwell-Egan Catholic  High School, my alma mater, were recently selected as recipients of the  Levittown-Bristol Kiwanis Club Dick Dougherty Scholarship.   A 4-year starter on the Conwell-Egan girls volleyball team, a 4-year  member of the softball team, and a two-time first-team all-Catholic  selection in bowling, Jessica also served as a member of the student  council for 2 years.   As a 2-year starting quarterback for the Conwell-Egan football team,  Alex was named the 2018 Philadelphia Catholic League Paul Bartolomeo  Top Scholar-Athlete and was a member of the 2018 Archdiocese of  Philadelphia Scholar-Athlete Honor Roll. As a starter, Alex threw for  1,972 yards and 21 touchdowns, and he also rushed for over 1,100 yards  and 25 touchdowns.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Jessica and Alex all the best as they continue  their studies at Bucks County Community College and Ursinus College,  respectively, and I congratulate both of them and my alma mater on this  amazing distinction.                            ____________________
