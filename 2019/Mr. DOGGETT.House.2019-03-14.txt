 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his work on this.   Mr. Speaker, the relentless, baseless attacks on an American patriot,  Robert Mueller, and his team, have moved us ever so closer to a  constitutional crisis. Just as we cannot yield to Trump's attempt to  discredit this distinguished team of legal experts, neither can we let  them bury the results of this taxpayer-funded investigation.   Having nothing to fear means having nothing to hide. Those who seek  to hide this report, obviously, do not believe that the truth will set  them free. Rather, as it has for so many of Mr. Trump's sleazy cohorts,  they feel that the truth will lock them up. So many lies, so much daily  deceit. Already so much evidence of collusion and obstruction and, from  the organization's own former lawyer, evidence of an apparent criminal  enterprise that bears the name of the Trump organization.   If it is a witch hunt, Mr. President, it has more witches than a Mar- a-Lago  [[Page H2727]]  Halloween party. And your witches' brew seems to have cast a spell over  many Members of this Congress who find themselves locked in continuing  silence or wishy-washy efforts to ignore and bolster your floundering  Presidency.   Today's resolution says to President Trump, who has shown some  consistent disregard for the rule of law: You cannot seize and secret  evidence of conduct that others need to see. Let the taxpayers see the  results of the investigation of the wrongdoing, which their dollars  have rightly funded.   Our congressional duty is to enforce the borders, to be Border Patrol  people, to see that this President, who is willing to cross every line,  every constitutional boundary, to see that he is contained within the  borders of the Constitution. For the rule of law to stand, the  administration cannot be allowed to sit on the special counsel's  report.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the resolution.
