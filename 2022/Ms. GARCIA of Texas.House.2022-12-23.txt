 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the key  accomplishments Democrats will deliver in today's Federal Government  funding bill.   Expanding healthcare is a top priority for my district.   Democrats are putting people over politics by investing in our public  health system and expanding access to quality healthcare.   Democrats will deliver permanent, mandatory, and continuous coverage  for the 40 million children enrolled in Medicaid and the Children's  Health Insurance Program.   We are making investments in mental health, which will improve access  to medication-assisted treatment, expand our mental health workforce,  and increase coverage of mental health services.   Investing in physical and mental health care is investing in our  families, our workers, and our communities. It is about putting people  over politics. It is about investing in our children.   I am proud that we will be voting on this bill today, and I plan to  vote for it.                            ____________________
