 Mr. Speaker, what we are witnessing here today  on the one-year anniversary of President Trump's inauguration is a  complete failure by the majority in leadership and governance.   For the first time ever, we have a shutdown where one party controls  the White House and both houses of Congress, and Federal employees will  risk being sent home and losing pay.   Not a surprise, given the twisted, upside-down priorities that  dominate the Republican agenda.   Instead of expanding health coverage, Trump and Republicans have been  focused on taking it away. Instead of providing responsible tax relief  focused on America's middle class, Republicans passed a huge tax scam  that produced handouts to corporations and the wealthy and explodes the  deficit.   Now, rather than passing a responsible long-term spending plan, we  have another shortsighted budget Band-Aid and the historic Trump budget  shutdown.   Our colleagues have clearly been reading from their alternative facts  dictionary today, because it does not pass the straight-face test in  any corner of this country that Republicans actually care anything  about people's healthcare. Please, give me a break.   Let's end the Trump shutdown by working together and focusing on  bipartisan progress. Americans deserve at least that much from this  body.
