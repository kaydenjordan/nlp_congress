 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 267, and I urge  my colleagues to come together to reopen a vital part of our government  and to support this straightforward, bipartisan bill. It is a  downpayment on reducing our nationwide, dangerous infrastructure  problems.   It provides $650 million for Amtrak's Northeast corridor, the most  heavily used passenger rail line in the Nation; $2.8 billion for the  Federal Railroad Administration; and $800 million in new transit  infrastructure grants. This is the least we can do to begin to get our  government open and Americans back to work.   Congress is 4 months behind on paying our transportation bills. We  cannot move forward on our larger infrastructure investment needs, like  Gateway, without this first step. Gateway is the most vital  infrastructure project in our Nation.   The century-old Hudson River rail tunnel connects 200,000 commuters  every day from New Jersey to New York. Amtrak uses it to connect 20  train routes across the country. This tunnel is the Achilles heel of  the Northeast rail corridor and was severely damaged during Superstorm  Sandy. A collapse of the tunnel could injure thousands and cost our  economy an estimated $100 million a day. But just as important to my  constituents, every delay, every deferred decision on Gateway means a  hardworking parent not making it home to see his or her family.   The proposal for Gateway was submitted to the DOT over a year ago.  Secretary Chao needs to put the funds already approved by Congress to  work. New transit trains and tunnels are exactly the type of  infrastructure projects our country needs to build a strong future.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the subcommittee chair for being so focused on  America's transportation priorities and for allowing the voice of the  people of the 11th District of New Jersey to be heard today.
