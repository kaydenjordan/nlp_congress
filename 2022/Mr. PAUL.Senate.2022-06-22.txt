 Mr. President, it is important to honor key leaders  who have made a positive impact in their communities. Pastor William  ``Bill'' Wade is the shepherding and care pastor at Living Hope Baptist  Church in Bowling Green, KY. He has been married to Dianne Harbin of  Vicksburg, MS for 41 years. They are blessed with two grown children,  Joey Wade and Katy Owen. They also have two grandchildren, Clare and  Judson Owen. Pastor Bill received his master of religious education  degree in December 1981 from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary.   Pastor Bill is a leader who cares deeply for those within his sphere  of influence. It is this caring heart that motivated him to establish a  counseling center in Bowling Green in 2016. His vision was to provide  anyone who is hurting in the community the opportunity to receive free  biblical counseling. His leadership has provided counselors who are  prepared to help those struggling with addiction, those with marriage  difficulties, those caught in debilitating conflict, and those  contemplating suicide. As an extension of his love for the community,  he served alongside first responders as a chaplain during the search  and rescue efforts following the December 2021 devastating tornados in  Bowling Green, in which 18 individuals lost their lives and hundreds  lost their homes. Pastor Bill's primary goal that individuals will  begin to experience God every day and live out a God-honoring life.   In addition, he led efforts to open a pregnancy support center in  2019 in Bowling Green to care for those mothers and fathers who feel  overwhelmed by unexpected news that a baby is on the way. Much-needed  care is provided during the pregnancy and after delivery. Many mothers  have since decided to continue their pregnancy, bringing forth the joy  of new life to celebrate. These two organizations are known  collectively as the Centers for Hope. Through Bill's wise and caring  efforts, his dream has become a reality, and lives have been forever  changed for the better. Pastor Bill's legacy will remain strong for  many generations to come.                            ____________________
