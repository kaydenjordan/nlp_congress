 Mr. President, today, the Senate was supposed to  finish legislation securing critical tools, training, and support for  America's Armed Forces, but the junior Senator from Vermont had other  ideas.   Remember, Senator Sanders spent last summer, literally, trying to  defund our military. Not my words, but the title of a piece he  published: ``Defund the Pentagon: The Liberal Case.'' Our colleague  offered an amendment to strip 10 percent of funding from our  servicemembers and decimate our defense budget. The Russians aren't  cutting military funding. China isn't cutting funding. But last summer,  Senator Sanders and fellow Democrats, including the Democratic leader,  voted to make America unilaterally disarm and cut ours.   The left took a break from trying to defund the police to try to  defund our Armed Forces. Their amendment went down in a landslide, but  now our colleague from Vermont is again putting political stunts before  the needs of our men and women in uniform.   Our colleague says he will slow down this vital bill unless he gets  to muscle through another stand-alone proposal from Speaker Pelosi that  would add roughly half a trillion dollars to the national debt, which  does not align with what President Trump has suggested and which has no  realistic path to quickly pass the Senate.   Well, as I have said, the Senate will not let our national security  be shoved off course, certainly not by Senators who have spent years-- literally years--trying to gut America's capabilities while our  adversaries continue ramping up. The Senate will stay on this important  bill until we complete it one way or another.                            ____________________     Now let's talk about COVID-19 relief. Four days ago,  President Trump signed the second largest rescue package in American  history. The largest one was the CARES Act back in March. Due to this  pandemic and our massive response, we now have a national debt far  larger than our entire economy for the first time since World War II,  but we knew our people needed more help, so Congress just passed  another nearly $900 billion in emergency relief targeted to those who  need it most, a second round of payroll support to save small business  jobs, more unemployment aid, vaccine distribution money, funding for  safe schools, and much more.   In addition to historic amounts of targeted help at the request of  President Trump and his team, the package also included another round  of direct checks to households, whether or not each household needs the  help, whether or not their finances have changed dramatically this past  year.   Yesterday, Secretary Mnuchin announced households should begin  receiving these payments as early as today and this week. That is more  good news to a lot of people.   After Congress and the administration finalized the bipartisan bill,  the President expressed interest in further  [[Page S7972]]  expanding nontargeted direct payments. So to ensure the President was  comfortable signing the bill into law, the Senate committed to  beginning one process that would combine three of the President's  priorities: larger direct checks, a repeal of section 230 of the  Communications Decency Act, and further efforts to review the integrity  of our democracy--three of the President's priorities in one Senate  process. That was the commitment, and that is what happened yesterday  when I introduced text reflecting just what the President had, in fact,  requested.   Now House and Senate Democrats want something very different. As they  tried to do countless times in the past 4 years, Speaker Pelosi and  Leader Schumer are trying to pull a fast one on the President and the  American people.   First of all, they are hoping everyone just forgets about election  integrity and Big Tech. They are desperate to ignore those two parts of  President Trump's requests, and you can draw your own conclusions. Even  on the question of larger checks, the Democrats have tried to warp what  President Trump actually laid out.   Look, it is no secret that Republicans have a diversity of views  about the wisdom of borrowing hundreds of billions more to send out  more nontargeted money, including to many households that have suffered  no loss of income during the crisis. COVID-19 has not affected all  households equally--not even close.   It is hardly clear that the Federal Government's top priority should  be sending thousands of dollars to, for example, a childless couple  making well into six figures who have been comfortably teleworking all  year. Our duty is to help get help to the people who actually need  help, like we did, to a historic degree, just 4 days ago.   But above and beyond that discussion, the Democratic leaders have  broken from what President Trump proposed. They quietly changed this  proposal in an attempt to let wealthy households suck up even more  money. Speaker Pelosi structured her bill so that a family of four  would have to earn more than $300,000 in order not--not to qualify for  more cash. A family of three could pull in $250,000 per year--a quarter  of a million dollars--and still qualify for some money.   Democratic leaders want to call this scheme ``survival checks.'' Only  my friends Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leader could look at  households in New York and California who make $300,000, in households  where nobody has been laid off, where earnings have not even dropped  during the past year, and conclude these rich constituents of theirs  need ``survival checks'' financed by taxpayer dollars and borrowed  money   Everyone sees the game here. These are the same Democrats who proudly  blocked the entire aid package for months because they tried to hold  out their special tax cuts for rich people in rich States. Now they say  it is a matter of survival to send another boatload of cash to people  making $300,000, regardless of whether they have experienced any  disruption at all this past year.   Even the liberal Washington Post today is laughing at the political  left for demanding more huge giveaways with no relationship to actual  need. Here is what the Washington Post wrote: ``Especially wrongheaded  . . . is the progressive left, spearheaded by Sen. Bernie Sanders . . .  who depicts the $2,000 as aid to `desperate' Americans despite the huge  amounts destined for perfectly comfortable families.''   That is from the editors of the Washington Post.   The Wall Street Journal, usually their opposite number, actually  agrees. These nontargeted ``checks are unnecessary,'' and struggling  households can access targeted support like ``expanded jobless  benefits, food stamps, child-care subsidies and much more.''   The liberal economist Larry Summers, President Clinton's Treasury  Secretary and President Obama's NEC Director, says: ``There is no good  economic argument'' for universal $2,000 checks at this moment. He  points out the CARES Act and the brandnew law will already have boosted  overall household income, relative to the economy, back to its  prepandemic levels, if not higher.   If specific struggling households need still more help after the  huge, historic package that was just signed into law 4 days ago has  taken effect, then what they will need is smart, targeted aid, not  another firehose of borrowed money that encompasses other people who  are doing just fine.   So, in my view, colleagues like Senator Cornyn and Senator Toomey  have pointed this out persuasively. But, more broadly, here is the  deal. The Senate is not going to split apart the three issues that  President Trump linked together just because Democrats are afraid to  address two of them. The Senate is not going to be bullied into rushing  out more borrowed money into the hands of the Democrats' rich friends  who don't need the help.   We just approved almost a trillion dollars in aid a few days ago. It  struck a balance between broad support for all kinds of households and  a lot more targeted relief for those who need help the most.   We are going to stay smart; we are going to stay focused; and we are  going to continue delivering on the needs for our Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 480,  S. 3985.
