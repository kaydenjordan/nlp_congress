 Mr. Speaker, my constituents and I are so blessed  to live, to work, and to play in the paradise that is south Florida.  But for our kids and our grandchildren to enjoy the same positive  experiences that we have had, it is vital that we act now to combat  climate change.   Creating a thoughtful dialogue on Capitol Hill about the harmful  impact of climate change is essential for us to be able to take  proactive action toward solving the challenges brought about by this  real and growing threat.   Congress can no longer dispute the fact that sea level rise has been  occurring steadily over the last 100 years. I have seen firsthand how  our streets keep flooding from king tides, which impacts our  constituents, businesses, tourism, and our economic livelihood.   There is positive progress emerging from south Florida. We have led  on sea level rise proposals with the Miami-Dade County Sea Level Rise  Task Force and the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that we put partisan politics aside and tackle the  inevitable threat of climate change.                            ____________________
