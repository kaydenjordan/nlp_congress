 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise to proudly recognize the  outstanding public service of Ackley Padilla, my brother, who is  retiring after nearly two decades of helping to lead the city of Los  Angeles.   Ackley is a proud son of Pacoima, CA--and I know that Pacoima takes  incredible pride in him. Ackley, my sister Julie, and I all learned to  value public service from our parents, Santos and Lupe Padilla. Ackley  made his career serving the people of the San Fernando Valley while  working for a number of local elected officials.   Ackley worked for the first Latino and the first Latina presidents of  the Los Angeles City Council. And, yes, that means that I was once his  boss. For the past 9 years, he has worked for council president Nury  Martinez. As her chief of staff, he has been crucial to Los Angeles's  response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including getting testing and  vaccination sites up and running, as well as food distribution sites  and other assistance for families in need.   In addition to his public service, Ackley is a passionate fan of the  Angels and the Clippers--and known hater of the Lakers and the Dodgers.  He clearly followed his father instead of his brother on those  decisions. Ackley is a proud dad to three wonderful girls--Kaylyn,  Kathryn and Khloey--and a proud handyman. He has come to love his  minivan, ``Pony Boy,'' and will surely drive into many adventures in  the years ahead.   The people of Pacoima, the San Fernando Valley, and all of Los  Angeles have benefited from Ackley's public  [[Page S3156]]  service. I wish him the best in his next chapter. And I promise an  extra cold refreshment on the next trip to Canelo's.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Fairness for Farmworkers Act, which I introduced today.   Throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, farmworkers continued to  keep our country going. This was especially true in California--the  agricultural heart of the Nation. California is the most successful  State in agricultural production and has the largest population of  farmworkers. In fact, more than one-third of our country's vegetables  and two-thirds of fruits and nuts come from California.   During a time of incredible hardship, farmworkers put food on the  tables of millions of Americans despite working in extreme conditions  and facing deep-rooted inequities in the workforce. The time to address  these inequities is now.   While the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act established Federal standards  for minimum wage and overtime pay, the law excluded millions of  domestic and agricultural workers, who were overwhelmingly people of  color.   In 2016, California recognized the need to provide farmworkers with  overtime protections. The California overtime law, which ensures  farmworkers have an equal right to overtime pay, is a model for this  Federal bill.   Farmworkers in California and across the Nation deserve an end to  discrimination in labor laws. As we work to rebuild from the pandemic,  we must also undo the discriminatory exclusion of farmworkers by  amending the Fair Labor Standards Act.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bill, which will improve the  lives of farmworkers and their families, create equity in our food  system, and benefit farming communities as the increased wages are  spent in local businesses.   This bill will gradually implement overtime pay over the course of 4  years and bring greater equity to the American agricultural industry  and greater prosperity to historically marginalized workers.   This legislation will also boost farming community economies as  increased wages are spent in local businesses.   I want to thank Representative Grijalva for joining me in introducing  this bill, and I hope our colleagues will join us in support of this  bill that would provide a measure of long overdue fairness for our  Nation's farmworkers.    Mr. President, the first thing you need to know about  picking radishes is that it is hard work. You have to work literally on  your knees, and you pick each radish out of the ground by hand--no  machines, no tools.   I learned how to pick radishes and parsley about 3 weeks ago when I  received an invitation from the United Farm Workers and the UFW  Foundation to spend a day working alongside them in California.   Now, I have said countless times that, day in and day out,  farmworkers show up to some of the hardest jobs in America. I have  always believed that farmworkers are essential, but not until that day  did I appreciate the physical demands of long hours on one's knees  under the Sun.   Many of the workers picking radishes are older than I am and have  worked in the fields for decades. They have labored through heat waves,  through storms, wildfire smoke, and more. They have labored through a  global health pandemic, and they are the backbone of our economy in  helping to keep food on our tables. Yet the majority of farmworkers  don't have legal status to live and work in the United States of  America. That includes those I worked alongside who were picking  radishes--people like Efren, who has worked on American farms for more  than 40 years, and Patricia, who has raised her children here.   Several of them told me that one of the hardest parts of being  undocumented was being cut off from their families in Mexico or in  other countries, being denied the opportunity of seeing their mothers  or their fathers one last time before passing away or being able to  attend their funerals to pay their last respects.   Imagine that heartbreaking choice of never seeing your parents again  because doing so means risking not being able to see your children ever  again. That is the fate that we are forcing on countless undocumented  farmworkers who fill our grocery stores with fruits and vegetables.  This is the choice that  [[Page S3164]]  we exacerbate every time we push immigration reform off for another  month, another year, another session of Congress. And this is why we  must pass legislation that creates a pathway to citizenship for  farmworkers.   Did you know that when you pick radishes, you get paid by the number  of crates that you fill? On the day that I worked the fields, it comes  as no surprise that I picked at a slower rate than the highly skilled  and experienced farmworkers, who depend on speed for their livelihoods.   Yet laws across the country leave farmworkers in a position of  uncertainty that few other workers have to face. If you are a  farmworker and you miss a day of work, there is no paid sick leave. If  you are a farmworker and you are injured on the job, you can't get  disability insurance. And living and working while undocumented means  worrying constantly about your status.   So when the Senate says that immigration reform can wait, we are not  seeing the people whose lives are at stake: Isidro, Armando, Isabel,  Epigemio. As they pick radishes, these workers are not taking jobs from  American citizens. I repeat: They are not taking the jobs of American  citizens. In fact, the opposite is true. We don't have enough  farmworkers to meet the demand, not just for radishes but for countless  other crops. As different produce comes into season, growers need  skilled labor on tight timelines.   Corporate leaders, small business owners, and economists agree that  we need more immigrants with more protections. The stakes for our  economy are high. Right now, American families are paying higher prices  not just at the gas pump but at the grocery store. Our labor shortage  is contributing to higher inflation. Over $1 trillion of America's GDP  is linked to agriculture.   All across the Nation, we rely on immigrant farmworkers. In North  Carolina, agriculture is the top industry, aided by tens of thousands  of undocumented workers in growing soybean, corn, and peanuts. In  Idaho, agriculture accounts for 17 percent of the economic output,  including a booming dairy industry. Around 90 percent of Idaho's dairy  workers are foreign born, the vast majority undocumented. In Texas,  agriculture is worth more than $20 billion each year. More than 100,000  immigrant workers, mostly undocumented, are employed on Texas's  ranches, farms, and fields.   I can go on and on, but I think the point is clear: This is truly a  national issue. The majority of all farmworkers lack legal status, and  growers say that more help is needed.   Congress can make a difference. We can do so by passing the laws that  farmworkers need and deserve. Our country cannot afford to wait. That  is why it was the first bill I introduced--the Citizenship for  Essential Workers Act--when I joined the Senate last year. I am talking  about the workers who keep us healthy and safe and fed, the workers we  as the Federal Government have deemed to be essential. They deserve  dignity; they deserve respect; and they have earned a pathway to  citizenship.   Today, I am also proud to introduce the Fairness for Farmworkers Act.  This bill will support fair pay for agricultural workers under the Fair  Labor Standards Act.   In 1 day, I had just a small dose of the physically demanding life of  a farmworker. Still, there is so much more that I could tell you about  the kind, funny, generous individuals whom I worked alongside that day.   As we shared a lunch of homemade tortillas, beans, and carne con  chiles, they told me about their hometowns that they miss, their  favorite music, and their dreams for their children. They had one more  message that they asked me to deliver, that they implored me to deliver  to all of you, and that is that you should come too. I was the first  U.S. Senator to accept an invitation to work in the fields. Last week,  my friend and colleague Senator Booker became the second.   I urge you, each and every Member of the Senate, to take this  opportunity, take a day to work alongside the heroes who feed America,  and then come back here, as I have, humbled and inspired to do our job.  Let's come together behind a solution so farmworkers can finally live  and work with dignity and security.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):   S. 4482. A bill to help persons in the United States experiencing  homelessness and significant behavioral health issues, including  substance use disorders, by authorizing a grant program within the  Department of Housing and Urban Development to assist State and local  governments, Continuums of Care, community-based organizations that  administer both health and homelessness services, and providers of  services to people experiencing homelessness, better coordinate health  care and homelessness services, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.    Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Helping  People Experiencing Substance Use Disorder and Homelessness Act, which  I introduced today.   Housing is a fundamental social determinant of health, and unhoused  individuals are often the victims of stark health disparities. Of the  more than 580,000 people experiencing homelessness in the United  States, an estimated 20 percent have a substance use and/or a mental  health disorder. Mental health concerns, including substance use  disorders, can cause and exacerbate homelessness.   A lack of affordable housing is the primary driver of homelessness,  and we are working to address this issue. Another piece of the puzzle  is to ensure housing and social service providers have the resources to  work together to ensure access to supportive services.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bill to provide essential  funding and tools for frontline organizations to coordinate health and  homelessness services.   If enacted, it will create a Federal interagency working group to  advise grantees on best practices. The grants will invest in programs  to build the capacity necessary to combat the United States' dual  homelessness and mental health crises.   I want to thank Representative Madeleine Dean for introducing this  bill with me, and I hope our colleagues will join us in taking this key  step to addressing challenges that have been exacerbated by the COVID- 19 pandemic.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Fairness for Farmworkers Act, which I introduced today.
