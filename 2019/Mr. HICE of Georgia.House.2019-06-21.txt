 Madam Chair, I thank my colleague, Mr. Allen,  for his leadership in this.   The U.S. Army's Cyber Center of Excellence is critical for cyberspace  operations, signal and communications networks, and electronic warfare.  The center carries out its important mission by developing mission  doctrine, educational programs, personnel, and facilities solutions. It  is of the utmost importance that we make sure this tradition of  training world-class, highly skilled cyber professionals is kept  intact.    Madam Chair, I urge passage of the Allen-Hice amendment to fully fund  this project, and I urge all my colleagues to do the same.   I thank my neighbor and my friend for yielding the time, and it is an  honor to work with Mr. Allen on this important amendment.
