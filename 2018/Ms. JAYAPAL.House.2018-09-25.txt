 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 6580, the Kerrie Orozco First  Responders Family Support Act.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsor for introducing this bill.   The bill, as is made clear by its title, is a tribute to Ms. Orozco,  a police officer in Omaha, Nebraska.   On May 20, 2015, after 7 years of service in the Omaha Police  Department, Kerrie was fatally shot in the line of duty while serving a  felony arrest warrant.   She was survived by her husband, Hector Orozco, and her two  stepchildren, Natalie and Santiago.   H.R. 6580 gives tribute to the sacrifice made by Kerrie and her  family by recognizing the sacrifices made by all first responders who  are killed in the line of duty as well as their surviving family  members.   The bill honors their sacrifice by speeding up the citizenship  process for the surviving immigrant's spouses, children, and parents of  slain first responders.                                time  2015    Specifically, the bill would waive certain physical resident  requirements for surviving immediate family members who are already on  the road to becoming citizens.   Current law requires such individuals to reside in the United States  as lawful permanent residents for 5 years before becoming eligible to  apply for naturalization. This bill would waive that 5-year requirement  and, thus, allow surviving family members to naturalize more quickly.  It is modeled on the Military Personnel Citizenship Processing Act,  which became law in 2008 after receiving unanimous support in both  Houses of Congress. That bill provides similar benefits to the  surviving immigrant family members of U.S. armed services members who  were killed in action.   H.R. 6580 simply recognizes that domestic first responders also serve  this country at great sacrifice both to themselves and their families.  This bill is the least we can do to recognize their service and their  sacrifice.   I congratulate Representative Bacon for introducing this bill and  ensuring its vote on the floor. Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank  Judiciary Committee Chairman  Bob Goodlatte and Ranking Member Jerry  Nadler for their support of this important piece of legislation.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Reciprocal Access  to Tibet bill, introduced by my colleague Jim McGovern, who has been  working on this issue for such a long time as our ranking member on the  Rules Committee and the co-chair of the Lantos Human Rights Commission.  I would like to thank him for his hard work and dedication to this  issue and on this bill.   The Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act is about fairness, human rights,  and careful U.S. diplomacy at its core. For too long, China has  restricted access to Tibet, preventing U.S. diplomats and journalists  from observing human rights abuses in Tibet and preventing Tibetan  Americans from visiting their home country. This bill seeks to reset  that table.   H.R. 1872 is premised on the idea that reciprocity forms the basis of  diplomatic law and the practice of mutual exchanges between countries.  This bill simply requires that, if Chinese officials, journalists, and  other citizens are able to travel freely in the United States, it is  only fair that their American counterparts are also able to do the  same; and if Americans are not granted the same access to Tibet that  the Chinese enjoy in the United States, then there should be  consequences.   This is more than reasonable and long overdue. Tibet is so difficult  to visit that a Washington Post journalist said in 2016, Tibet ``is  harder to visit as a journalist than North Korea.''   Mr. Speaker, I had the great honor last year of traveling with our  minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, and Congressman McGovern to Dharamsala  last year to visit with His Holiness, the Dalai Lama. It was a deeply,  deeply moving meeting with him, with the Tibetan Government in exile,  and the 10,000-plus people who came to a public celebration event while  we were there.   The world knows that His Holiness is a man of peace and tremendous  integrity. He has laid out a 5-year roadmap for negotiations with  China, and he is willing to work with China to find a way forward. For  any peace plan to get a footing, we have to work closely with our  global partners to push this issue at this time because, if His  Holiness should die, and he will eventually do so, a period of greater  instability is likely to ensure making the human rights issues and the  possible solutions still more intractable. The timing of U.S. actions  here is extremely important.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), my  colleague, the sponsor of this bill, and a great fighter for human  rights.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the actions called for in this bill are measured and  calibrated, measured in that they follow the line of traditional  diplomacy of taking careful steps without the dangers of over- escalation, but calibrated to achieve a real opening, to wisely use  U.S. power to open up an opportunity for the two sides to take their  next steps.   There are many Tibetan Americans throughout the United States whose  family members still reside within Tibet, and they are watching this  Chamber closely for signs that the United States is willing to help,  willing to allow them to return to visit their families, and hoping  fervently for a solution to the pain and suffering in Tibet and with  the diaspora that has been experienced by generations.   This is the time for bold U.S. leadership, and I do believe that is  what this bill offers tonight. Our timely consideration of this bill  takes an important step forward in leveling the global playing field.  This bill seeks to make simple policy changes to enforce reciprocity  between our two countries, to make clear that China cannot bar our  people from Tibet and continue to expect open access to our country.  Allowing for the freedom of movement for people in both of our nations  sets an important precedent going forward.   Mr. Speaker, let me just say that this has been an incredibly  important bipartisan collaboration that we have had. I am very grateful  to my colleague from Florida for her work on this, and I am also very  grateful to Chairman Goodlatte and to Ranking Member Nadler for their  work on this.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the minority leader, who has been a tireless  champion on this issue for decades, has led many of us to meet with His  Holiness, has worked with His Holiness to come here, and has been a  champion for human rights around the world.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I have no further  speakers.   Mr. Speaker, I would just say that we are incredibly proud to be,  hopefully, passing this legislation tonight with such bipartisan  support and reminding the world that the United States stands for human  rights. We stand for the human rights of Tibetans, and I thank my  colleagues on the other side for their work on this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
