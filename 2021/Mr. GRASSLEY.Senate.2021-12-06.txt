 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, this week marks the 80th year since  FDR delivered his ``Day of Infamy'' speech. That was in a joint session  of Congress. FDR told the Nation that the United States of America was  under attack. Besides that attack, Pearl Harbor changed the course of  history, including the future and fortunes of a young man from Russell,  KS.   Today, I come to the floor with a heavy heart. I am here to pay  tribute to my best friend in the U.S. Senate. Yesterday, Senator Dole  passed away at 98 years of age.   For 35 of those years, he served Kansans here in Congress. He also  was the second longest serving Senate Republican leader. When Iowans  first elected me to serve in the Senate, Bob Dole took me under his  wing. I couldn't have asked for a better mentor. He treated me like a  brother. Even when we disagreed, he treated me with respect. We shared  conservative, Midwestern values. Those values steered us to champion  fiscal discipline, American agriculture, rural healthcare, and limited  government.   From humble beginnings, the three-sport athlete at the University of  Kansas left his field of dreams. He left them behind to enlist and  serve his country. Near the end of World War II, he was called to serve  on the front lines in the northern mountains of Italy.   From the Great Depression to the ``greatest generation,'' Senator  Dole was battle-tested to tackle whatever life threw at him. During his  Presidential campaigns, he got to know my State of Iowa very well, just  like almost every Presidential candidate does. Bob loved my State of  Iowa. He won the Iowa caucuses twice. In 1988 and in 1996, I was proud  to join him on the campaign trail and crisscross the State, visiting as  many Iowans as possible in as many of our 99 counties as possible. I  think he earned an honorary nickname as Iowa's third Senator.   On the campaign trail, it was often my job to introduce Bob Dole, so  I am going to tell you about some of those introductions and about how,  maybe, sometimes I screwed them up, but it was all with the intention  of honoring my friend and fellow Senator, a person who I thought would  make a very good President of the United States.   So I would start out these meetings by telling the story about the  day he nearly lost his life on the battlefield. I wanted to show how  this young soldier from the Kansas prairie led a platoon of mountain  troops to flush out the enemy--far, far afield from serving chocolate  malts at Dawson's Drug Store in Russell, KS.   To illustrate his grit, his courage, and his resiliency, I explained  how a then-21-year-old soldier belly-crawled across a mountain valley,  under heavy artillery, to secure what I thought was Hill 15--or was it  Hill 13?   Then Bob Dole would chime in--kind of interrupt me--with some witty  remark. More often than not, I flubbed the name of that hill in my  introduction of this Presidential candidate to the voters of Iowa. He  patiently said to me that it was not Hill 15; it was Hill 913.   Humble through and through, he didn't share that his injuries left  him paralyzed from the neck down. Rather, he joked that I got the name  of the hill wrong. He went on to say that what is important is that we  are in the right State--meaning Iowa--at the right time, and right now.   Senator Dole's legacy was secured that day on the Italian  mountainside. As Second Lieutenant of the 10th Mountain Division, as he  pulled his radio operator to safety, Bob's right shoulder was nearly  blown away. The hit paralyzed him from the neck down. He waited for  hours in the pouring rain, bleeding and in pain, before being carried  down the mountain.   Bob Dole was eventually sent home to Kansas in a body cast. He  endured years of surgery, infections, rehabilitation in his relentless  pursuit to walk again, and he did walk again. He learned how to write  with his left hand, his right arm remaining paralyzed. Bob never forgot  the people who helped him along the way: a doctor in Chicago or the  medical professionals in Italy. They made it possible for him to serve  later on in elective office.   Even though Senator Dole endured more than his share of hardship, it  surely didn't take away his sense of humor. Anybody who knew him knew  that there was hardly a speech or a conversation in which something  witty wasn't said. He was a master of witty one-liners, and he could  defuse red-hot partisanship with a single quip.   As Republican Senate majority leader, he finessed thorny policy  issues with no-nonsense charm. He was able to find consensus with  allies and adversaries alike. When Senator Dole became chairman of the  Senate Finance Committee, he and House Speaker Tip O'Neill forged  bipartisan consensus to rescue Social Security; and here we are, 35  years later, still rescued but still in need of some help. Less than 10  years later, he helped to broker the Americans with Disabilities Act of  1990 of which my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, played a very  major role.   His compassion for the disadvantaged informed his legislative  achievements to expand Medicaid, school lunches, hospice, and food  stamps. Senator Dole was awarded the World Food Prize in Des Moines  with Senator George McGovern--a dual honor, that it was. That was the  year 2008. They got this World Food Prize for their work to combat  hunger, specifically nutrition for children in poverty.   He never forgot from where he came, and his legislative record  reflects his compassion for others. He was a compassionate conservative  because of his instincts and because of who he was and not as a  political gimmick. Senator Dole had an uncommon ability to make you  feel like you were the most important person in the world. He was  plain-spoken, not a smooth talker. His authenticity wasn't  manufactured. It pumped through his bloodstream, shaped by the  hardships in the dust bowl and sacrifice as a war hero.   His Midwestern instincts guided his decision on one crucial factor  here in the Senate--the looming deadlines. He knew when to fish or cut  bait. Senator Dole mastered the art of compromise, embracing  transparency and banked trust and the respect of supporters and  opponents alike.   Senator Dole knew what it took to make the Senate work. We all know  that it is not so very easy to make the Senate work. One former  majority leader referred to the job as majority leader as a job of  ``herding cats.''   Leader Dole was effective because he was exceptionally skilled at  figuring out what each side needed to claim victory. You can't be an  effective leader if you don't have followers, and Dole had lots of  them. He was a war hero and a workhorse rolled into one; a soldier, a  Senator, a statesman. He led the 10th Mountain Division to defeat  tyranny and championed the 10th Amendment to uphold the blessings of  freedom and liberty.   When Senator Dole stepped away from public life, he didn't stop  public service. He poured his heart and soul into honoring veterans. He  was instrumental in getting the National World War II Memorial  established. For nearly two decades, he went there often to greet  veterans at the memorial face-to-face, each time thanking them for  their service and their sacrifice.   Barbara and I extend our condolences to Elizabeth and the entire Dole  family. So many are grieving the loss of this extraordinary American  here at home and also around the world. From his former colleagues to  the corps of loyal staffers who worked with him here in the U.S.  Senate, to legions of volunteers and supporters who worked for him on  the campaign trail, Senator Dole was a widely respected leader on both  sides of the aisle.   Senator Dole referenced Scripture when he resigned from the Senate in  1996 to hit the Presidential campaign trail at full speed. He said:         To everything there is a season.    A quarter-century has passed since he shared those very words with us  here in this Chamber.   Today, the time has come to say farewell to my mentor and brother in  Christ, Robert Joseph Dole. The Lord has called him home as a loyal  servant.  [[Page S8927]]    Until we meet again, enjoy the new balcony of Eternal Paradise. It  has got a better view to keep watch over Washington and your beloved  Sunflower State.   It is fair to say that ``Dole Beach'' is now even closer to the Sun.   May you enjoy the warm sunshine upon your face in life everlasting.  And may the yoke of hardship born upon your shoulders, worn with grit  and grace, weathered by ravages of time and war, be taken now by our  Lord God and Savior.   Always at the end of the day on the campaign trail, whether it was  getting on an airplane to fly to the next stop or whether it was in a  car going to the motel or a car going to a restaurant, we always heard  Dole at the end of a day of maybe four or five campaign stops saying  ``Free at last. Free at last.'' Well, Bob Dole now is free at last.   Godspeed, my friend. You have made a difference in my life. You have  made a difference in our country. Your service and sacrifice will be  celebrated for generations to come.   I yield the floor.
