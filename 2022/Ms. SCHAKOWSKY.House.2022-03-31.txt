 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, Americans pay 10 times as much for insulin as do any  other consumers in countries around the world. The exact same drug. You  know, we actually have the names of people who have died because they  could not afford their insulin and started to cut back on their  prescribed amount. And that is just unacceptable.   Big Pharma has been gouging consumers for a long time, even for  lifesaving drugs, and it is time to stop it. The Affordable Insulin Now  Act will make insulin $35 a month for millions of Americans, and it  will save life after life after life. This is only the start. We have  to make sure that all Americans have access, including those who have  no insurance.                                time  1445
