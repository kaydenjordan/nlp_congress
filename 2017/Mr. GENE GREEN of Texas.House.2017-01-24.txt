 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my  opposition to H.R. 7, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act.   Longstanding federal policy explicitly prohibits the use of federal  funds for abortions, except for certain narrow circumstances of rape,  incest, or severe health complications that threaten the life of the  mother.   The Affordable Care Act (ACA) maintains this ban and a federal  appeals court confirmed that no federal dollars may be used to pay for  abortion services under the law.   Far more sweeping in scope than the title implies, the No Taxpayer  Funding for Abortion Act goes well beyond codifying the Hyde Amendment  and protecting public funds.   This bill intrudes on women's reproductive autonomy and access to  health care, manipulates the tax code to put additional financial  burdens on many women and small businesses, and unnecessarily restricts  the private insurance choices available to consumers today.   The House of Representatives should be spending our time working to  improve access to health care for all Americans, instead of deceptive  legislation that interferes with a woman's ability to make personal,  private medical decisions.   I urge my colleagues to stop the relentless attacks on women's health  and vote against this damaging, unnecessary legislation.
