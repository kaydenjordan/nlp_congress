 Madam President, I want to thank Senator Murkowski for  her hard work.   For the Alaskans who are watching, what just happened here is kind of  quick but important. The U.S. Senate just passed our bill, the PVSA  suspension act, that is going to give our tourism season and the  thousands of Alaskans in that industry and the hundreds, if not  thousands, of small businesses that are hanging by a thread a fighting  chance for this summer--a fighting chance for the summer. That just  passed the U.S. Senate and is going over to the House.   So, again, I want to thank Senator Murkowski for her leadership on  this and, of course, the Senators that she mentioned who were very  engaged: Senator Lee, Senator Markey, Senator Blumenthal, Senator  Cantwell, Senator Wicker.   You know, this, to me, is an example of the U.S. Senate working at  its best--at its best. What was going on here and what we did for the  last several weeks is we went to all of our colleagues and said: Look,  we have a unique problem right now. In the Great State of Alaska, we  are so proud of how we have done in terms of getting through the health  aspects of this pandemic, but our economy is getting crushed for a  whole host of reasons I have talked about on the floor here many, many  times. One of the huge areas is the tourism sector and the unique  challenges we have with the borders being closed by the Canadians,  which is not helpful; the cruise ship industry not being able to move;  and the millions of passengers who were expected to come to Alaska on  cruise ships.   So we were going to each Senator and saying: Look, we know you have  big, philosophical differences on some things that relate tangentially  to this issue, but right now this issue is very narrow. Help us help  our constituents. That is it. It is not going to impact any other  State.   And to our colleagues' credit, all of them said: OK, Senator  Murkowski, Senator Sullivan, we will help.   And that is a good spirit of cooperation. We essentially went to them  and said: Hey, if your State had a problem uniquely focused on just  your citizens, we would help you.   So that is what you just saw here. It took a little while. That is  OK. Nothing moves fast in the U.S. Senate, but that is a step forward-- an important step forward.   But we still have work to do, as Senator Murkowski mentioned. This  bill right now is going to be heading over to the House, right now, and  we certainly hope, with the great leadership of the dean of the House,  Congressman Young, and all his relationships in the House, that the  House is going to show the same cooperative spirit that we just  witnessed here on the U.S. Senate floor. So we are hoping for that.  That is the next step.   But as Senator Murkowski mentioned, we are working all kinds of  different angles--plan B, plan C, plan D. We need the CDC to continue  its progress, finally--frustrating but finally. They need to continue  to provide detailed guidance to operationalize their lifting of the no- sail order.   And as Senator Murkowski also mentioned, we are going to continue to  work with our friends in Canada--``O Canada.''   Now, you know, in Alaska, we have one neighbor. We don't have any of  our wonderful lower 48 States as neighbors. We have Canada. We don't  really include Russia. Canada. So I would say that the Alaska  delegation is probably the most pro-Canadian, certainly the most  knowledgeable about Canada issues of any delegation in the U.S.  Congress. We work to help them out on issues--big issues, small issues,  trade issues, NORAD, military issues, mining. We have a great  relationship--the Alaska-Canada relationship. But, to be frank, we are  not getting a lot of help right now. The border is closed--fully  closed. We think that is pretty draconian, to be honest.   Alaskans are having a hard time even driving home to get through  Canada. We put forward a number of very reasonable suggestions to try  to accommodate what we are hoping will be a fighting chance for our  tourism season, for our small businesses that have been so decimated by  this pandemic.   To our colleagues in Canada, reasonable compromises in the event that  we don't make progress here--we are making progress here in the U.S.  Congress. That is good, again, so that we can have a fighting chance  for somewhat of a tourism season this summer. But up until now, all of  these suggestions--they are really not even neighbors to the north;  they are neighbors for us to the east--haven't gotten a lot of  cooperation. So this is not the cooperative spirit that has defined the  Alaska-Canadian relationship for decades, and quite frankly, we have  been disappointed by it.   So to our House colleagues--Democrats and Republicans--you have just  kind of witnessed two examples of cooperation. What happened here on  the Senate floor just a couple of minutes ago was really good  cooperation. All 100 Senators essentially had to agree to move this  bill forward, and they just did. That is what just happened. That is  good cooperation.   We haven't had such good cooperation from our Canadian neighbors-- disappointing. But look, my own view is that we need to start making  sure that the Alaska economy is not held hostage to another country. We  are going to start working on that.   But until then, to our House Members, please, if you can look at what  just happened in the Senate, listen to Congressman Young, whom you all  know is a great advocate. If we can get this done in the next 24, 48  hours, our State--your fellow Americans, who are working hard like  everybody else here to get out of this pandemic--will have a fighting  chance   With that, I yield the floor.    Madam President, it is Thursday, and it is that time of  the week I come down on the Senate floor and get to do one of my  favorite things of the whole week. I get to recognize the special  Alaskan, someone whom we call the Alaskan of the Week.   But before I talk about our Alaskan of the Week--and my good friend  from Texas, Senator Cornyn, just talked about the importance of  supporting our police and leaders in the police forces, and it is  National Police Week. It is very appropriate that the Alaskan of the  Week this week is outgoing Anchorage Police Chief Justin Doll.   I am going to tell you a lot about Chief Doll's great career in  Alaska. I want to first begin by just giving a quick little update. I  know people who watch the Alaskan of the Week want to know: Hey, what  is going on in Alaska right now? It is such a great place, a special  place.   Right now, it is approaching midnight Sun time in most places across  the State. I will give you one example. In Anchorage, the Sun  officially rose at 5:16 a.m. and will set at 10:37 p.m. That is a lot  of daylight. Twilight actually starts around 4 a.m. and ends around  midnight.   We are getting to that midnight Sun time, summer solstice time. A  frenzied energy hits the State at this time of year. It is all the more  so because the State is opening up, like so many States across America  now, after a  [[Page S2514]]  long year of hunkering down--late night walks, softball, yard work,  gatherings.   If you are watching and you have never been to Alaska, it is a great  time to be in Alaska. I urge everyone in the Gallery and at home to  come on up to Alaska.   You may have seen some of the action on the Senate floor a couple of  minutes ago. It is looking more and more like we are going to have,  hopefully, at least part of a cruise season. But we are welcoming  everybody to come to Alaska this summer. You will love it. Heck, you  can even get vaccinated if your State is not doing that for you, so  come on up.   We all know that what makes the State truly great is not the hours of  Sun it gets or its salmon-choked streams and rivers or the magnificent  wildlife--moose, bear, caribou--or the soaring mountains, all of which,  of course, in Alaska we have in spades. Nothing makes our communities,  our State, our country strong like the people who live in our  communities, and none are perhaps more important to community strength  and cohesion than our brave first responders, our police officers who  wake up every day determined to protect others.   I know there is a movement across the country, and Senator Cornyn  just talked about it--in my view, a dangerous movement--and that is the  call to defund the police. It makes zero sense, by the way. You want  your communities safe, and you are going to get rid of your police? It  makes no sense.   Here is the thing about police officers like Chief Doll and first  responders. These jobs are not only important, in my view, they are  sacred. Now, every job in America is an important job, but there is  something special, there is something even sacred about the job of our  first responders--police, firemen, our military--whose job it is  literally to go lay down their lives for their fellow citizens if  called to do that. That is sacred.   I think it is important for all of us here in the Senate to be very  clear how much we support our police and our first responders all  across the Nation, especially during this week. That is why I am so  honored and thrilled in many ways to be able to recognize our Alaskan  of the Week this week, who is outgoing Anchorage Police Department  Chief Justin Doll, who has served with APD for 25 years and has been  the chief of the department since 2017. Justin has worked with,  supported, and overseen more than 600 members of the APD, brave men and  women who keep about 300,000 residents in the Anchorage area, my  hometown, safe--roughly 200 square miles.   Let me tell you a bit about Justin, who also happens to be a Marine  Corps brother of mine--a man of service, a man of honor, courage, and  commitment. Born and raised in Oregon, he moved with his family to  Anchorage in 1985 when he was just 12 years old. The country was coming  out of a recession. Alaska was doing well. His parents saw opportunity,  so they packed their U-Haul and drove up to Alcan.   His mother ended up working in an orthodontist office, and his father  worked for 22 years at the famous Hotel Captain Cook, one of the great  locally owned hotels in all of Alaska.   Justin graduated from West Anchorage High School, and after a few  years in college, he joined the Marine Corps Forces Reserves. Now, he  didn't join just any Marine Corps reserve unit; he joined Echo Company,  4th Recon Battalion--the premier cold weather recon unit in the U.S.  Marine Corps, reserve or active. How do I know? Because I was serving  in that unit with Chief Doll for 5 years. As a matter of fact, I was  Justin's platoon commander. Now, he laughingly describes himself as my  Marine Corps disciplinary challenge. I don't remember him as a  disciplinary challenge; I remember him as a fine marine and a great NCO  who did a really good job with Echo Company.   In 1996, he was in the Reserves at that time, and he got a job with  the APD. A lot of the marines in Alaska join our law enforcement, which  is another great path into service. He didn't grow up wanting to be a  police officer, but when presented with an opportunity to serve his  community as he was serving in the Marines, he jumped at it, and he  excelled. Throughout the years, he served as a patrol officer, an  academy instructor, a motorcycle officer, a SWAT team member, a patrol  shift commander. He was on the bomb squad and was a commander of the  Homicide and Robbery/Assaults Detective Units. He did it all, and he  did it all well.   Here are some of the ways in which his colleagues and his bosses have  described him throughout his years in his fitness reports:  ``Outstanding performance''; ``proactive leadership''; ``Gives credit  where credit is due''; ``genuine concern for his fellow officers'';  ``earned the respect of everybody''; leadership philosophy is to help  guide and train up leaders to rise''; ``committed to excellence.''  Those are his reviewing officers' remarks.   His executive assistant, Gia Currier, talks about how, when people  would meet Chief Doll, community members--young kids; it didn't  matter--he never introduced himself as ``chief.'' He would just say:  ``Hey, I'm Justin.'' She said:         He makes me proud to work at APD, and I am grateful to have       had the opportunity to work and learn from him.    It should be noted here that, in the meantime, in 2000, he married  fellow police officer Monique, and in so doing, like many of us-- certainly, like me--he married up. Like Justin, Monique also rose  through the ranks to become one of the APD's top detectives. In fact,  she was the lead in catching one of the most sickening serial killers  in Alaska's history, Israel Keyes. We are so grateful for her  dedication and service to our State and our community.   We have a very unique community in Alaska, in Anchorage. We have  earthquakes. Not too far away, we have volcanoes. We have 100-mile-an- hour windstorms. Our moose charge, and our bears attack sometimes.  Once, when he was at a national training event with big-city police  officers from across the country, he was talking to his fellow police  chiefs, over beers, about bears and what was going on in their  respective cities. He told the group how just the day before, a brown  bear had charged, mauled, and tragically killed an Alaskan resident.   Terry Monahan--at the time, the police chief for New York City--said:         What? In the city? How do you deal with that?    By the way, I am pretty sure Justin, when he was telling that story  to us, cleaned up the language from the New York City police chief when  he recounted that story. But these are the many things that a police  chief in Alaska has to deal with, has to be ready for, and has to be  able to lead on.   Like all cities, we have had serious problems with crime. As a matter  of fact, in 2017, right when Justin took over as the chief for the  Anchorage Police Department, my hometown of Anchorage was going through  a very serious, major crime spree. Violent crime was way up. Homicides  were breaking records. Property crime and vehicle crime were way, way  up. Justin got to work. He focused on making sure his officers had the  training they needed to do their jobs. His goal was ``to set them up  for success and let them be successful.'' His motto: ``One Team, One  Mission.'' It sounds a lot like a marine: ``One Team, One Fight.'' He  put a focus on engaging with the community. He organized the beats so  that the officers got to know the people in their areas and patrolled  those same areas during the course of their time. He brought back  walking beats in the downtown area. He and his officers attended  community council meetings and joined the communities throughout the  entire city in smaller gatherings.   Now, as I mentioned, Anchorage is a big city in terms of area, but in  a lot of ways, it is really a small town. Word gets around. When you  get to know your police officer, you trust your police officer, and you  begin to work with that person to make your community safer. That was  Justin's philosophy, and that is what started to happen. At its heart,  community policing is not more complicated than that, according to  Justin, Chief Doll. Getting to know one another, respecting one  another, trusting one another--that is how communities become safe.   He also worked on forming partnerships with the Department of  Justice, the Attorney General's Office, and the FBI, which doesn't  always happen in other localities across the country. Again, Anchorage  is a big city and a small town. Federal agents were also having their  cars stolen. They had  [[Page S2515]]  friends whose houses were getting broken into. This crime spree became  personal for everybody, and everybody started to work together--with  Chief Doll in the lead to solve it. Again, word got around. All of it-- training, empowering police officers, working with the Feds, community  engagement--started to work.   We still have challenges, no doubt, in Anchorage, but since the time  Justin Doll started, homicides have gone down almost 50 percent. The  rates of property crimes and other violent crimes have also come down.  That is a win. Mostly, it is a win for the people of Alaska, for the  people of Anchorage. So Justin is leaving the department a winner, and  he is also leaving the department with good memories. That was  important to him.   There are challenges, and he recognizes those. Burnout, he said, is a  problem, particularly these days. He didn't want to get that, and he  hopes his fellow officers don't get that. According to Justin--he said:  ``The world's a little insane right now when it comes to law  enforcement,'' and he sees for himself what that does to the morale of  his officers. He has experienced how disheartening it is to have the  whole force, not just in Alaska but across the country--these are  hundreds of thousands of good police officers across our Nation who  have very, very stressful jobs--being disparaged because of the  horrific actions of a few.   Across the Nation, he said:         We have completely lost sight of the fact that there are so       many people doing a good job keeping communities safe every       day. These are people who really want to do a good job and       take care of the people and citizens around them.    We should remember that, especially during this week, National Police  Week, when we remember the sacrifices of so many of our frontline  heroes.   Justin and Monique, his wife, will be leaving the force permanently  in June. The current acting chief is Kenneth McCoy--also a very  impressive officer. We are all rooting for Chief McCoy. Of course, we  are rooting for Justin and his future endeavors. As we are for all of  our police officers across the country, we are thankful for Chief  Doll's service--fulfilling his sacred duty--for keeping us safe, and  for keeping our communities whole.   So, Justin, one more time, congratulations on a great job.  Congratulations on being our Alaskan of the Week.   Semper Fi.                                    Energy     Madam President, I would like you to hear a quote:  ``You know, if you drive an electric car, this would not be affecting  you, clearly.'' That was from our Secretary of Energy, Jennifer  Granholm, yesterday, as she told reporters all about the cyber attacks  on the Colonial Pipeline and the ensuing gas shortages and price  spikes.   Think about that, America.   Of course, the media just let her go. They didn't ask her if she knew  that, just as meat doesn't come from a grocery store, energy just  doesn't come from a wall. It doesn't just appear like magic when you  plug into it. It comes from many sources, including from natural gas,  including from oil.   The media didn't ask about natural gas--yes, and oil--needing  pipelines.   The media didn't ask her if she knew that all energy, including  alternative energy, requires transmission lines--lines that are also  subject to being attacked like the Colonial Pipeline.   They didn't ask her if she knew that the cost of an electric car, the  average price, is more than $55,000. Maybe that is a bargain for her,  but for the people the Biden administration is putting out of work in  the energy sector, that is a huge pricetag.   The media certainly didn't ask the Secretary of Energy how this  cavalier, condescending attitude, once again, about our energy sector-- one of our country's huge strengths that employs hundreds of thousands  of hard-working Americans--is received by the average American who is  being hurt right now.   There are so many questions that were not asked, so many questions  that aren't being asked about the Colonial Pipeline issue, and so many  that continue to not be answered by the administration when it comes to  this specific situation and how this administration's energy policies  threaten to make this short-term disruption of our energy supplies into  a long-term reality across the country.   The cyber attack on the Colonial Pipeline is a warning for America  not just from a cyber security standpoint but from a broader energy  perspective standpoint.   I participated yesterday in the briefing of U.S. Senators by the  Secretaries of Energy, Transportation, and Homeland Security on this  cyber attack that is creating disruptions in energy supplies across the  country, particularly on the east coast. Here is the advice I gave  these members of the Biden administration: Respectfully, I said that I  fear that this is going to be commonplace, this kind of disruption--and  not just from a cyber standpoint--if we don't change the Biden  administration's energy policies for America.   What was I talking about? They are restricting the production of  American energy. That is one of the great comparative advantages of our  country--that of producing more in oil, more natural gas, and more  renewables than any other country in the world. They are restricting  the production of oil and gas.   You have senior administration officials going to Wall Street saying:  Don't invest in energy companies. You have Federal Agencies that are  either killing pipelines or slow-rolling pipelines. None of this is  good for the country.   So here is the advice I gave them. Pipelines are good. We need them,  as this Colonial Pipeline shutdown certainly demonstrates. Importing  more oil from our adversaries like Russia is bad, but, by the way, that  is what is happening with the Biden policies. So we need a change.   We have plenty of oil and gas for Americans. We should produce it, as  we do, with the highest environmental standards for the benefit of our  own citizens and not restrict it or, this issue, this kind of  disruption is going to be much more commonplace in our country.   I yield the floor.
