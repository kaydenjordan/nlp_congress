 Mr. Speaker, across the United States, Americans are  finally seeing the administration of COVID-19 vaccines improve after a  slow rollout.   The development of two highly effective vaccines in under 1 year is  an unprecedented scientific accomplishment, but this effort is only  truly recognized when we can get vaccine into the arm of every American  who wants it.   That is why the first piece of legislation I introduced this year,  the Coronavirus Vaccine and Therapeutic Development Act, would  dramatically boost Federal investment in manufacturing and distribution  of the COVID-19 vaccine.   There is no greater public health priority than getting this vaccine  into the arms of every American, and I am committed to working with my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure the equitable  distribution of the vaccine.   To improve the facilitation of vaccine distribution, I have also  introduced bipartisan legislation with my colleague, Dr. Larry Bucshon,  that would improve and expand information-sharing between State and  Federal governments to ensure that vaccines are being administered  effectively and efficiently.   I urge my colleagues to join both of these bills so that we can save  lives and get our economy back on track.                            ____________________
