 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 5290) to extend authorization for livestock  mandatory reporting.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5290         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. LIVESTOCK MANDATORY REPORTING EXTENSION.         (a) In General.--Section 260 of the Agricultural Marketing       Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1636i) is amended by striking ``2020''       and inserting ``2022''.        (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 942 of the Livestock       Mandatory Reporting Act of 1999 (7 U.S.C. 1635 note; Public       Law 106-78) is amended by striking ``2020'' and inserting       ``2022''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 5290. Our agriculture industry is  the best, the greatest in the world. And at the centerpiece of it is  our livestock industry. And that is why we are gathered here.   Livestock mandatory reporting is an important tool that provides the  necessary transparency information to our livestock producers. This  legislation extends livestock mandatory reporting until the end of  September 2022, and it has bipartisan support with Democrats and  Republicans working together on this very, very important bill.   In talking to our great livestock producers, I have heard time and  again how important it is to extend this mandatory reporting program;  and that if we let it lapse it will cause significant problems for our  farmers and ranchers.   We are working together to make sure we get the job done the right  way. All of our industry groups agree on this important bill, and that  is the 1-year extension immediately of our livestock reporting.   Our Agriculture Committee held a hearing earlier this year that  extensively covered the importance of livestock reporting, mandatory  reporting. In that hearing, we also heard from a variety of very  distinguished industry representatives that, first and foremost, we  need to extend this program.   My committee's work on this issue--and while I am at it, I want to  really give great thanks and gratitude to our agriculture staff. They  have worked very diligently on this, and we are grateful for the hard  work and dedication of the House Agriculture Committee staff.   So, as I said, my work on this issue is indicative of how important  the livestock industry is to our fellow committee members, both  Democrats and Republicans, and to our Nation and the vital importance,  as the leading force, in our Nation's economy. That is where our great  agriculture system is today.   I am aware of some ongoing discussions and pending legislation that  seeks to reform the cattle industry, and we are going to deal with  that. We are dealing with that over in the Senate Agriculture Committee  and in our House committee.   However, we should not let negotiations of those reforms that we are  working with stand in the way of extending this vital program for 1  year. In recent months, we have seen cattle markets begin to recover;  prices for producers have moved up. This change in market dynamics is  important to account for as we look to reach a consensus point on the  framework of our reforms.   This 1-year extension will help to settle the concerns in the  livestock markets and provide certainty to our livestock industry,  while also giving our Agriculture members in both the House and the  Senate more time to come up with a consensus of the proposed reforms to  cattle markets.   We, in our House committee, are working with the Senate Agriculture  Committee. I am personally working with Senator Grassley on the Senate  committee so that we can have legislation going forward that has the  vital input of both the House and the Senate, and we are giving it the  time and  [[Page H7487]]  the interest that is needed, more time to have a consensus on the  reforms that other Members of Congress have ideas on.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1215     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I will just close right briefly with a big thank you to  my great staff, which is headed by the distinguished, smart, and  dedicated Anne Simmons. I don't know what I would do without her. Of  course, Ashley Smith, Prescott Martin, Daniel Feingold, Lesly McNitt,  Kelcy Schaunaman, and also my chief of staff, Catherine Kuerbitz. We  are a team, and I want to thank our staff.   Also, I want to thank our ranking member. We work together in a  bipartisan way. This is an example of how we Democrats and Republicans  have got to continue to do. We are here today setting this fine example  of strong bipartisanship.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 5609) to amend the Agricultural Marketing Act  of 1946, to establish a cattle contract library, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5609         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5609.   One of my goals, Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the House Agriculture  Committee, is to ensure that our farmers and our ranchers are treated  fairly. This bill, which creates a cattle contract library, will  improve fairness through increasing transparency in the marketplaces.   Mr. Speaker, over the past few years, we have seen significant  volatility in our cattle markets, and the Agriculture Committee has  held hearings to discuss this volatility and the events that  precipitated those price fluctuations.   As we look for ways to bring about parity to cattle markets, this  bill is one good step in that right direction.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend, Mr. Johnson, for his work on  this bill. This is a good reminder, another reminder, of the great  bipartisan legislation that is possible when we Democrats and  Republicans work together to address important issues. I thank the  gentleman, Mr. Johnson, for putting this bill forward.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no additional  speakers on this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time to close.   First of all, I thank the gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson)  for his dedication, hard work, and talent in putting forward this bill.   I believe that our ranchers, farmers, and those in the agriculture  industry are looking at a great day for agriculture today to get these  four important bills over to the Senate, where we will be working  together on them.   Mr. Speaker, again, I thank Mr. Johnson, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 4489) to amend the Act of June 20, 1958, to  require that certain amounts collected by the United States with  respect to lands under the administration of the Forest Service be  invested into interest bearing obligations, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4489         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``National Forest Restoration       and Remediation Act''.       SEC. 2. INVESTMENT OF CERTAIN FUNDS INTO INTEREST BEARING                     OBLIGATIONS.         Section 7 of the Act of June 20, 1958 (16 U.S.C. 579c), is       amended--        (1) by striking ``of any improvement, protection, or       rehabilitation'' and inserting ``of any assessment,       improvement, protection, restoration, or rehabilitation'';       and        (2) by striking ``Provided, That'' and all that follows       through the period at the end and inserting: ``Provided, That       any monies covered into the Treasury under this section,       including all monies that were previously collected by the       United States in a forfeiture, judgment, compromise, or       settlement, shall be invested by the Secretary of the       Treasury in interest bearing obligations of the United States       to the extent the amounts are not, in the judgment of the       Secretary of the Treasury, required to meet current       withdrawals: Provided further, That any interest earned on       the amounts, including any interest earned by investment, is       hereby appropriated and made available until expended to       cover the costs to the United States specified in this       section: Provided further, That, for fiscal year 2021 and       thereafter, the Secretary shall include in the budget       materials submitted to Congress in support of the President's       annual budget request (submitted to Congress pursuant to       section 1105 of title 31, United States Code) for each fiscal       year the proposed use of such amounts with respect to the       Forest Service: Provided further, That any portion of the       monies received or earned under this section in excess of the       amount expended in performing the work necessitated by the       action which led to their receipt may be used to cover the       other work specified in this section.''.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 4489.   This bill is an excellent example, again, of the strong bipartisan  work that can be accomplished through the Agriculture Committee. First,  I want to applaud and thank the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms.  Schrier) and the gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa) for working  together to get this legislation to the floor for consideration today  by the full House.   Mr. Speaker, we know that there are significant needs for investment  in restoration and recovery work on our great national forests. Our  bill this morning allows the Forest Service to keep interest on  settlement funds and apply these additional resources to restoration  work on Forest Service land that has been damaged by mining activities  and wildfires. All of us know of the devastation that these wildfires  have caused to our forests.   This is one of several major responses that we here in Congress are  responding to, to keep our forestry strong and to provide this much- needed financial help to keep interest on settlement funds and apply  those additional resources to the restoration work and the Forest  Service lands that were damaged by these terrible fires.   It will also allow for more restoration work to be done in some of  the areas where it is most needed, particularly the West Coast in  California. It will allow this restoration work, and I encourage all of  my colleagues to support this commonsense, bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Schrier), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Again, I thank Mr. Johnson for the time he has put into this bill.  The people of this country are very grateful, and we hope they realize  how we here in Congress are really responding to the challenges facing  our forestry, particularly with these wildfires.   A while back I recognized some of my staff, but we have had an  addition that I would like to recognize because he really worked  feverishly on this bill all the way up until this morning, I  understand, and that is Mr. Paul Babbitt. I would ask Paul to stand.  Mr. Speaker, I thank him for his work.   So much has already been said about this, but I am so proud of the  efforts of our full House committee because once we really began to get  into the ravages of these wildfires out West about a year back, we made  a commitment that we were going to make sure that we did everything we  can to save and prosper our great forestry industry, and we have done  it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this great bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 5608) to support research and state management  efforts on chronic wasting disease.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5608         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Chronic Wasting Disease       Research and Management Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Chronic wasting disease, the fatal neurological disease       found in cervids, is a fundamental threat to the health and       vibrancy of deer, elk, and moose populations, and the       increased occurrence of chronic wasting disease in regionally       diverse locations necessitates an escalation in research,       surveillance, monitoring, and management activities focused       on containing and managing chronic wasting disease.        (2) A focus on research into the transmission of,       resistance to, diagnosis of, and epidemiology of chronic       wasting disease is needed to inform future policies to combat       the disease and ensure the health of cervid populations.        (3) Because States and Tribes have diverse policies for       addressing chronic wasting disease, the Federal Government,       in consultation with the Chronic Wasting Disease Task Force       established by section 104 of America's Conservation       Enhancement Act (Public Law 116-188), should coordinate       financial and technical support to States and Tribes, State       and Tribal departments of agriculture, State and Tribal       wildlife agencies, institutions of higher education, and       research centers conducting scientific research on chronic       wasting disease.        (4) Pursuant to State and Federal law, the States retain       primacy and policymaking authority with regard to wildlife       management.        (5) Under current policies, chronic wasting disease remains       a systemic threat to cervids.        (6) Scientific advances that lead to the ability to stop       transmission of chronic wasting disease are needed to ensure       the long-term viability of cervids.       SEC. 3. CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT                     PROGRAM.         (a) Research Program.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date on       which funds are made available to carry out this section, the       Secretary of Agriculture shall establish a program under       which the Secretary shall offer to enter into cooperative       agreements or other legal instruments, as authorized under       10413 of the Animal Health Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 8312),       with eligible entities to conduct research on the       transmission of, resistance to, and diagnosis of chronic       wasting disease.        (2) Criteria for selection.--In entering into cooperative       agreements or other legal instruments pursuant to paragraph       (1), the Secretary shall give priority to eligible entities       that shall conduct research relating to--        (A)(i) methods and products to effectively detect       infectious chronic wasting disease prions in live cervids,       cervid excreta, the environment, and inorganic surfaces, and       to decontaminate such infectious prions; or        (ii) testing methods that significantly improve sensitivity       and accelerate timelines for test results on non-live       cervids;        (B) the long-term suppression or eradication of chronic       wasting disease; or        (C) determination markers for genetic resistance to chronic       wasting disease and strategies for using genetic resistance       to combat the spread of the disease;        (D) sustainable cervid harvest management practices to       reduce chronic wasting disease occurrence and to prevent or       limit spatial spread of chronic wasting disease; or        (E) factors contributing to local emergence of chronic       wasting disease, increased prevalence of chronic wasting       disease, and distribution of chronic wasting disease,       including mechanisms of disease transmission and effective       barriers to transmission.        (3) Size of awards.--To the maximum extent practicable,       individual cooperative agreements or other legal instruments       entered into under paragraph (1) shall be not less than two       percent and not more than 10 percent of the funds       appropriated to carry out this section.        (4) Administrative costs by eligible entities.--Of the       amount of a cooperative agreement or other legal instrument       entered into with an eligible entity under paragraph (1), the       eligible entity may use not more than 10 percent of such       amounts for administrative costs incurred by the eligible       entity in carrying out the research described in such       paragraph.        (b) Support for State Efforts to Manage and Control Chronic       Wasting Disease.--        (1) In general.--Subject to the availability of       appropriations, the Secretary shall offer to enter into       cooperative agreements or other legal instruments, as       authorized under section 10413 of the Animal Health       Protection Act (7 U.S.C. 8312), with State or Tribal wildlife       agencies and departments of agriculture to provide direct       financial assistance to support the efforts of such State or       Tribal wildlife agencies and departments of agriculture to       develop and implement management strategies to address       chronic wasting disease within their respective jurisdiction.        (2) Application.--A State or Tribal wildlife agency or       department of agriculture seeking direct financial assistance       under this subsection shall submit to the Secretary an       application at such time and manner, and containing such       information as the Secretary may require.

(4) Rapid response.--If a State or Indian tribe detects       chronic wasting disease in a cervid population within its       jurisdiction that was not previously infected, the Secretary       may, notwithstanding paragraphs (2) and (3), immediately       issue funds made available under subsection (e), in an amount       to be determined by the Secretary, to support State and       Tribal efforts to immediately control the spread of chronic       wasting disease within that population.        (5) Public education on chronic wasting disease.--The       Secretary, in consultation with State and Tribal departments       of agriculture and wildlife agencies, organizations       representing the farmed cervid industry, and organizations       representing deer hunters, shall develop and maintain       materials based on the latest scientific knowledge to be used       to educate the public on chronic wasting disease and       techniques to help prevent the spread of the disease.        (c) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Chronic wasting disease.--The term ``chronic wasting       disease'' means the animal disease afflicting deer, elk, and       moose populations that--        (A) is a transmissible disease of the nervous system       resulting in distinctive lesions in the brain; and        (B) belongs to the group of diseases known as transmissible       spongiform encephalopathies, which includes scrapie, bovine       spongiform encephalopathy, and Cruetzfeldt-Jakob disease.

SEC. 4. TECHNICAL AMENDMENT.         Section 10403(8) of the Animal Health Protection Act (7       U.S.C. 8302(8)) is amended by striking ``(25 U.S.C. 450b)''       and inserting ``(25 U.S.C. 5304)''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5608.  Chronic wasting disease is a devastating illness and has had  significant impacts on deer and other cervid populations around our  great Nation. And improving management of chronic wasting disease is  vital to containing the disease and preventing further spread of the  disease.   Currently, there is no cure for the disease, and passage of this bill  will also provide important research funding so that scientists can  better understand the disease and their transmission.   Mr. Speaker, it gives me a real special honor to recognize and say a  word about the great sponsor of this bill--two great sponsors, I might  add--Mr. Ron Kind, and Ranking Member G.T. Thompson, for their longtime  dedication on this important issue. Both of these gentlemen have been  working on this bill feverishly for quite some time.   Mr. Speaker, it is also special because of Mr. Ron Kind, one of our  stalwart leaders and tremendous contributors to the Congress and this  Nation, and most certainly to his great State of Wisconsin. But we all  have heard the news that our good friend, Mr. Kind, this will be his  last year here with us, and he has dedicated so much of his time to  this specific bill. He is a good man and a good friend, and he is also  a good friend of my own brother-in-law, Hank Aaron. And he, in  Wisconsin, who represents Eau Claire, played a very big role in getting  that statue up there for my brother-in-law, Hank Aaron. He sent me a  message when the Braves won the World Series. He said: David, Hank is  up in heaven smiling now.   I say to my friend: We are going to miss you. Great work here.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind), who  is the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this is indeed a very proud day and a proud moment for  us here in the House of Representatives. This bill is going to help our  agriculture industry, our deer, and a lot of our other animals.   This chronic wasting disease has been so devastating. Ron Kind has  been working on this for several years. He has not just jumped on this,  he has dedicated a lot of his time to this, and it is a great monument  to him as he leaves his service here in the Congress. Job well done, my  friend. Job well done.   Mr. Speaker, we have no more speakers. As we are concluding our four  bills today, I am so proud of the great work that our House Agriculture  Committee has done. We have them all moving over to the Senate, and so  our work, again, begins anew as it goes over.   We have good friends over there working. As I mentioned before, we  are working with my colleague, Ms. Stabenow from Michigan, who is  chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee; and as I mentioned  before, my friend, Senator Grassley. We are all going to come together  and improve these four bills even more so.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Johnson. I want to thank Kim  Schrier. I want to thank our entire committee. This has been a great  day, and I yield back the balance of my time.
