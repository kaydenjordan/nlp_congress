 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I would first like to start off by remembering Ray Baum,  whom this legislation is named after, very appropriately, and I thank  the chairman for sharing him with us. As was correctly stated by the  whip, we appreciate the staff that does so much work for us. Leaders  like Ray Baum are special. He will be missed, but we will carry on in  his memory and in the quality of service that he supplied.   The RAY BAUM'S Act does something that hasn't been done in over 28  years: it reauthorized the Federal Communications Commission. It is  amazing to think that we have a commission as important as that and it  hasn't been authorized--or reauthorized, or reauthorized. It is time to  do it and bring it up to this century, as well, and beyond.   This bipartisan bill is good, forward-thinking policy that modernizes  the FCC to ensure it is more transparent, efficient, and able to tackle  the issues of the 21st century. It maintains the credibility of  spectrum auctions and the promise the FCC made to Michigan  broadcasters.   It paves the way for new spectrum auctions that will allow for the  United States to maintain its leadership in developing and deploying  technologies such as 5G and, ultimately, win the race to 5G.    Additionally, it requires the FCC to report to Congress  on its efforts to promote broadband internet access for veterans,  especially low-income and rural veterans.   I would love to have broadband to my home, as well.   This bill is critical for consumers and our Nation's  telecommunications infrastructure, and I urge its passage today.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  appreciate the opportunity to talk about the truth.   We heard so much dismissal of the tax cut plan before we passed it.  Now that we passed it, not only did we read it beforehand, but  rereading it again we are seeing the truth is working out.   As I travel around, Mr. Speaker, the Seventh District of Michigan,  optimism about the new tax cuts is hard to miss.   I have people coming up to me at the grocery store, at gas stations,  even in church, saying: You know, Congressman, we heard a lot of  reports that this wasn't for middle class people, but I saw my paycheck  in February and, it is true, I got a raise because the government is  taking less out of it.   I have heard from a number of workers excited about their bonuses and  pay raises and from businesses that are looking to expand their  operations.   Just last week, I toured Lowe's home center in Adrian, Michigan, to  visit with their team. Because of the new tax law, their employees are  receiving $1,000 bonuses and expanded maternity and parental leave.    I toured Cintas' Lansing operations. The tax cut afforded their  employees $1,000 bonuses, and they reported to me that day that they  jumped now on a plan that they were holding off, but now they are going  to build a $17 million facility to add on to their operations.   We already heard about Fiat Chrysler giving out $2,000 bonuses to all  of their workers. They are also moving production of the Ram heavy-duty  truck plant back from Mexico to Michigan--I wanted to reiterate that-- that is coming home and creating 2,500 new good-paying jobs.   We have also seen announcements from DTE Energy and Consumers Energy,  utilities in Michigan and in other States, that their customers can  expect to see lower utility bills, thanks to the tax cuts. In fact,  they have submitted a request to the PSC for almost $400 million in  rate reductions. That is real money.   As Vice President Pence said last week when we welcomed him to the  Motor City, tax reform is working for Michigan.   Here is even more good news: the benefits are just beginning to kick  in.   This tax season is the last time taxpayers will have to file under  the old and broken Tax Code.   Under the updated Code, individuals and families at every income  level will see tax relief.   The standard deduction is nearly doubled to protect more of people's  hard-earned income from taxation.                                time  1715    The child tax credit is expanded from $1,000 to $2,000 to help with  the cost of raising kids.   With these new reforms, the typical middle-income family of four will  receive a tax cut of more than $2,000.   On top of that, the law will help small businesses thrive, boost job  creation here at home, and make our economy stronger and more  competitive, like it ought to be, in the United States and in Michigan.   For families across Michigan, the new tax cut law means bigger  paychecks and more money in their pockets, not in the Federal  Government's pockets. And that is where it belongs.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity at any time to put forward  truth, but, more importantly, truth that is optimistic, that builds on  our people, that builds on letting them do for themselves with the  resources they have earned.   Mr. Speaker, I express appreciation to my colleague for holding this  ``truth squad'' opportunity again tonight because people need more of  that. They need more optimism that comes from truth that impacts them  in a growing and positive way, and I am glad to be part of it.
