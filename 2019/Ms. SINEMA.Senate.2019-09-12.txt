 Mr. President, I join my colleagues in opposition to  cutting congressionally mandated support from critical military  construction projects in Arizona, the United States, and around the  world. This misguided effort takes $30 million away from Ft. Huachuca,  home to the U.S. Army Intelligence Center of Excellence, where all Army  intelligence professionals train at least once in their careers.   The $30 million was set to fund construction of a long-needed, new  facility to protect and maintain equipment used to replicate the  communications networks and threat displays of our adversaries. This  investment is critical to ensuring our Army intelligence professionals  receive the training they need to keep our country safe. Backfilling  these cuts will likely delay several other needed projects at Ft.  Huachuca and may lead to wasted taxpayer dollars as the cost of  construction goes up over time.   I recently saw firsthand how the training our soldiers receive at Ft.  Huachuca is essential in preparing our country to respond to threats  from Russia, China, and other bad actors around the globe. As we  continue to counter terrorism, we must consider threats our adversaries  pose across multiple domains--notably disinformation campaigns, cyber  warfare, and conventional military operations. Our intelligence  training mission at Ft. Huachuca is critical to our national security,  and our intelligence soldiers deserve our full support.   Ft. Huachuca is the largest employer in Cochise County, and the  residents of Sierra Vista and the surrounding communities remain  steadfast supporters of our brave servicemembers and America's  intelligence mission. They know personally that taking $30 million from  the base risks military readiness and our security.   This misguided plan weakens our national security and will likely  cost American taxpayers more money in the long-run, which is why I  thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have rejected taking  money away from these important military projects. We all support the  men and women of our Armed Forces and must work together to ensure they  have the resources and support to do their jobs and keep us safe.                            ____________________
