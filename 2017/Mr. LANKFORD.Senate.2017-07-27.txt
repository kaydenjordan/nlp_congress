 Mr. President, I would like to tell my colleagues a  couple of stories. We are going to talk about what is happening in  healthcare right now. There is the healthcare that is happening here in  this room in the debate that is ongoing that started months ago,  continuing to try to figure out the solutions to what we face with the  Affordable Care Act. Then there are the healthcare issues happening at  home.   Sometimes we get caught up in this conversation and think this is  what the center of the healthcare conversation is about. It is not. The  center of the healthcare conversation in America is around dinner  tables. Let me tell my colleagues what that conversation sounds like.   This comes from one of my constituents who just wrote to me. He said:         My premium increases from $1,308 per month to $2,489 per       month. This is for just my wife and I. We are self-employed       small business owners and simply cannot afford to pay nearly       $30,000 per year for health insurance. We will have to pay       the penalty for not having healthcare, but we have to eat and       pay our bills. Sadly, we are both in our late 50s, and we       probably need healthcare more now than ever. Mr. Lankford,       this is not the America that I grew up in, the America my       father fought to preserve in World War II.    That is the healthcare debate happening in America right now-- individuals who used to be able to afford their healthcare coverage,  but now they cannot and no longer have healthcare.   The Affordable Care Act did cover a new group of people who were not  covered before, but it also pushed out another whole group who used to  have coverage and now does not.   This is an extremely personal issue. This is not a political issue.  These are families and lives and children. These are individuals who  have cancer and diabetes and a history of genetic diseases in their  families, and they are very concerned about what happens politically in  this room because it affects their families and their real lives.   Congress needs to act on this. What is happening right now with the  status quo is untenable for families all across the country. Insurance  carriers have left the market. Rates have gone up dramatically. We have  fewer choices and more control but less control for families.   What does that look like in my State? Well, in my State, premiums  went up last year 76 percent--last year--a 1-year increase. I have  folks all the time who say to me that their great complaint is about  the rising cost of college tuition. Let me give my colleagues a  glimpse. College tuition has increased 76 percent in 15 years.  Insurance in my State went up 76 percent in 1 year. In fact, since  ObamaCare fully rolled out in 2013 until now, insurance in my State has  gone up 201 percent. That is not the Affordable Care Act; that is a  recipe to be able to push people out of insurance and keep them out.   ObamaCare was designed to force healthy people to buy insurance to  increase the risk pools for those insurance companies. But when you  can't afford the premiums, you are forced to pay this big tax. Now, the  question is, Who is paying the tax? Originally, ObamaCare said: Well,  people who didn't buy into the insurance who want to just take the risk  on their own, these wealthy individuals, they would have to pay the  extra tax. Really? What did that end up looking like? Again, coming  back to my State, 96,000 Oklahomans are currently paying the tax to the  IRS because they don't have healthcare insurance. Who are they? Eighty- one percent of the people who pay the penalty make less than $50,000 a  year. These are individuals who cannot afford the insurance, and they  also can't afford the fine that is coming from the IRS. It is a poverty  tax that the Affordable Care Act created to try to force these people  into insurance they cannot afford, and when they can't afford that,  then they get a big hit on their taxes as well. It is literally a no- win situation for them.   One of the major goals of the Affordable Care Act was to provide  affordable coverage. It was to be able to help people get into  insurance. It was to be able to help improve the safety net. Those are  not irrational goals. Those are good goals, but the execution of it was  terrible, and the implementation has caused more problems than it has  solved.   In my State, many physicians in rural areas used to be independent.  Now they have all been forced into working for big hospitals because  they can't afford the compliance costs to keep their office moving  anymore. So independent doctors and independent clinics are now part of  big conglomerate hospital companies. I am glad they are there, or we  would have no access to care at all.   My State used to have four insurance carriers in the State. Now it  has one, and that one is discussing leaving.   I hear all the time people who are mad at Republicans saying: Why  haven't you solved this yet? Quite frankly, this is an incredibly  difficult issue. But I also want to be able to respond back to people:  Don't gripe at the firefighters fighting the wildfire. They didn't  start it. We are trying to put it out. Yes, I know the fire line is  big, and, yes, I know it is difficult to put it out, but we are doing  our best to resolve a fire we did not start. We will resolve this.   So what is happening right now with our trying to resolve it? What  are we trying to accomplish? We are trying to do several specific  things dealing with the Affordable Care Act. This is not about  resolving everything in healthcare. There are, quite frankly, lots of  issues on which we have bipartisan agreement that we should work on in  the days ahead, things like prescription drugs and so many other things  we can do to help bring down the cost of healthcare itself, but in the  meantime, we do have a dispute.   Our Democratic colleagues have said to us that they want to be able  to cooperate with us on healthcare, but the parameters are that we have  to keep the individual mandate--that tax penalty on people in my State  for people who make $50,000 or less to pay this giant tax; they want to  keep that. They want to keep the employer mandate, which is  dramatically driving up the cost of insurance for employers and  decreasing wages. The initial estimates are that people in my State are  making about $2,500 a year less now than they would be because of the  employer mandate that is on them. So we can't negotiate and say ``Let's  form a bipartisan agreement on this'' if they want to keep the  individual mandate and the employer mandate. Those things hurt people  at home.   So here is what we are trying to do. This is a budget bill. It is  called reconciliation. We are limited to only budget-related items to  be able to deal with. So we are working on some of the basics of what  needs to be repealed in the Affordable Care Act. We do want to get rid  of the individual mandate. We do want to get rid of the employer  mandate.    We do want to deal with how we can take control of healthcare out of  Washington, DC, and get it back to the States, where it used to be.  Prices are much cheaper when there is local control on healthcare than  when there is Federal, centralized control.   We would also like to find a way to get some of the bureaucracy out  of this. You see, when there is a healthcare dollar paid and it first  has to pay the Federal bureaucracy, then it goes to the State  bureaucracy, then it  [[Page S4392]]  pays an insurance company bureaucracy, and then it pays a hospital  bureaucracy, there is not much of that dollar left to finally get to  patient care at the end. If we can take out one of those bureaucracies,  we can actually get more dollars to patients rather than having them  just feeding the bureaucracy of another layer.   We are simply trying to deal with the mandates that are there, who  actually makes the healthcare decisions for regulations and policy,  whether it is the State or the Federal Government, and how we are going  to balance out coverage for individuals who desperately need it in the  safety net.   I have heard a lot of folks talking about CBO scores. I will tell  you, I am in the middle, and I am very frustrated with CBO right now.  Every policy we want to float to say this is something we think will be  very effective to be able to help people in the safety net or to be  able to help people purchase insurance, CBO responds back to us: That  sounds like an interesting idea; it will take us about 4 weeks to study  it. When we are in the legislative process, when we are doing  amendments, we can't wait 4 weeks between each amendment. We have to be  able to get answers from them.   So we are stuck in this spot, so our resolution is--we have a House  version that has been scored, and we have a Senate version. We have a  lot of changes we want to make, even to our latest version. The best  answer we have while we wait on CBO scoring--another month to get us an  answer--is to be able to get an interim bill, get into a conference  between the House and the Senate, allow CBO the month that they need to  score this, and for us to be able to pass a better bill in September.  So that is where we are stuck right now.   This is not a final bill that is coming out. This is still an interim  process that is moving. But we need to be able to keep this process  moving because there are people at home who are counting on this  actually getting better for them in the future. Their words to me are:  This cannot get worse, because I can't afford what we currently have,  and I can't afford that access I have been given to healthcare.   In the middle of all of this debate, a lot of people on the outside  look at it and say: How come the Senate can't move faster?   I respond back to them: We can't get a score from CBO, so we can't  move any faster. We are stuck waiting on them.   They typically will call me and say: Well, just run over CBO.   We are not going to ignore the law, and we are not going to ignore  the rules of the Senate, but we are going to work to actually get this  right.   In the meantime, I have heard an awful lot of scare tactics coming  out. It usually circles around, there will be 22 million people who  will suddenly not have insurance. That is a fascinating number to me  since only 9 million people have ObamaCare right now. Nine million are  actually on the exchange. So it seems difficult to me for 22 million  people to lose what only 9 million people have. But if you are an  economist, they look at, on the horizon, people who may one day join in  at some point, and then those people who may have joined in then might  have lost their insurance. It makes total sense to an economist, but to  all of us who just look at math, it becomes very difficult.   CBO also believes that without a Federal mandate and a tax penalty on  individuals, they will not buy this insurance product. People do not  want to buy it and will not buy it unless they are made to buy it.   The problem is, there are 6.5 million people in the country who are  also required to buy it who are just paying the tax rather than buying  the insurance.   We need to allow people to make decisions on their own lives, but we  need to also make sure there is actually an insurance product they can  afford. And all the scare tactics about how we are going to throw out  preexisting conditions and people who have preexisting conditions will  be on their own--that is not true. Every single one that we have  debated has included protection for preexisting conditions. We all are  still honoring things like lifetime caps, annual caps. We have all  included 26 and under. If you want to stay on your parents' insurance,  you can still do that.   There have been all of these scare tactics, like this will throw  senior adults out on the street, and Medicaid is going to have these  dramatic cuts. I looked at one of the proposals that was put out by the  Senate and one of the drafts that we went through, and it said  ``dramatic cuts.'' Here are the ``dramatic cuts'' we had in Medicaid:  Every year for the next 8 years, Medicaid increased at twice the rate  of inflation. Every year for 8 years in a row, twice the rate of  inflation, Medicaid went up. That is twice as fast as Medicare goes  up--twice as fast as Medicare. So Medicaid was accelerating twice as  fast as Medicare, and then 8 years from now, Medicaid went back to  growing at the same speed as Medicare--at the rate of inflation. That  was the ``dramatic cut'' in Medicaid. Every year going up twice as fast  as inflation is a cut? Nine years from now, only growing as fast as  inflation is a cut? But it is being portrayed that people are going to  be thrown out on the streets and Medicaid is going away.   I would encourage Americans to understand that the conversation has  been a lot about political rhetoric. This body really is committed to  the safety net. This body really is committed to allowing people to  have choices again that they can actually afford for insurance. We are  really committed to taking control of healthcare out of Washington, DC,  and pushing it back to the States and to families so they can control  healthcare decisions again. That is the real debate that is happening  here. I know it is boisterous, and I know it is much easier just to  have bumper sticker comments, but at the end of this, we have to  realize there really are people who are involved in this, who are  deeply affected by it.   A couple more stories. A gentleman recently sent me an email saying  that he received word that his premiums are rising from $1,229 a month  to $2,205 a month to cover just him and his wife. His deductible is  rising to $4,000 a person. His out-of-pocket maximum is rising to  $13,000. That is under ObamaCare now.   Another person who wrote me is currently enrolled in ObamaCare now.  He is 62 years old, and his wife is 61.         Our monthly health insurance premium increased by 71       percent to $2,900 last year. My wife and I are healthy with       no major problems, so my health insurance is the size of my       mortgage payment.    That is under ObamaCare now.   Under ObamaCare now, a lady from my State wrote me and said that for  her first year, her monthly premium was $1,200. This year, she will pay  $1,900 a month. She just got a letter from the one insurance company  left in her State--the one opportunity she has to get insurance--saying  that her monthly premium next year will be $3,540. That is an increase  of 84 percent, or $42,000 a year, for insurance under ObamaCare now.  Her simple statement to me is, How is this possible?    I speak to some of my colleagues, and they say: Those stories aren't  true.   I say: Let me introduce you to some real-life people outside of this  political debate who are debating around their kitchen table about how  they are going to make it with the rates that have been put on them.   What we have now has to be addressed. I know this is a boisterous,  loud process. But as we walk through the process, the end solutions are  for these families, so that our noise helps them to actually move back  to thinking about their kids and what they are going to do next in  their retirement, and not to say: How in the world am I going to pay  for my health insurance anymore?   Let's get this finished. Let's move to the next stage. Let's get to  conference and try to resolve the differences between the House and the  Senate. By September, when we finally get a score back from CBO on all  of our scoring and they finally get us information on the things we  have asked for, let's get this passed so we can actually get this done.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.
