 Mr. President, today Senator Carper and I introduced the  Reclaiming Congressional Trade Authority Act of 2019. Enacting this  bill would restore the role on Congress in overseeing international  trade matters.   I have been outspoken against the abuse of executive authorities that  have been delegated to the President. Congress has a Constitutional  power to oversee international trade. We have recently seen an abuse of  this power, as with other executive authorities. This bill would  mandate expanded Congressional involvement in international trade  decisions by requiring the Trump Administration--and future  Administrations--to further analyze, communicate, and justify tariff  actions to Congress. Congress would then review new tariffs and if the  Administration used national security to justify the tariffs' need,  Congress would be required to approve them.   I am advocating for my colleagues to consider supporting this bill,  especially as the damaging effects of the ongoing trade war continue.  It's time for Congress to step in and act on our Constitutional duty.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DAINES (for himself and Mr. Tester):   S. 900.

Atkins Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic''; to the Committee on  Veterans' Affairs.
