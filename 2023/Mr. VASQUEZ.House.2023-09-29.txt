 Madam Speaker, I rise today to deliver a message on  behalf of Native American youth.   As the Representative of New Mexico's Second District with seven  sovereign nations, I have heard from leaders from the Center for Native  American Youth who are deeply troubled about their future. They are  asking for Congress to be good relatives.   Failing to pass an agreement means that over 30,000 Native parents  and caregivers who are Federal workers are at risk of being unable to  provide for their families.   It means over 70,000 Native students in Head Start, BIE schools, and  Tribal colleges and universities are at risk of a disruption in their  education, harm to their mental health, and food security.   I proudly represent Zuni, Acoma, Isleta, and Laguna Pueblos, and the  Mescalero, Fort Sill Apache, and Navajo Nations.   A government shutdown is a failure to uphold the Federal trust  responsibility with real-life consequences that disproportionately  impact Native youth and their families.   Native youth from across the country are asking Congress to do what  is right. Find an agreement. Be good relatives, not just in New Mexico,  but across the country.                            ____________________
