 Madam Speaker, as the Congress prepares to break for  Christmas, it is important to review one more time what we can do to  deal with the coronavirus.   While vaccines unquestionably have a role here, I am a little bit  appalled at the lack of information coming from the public health  establishment regarding vitamin D. Tests show that adequate levels of  vitamin D can reduce the amount of COVID cases by up to 75 percent,  which is good, including for people who have taken the vaccine.   Right now, Madam Speaker, experts feel you should have at least 30  nanograms per milliliter to have adequate amounts of vitamin D. Right  now, 65 percent of our White population, 87 percent of our Hispanic  population, and 96 percent of our Black population do not have adequate  vitamin D levels.   The public health establishment has to be asked: Why is this not  publicized? Why do we not give routine vitamin D tests to people coming  in for their annual checkups? And why, if you show up at the hospital  with COVID, are not vitamin D tests automatic?   I ask public health establishments to please familiarize themselves  with the benefits of vitamin D and the role it plays.                            ____________________
