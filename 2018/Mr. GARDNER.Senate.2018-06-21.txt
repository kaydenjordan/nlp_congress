 Mr. President, I thank my colleague Senator Bennet for  his work on this and the opportunity to work with him to make sure we  continue to honor our veterans and armed servicemembers.   Our veterans have served and our armed servicemembers proudly serve  this country in Active Duty. When they come home, though, one of the  obligations we have as a society and country to thank them for this  incredible service is to make sure they have the skills, education, and  training to integrate back into the civilian workforce. They obviously  have incredible skills which they have acquired during their military  service, and we can put them to use here at home.   This amendment simply says the Department of Defense and the  Secretary of Energy will evaluate military installations to determine  which ones are ripe for opportunities to work with community colleges,  institutions of higher education, and others so they can enter into  agreements to help train veterans--armed servicemembers, members of the  Armed Forces, to transition them into civilian life--to help work in  the cyber security fields, energy fields, artificial intelligence  workforce.   In Colorado alone, we have 13,000 job openings in cyber security-- 13,000 job openings in cyber security alone. This gives us a chance to  continue our service in thanking our veterans for the work they have  done in service to our country.   I thank my colleague from Colorado, Senator Bennet.   I yield the floor and urge my colleagues to vote yes.
