 Mr. President, I would like to discuss my decision to vote  against the President's nomination of Gina Haspel to be the next  Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, CIA.   First, let me state that I have immense respect for the men and women  of the CIA. I have had the opportunity to meet many of them and to  personally offer my thanks in some of the world's most dangerous  locations. Their work is difficult and demanding but critical to  helping safeguard our nation.   I do not question Ms. Haspel's patriotism, intellect, or dedication  to the CIA. She has ably served the agency and several Administrations,  both Democratic and Republican. Ms. Haspel is clearly a committed  professional.   I welcome Ms. Haspel's statement of support for the ``stricter moral  standard'' legislatively imposed by Congress with respect to  interrogation policies and her admission that, in hindsight, the use of  coercive interrogation techniques was a mistake. However, I remain  troubled that Ms. Haspel failed to clearly articulate a view that the  use of coercive interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, was  immoral.   As discussed in a 2008 report by the Senate Armed Services Committee,  the CIA's so-called enhanced interrogation techniques were based on  Survival, Evasion, Resistance, and Escape, or SERE, techniques used to  train members of our military to resist torture. There are those who  defend the use of such techniques by the CIA because similar techniques  were previously used on our own troops during training activities.  However, this argument ignores the fact that coercive interrogation  techniques were never intended to be used by U.S. interrogators to gain  actionable intelligence. Rather, the SERE techniques, which are based  on Communist Chinese interrogation methods used during the Korean War  to elicit false confessions, were developed to expose U.S. soldiers to  the abusive treatment they might be subjected to if captured by our  enemies.   There is simply no comparison between the use of such SERE techniques  in a controlled environment to train U.S. military personnel to resist  torture by an immoral enemy and their use by the CIA to interrogate  detainees after 9/11. There is also no basis for any assertion that  they are an effective means to gather intelligence, given their  original purpose.   Some have suggested that Ms. Haspel is being held to a higher  standard than that of former Director Brennan, who similarly served in  leadership positions at the CIA at the same time as the creation and  operation of the detention and interrogation program. During his  confirmation process, former Director Brennan stated that he was aware  of the program during his time at the CIA, but ``did not play a role in  its creation, execution, or oversight.'' He also testified, under oath,  that he raised significant concerns and ``personal objections'' to  colleagues at the time and stated that waterboarding is  ``reprehensible'' and inconsistent with American values.   Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Ms. Haspel. There is a lot  the public doesn't know about Ms. Haspel due to the CIA's selective  declassification of her record, but we do know that she joined the  CIA's Counterterrorism Center soon after 9/11 and held various  leadership positions in the Directorate of Operations that oversaw the  detention and interrogation program. We also know that Ms. Haspel  continues to be unwilling to make statements similar to those of former  Director Brennan condemning the use of torture.   Lastly, we know that Ms. Haspel supported the destruction of  evidence, namely 92 videotapes documenting waterboarding and other  coercive interrogation techniques by CIA officers and contractors,  despite known objections from superiors at the CIA and the White House.  That alone should cause serious, bipartisan concern. Ms. Haspel's claim  that she was just following orders is deeply flawed. It may be true  that there was no legal prohibition on the destruction of the  interrogation tapes, but that does not mean it was moral and ethical,  particularly in light of known objections from various senior  stakeholders.   At the hearing, I asked Ms. Haspel if she believed the destruction of  the tapes was insubordinate, and she declined to describe it as such.  Her refusal to clearly acknowledge and repudiate that error, even in  retrospect, sets a troubling precedent that could be cited by other CIA  officials to justify their own questionable behavior in the future,  including those under her supervision.   Never has it been so important to have a Director of the CIA that is  willing and capable of speaking truth to power. Ms. Haspel was  nominated to lead the CIA by a President prone to misinformation and  who, repeatedly, has advocated for the use of U.S. power and  capabilities in ways that are inconsistent with U.S. values, including  killing the families of terrorists.   I am glad that Ms. Haspel has committed not to restart a detention  and  [[Page S2789]]  interrogation program under her leadership, but I retain serious doubts  that she would stand up to President Trump if he directed her to carry  out another legal, but morally questionable activity in the future.  Taken together, Ms. Haspel's lack of transparency, unwillingness to  repudiate torture, and inability to learn from past mistakes do not  give me confidence that she is the right person to lead the CIA. I,  therefore, voted no on her nomination.                            ____________________
