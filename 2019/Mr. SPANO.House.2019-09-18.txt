 Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to and  celebrate the birthday of the United States Air Force.   Today's Air Force traces its lineage to the U.S. Signal Corps in 1907  but officially became its own branch as part of the National Security  Act of 1947.   During this period, the Air Force has been on the front lines of  racial integration, helped keep the city of Berlin fed for 11 months,  placed the first artificial communications satellite into orbit, and  continually maintained round-the-clock flights of an airborne command  post for three decades.   More significantly, their vigilance and reach have deterred  aggression while their speed, power, and sacrifice of life have  restored peace.   Today, on the 72nd birthday of the Air Force, the branch has grown  into a staple of the United States defense community. With over 600,000  Active Duty, Reserve, and civilian personnel, thousands of whom serve  at MacDill Air Force base in Tampa, it is imperative we give these  American heroes, past and present, the respect that they deserve.   Please join me in wishing the United States Air Force a happy  birthday and honoring the lives of all who have served.                            ____________________
