 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the distinguished  service of SPC5 James McCloughan, who was recently awarded the Medal of  Honor for his heroic actions as a combat medic during the Vietnam war.  From May 13 to 15, 1969, then-PFC McCloughan repeatedly put himself in  the line of fire to extract and treat his fellow soldiers.   Specialist 5 McCloughan was born in South Haven, MI, in 1946 and  spent his childhood in Bangor, MI. He became a four-sport varsity  athlete at Bangor High School and would go on to play football,  baseball, and to wrestle at Olivet College. Three months after  accepting a teaching and coaching position with South Haven Public  Schools, McCloughan was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1968.   McCloughan's superiors took notice of his knowledge of sports  medicine, and he was assigned to Fort Sam Houston, TX, to report for  advanced training as a medical specialist. Upon his completion of  training, McCloughan was assigned as a combat medic with Company C, 3rd  Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 196th Light Infantry Brigade,  American Division, and was deployed to Vietnam.   On the morning of May 13, 1969, two American helicopters were shot  down near Tam KY, and one crashed 100 meters from McCloughan and  Charlie Company. A squad was sent to rescue the downed crew and found a  wounded soldier too injured to move. McCloughan ran 100 meters through  an open field, dodging crossfire between Charlie Company and the NVA,  reached the wounded soldier, and carried him back to the company and  successfully saved his fellow soldier from being captured or killed.   Later that same day, McCloughan displayed another act of heroism in  the midst of an American airstrike against nearby NVA targets. While in  a trench, he saw two U.S. soldiers huddled together without weapons in  the midst of an ambush. McCloughan dropped his weapon and rushed into  the ambush to check on his comrades. While inspecting them for wounds,  he was hit with shrapnel when a rocket-propelled grenade exploded  nearby. McCloughan pulled the two soldiers back to the trench and would  go back into the ambush zone four more times to extract wounded  comrades. Wounded and bleeding himself, McCloughan refused to evacuate  and remained on the battlefield to treat the wounded and prepare them  for extraction.   The next day, Charlie Company engaged NVA forces near Nui Yon Hill.  Similar to the day before, McCloughan again went into the crossfire  zone numerous times to treat and extract wounded soldiers. He was  wounded again by RPG shrapnel and small arms fire. McCloughan again  showed his heroism when he volunteered to hold a blinking light in the  open while bullets and RPGs hit around him so his company could be  resupplied.  [[Page S6919]]    McCloughan continued to fight throughout the night and into the  morning, knocking out the RPG position and treating numerous soldiers.  He kept two critically wounded soldiers alive during the night and is  credited with saving the lives of 10 members of Charlie Company in the  48-hour timespan.   Upon returning home, McCloughan would resume his job as a teacher and  coach at South Haven High School. He taught sociology and psychology  and coached football, baseball, and wrestling until his retirement in  2008.   SPC5 James McCloughan is an American hero who consistently put his  life on the line to save the lives of his fellow Americans. He has  always inspired others, whether by his actions on the battlefield or  for his students in the classroom. I urge my colleagues to join me  today in congratulating and thanking Specialist 5 McCloughan for his  continued dedication and service to our Nation.                            ____________________     Mr. President today, I wish to recognize a  crusader and legal titan, the Honorable Damon J. Keith of Detroit, MI,  for his legendary 50-year career as a Federal judge.   Judge Keith's career in public service began during World War II,  when he served in a segregated military where he faced discrimination  as he served his Nation. The injustice he experienced led him to  dedicate his life to equality for all Americans.   Judge Keith received his law degree from the prestigious Howard  University. His professor and mentor was none other than the Honorable  Thurgood Marshall, who argued the landmark case Brown v. Board of  Education and the first African-American Justice to serve on the U.S.  Supreme Court. Just like his mentor, Judge Keith would go on to make  groundbreaking rulings.   While African-American citizens in the South suffered through the  institutionalized practices of segregation, Michigan was not immune  from racial discrimination. After his 1970 decision in Davis v. School  District of Pontiac, allowing busing to help integrate schools, Judge  Keith faced threats of violence from the Ku Klux Klan. Despite threats  placed against his own life, Judge Keith stood firm. Judge Keith  continued his fight for civil rights in 1971 when he found that the  city of Hamtramck practiced discriminatory community development which  largely displaced African American residents. He ordered the city to  replace the homes that were demolished. After the civil unrest in  Detroit in 1967, actions were taken to improve racial inequality in the  city. African-Americans accounted for one-third of Detroit's population  but were underrepresented in its government and police force. Judge  Keith ruled to uphold the city of Detroit's affirmative action plan and  its good faith effort to promote diversity in its police force.   Judge Keith heard cases that presented new questions and challenged  long-held interpretations of the Constitution. In the 1971 landmark  case, United States v. United States District Court, widely known as  the Keith Case, the Supreme Court upheld Judge Keith's ruling that the  Nixon administration could not wiretap citizens without a court order,  even in cases involving domestic terrorism. This ruling protected  Fourth Amendment rights for all Americans and enforced the boundaries  of warrantless surveillance, paving the way for the U.S. Foreign  Intelligence Surveillance Act, FISA, of 1978, which provides judicial  and congressional oversight of the government's foreign intelligence  surveillance activities.   After the tragedy of the terror attacks on September 11, 2001, and  the subsequent war on terror, we once again faced circumstances that  tested the balance between the power of the government and fundamental  civil liberties. Judge Keith found himself ruling against another  administration in the 2002 case, Detroit Free Press v. Ashcroft.  Attorney General John Ashcroft and Chief Immigration Judge Michael  Creppy directed that hearings regarding immigration and deportation  cases, deemed to be of interest to the investigation of the September  11, 2001, attacks, be closed to the public. When this case came before  Judge Keith, he affirmed that the directive was unconstitutional and  that deportations should not be shrouded in secrecy, famously  proclaiming that, ``Democracies die behind closed doors.''   It is my pleasure to recognize the Honorable Damon J. Keith for his  incredible half century on the bench and as one of the most influential  jurists in American history. Judge Keith has a heart of gold and a will  of steel, showing great courage in the face of danger and injustice. In  his relentless pursuit of equality and justice, he has garnered many  honors and admirers. In his life, Judge Keith not only witnessed some  of the most critical moments in this Nation's history, but he has also  contributed immensely to making America a better and more fair place. I  ask my fellow colleagues to join me in thanking the Honorable Damon J.  Keith for safeguarding the bedrock of our society the U.S.  Constitution.                            ____________________
