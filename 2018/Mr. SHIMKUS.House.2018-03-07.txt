 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 762, I call up  the bill (H.R. 1917) to allow for judicial review of any final rule  addressing national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants for  brick and structural clay products or for clay ceramics manufacturing  before requiring compliance with such rule, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and insert extraneous material on H.R. 1917.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today we have a chance to help hundreds of small  businesses, manufacturers, as well as thousands of employees, while  also lowering prices for consumers.   I thank the bipartisan cosponsors of H.R. 1917, the Blocking  Regulatory Interference from Closing Kilns Act, the BRICK Act, and urge  my colleagues to support this commonsense bill.   American brickmakers literally produce the building blocks of our  Nation. They are primarily small businesses, and they are often the  most important employer in small communities across America, where many  are located.   Like an old brick house, this industry has had to weather a lot,  including a long economic downturn, that we have finally come out of,  that suppressed new construction activity and, thus, brick sales for  many years.   They even weathered the 2003 EPA regulation that cost many millions  of dollars to comply. That regulation was later thrown out by a Federal  court, but the judicial relief came too late, as the industry had  already spent considerable sums to meet EPA's tight deadlines.   We don't want to see a repeat of that unfair result, but, once again,  EPA has imposed another regulation with difficult deadlines that will  likely take effect before judicial review is complete.   Brickmakers have testified before the Energy and Commerce Committee  that this regulation may result in layoffs and even plant closures.  H.R. 1917 would simply extend the compliance deadline until after  judicial review is final.   This industry has already reduced its emissions by up to 95 percent,  according to a study from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It should not  be forced to comply with another new regulation that may not withstand  judicial scrutiny. We owe it to these brickmakers, their employees, and  consumers of building materials to allow meaningful judicial review.   I might add that a Senate bill has been recently introduced that also  provides regulatory relief for brickmakers, but it takes a somewhat  different approach than our version. I pledge to work with the Senate  so that we can provide timely relief to this important industry.   The bill also deals with wood heaters. As with bricks, the wood  heaters industry is dominated by small business manufacturers who are  often the economic anchors of rural communities, where many are  located. Many wood heater buyers are low-income, rural households that  rely on them to get through the winter.   In 2015, EPA set a two-step wood heater emission rule. The first step  took effect in 2015 and reduced emissions in new models by up to 90  percent.   The more stringent second step is scheduled to take effect in 2020,  but is causing a great deal of difficulty. Only a small fraction of the  wood heating models currently available can meet the 2020 standards,  and time is running out to design and certify any additional models.   One wood heater manufacturer testified before the Energy and Commerce  Committee that he has already had to cut staff as a result of the 2020  deadline, and others feel there will be additional job losses if the  2020 standard is retained, but this is not just a jobs issue.   Users of wood heaters face both reduced product choice and higher  prices for new models. Many would have to forgo buying a new wood  heater and continue using older and dirtier ones, which undercuts the  claims that the current deadline will improve air quality.   The provisions in the bill retain the 2015 standards, but extend the  2020 deadline by 3 years to 2023.   This is a reasonable fix that would avoid unnecessary economic damage  while still prioritizing environmental protection.   In conclusion, the brick industry and the wood heater industry may  both be small, but they are far from small to those who owe their jobs  to them and to those who rely on their products.   I urge my colleagues to provide targeted relief to these two  industries by supporting H.R. 1917.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).    Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the next individual, I  just want to say it is not a low cost to the individuals in these small  communities who lose their job, and it is not a low cost to the  communities that lose the tax base when these small businesses fold up  and go away in small towns.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from Mississippi (Mr. Harper), a person who also represents big parts  of rural America.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from the great State of Minnesota (Mr. Peterson), a Democrat  who is going to speak on behalf of part of his bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson), the author of the BRICK Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, this is a good debate and discussion. It is one we had  in the subcommittee; it is one we had in the full committee; and we are  bringing it to the floor. It just focuses on a different way in which  we view manufacturing and, really, as you heard in this debate, small  manufacturers--small brick manufacturers, small wood heaters, because,  as everyone knows, when you are in a big corporation, you have got  lawyers and you have got--you can do an economic analysis and you can  do research and development, but a lot of these folks are just small  local operations, probably started by a husband and wife, probably  brought on a kid and next-door neighbor.   In my opening statement, I mentioned how, in rural America, there are  not a lot of businesses, other than maybe agriculture, people coming  into the town; so not only are these manufacturers, they are the  backbone of these small communities.   So, simply put, this bill is a combination of two. One says you  really shouldn't force someone to comply with a rule and regulation  until they have fought the litigation battle, because, in the example  that we are talking about today, the claimants, the manufacturers, won,  where either they went out of business because they were trying to  comply or they had to have this excessive cost. That is issue one.   Issue two on the small wood heaters is just say they were forced to  move forward in cleaner technology, increasing their environmental  ability 90 percent; and we all know that the cleaner you get, the  harder it is to get the last percentages. So all the folks are asking  for is more time to comply.   They are both bipartisan bills. I applaud folks coming down to talk  and defend those. This is an exciting time in our country. It is  exciting because we are having economic growth. We are having economic  growth for two reasons. One, our historic tax cuts. Fifty percent of  all manufacturers of the country have said they are going to invest in  capital investment. Pretty exciting.   There is optimism again. Wages are increasing. Benefits are  increasing. You have people getting checks increasing or new growth  capital expenses.   There is another component of this exciting time for jobs in the  economy, and this other component is easing up on the assault that the  EPA has done over the past decade on our manufacturing sector and our  job creators.   So you put these two together, the American worker has a greater  opportunity, and these are just a couple of examples of the bills we  are moving today, how we can continue to make that happen.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include the following letters in the  Record on H.R. 1917.                                             Chamber of Commerce of                                    the United States of America,                                      Washington, DC, March 7, 2018.        To the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The       U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports H.R. 1917, the ``Blocking       Regulatory Interference from Closing Kilns (BRICK) Act of       2017.'' The bill would ensure that the U.S. brick industry       will not be forced to comply with the Brick Maximum       Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for air       quality issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency       (EPA) until after judicial challenges to the rule are       resolved.        EPA issued an earlier version of the Brick MACT rule in       2003, which required the brick industry to spend millions of       dollars to purchase, install, and operate control equipment.       Five years later, a court threw out the 2003 rule. Now brick       companies are faced with having to pay to tear out the       equipment they installed and install even more costly new       equipment. Brick companies are rightfully worried that they       may make the investment to comply with the 2015 rule, only to       have it subsequently thrown out by a court. To avoid this       unfair and wasteful outcome, H.R. 1917 would set a compliance       date for the final Brick MACT rule after judicial challenges       to the 2015 Brick MACT rule are completed and after any       subsequent final rule is promulgated.        It is important that American industries are not unfairly       penalized when they are compelled to comply with costly rules       that are later overturned by the courts. This wasteful and       unreasonable outcome must be avoided.            Sincerely,      Neil L. Bradley.                                   ____                                                National Association                                                of Manufacturers,                                      Washington, DC, March 7, 2018.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative, The National Association of       Manufacturers (NAM), the largest manufacturing association in       the United States representing manufacturers in every       industrial sector and in all 50 states, urges you to support       H.R. 1917, the Blocking Regulatory Interference from Closing       Kilns Act of 2017 (BRICK Act), introduced by Representative       Bill Johnson (R-OH).        In September 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency       (EPA) issued final National Emissions Standards for Brick,       Structural Clay Products and Clay Ceramics Manufacturing,       often referred to as Brick MACT. It is estimated that this       rule will collectively cost the brick industry, which is made       up of predominantly small- and medium-sized manufacturers,       more than $100 million dollars per year.        Manufacturers support reasonable environmental policies,       but need regulatory certainty to ensure that the investments       made today match what regulations will ultimately require.       When regulations stretch beyond what the law allows,       manufacturers and other stakeholders must turn to the courts       for relief. Often times compliance deadlines for disputed       final regulations are too short for the legal process to       fully run its course and manufacturers are forced to make       investments to comply with rules that courts may ultimately       throw out or send back to EPA for more work.        This is exactly the situation brick manufacturers find       themselves in with this regulation, as EPA's rule requires       millions in new regulatory costs within a three-year period,       while the underlying regulation is being disputed in the       courts--a process that could ultimately span several years       H.R. 1917 is a commonsense way to approach this issue, as it       simply ensures that manufacturers will have the certainty       that the investments they make are based on laws that the       courts have determined are appropriate and legal. The NAM       strongly urges you to support H.R. 1917            Sincerely,      Ross Eisenberg.                                   ____     Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, a Member uses a motion to instruct or  recommit to change or amend the bill. I don't think we build and use  bricks to make our airplanes, and I don't think we power our planes  with wood heaters.   So what is the deal with this motion to instruct and recommit?    It is just purely politics, and it is not surprising.   Why?   Well, because Democrats want to distort us from our economic success  of the Republican agenda. And it is built on two foundational  principles. One is the very successful tax reform and bill that we  passed in December. And Americans are seeing it. Fifty percent of all  manufacturers around the country are going to invest in capital  expansion. People have bigger paychecks now. They are getting bonuses.   In fact, I was on the floor last night with Illinoisans. We were  reading stories from constituents about the benefits they are  receiving, either in less money being taken out on taxes or increase in  wages; trucking companies expanding. So it is an incredible success of  optimism when we have been in an economic malaise for the past 8 years.   And that is the kind of society I want to live in. I want to live in  a society where, when my kids enter the workforce, there is a job  there. And I want them to say: If I work hard and play by the rules,  man, there is an opportunity for me. And that is what is coming back.   There is another component to this economic success, and that is  calling  [[Page H1465]]  off the EPA dogs who have been attacking the job creators in our  country over the past 8 years. Ease the regulatory burden, provide  historic tax relief, excitement in the economy, new jobs, new energy.  So I understand why my opponents on the other side would like to  distort us from this record.   This motion to recommit is purely politics to do that, so that is why  I ask my colleagues to reject the motion to recommit and, once we do  that, support the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
