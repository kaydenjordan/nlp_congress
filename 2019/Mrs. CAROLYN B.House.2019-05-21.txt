 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her  remarks.)    MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, just over 100  years ago, my mother was born without the right to vote. Like other  women of her time, she had no vote, and she had no voice in her  government.   Today, we honor the courageous women who marched, staged hunger  strikes, went to jail, and persevered in order to win this fundamental  right for half the country, forever altering our democracy by ensuring  that everyone in this country, including women, had the constitutional  right to vote.   I am deeply grateful that my mother benefited from their efforts and  that she would live to see her daughter run for and be elected to  Congress.   Millions of women voted for the first time in November 1920 and in  the nearly 100 years since. But we still have much more work to do.   I am determined that, one day soon, all of our daughters and sons  will witness the ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, which, at  long last, makes it clear that equal means equal.                            ____________________
