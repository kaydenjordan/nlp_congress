 Madam Speaker, inspired by the story of my constituent  Lauren Price, I first filed comprehensive burn pit legislation with my  colleague, Congressman Ruiz, in 2018.   Lauren developed a terminal illness due to her exposure to burn pit  toxins in Iraq. Despite her illness, she was passionate about making  sure her brothers and sisters in arms would finally be able to access  the medical care and benefits they have earned. Lauren worked  tirelessly to help me craft legislation and testified at multiple  congressional hearings.   Since 2018, I have continued to work with my colleagues in the House  and the Senate to push this critical issue forward. While Lauren  tragically passed before she was able to get help, today, finally, we  will pass the PACT Act to make sure no other veterans have to go  through what Lauren went through.
