 In America, inflation has topped 5 percent every month  for the past year. The consumer price index continues to hover at  levels our economy hasn't seen in four decades. As we head into  Memorial Day weekend, the American people have become reluctant experts  in its painful, real-life effects.   The average working family is now spending the equivalent of $5,000 a  year on gas money. A year ago, the number was $2,800. Nationwide, gas  prices have risen 46.9 cents just in the last month, and in Kentucky,  they have risen actually even faster. Here's a quote from one of my  constituents: ``I'm getting taken full advantage of,'' said one driver  in Lexington.   Another said: ``It costs so much to fill up I have to do it half a  tank at a time now.''   But according to President Biden, it is all part of what he calls an  ``incredible transition.'' Well, that is a heck of a way to describe  his administration's war on the most affordable, reliable, and abundant  forms of energy in our country, forcing fuel prices so high that it  requires Americans to transition to more expensive cars with supply  chains controlled primarily by China and other hostile regimes with  lower labor and environmental standards is not my idea of incredible.   But pain at the pump is only one of the tangled consequences of  Washington Democrats' radical policies and reckless spending. Depending  on where you are trying to go, higher fuel costs are hurting Americans'  ability to enjoy major summer traditions. Rental car costs have jumped  to 10.4 percent in the past year. Hotel rooms are going for 22.6  percent more, and plane tickets are up 33.3 percent.   Of course, millions of Americans are having a hard enough time paying  for basic expenses, let alone planning summer vacations. Grocery stores  now stock painful surprises on every aisle. Ground coffee is 14.7  percent more expensive than it was a year ago; eggs, up 22.6 percent.  Anyone wanting to grill a bacon cheeseburger over Memorial Day weekend  will find ground beef up 15 percent and bacon up 18 percent compared to  only 1 year ago.   And utility bills now arrive with gut punches. For ratepayers in New  England, electricity rates are projected to cost 16.4 percent more this  summer than last summer. Everywhere they turn, American families are  having to pare back expectations, put dreams on hold, and make bitter  sacrifices.   It is no longer a shocking scandal; it is just normal life in  Democrats' version of America: harder to fuel the tank, harder to feed  the family, harder to get by.                       Tribute to Jennifer M. Kuskowski    Madam President, on an entirely different matter, 9 years and a  couple of months ago, an impressive young woman interviewed for a  position in my office over in the Russell Building. She had worked for  her home State senator out of college. At that point, she sharpened her  chops on the House side. I knew 5 minutes into the meeting with  Jennifer Kuskowski that we had found someone very special.   And now that young staffer from a decade back is departing the Senate  as a commanding policy expert and one of my most indispensable  advisors.   Jen began as my legislative assistant for healthcare. In less than 2  years, she earned a no-brainer promotion to be the legislative director  for my whole personal office, a sort of player-coach overseeing all  policy areas. For a couple of years, Jen briefly betrayed us and  obtained committee experience with Chairman Hatch at the Senate Finance  Committee. But we soon stole her back for my leadership office here in  the Capitol.   For more than 3 years, she has been my crucial point person on some  of the most complex issues we face--from healthcare to education to  tech and telecom. She is the consummate professional, reliable, calm,  clear under pressure. She knows her portfolio like the back of her  hand, and Jen genuinely loves the legislative process. As her  colleagues playfully reminded her with some frequency, Jen is a policy  nerd's policy nerd.   Now, don't get me wrong, Jen's not naive. She has the realism and  tenacity of a grizzled veteran, but even as a top staffer who works  directly with Senators and coordinates across committees, Jen has still  got the same earnestness as the young woman I met a decade back. And I  think I know why. I think Jen Kuskowski loves mastering thorny policy  issues because she understands that policy impacts people.   In between her first and second stint on the Hill, Jen served in the  Peace Corps, working on health issues in Ecuador. That is hands-on  experience you never forget.   And towards the other bookend of her Senate service, Jen spent the  coronavirus pandemic first as an expectant mother and then with a  newborn. She knew what was at stake as she tracked the science and  helped assemble the Senate's historic, bipartisan response.    Jen has honed expertise in issues that touch families' lives very  directly. And with that expertise, she has done unbelievably well. She  was an early driving force to focus Congress on the opioid epidemic.  She was alert to the plague of substance abuse years before anybody in  Washington was even discussing it.   Jen was the central player in my effort to raise the minimum tobacco  age to 21. She played a huge role in structuring the historic relief  for hospitals and providers that kept health systems above water in the  early weeks of the COVID crisis.   She was a key quarterback as we crafted support for vaccines and  therapeutics that got America back on offense. Across many years,  across many issues, Jen Kuskowski's expertise and professionalism have  literally saved lives throughout Kentucky and across America. It is not  an exaggeration; it is literally true. Families across the Commonwealth  and across the Nation that will never meet Jen have benefited from the  fact that she has been one of the most reliable closers on Capitol  Hill. When an issue lands in her court, it gets resolved, period.   Now, saying Jen cares about policy because she cares about people  might sound like sort of a sappy cliche, but everybody in the Senate  can attest there is nothing remotely sappy or ``Hallmark card'' about  her. Jen's sarcastic sense of humor is world-class. She does not suffer  fools. She pursues goals with bulldog determination, and a competitive  fire burning below the surface. But all this coexists with a deep  kindness and care for others. It is really a very special package.   Jen has been the likeliest member of our team to seek out a colleague  who is having a hard day and offer a pep talk and the likeliest person  to aim a witty barb at a friend who is feeling overconfident and needs  to be taken down a peg. Any team would be lucky to have either someone  as diligent and professional as Jen or somebody as compassionate or  someone as wickedly funny. It has been our special blessing to have all  three in one person.   So as you can see, Jen has rendered the Senate a special and unique  service. So I am happy to report the institution has repaid Jen in a  special and unique way as well. When we first met Jen, she was Jennifer  Conklin, but she leaves the Senate partnered to her husband Officer  Andrew Kuskowski of the United States Capitol Police. They are proud  parents of little Zachary.   And after a decade of late-night negotiations and weekend conference  calls,  [[Page S2716]]  our friend is excited to strike out and tackle new challenges.   So, Jen, I am so grateful for your outstanding service. We know you  will continue to be a force of nature wherever you go, and you will  keep serving the common good, just in new and different ways.   You have done your family proud. You have done me proud. And I hope  you are proud. Your fine service has literally saved lives and changed  our country for the better.    Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the  vote.
