 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Without objection, it is so ordered    Madam President, I come to the floor to speak in  support of proceeding to debate legislation that is critical to our  democracy, legislation that is based on two simple ideas: that  Americans must be able to freely choose their elected officials and  that government must be accountable to the people, not to those with  the most money. These are not Democratic or Republican ideas; they are  core American ideas. But for too long, these rights have been under  attack, which is why we need the critical democracy reforms in the For  the People Act.    I am honored to be leading this legislation with Senators Merkley and  Schumer and to have worked with my colleagues as chair of the Rules  Committee, worked with my colleagues in the House and civil rights and  democracy reform groups and you, Madam President, to bring this bill  forward today.   The freedom to vote is fundamental to all of our freedoms. It is how  Americans control their government and hold elected officials  accountable. It is the bedrock of our government. It is the founding  principle of our country, and it has stood the test of wars, of  economic strife, and yes, a global pandemic. But protecting this right  has not always been easy.   Throughout our country's 245-year history, we have had to course- correct and take action to ensure that democracy is for the people and  by the people and that it has lived up to our ideals.   At the beginning of this year, we were reminded on January 6 that it  is up to us to protect against threats to our democracy, to ensure that  it succeeds.   I still remember that moment at 3:30 in the morning when Senator  Blunt and I and, yes, Vice President Pence walked from this Chamber  with the two young women with the mahogany box full of those last  ballots to get over to the House to finish our job so that you, Madam  President, were declared the Vice President and President Biden was  declared the President. That is upholding our democracy. That is doing  it together, Democrats and Republicans doing our job. And what this  bill is about to me, this bill is about carrying on that torch to  protect our democracy.   Today, the vote to begin debate on this legislation will likely get  the support of all 50 Democrats. Senator Manchin, along with the rest  of our caucus, has made clear to the country that standing up for the  right to vote is bigger than any one person or thing. It is about us.  It is about us as Americans. I deeply appreciate the work he has put  into the proposal he is putting forward today, and I look forward to  continuing our discussions with him. He is doing this in good faith.  There are many good things in that proposal. And today we are here  together to reaffirm we will not give up this fight. It is just  beginning.   The 2020 election showed that you can make it safer to vote while  giving voters the options that work for them. If it is vote-by-mail--I  see my colleague Senator Smith here. Minnesota is so proud of our same- day registration. That has worked for us. It has made us No. 1 in voter  turnout in the country time and time and time again. Many States during  the pandemic took steps exactly like that, extending options for  voters, like safe vote-by mail, and now 34 States have no-excuse vote- by-mail--34 States. The result? More than nearly 160 million Americans  voted--more than ever before and in the middle of a pandemic.   I still remember those voters in the primary in Wisconsin standing in  makeshift garbage bags with makeshift masks over their faces in the  middle of a rainstorm, in the middle of a pandemic, standing in line to  vote. And in an election that the Trump Department of Homeland Security  declared was the most secure in our history, the American people  elected, yes, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.   But in the wake of that historic election, there has been a  pervasive, coordinated, and overwhelming effort to undermine the  freedoms of voting in future elections, with over 400 bills introduced  in legislatures across the country. Twenty-two laws to restrict voting  have been enacted in 14 States, and 31 more bills to roll back the  right to vote have passed at least 1 chamber of a State legislature.   As Reverend Warnock put it in this Chamber in his maiden speech as  Senator, ``Some people don't want some people to vote.'' That is what  is going on here.   The new law in Georgia makes it harder to request mail-in ballots,  drastically limits ballot drop boxes, and makes it a crime to hand  water and food to voters waiting in line to cast their ballots, when in  previous elections, Georgians have stood in line for up to 10 hours to  vote.   One of the new Montana laws ended same-day registration on election  day after it had been in practice in the State for 15 years, and  Senator Tester is joining me in trying to bring this practice across-- when we introduced that bill--across the Nation.   In the weeks ahead, similar bills are expected to pass in even more  States, including Texas, where the Governor has promised to call the  legislature into special session to pass a bill to restrict voting that  was blocked at the end of regular session thanks to the heroic efforts  of Democrats in the Texas State Legislature who blessed us with their  presence just last week.   These are not empty threats; they are real efforts to disenfranchise  regular Americans from voting--senior citizens, people with  disabilities, people who can't stand in line for 10 hours just to wait  to vote.   In the face of these efforts to roll back voting rights in so many  States, the For the People Act is about setting basic national  standards to make sure that all voters in this country can vote legally  in the way that works for them, regardless of which ZIP Code they live  in, regardless of whether they live in a big city or in a suburb or out  in a small town in western Minnesota. It is about reducing the power of  Big Money in our elections by ending secret spending by billionaires  and special interests. It is about making anti-corruption reforms to  ensure that politicians work for the people, not for themselves.   Republicans have said that this bill is designed to provide a  political advantage, but, as a former Republican Commissioner of the  Federal Election Commission who chaired under George Bush, Trevor  Potter, has said in explaining his support for this bill--and he  appeared as a witness in my hearing for this bill--he said:         This bill does not give power to any particular party over       another; it gives power back to the voters.   [[Page S4684]]     Giving power back to the voters is exactly what we need.   There is an amplified attack on the right to vote this year, but we  have seen serious efforts to restrict voting rights since the Supreme  Court gutted the Voting Rights Act 8 years ago. The Voting Rights Act  of 1965 marked the cornerstone achievement to the civil rights movement  and became a law because of the tireless work of people like John Lewis  who put their lives on the line to secure voting rights for all. Fifty- six years later, we are still fighting that battle. At the same time,  we haven't had meaningful campaign finance or ethics reform.   Our democracy desperately needs the proposals in this bill. And guess  what. The American people agree. Yes, this bill is bipartisan, except  right here in this place. It is bipartisan because one poll released  recently found that 78 percent of Americans, including 63 percent of  Republicans, support making early in-person voting available for at  least 2 weeks before election day. That is a proposal in our original  For the People, and it is in the managers' amendment that we are voting  for cloture on, and it is in Senator Manchin's proposal.   Another poll found that 83 percent of likely voters support public  disclosure of contributions to groups involved in elections--also the  DISCLOSE Act in all three proposals. Yet some of my Republican  colleagues want to limit disclosures. By the way, disclosures were  championed by Justice Scalia. Yet what happened in our committee  hearing on this, our markup? Republicans filed amendment after  amendment to gut those provisions of the bill.   So while they make claims--my friends on the other side of the  aisle--that this isn't popular, it is just not true. They claim it is  not bipartisan. It is just not true. The bill contains nine bipartisan  bills, including the Honest Ads Act, which I first introduced with  Senator John McCain and Senator Warner, and now Senator Lindsay Graham  took up that cause. Our provision--that provision would finally hold  the social media companies accountable to make sure that there are  disclaimers and disclosures on political ads.   There is the work that I have done with Senator Lankford and with  you, Madam President, when you were in the Senate to make sure we have  backup paper ballots. We still have eight States that don't have backup  paper ballots. That provision is in this bill.   Many of the bill's provisions have already been adopted in red, blue,  and purple States and have the support of Governors and election  officials from both parties.   Twenty-one States have same-day voter registration, including red  States like Idaho, Wyoming, and Iowa. That is great, but our question  should be, why don't all 50 States have it, especially when the  Constitution of the United States specifically says that Congress can  make and alter rules for Federal elections? It is as clear as the words  on the page. Twenty States have automatic voter registration laws,  including Alaska, Georgia, and West Virginia. Forty-five States allowed  all voters to vote by mail in the 2020 election, and 44 States have  early voting.   What this bill does is takes the best of the best and puts in place  minimum standards so that no matter what State you call home, you have  access to the ballot box. That is why Senator Merkley has worked so  hard on this legislation. That is why Senator Schumer made this bill  Senate file No. 1.   The bill that we are voting to advance includes changes that directly  respond to concerns about implementation from both Democratic and  Republican States and local officials. We heard those concerns, and the  Democrats on the Rules Committee, which included Senator Warner and  Senator King--we worked on that managers' amendment and made it easier  for rural areas, extended the time system, and got at their concerns.  And then Senator Manchin has come up with more ideas and more things we  can do to make the bill strong.   We heard from election officials that requiring States to accept  mail-in ballots for too long after election day would delay them from  certifying the results, so we shortened the window.   I could go on and on and on. In good faith, we have worked to make  this bill work for America, and now it is time to allow for debate on  this bill.   Our Republican friends on the other side of the aisle say this bill-- this is one thing Senator McConnell would say in the hearing--that it  would cause chaos. I say this: Chaos is a 5-hour wait to vote. Senior  citizens standing in the hot Sun for 5 hours, for 10 hours--that is  chaos. Chaos is purging eligible voters from voter rolls and modern-day  poll taxes and one ballot box for a county of 5 million people, which  is exactly what they did in Harris County, TX. That is exactly what is  happening in that State right now. Chaos is voters in Wisconsin waiting  in line to vote for hours in the rain in their homemade masks and  plastic garbage bags. The angry mob on January 6 that came into this  very Chamber, that spray painted the columns, that attacked police  officers, that injured people left and right--that is chaos.   As I said from the stage on Inauguration Day under that bright blue  sky where you could still see the spray paint at the bottom of those  columns and the makeshift windows we had in place--I said this: This is  the day our democracy picks itself up, brushes off the dust, and does  what America always does: goes forward as a Nation under God, with  liberty and justice for all. We cannot do that if Americans are  disenfranchised, if they are not part of our democracy.   Republicans have sadly made it clear that this is not legislation  they are willing to negotiate or even debate. They won't even give it a  week. They won't even give it a few days. Just last week, they held a  press conference to tell the American people that they don't believe  Congress should act to protect the right to vote or get rid of secret  money in our elections. So, honestly, I would love to get support from  the other side of the aisle, but we have to be honest--I don't expect  we are going to get it.   So, my Republican colleagues, this is not the end of the line for  this bill. This is not the end of the line. This is only the beginning  because if you have your way, those voters won't even be at the end of  the line. They are not going to be able to vote.   In the Rules Committee, we will be holding a series of hearings--not  just one hearing, a series of hearings--and we are taking it on the  road for the first time in a long time. We are going to Georgia and  holding a field hearing there so we can hear firsthand from people in  the State on what is happening and why we must carry out the  constitutional duty in this Chamber to act.   I urge my Republican colleagues to recognize the work being done in  States to restrict the freedom of Americans to exercise their sacred  right to vote. Our Nation was founded on the ideals of democracy, and  we have seen for ourselves in this building how we can never take it  for granted.   We can't let State legislatures get to pick and choose who votes and  what votes get counted. That is not how democracy works. I urge all of  my colleagues to do what the American people are asking us to do and to  do what is right. Vote today to bring us closer to passing legislation  to strengthen our democracy. We can't wait in line, and we can't make  the people of America wait in line. The time to do this is now.   I yield the floor.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority leader.    Madam President, today I rise to honor and pay  tribute to the International Falls Journal, the local newspaper of the  International Falls and Koochiching County communities that has  provided timely, trustworthy, and thorough reporting to Minnesotans for  the past 110 years. On June 24, 2021, the International Falls Journal  will sadly publish its final edition.   Founded in 1911 by Clarence Burton Montgomery as The Daily Journal,  the then-daily paper has been a community staple since its start,  informing locals of who was born and who died, local business news, and  what happened at city council and school board meetings. Through  different disasters and crises, The Journal made sure they delivered  the news to their readers. In 1988, a fire ripped through its office on  a Friday night, claiming most of the building and everything inside,  including the paper's equipment. Still, that Monday and for weeks  following the fire while the outlet was without printers, the paper was  published as planned. This was 38 years after the great flood of 1950,  when--you guessed it--the paper still ended up on their readers'  doorsteps despite the unprecedented circumstance.   The paper went through several owners before landing in the hands of  Arlin Albrecht and Phil Duff, The Journal's current publishers, who  purchased the paper in 1974.   Regardless of ownership, locals have always been able to count on The  Journal. International Falls Area Chamber of Commerce President Tricia  Heibel said it well: ``From births, deaths, marriages, school events  and sporting highlights, from lost pets to everything else, it was just  a really central communication tool.''   As the daughter of a newspaperman, I grew up knowing just how  important local newspapers like the International Falls Journal are. In  fact, it is thanks to the presence of a local newspaper--the Duluth  Herald--in my dad's childhood home that my grandmother spotted his  interest in storytelling when he was just 12. Local papers played an  irreplaceable role in my father's life, as they continue to today for  countless readers.   But today, newspapers of all sizes are struggling and closing. Ad  revenue for U.S. newspapers plummeted from $49.4 billion in 2005 to  $14.3 billion in 2018. During that time, two other companies, Facebook  and Google--worth over $2.4 trillion combined--became advertising  titans. These two companies don't just control the majority of online  advertising; they have built power over the news and crushed local news  outlets along the way.   With the closure of The Journal, we are once again seeing the impacts  of this firsthand. We can't stand by and watch this happen to our  independent press. That is why I have introduced bipartisan legislation  to let news publishers join together to negotiate fair terms with these  giant digital corporations. We must give independent papers the chance  to compete.   But even as we work to ensure other papers are able to keep their  lights on, the International Falls Journal is a reminder of the value  of local journalism. For more than a century, it has empowered its  readers by providing them with accurate, relevant information about  their communities. It has captured moments big and small that together  tell a beautiful story of the region that will live on.   Even as it closes its doors, generations will benefit from the legacy  it leaves behind.  [[Page S4694]]                                ____________________
