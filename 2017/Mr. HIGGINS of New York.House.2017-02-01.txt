 Mr. Speaker, this week in 1940, the first  Social Security check was issued. Since then, it has been one of our  Nation's most impactful and successful programs.   Social Security is based on a simple premise: if you work hard, you  should live a dignified retirement. It has been a critical lifeline for  America's seniors, tens of millions of whom were pulled out of poverty  because of this program.   In order for Social Security to continue to fulfill its promise,  Congress and the administration need to work together. I am concerned  that the new administration may wish to dismantle Social Security as we  know it. The President's choice for Budget Director has a long track  record of calling for raises in the retirement age and of lowering  Social Security benefit payouts. In 2011, when my Republican colleagues  proposed cuts to Social Security, the nominee argued that the cuts were  not rapid enough. This is unacceptable.   We cannot afford to weaken Social Security. We should expand and  strengthen this program. We need to make Social Security more generous  and increase the benefits so that today's and tomorrow's retirees get  the dignified retirements that they have earned. This is also good for  economic growth, higher wages, higher demand, higher economic growth,  and opportunity.                            ____________________
