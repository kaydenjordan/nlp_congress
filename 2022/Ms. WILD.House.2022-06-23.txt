 Madam Speaker, I rise today to speak about this bipartisan  [[Page H5842]]  bill, H.R. 5407, the Enhancing Mental Health and Suicide Prevention  Through Campus Planning Act, which will be taken up for consideration  today.   Supporting the young people of our country is not a partisan issue. I  thank the co-lead of this bill, Representative Fred Keller, and the  original cosponsors, Representatives Fitzpatrick, Raskin, Stevens,  Trone, Scanlon, Moulton, Grijalva, Roybal-Allard, Dean, Harder, and  DeSaulnier for their support.   In the last several years, young Americans have faced unprecedented  challenges resulting in a rise in mental health needs. College campus  counseling centers have been tasked with responding to this increased  demand for mental health services with limited staff, funding, and  resources.   The mental health effects of the pandemic are widespread, with a  study conducted by Pennsylvania State University reporting that 94  percent of students seeking mental health services said that COVID-19  negatively impacted at least one area of their life and 72 percent  reporting that the pandemic's main impact has been on their mental  health.   To help institutions of higher education better serve students, once  passed, this bill will encourage colleges and universities to develop  and implement mental health programs in concert with both State-level  programs and community-based organizations.   During my visits to colleges in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania,  even before the pandemic, students shared with me the importance of  improving mental health care access on campus.   Today, I am proud that the Enhancing Mental Health and Suicide  Prevention Through Campus Planning Act will receive a vote, and I look  forward to casting mine in support.
