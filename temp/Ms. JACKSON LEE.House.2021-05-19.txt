 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for  yielding.   I was here on 9/11, and I could see the billowing smoke as we ran for  our lives as the planes were hitting the Pentagon and the aftermath.   I was here on January 6 when screaming voices came and glass began to  break, as the video has shown us, the video of the beatings. My tribute  to all the officers--we have heard the story of Officer Fanone.   All we want is truth, and all we want is for the big lie to be  undone.   It is important to support H.R. 3233, the National Commission to  Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol Complex,  and the underlying emergency supplemental that General Honore and his  committee so aptly did.   I thank Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Katko for their hard  work. Be reminded of the fact that it was the former President still  lingering, lashing around instead of allowing the transfer of peaceful  government to go. He is now pushing big lies.   I wanted the Vice President to live. I wanted the Speaker to live. I  wanted Members to live. I wanted Black officers not to be under the  threat of racist overtones. So this commission will listen to it all.   I ask my colleagues to get rid of the big lie, stand by the  Constitution, the flag, and justice and equality for all. Pass H.R.  3233, the National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on  the United States Capitol Complex Act.   Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime,  Homeland Security, and Terrorism, and a senior member of the Homeland  Security, and Budget Committees, I rise in strong support of the rule  governing debate of H.R. 3237, the Emergency Security Supplemental to  Respond to January 6th Appropriations Act of 2021, and H.R. 3233, the  National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United  States Capitol Complex.   H.R. 3237 provides $1.9 billion in funding to respond to the  insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, when thousands of  domestic terrorists inspired by the 45th President stormed the U.S.  Capitol in a violent, crazed, and desperate effort to disrupt the Joint  Meeting of Congress prescribed by the Constitution to tally the votes  of presidential electors and announce the results to the nation and the  world.   H.R. 3233, the National Commission to Investigate the January 6  Attack on the Capitol Complex Act, which establishes a national  commission charged with investigating and reporting upon the facts and  causes of the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol as well as the  influencing factors that may have provoked the attack on our democracy.   Specifically, the January 6 Commission's mandate includes:   1. examining and evaluating evidence developed by relevant Federal,  State, and local governments, in a manner that is respectful of ongoing  investigations, regarding the facts and circumstances of the attack;   2. building upon other investigations regarding the attack and  targeted violence and domestic terrorism related to such attack; and   3. reporting to the President and Congress regarding its findings,  conclusions, and recommendations for corrective measures taken to  prevent future acts of targeted violence and domestic terrorism and  improves the security posture of the United States Capitol Complex in a  manner that preserves the accessibility of the Capitol Complex for all  Americans, and strengthen the security and resilience of nation and  American democratic institutions against domestic terrorism.   Like September 11, 2001, we cannot and must not ever forget the  existential threat faced by our democracy on January 6, 2021, when  thousands of domestic terrorists inspired by the 45th President stormed  the U.S. Capitol in a violent, crazed, and desperate effort to disrupt  the Joint Meeting of Congress prescribed by the Constitution to tally  the votes of presidential electors and announce the results to the  nation and the world.   Mr. Speaker, the morning of September 11, 2001 is, and will always  be, a day like no other.   It is a day all living Americans will remember because not since  Pearl Harbor had there been such a dastardly and deadly attack on  American soil.   On that day, we were united in our shock and anger and sadness and in  our resolve to defend our country and protect the freedoms that has  made America the greatest country in the history of the world.   I experienced the same gamut of emotions on January 6: grief, hope,  resolve, and fierce commitment to protect our country.   Mr. Speaker, the assault on the U.S. Capitol by domestic terrorists  and insurrectionists rightly takes its place as one of the darkest  moments in our nation's history since the Civil War.   Mr. Speaker, the January 6 insurrection caused tragic loss of life  and injuries, while leaving behind widespread physical damage to the  Capitol Complex and emotional trauma for Members, Congressional  employees, and the Capitol Police.   It bears repeating often that the Congress and the nation owe undying  gratitude to the men and women who answered the call of constitutional  duty and heroically won the day on that bloody and deadly afternoon.   That is why I introduced H. Res. 169, a resolution commending the  officers of the United States Capitol Police Department, the  Metropolitan Police Department of Washington, DC, and other law  enforcement personnel for their selfless and heroic service in defense  of American democracy in responding to the assault on the United States  Capitol by domestic terrorists on January 6, 2021.   H. Res. 169 notes that the January 6, 2021 siege of the Capitol  assault resulted in one of the worst days of injuries for law  enforcement in the United States since the September 11, 2001,  terrorist attacks but that the officers of the United States Capitol  Police Department, the Metropolitan Police Department of Washington,  DC, and other uniformed law enforcement officers stood their ground in  defense of American democracy while being attacked metal pipes,  discharged chemical irritants, and other weapons.   The resolution conveys the thanks and appreciation of a grateful  nation to them for their selfless and heroic service, encourages all  educational and media institutions throughout the United States to  teach and celebrate the story of their heroism and patriotism; and  calls upon all Americans to read, celebrate, and revere the  Constitution of the United States, fidelity to which is the surest best  means of forming a more perfect union, establishing justice, ensuring  domestic tranquility, providing for the common defense, promoting the  general welfare, and securing the blessing of liberty to them and their  posterity.   Mr. Speaker, the domestic terrorists and seditionists who attacked  the Capitol Building on January 6, 2021 were not, as some of their  ardent defenders and apologists across the aisle have stated falsely,  on a ``normal tour visit''; nor was their effort to lay siege to the  Capitol and disrupt the processes of government an act of persons who  love their country.   And it is absurd to suggest that it was a celebration of the United  States and what it stands for when the leading edge of terrorists  desecrated the Capitol by offensively parading the treasonous  Confederate flag through the building and when, because of their  insurrection, several members of law enforcement made the supreme  sacrifice and scores more were seriously injured.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a few moments to explain why the  intended purpose of the January 6 insurrection--to disrupt the Joint  Meeting of Congress to tally the votes of presidential electors and  announce the results to the nation and the world--was the greatest  threat to the American Experiment since the Civil War when the  proslavery forces would rather make war than let the nation survive and  the pro-freedom forces would accept war rather than let the nation  perish.   The Framers understood and declared to the world that democratic  governors derived their powers from the knowing and voluntary consent  of the governed as expressed in free, fair, and unfettered elections  unmarred by the influence or sabotage of any foreign country or entity  not a member of the political community.   The most important feature of a democracy is that it is the voters  who alone can confer the legitimate consent and authorization necessary  to govern upon the governors who are then duty-bound to represent the  voters' interests, and only their interests.  [[Page H2570]]    Mr. Speaker, the fundamental democratic compact between the governed  and the governors is that the latter's authority and continuance in  office comes exclusively from the governed and allegiance is owed  exclusively to the governed.   This agreement can only be reached through free and fair elections, a  breach of which threatens the vitality and viability of the social  contract upon which democratic self-rule of, by, and for the people  depends.   Mr. Speaker, President Lincoln called the United States the ``last  best hope of man on earth'' and stated at Gettysburg the importance of  finishing the work we are in to ensure that ``government of the people,  for the people, by the people does not perish from the earth.''   By our actions in voting to establish and empower a National  Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the Capitol Complex,  we are taking an indispensable step in ensuring the preservation of our  democracy, which has been the envy of the world for more than 240  years.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in voting for the rule and  the underlying legislation, H.R. 3237, the Emergency Security  Supplemental to Respond to January 6th Appropriations Act of 2021, and  H.R. 3233, the National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack  on the United States Capitol Complex.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and I thank the  ranking member for showing, no matter how much confusion and upside  down interpretation that leadership may give in changing their mind,  truth will prevail.   Let us show what America is today. Let us show what unity is today.  Let me take a few moments to explain why the intended purpose of the  January 6 insurrection to disrupt the joint meeting of Congress to  tally the votes of Presidential electors and announce the results to  the Nation and the world was the greatest threat to the American  Experiment since the Civil War, when the pro-slavery forces would  rather make war than let the Nation survive, and pro-freedom forces  would accept war rather than let the Nation perish.   Mr. Speaker, I was here on 9/11, and I understand what we did not get  accomplished, yet when we became part of the Homeland Security  Committee, we moved the 9/11 Commission that still stands as the  standard-bearer for finding out what happened.   All the American people want, and those officers who were beat and  beat and beat, is to find out the truth. This commission will help us  find out the truth. It will answer the cry of those law enforcement  officers who were called racial names. We will be able to explain why  someone was trying to kill the Vice President, kill the Speaker, and  kill Members of Congress.   This is a truth time. Can we stand for truth?   And might I add, I want to thank all of those officers who put their  line in front for us. Let us get them the truth so the Nation will know  the truth and so we can stand on the truth and be free.   Mr. Speaker, as Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime,  Homeland Security, and Terrorism, and a senior member of the Homeland  Security, and Budget Committees, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3233,  the National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the  Capitol Complex Act, which establishes a national commission charged  with investigating and reporting upon the facts and causes of the  January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol as well as the influencing  factors that may have provoked the attack on our democracy.

Like the 9/11 Commission, the measure establishes a 10-person  bipartisan commission with five commissioners, including the Chair,  appointed by the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the  Senate and five commissioners, including the Vice Chair, appointed by  the Minority Leaders of the House and Senate.   Like the 9/11 Commission, the January 6 Commission will be granted  authority to issue subpoenas to secure information to carry out its  investigation but only upon agreement between the Chair and the Vice  Chair or a vote by a majority of Commission members.   January 6 Commissioners must have significant expertise in the areas  of law enforcement, civil rights, civil liberties, privacy,  intelligence, and cybersecurity. Current government officers or  employees are prohibited from appointment.   The January 6 Commission will be required to issue a final report  with findings regarding the facts and causes of the attack, along with  recommendations to prevent future attacks on our democratic  institutions, by December 31, 2021.   Like September 11, 2001, we cannot and must not ever forget the  existential threat faced by our democracy on January 6, 2021, when  thousands of domestic terrorists inspired  [[Page H2580]]  by the 45th President stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent, crazed,  and desperate effort to disrupt the Joint Meeting of Congress  prescribed by the Constitution to tally the votes of presidential  electors and announce the results to the nation and the world.   Mr. Speaker, the morning of September 11, 2001, is, and will always  be, a day like no other.   It is a day all living Americans will remember because not since  Pearl Harbor had there been such a dastardly and deadly attack on  American soil.   My heart still grieves for those who perished on flights United  Airlines 93, American Airlines 77, American Airlines 11, and United  Airlines 175.   When the sun rose on the morning of September 11, none of us knew  that it would end in an inferno in the magnificent World Trade Center  Towers in New York City and the Pentagon and in the grassy fields of  Shanksville, Pennsylvania.   Mr. Speaker, as hard as it is to believe, out of a tragedy so  overwhelming and horrific, something good and great emerged in the  aftermath of September 11.   On that day there were no Republicans or Democrats; there were no  Northerners or Southerners or West or East Coasters.   We were not Red State or Blue State; we were all simply Americans.   On that day, we were united in our shock and anger and sadness and in  our resolve to defend our country and protect the freedoms that has  made America the greatest country in the history of the world.   I experienced the same gamut of emotions on January 6: grief, hope,  resolve, and fierce commitment to protect our country.

Mr. Speaker, the Framers had first-hand experience with the types of  abuses and usurpations committed by political leaders who ruled them  but were not accountable to them and detailed many of those wrongs in  the Declaration of Independence.   The Framers understood and declared to the world that democratic  governors derived their powers from the knowing and voluntary consent  of the governed as expressed in free, fair, and unfettered elections  unmarred by the influence or sabotage of any foreign country or entity  not a member of the political community.   The Framers understood that if elections are influenced by foreign  actors or authoritarian forces within, then voters are reduced from the  great role of citizens to mere subjects, and government for and by the  people is a sham.   The most important feature of a democracy is that it is the voters  who alone can confer the legitimate consent and authorization necessary  to govern upon the governors who are then duty-bound to represent the  voters' interests, and only their interests.   Mr. Speaker, the fundamental democratic compact between the governed  and the governors is that the latter's authority and continuance in  office comes exclusively from the governed and allegiance is owed  exclusively to the governed.

I urge all Members to join me in voting for H.R. 3233, the National  Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the Capitol Complex  Act.    Mr. Speaker, in this short period of time, I offer  several  [[Page H2596]]  thoughts. First of all, we are stronger as a country when we stand up  against hate at all times.   Today, in the Judiciary Committee, we saw the results of hate now 100  years in the making, and that is the Tulsa race riots. The Tulsa race  riots showed that attackers looted and intentionally burned an  estimated 1,256 homes in Greenwood, America's Black Wall Street, along  with nearly all of the district's churches, schools, and businesses.   The testimony of yesteryear saw hundreds of men march through the  main business section of White town with their hats off and their hands  up. The brutality was unmentionable. Men, women, and children, driven  like cattle, huddled like horses, treated like beasts.   Today, we heard from Viola Fletcher, 107 years old; Hughes van Ellis,  100 years old; and Lessie Benningfield Randle, 106 years old. We ask  for justice for them.   In addition, I want to take note that this is Asian American and  Pacific Islander Heritage Month, and to be able to say that we stand  against the horrific shootings in Atlanta, Georgia, on March 16, 2021.  We have to stand against hate. I am glad that we passed the bipartisan  commission on January 6 to show that America is unified.   Finally, some good news to my constituents: We will be launching the  child tax credit effort. We want you to get that child tax credit.                            ____________________
