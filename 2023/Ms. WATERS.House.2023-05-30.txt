 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2792, the Small Entity Update  Act, sponsored by the gentlewoman from Missouri.   This bill directs the SEC to carry out a study and rulemaking, if  appropriate, on its definitions of ``small entities'' under the  Regulatory Flexibility Act to ensure that the SEC accounts for impacts  on businesses when pursuing rulemakings.   The Regulatory Flexibility Act provides small entities with an  expanded opportunity to participate in the development of certain  regulations. Through the study contemplated under the bill, ``small  entities'' under SEC's jurisdiction would gain a louder voice when it  comes to the development of SEC regulations that directly apply to  them.   I am pleased that Mrs. Wagner was willing to accept changes to this  bill I pressed for that would ensure that the SEC remains in exclusive  control of the study, and whatever the outcome of the study, SEC's  actions would be consistent with its overall mission.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Wagner for working with us on this bill. I  also thank Mrs. Wagner for working with Mr. Casten to include his  suggestion related to an inflation adjustment for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2795, the Enhancing Multi- Class Share Disclosures Act, sponsored by the gentleman from New York.   This bill closes documented gaps around multi-class governance  structures. Multi-class governance structures are those where corporate  insiders or beneficial owners retain an outsized amount of voting power  relative to their shares.   These structures, while they may add value, can pose significant  risks to other investors, making sunlight ever more important for  investors. Specifically, these structures limit investors' ability to  influence management, direct strategy, and hold misaligned boards  accountable.   Under current rules, the difference between a corporate insider's  voting power and their ownership interest, regardless of how large that  gap may be, is often disclosed in ways that are difficult for a retail  investor to fully comprehend.   Accordingly, the SEC Investor Advisory Committee recommended that the  SEC amend its rules to ensure that this gap is better identified and  quantified for investors via a disclosed ratio. This commonsense bill  adopts this recommendation to ensure investors have the clearest  information available to make the best decision for themselves.   This bill is supported by the Council of Institutional Investors,  whose members manage trillions of dollars of assets for people all  across America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Meeks), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   This bill is pro-transparency, pro-investor, pro-corporate  accountability. It strengthens investors' and other stakeholders'  ability to understand the risks associated with investing in companies  that have dual-class share structures.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 2796, the Promoting Opportunities  for Non-Traditional Capital Formation Act.   At the beginning of this Congress, Chairman McHenry expressed an  interest in working with me to pass sensible, pro-investor, and pro- capital formation bills, particularly if they will help small  businesses.   My bill would do just that. It will encourage the SEC to better serve  the needs of underserved small businesses, coordinate better with State  regulators, all the while protecting investors.   The Office of the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation is an  independent SEC office that was established to advance the interests of  small businesses. Under my bill, the office would be directed to  proactively work to identify and address unique challenges faced by  minority owned, women-owned, and rural small businesses, as well as  businesses located in natural disaster areas.   My bill requires the SEC's Small Business Advocate to provide  educational resources and host events to promote capital-raising  options for these underrepresented small businesses and businesses in  rural areas.   We all know that oftentimes you need that face-to-face connection to  tell your story, but all too often, minority-owned businesses aren't  invited to those gatherings.   My bill would also require the office to meet annually with  representatives of State Securities Commissions to ensure that there is  a whole-of-government approach to addressing the unique needs of  underrepresented businesses.   The North American Securities Administrators Association strongly  supports this legislation, particularly as it would strengthen  collaboration and coordination between regulators.   Indeed, my bill makes sure that Federal regulators and State  regulators do just that, while at the same time advancing the cause of  small business capital formation across the spectrum. I hope my  colleagues will join me in passing this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I yield myself  the balance of my time.   I am pleased to have worked with Chairman McHenry on this bill, and I  look forward to continuing to work with him on other bills that are  pro-small business and pro-capital formation, while at the same time  strengthening the ability of our market and investor protection  agencies to do their jobs.   Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2797, the Equal Opportunity  for All Investors Act, sponsored by the gentleman from Nebraska. The  accredited investor framework serves to protect the general public from  investing in high-risk, illiquid, private securities because they lack  the safeguards that are a feature of public securities.   Unlike our public capital markets, companies do not provide anywhere  near the same financial and other disclosures to investors for private  offerings. Private securities also do not offer the same legal  protections for investors.   The SEC and State securities regulators do not have the same ability  to police the private markets as they can the public markets. The  general rationale behind the comparative lack of regulations governing  private securities is that institutional investors like private equity  funds, hedge funds, banks, and others can demand the disclosures from  the company in exchange for their investment and have significant legal  resources to hold the company accountable.   These Wall Street players and other big-money investors don't  necessarily need the same level of protections when investing as  compared to retail investors like working families do. The accredited  investor definition ensures that those who are eligible to invest in  private securities do, in fact, have the knowledge to know these  heightened risks.   Initially, the SEC defined accredited investors to be those who  possess an intimate understanding of the risk and had the knowledge  base to decide whether to invest in these particular types of  securities.   However, the companies needing to raise capital privately and the  underwriters and intermediaries facilitating these capital-raising  activities argued for a simpler approach, so the SEC adopted the  current definition which is based on financial resources.   Today, an accredited investor must meet three criteria: They must  have a net worth either individually or with a spouse exceeding $1  million, excluding the value of their home; make more than $200,000 a  year or $300,000 with a spouse; or since 2020, hold certain  professional certifications or designations, such as being an  investment adviser or broker.   This bill being considered under suspension today aims to return to  the original concept of accredited investor, which is that investors in  these high-risk investment offerings should be fully aware and  knowledgeable of the risks involved.   We all know that just because you have a million dollars, it doesn't  mean that you understand the complexities of investing. This is why it  is important for the SEC to also update the current thresholds so that  Wall Street intermediaries are not able to sell unregulated securities  to individuals who have become accredited solely based on  [[Page H2657]]  the inflated value of their retirement assets.   For example, unfortunately, there are millions of accredited  investors who are now being solicited to invest in products they have  little knowledge about and the SEC should act to amend the definition  of the accredited investors to protect those investors.   On the other hand, we have heard from some investors who really want  to try their luck with some of these risky and illiquid investments,  but they do not qualify as an accredited investor because they don't  meet the wealth or the income test.   The Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act would solve the latter  part of this problem by allowing an individual to qualify as an  accredited investor if they pass an exam that ensures they are  sufficiently versed in the risk of investing in the private markets.   Generally, private markets are understood to have a higher potential  for total loss and can be significantly illiquid than the public  markets, so having a deep understanding of these risks is necessary to  navigate the space. In addition, there are fewer protections for  investors when things go wrong with an investment.   With this change, any investor who wants to invest in private  securities can now do so if they can pass this test, which would  establish they are keenly aware of the particular risks related to  high-risk and illiquid securities, as well as the conflicts of  interests presented when financial professionals sell these products to  investors.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Flood and Chair McHenry for working with me  to ensure that the test in this bill is established by the SEC and that  it contains specific, robust elements that witnesses at previous  committee hearings talked about when discussing how they teach and  mentor their budding investors. I am also pleased that the tests in  this bill would be available free of charge.    I think that this bill will solve the problem of people who are ready  to invest, who are not millionaires, they are not billionaires, but  they are smart and they know how to determine what the risks are. If  they are prepared to take them, then let them do so.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Nickel), the lead cosponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  closing.   Mr. Speaker, it is important to appropriately tailor the accredited  investor definition to protect those who do not have the requisite  knowledge to make certain investments while creating a pathway for  those who have demonstrable knowledge about the risk associated with  investing in private securities.   I believe this bill would ensure that those who possess the knowledge  and risk appetite for privately-issued securities are able to invest in  those.   Mr. Speaker, I, again, urge my colleagues to support this bill that  is offered by Mr. Flood and Mr. Nickel, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
