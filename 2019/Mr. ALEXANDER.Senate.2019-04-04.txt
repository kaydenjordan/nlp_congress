 Thank you, Madam President.   Today I received a letter from the U.S. Ambassador to China, Terry  Branstad. Governor Branstad's letter said the following:         I am delighted to inform you that China's Ministry of       Public Security announced China will make all forms of       fentanyl a controlled substance effective May 1, 2019. If       implemented effectively, this will fulfill the commitment       President Xi made to the President at the G-20 last December       in Buenos Aires. That commitment and this key development are       direct results of your visit to Beijing during which you       highlighted China's role in the global opioid crisis.       Separately, I have asked my staff to share diplomatic       reporting with you that addresses China's action in greater       detail.    That is from Ambassador Terry Branstad, our Ambassador to China.   This is important news. It will save thousands of American lives.  President Trump deserves great credit for persuading President Xi at  their meeting in Argentina in December to do this, the one thing that  our drug enforcement agents have said will reduce the flow of fentanyl  into the United States more than any other single thing.   President Xi, the President of China, deserves the thanks of the  American people for making this decision because our Drug Enforcement  Agency is convinced that this decision by China and its senior  officials will save thousands of American lives.   The reason for this, we were told by our Drug Enforcement Agency  personnel in China, is that, one way or the other, almost every bit of  fentanyl that makes its way into the United States starts in China.  These chemicals are made and mixed there. Then they come through the  mail. They come through Mexico, through China, many different ways, but  the chemicals start in China.   Every time China has made some form of fentanyl illegal, the  availability of that form of fentanyl in the United States has begun to  go straight down.   What President Trump and President Xi agreed to do on May 1 is to  make all forms of fentanyl illegal. This means that if some clever  scientist in China says: Well, this form of fentanyl is illegal, so I  will make a different form that isn't, that clever scientist will now  be out of business.   One thing the Chinese know very well how to do is to police their  country. I would not want to be the Chinese person, after May 1, who is  in violation of Chinese law that says all forms of fentanyl are  controlled substances and illegal in China.   In October, I led a delegation of senior Members of the House of  Representatives and the Senate to meet with the Chinese senior  delegation. One would have thought that all we talked about was trade  because trade was important to all of our States, but at Governor  Branstad's insistence, in every meeting we had with senior Chinese  officials, we said: Fentanyl is our biggest problem, and you can solve  our biggest problem more than anybody else in the world. Instead of  being our problem, why don't you be our solution? Why don't you let the  United States point to China and say that you helped us solve a problem  that is killing thousands of Americans on a regular basis?   China agreed to do that in December with President Trump. It has now  been announced that on May 1, all forms of fentanyl will be controlled  and therefore illegal.   We should watch and make sure it is effectively done, but what we  should say today is: President Trump, we thank you for putting fentanyl  on top of a busy agenda in December, and, President Xi, we are grateful  to you for a decision we believe will save thousands of American lives.  I might add, it is very helpful to have such an effective Ambassador as  Terry Branstad in China because he knew how to focus the attention of  many visiting delegations.   Our delegation wasn't the only one who carried this message; Senator  Portman and others have been there. But this is an example of China  responding to an urgent American problem, and we ought to give both  Presidents much more than a pat on the back for this important step.  [[Page S2251]]                                       Healthcare    Madam President, I often suggest to Tennesseans that we should look  at Washington as if it were a split-screen television. For example,  last October, on one screen, you would have seen Senators throwing food  at each other all month long over the Kavanaugh debate, but in another  part of the Capitol, you had 72 Senators working together--Democrats,  Republicans, three different committees from the Senate, five from the  House--working together to enact what the President called the single  most important law to deal with a public health epidemic ever passed,  and that was the opioids bill.   While we are arguing--which we know how to do--on such issues as the  border or the special counsel's report, on the other screen, you will  see a lot of work getting done if you take time to look. That means  there are bipartisan efforts. That means Republicans and Democrats are  working together. It takes 60 votes to get most things done here. We  are 53 to 47. So, as I learned to count in the public schools of  Tennessee, I know I need to work with some Democrats to get up to 60.  Usually, we find that when we do that, we get up to 70 or 80 or 85  because we can take even the most difficult issues and find our way  through them.   Today, I want to talk about one of those efforts--a bipartisan effort  to try to reduce healthcare costs. Healthcare and health insurance are  often conflated. We often mix them up, both in Congress and in media  stories. The President sometimes does that too. I want to be very clear  that what I am talking about is a bipartisan working effort, that  healthcare itself, not just health insurance, is too expensive.   Health insurance has gotten a lot of attention lately. The President  tweeted earlier this week that ``deductibles, in many cases [are] way  over $7,000, mak[ing] it almost worthless or unusable.'' I agree. High  deductibles tied to high premiums make healthcare inaccessible for too  many Americans. I know the President is looking at ways to give  Americans more affordable health insurance and to protect patients with  preexisting conditions, and I look forward to hearing his plan. But the  truth is, the cost of health insurance will not come down or even grow  more slowly unless we lower the cost of healthcare. You can't have low- cost health insurance when you have high-cost healthcare.   My top healthcare priority this Congress is to enact legislation that  will give all Americans an opportunity for better health outcomes and  better health experiences at a lower cost. Democrats and Republicans  are working together on that to get a result.   That is why Senator Murray, the lead Democrat on the Senate's Health  Committee, and I are working with Senator Grassley and Senator Wyden,  the senior leaders on the Senate Finance Committee, which shares  jurisdiction over healthcare. We are working together on developing  specific, bipartisan steps to help deal with the startling fact--which  has come by way of experts who come before our Health Committee--that  up to half of what Americans spend on healthcare is unnecessary. That  is according to Dr. Brent James of the National Academies in testimony  before our committee.   Last December, in order to help focus on reducing healthcare costs,  after the Senate Health Committee held five hearings on reducing the  cost of healthcare, I wrote a letter to the American Enterprise  Institute, the Brookings Institution, governors, State insurance  commissioners, doctors, patient groups, academic experts, and the  public asking them to submit specific recommendations to Congress to  lower healthcare costs. As of the March 1 deadline for response, we  have received over 400 recommendations, some as many as 50 pages long.   I want to talk about some of those today. Before I do, it is  important to know that the cost of healthcare, in effect, has become a  tax on the budgets of families, employers, the Federal Government, and  State governments. Warren Buffett has called the ballooning cost of  healthcare ``a hungry tapeworm on the American economy.''   Almost every day, I hear from Tennesseans who are concerned that  healthcare is too expensive. For example, Sherry from Hermitage, TN,  wrote me about her daughter's family and said:         They are new parents now and spend almost as much on       healthcare premiums as they do on their mortgage payment.       That doesn't include the out-of-pocket expenses, such as       copays and deductibles.    Many people worry about a surprise billing, which is when a patient  receives care at an in-network hospital, but an out-of-network  specialist--like an anesthesiologist, for instance--also treats the  patient.   Todd is a father from Knoxville, TN, who recently took his son to an  emergency room after a bicycle accident. The son was treated. Todd paid  a $150 copay because the emergency room was in-network for his health  insurance, and they headed home. Todd was pretty surprised when he  received a bill later for $1,800 because even though the emergency room  was in-network, the doctor who treated his son was not.   I hear a lot about the high cost of prescription drugs. Shirley  recently wrote me from Franklin saying:         As a 71-year-old senior with arthritis, I rely on Enbrel to       keep my systems in check. My copay has just been increased       from $95 to $170 every 90 days. At this rate, I will have to       begin limiting my usage in order to balance the monthly       budget.    I hear from doctors about administrative burden. Dr. Lee Gross, a  Florida direct primary care doctor, testified at one of our hearings  that insurance and government regulations were making primary care too  expensive. Dr. Gross founded one of the first direct primary care  practices. This is where a patient might pay $60 a month for an adult,  $25 for the first child, $10 for each child after, and receive all  their primary care--strep tests, vaccines, minor surgical procedures,  and more. He calls it ``NetFlix for healthcare. After you pay your  membership, you don't have to pay for each episode of care.''    Dr. Atul Gawande, who is leading the Amazon-Berkshire Hathaway- JPMorgan healthcare venture, told me recently in a conversation that  direct primary care doctors are a powerful group for driving improved  outcomes in healthcare because the doctors take responsibility for the  outcomes, the risks, and the cost to the patient.   I also hear that the place where medical procedures are performed can  make healthcare more expensive. For example, Michael from Johnson City  shared that he recently had an endoscopy of his esophagus--a fairly  common, routine procedure. He had the procedure at an outpatient  facility, which typically is less expensive than a hospital; however,  the procedure was billed as being done at a hospital. Michael is on  Medicare, and he wrote to me saying: ``Not only am I charged a higher  ``hospital'' rate, but taxpayers are charged a higher rate, as well.''   I imagine that every Senator has heard similar stories from people in  their States and wants to do something about reducing the cost of  healthcare.   In addition to the more than 400 comments we received, the American  Enterprise Institute and Brookings sent us a detailed list of 18  specific policy recommendations. The Senate Health Committee can work  on some of these. Some of these fall into the jurisdiction of other  committees, and some are steps the administration itself can take  without congressional action.   My staff and I are still reviewing all of these recommendations, but  I want to mention some of them today.   One reason healthcare is so expensive is that the cost is in a black  box. Patients just don't know how much a particular test and procedure  will cost. That makes it nearly impossible to adequately plan for  future healthcare expenses, and because of that, the healthcare system  does not operate with the discipline and the cost-saving benefits of a  real market.   Congress has already taken some steps to increase transparency. For  example, last Congress, we passed and the President signed legislation  by Senator Collins of Maine to ban the so-called gag clauses in  pharmacy contracts that prevented pharmacists from telling a patient  that a drug was cheaper if they paid with cash instead of their  insurance.   Now we have received recommendations on how to build on that first  step. For example, patients shouldn't be prohibited from knowing the  cost of a surgery or a doctor's visit in advance of scheduling the  procedure or appointment. Insurers and employers should  [[Page S2252]]  not be prohibited from providing patients with information recommending  lower cost options or higher quality providers.   Another recommendation--this one from AEI and Brookings--is that  employers contribute claims data--which is information on how much a  test or service costs and how much insurance paid for it--to what is  known as an all payer claims database. Eighteen States currently have  these databases so employers and insurers can see trends in healthcare  spending. This would help break open the black box around the claims  data for the 181 million Americans who get their healthcare on the job.   One of our new Health Committee Members, Senator Braun of Indiana,  owns a manufacturing and distribution company. He employed over 1,000  people before he became a Senator. He was aggressive about helping his  employees reduce healthcare costs.   Healthcare Bluebook, a Tennessee company that testified at one of our  five hearings on how to reduce healthcare costs, recommended that we  look at the clauses in contracts employers sign with insurers that  block the employer from accessing de-identified claims data that they  could use ``for purpose of price and quality transparency.''   The Trump administration is also focused on transparency. For  example, Secretary Azar has proposed a regulation to start requiring  that advertisements for prescription drugs include the list price, and  he has asked for feedback on the idea of requiring that the prices  patients pay for medical services also be disclosed.   Another strategy for achieving better outcomes and better experiences  at lower costs is to focus on the 300,000 primary care doctors in our  country. Dr. Sapna Kripalani of Vanderbilt testified at one of our  healthcare cost hearings that primary care providers are the  ``quarterbacks'' of healthcare. By coordinating patients' care,  managing their chronic diseases, and providing other preventive care,  primary care doctors are able to help patients stay healthy and out of  the emergency room.   Adam Boehler, who leads the Center for Medicare and Medicaid  Innovation, told me that while primary care accounts for only 3 to 7  percent of healthcare spending, it can affect as much as half of all  healthcare spending.   One recommendation we received came from Dr. Gilliam, a primary care  doctor in West Tennessee who runs a direct primary care practice--the  same type of practice I mentioned earlier that Dr. Gross runs. Dr.  Gilliam said: ``[Direct primary care] is the only model that is able to  offer affordable healthcare with complete price transparency.''   One suggestion we have heard is to change Internal Revenue Service  rules that block Americans from using their health savings accounts to  pay for the monthly direct primary care fee.   Then there is drug pricing. Many recommendations are focused on  reducing what we spend on prescription drugs, which is about 17 percent  of all healthcare spending.   One way is reforming prescription drug rebates, the discounts that  pharmacy benefit managers negotiate with pharmaceutical companies. The  Trump administration has proposed a new rule for the $29 billion  rebates on prescription drugs that the government pays for through  Medicare Part D. One recommendation is to expand that to the estimated  $40 billion of rebates negotiated in the private market.   Another way to lower drug prices is to increase competition through  generic drugs, which can be up to 85 percent less expensive than brand  drugs when there are multiple approved generics. I have heard concerns  about brand drug companies not providing generic companies the samples  needed to make generic drugs and other ways that brands delay drug  competition.   It was recommended that we increase competition for the generic  versions of biologic drugs, which are called biosimilars. One way to do  that may be with a bill Senator Collins introduced to ensure that  biosimilar manufacturers have access to the information they need to  develop and bring to market more biosimilars.   Then there is surprise billing.   AEI and Brookings also recommended we focus on helping to eliminate  surprise medical billing, which is what happened when Todd, of  Knoxville, took his son to the emergency room. AEI and Brookings said  the issue is not that insurance companies have limited doctors and  hospitals in their networks but that emergency departments and  ancillary physicians, as well as hospitalists and ambulance companies,  have a lucrative out-of-network billing arrangement that is unavailable  to other providers, which encourages doctors to go out of network and  send patients high bills. Senator Cassidy and Senator Hassan are  leading the way to help eliminate surprise billing.   We received comments about the importance of the seamless exchange of  information between electronic health records, which includes stopping  information blocking.   A goal of the 21st Century Cures Act, which is a bipartisan bill that  Senator McConnell said was the most important bill that Congress, was  to make it easier for patients to access their health records and for  doctors and hospitals to get the information they need to treat  patients. Last month, the Department of Health and Human Services  released two proposed rules required by the Cures Act to lead to better  coordinated care and to less unnecessary health care. We held a hearing  on those last week. We heard a story of the better experiences and  outcomes that can happen when health records are interoperable.  Finally, there is the consolidation of healthcare.   We received comments on the decreasing choices and competition in the  healthcare system, which is when hospitals merge with doctors' offices  or other hospitals, when insurers merge with other insurers, or when  hospitals and insurers merge so that these hospitals or insurers have  even more control over the market.   Some argue that the consolidation in healthcare can benefit patients  and lower costs. Others say that it gives patients fewer options and  that healthcare prices increase.   AEI and Brookings suggested that one way to address the potential  negative consequences of consolidation would be to improve oversight of  the 340B drug discount program, which has been found to incentivize  hospitals to purchase physician practices or to employ physicians  directly in order to bring in additional revenue from the 340B  discounts. This echoes what we heard at our committee's three hearings.   I am also asking for other Senators to continue to come forward to  Senator Murray, to Senator Wyden, to Senator Grassley, and to me with  their specific proposals as to how we can reduce healthcare costs. What  I hope to do is to compile the proposals that fall under the  jurisdiction of our Senate HELP Committee into a package of legislation  that the committee will vote on early in the summer. We could then  combine that with whatever the Senate Finance Committee passes and ask  the leader to put it on the Senate floor and work with the House to  send legislation to the President's desk.   This morning, in a hearing before the Appropriations Committee,  Secretary Azar reiterated his support and the President's support for  this bipartisan process to reduce health care costs.   My staff and I will continue to review recommendations and work with  other Members to incorporate ways so that Americans like Sherry, Todd,  Shirley, and Michael will have better outcomes and better experiences  at lower costs.   I yield the floor.
