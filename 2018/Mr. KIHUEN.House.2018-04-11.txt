 Madam Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of  Rhonda LeRocque. Rhonda attended the Route 91 Festival in Las Vegas on  October 1.   Rhonda was married to her husband, Jason, for 21 years, with whom she  had a 6-year-old daughter, Ali.   Rhonda and Jason were very active in their church and enjoyed  participating in humanitarian projects together. One of their biggest  projects was when they traveled to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina  to help rebuild homes.   Rhonda worked for a design firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but  dreamed of opening up her own catering business. She loved skiing,  cooking, and baking, but nothing could surpass her love for her family.  She is remembered for being a selfless and joyful woman who had a  strong faith.   I would like to extend my condolences to Rhonda LeRocque's family and  friends. Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada,  and the whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Maloney and Ranking  Member Waters for providing me this opportunity to speak about the  critical importance of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the  CFPB.   Mr. Speaker, during the recession, Nevada was ground zero for the  housing crisis.   For 5 years, Nevada led the Nation in foreclosures. In 2010, 70  percent of Nevada homeowners were underwater on their homes. I saw  firsthand as family, friends, neighbors, and constituents who lost  their homes because of big banks and unscrupulous mortgage lenders.   While Nevada has made a tremendous recovery since the recession, the  scars are deep and still fresh.   In the wake of the financial crisis, the CFPB was created to protect  Americans from unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices that led to the  financial crisis, and to take action against companies that break the  law.   The CFPB has cracked down on predatory lenders and aggressive debt  collectors, and forced financial institutions to return over $11  billion to Americans who have been taken advantage of.   Since 2011, the agency has been a resource for thousands of my  constituents. More than 14,000 Nevadans have gone to the CFPB with  complaints, and over 3,400 of them about mortgages.   It is appalling that Mr. Mulvaney and congressional Republicans are  focused on destroying the CFPB at the expense of American families.   When someone has an unwarranted overdraft, an incorrect credit score,  or is misled by their bank, they turn to the CFPB for help.   I will do everything I can to ensure that Nevadans never again have  to experience the pain of being foreclosed on or being preyed upon by  unscrupulous lenders.   The cost to consumers is not only their livelihoods, but the future  of our economy, because a strong economy includes a strong consumer.
