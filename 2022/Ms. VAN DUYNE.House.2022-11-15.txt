 Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart. Over the  weekend, tragedy struck North Texas as six lives were taken in an air  show honoring our veterans. One victim was Texas-24 resident and local  leader, Terry Barker.   Terry was the epitome of an all-American hero. An Army veteran and  American Airlines pilot of 36 years, Terry spent decades of his storied  and accomplished life serving others. His service in the Army and  unmatched dedication to honoring veterans is a testament to the kind of  man Terry was.   Just last week, to pay tribute to veterans, Terry helped set up the  Keller Field of Honor: 1,776 full-size U.S. flags dedicated to the  1,776 heroes. He then took to the skies one last time in a World War II  era B-17 bomber to pay tribute to the Greatest Generation.   Terry was also a dedicated public servant, spending two terms as a  Keller City councilmember. My friend and colleague, Keller Mayor Armin  Mizani, described Terry as his mentor, and an ``outgoing and selfless  man who always had a joke to share.''   Texas-24 lost an American patriot, a public servant, and beloved  friend this week. I ask you to please join me in praying for Terry, his  family, and all of those affected by this weekend's tragedy.                            ____________________
