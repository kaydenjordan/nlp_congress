 Madam Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairman  for his leadership, and I thank my distinguished friend from Illinois,  Congresswoman Bustos for her constant determination.   It is wonderful that H.R. 4445 is restoring freedom and justice to  women. It is a bipartisan piece of legislation that will not allow any  pre-dispute arbitration agreement or pre-dispute joint action waiver to  be valid or enforceable with respect to a case which is filed under  Federal, Tribal, or State law and relates to a sexual assault dispute  or sexual harassment dispute.   I am glad to hear friends on the other side, as this is a bipartisan  bill, acknowledge the fact that this is an absolute injustice; an  injustice that befalls a certain segment of the population, and that is  women.   One of the cases that is most stark is the one of Stefani Bambace.  Many witnesses came before us in the Judiciary  [[Page H988]]  Committee. Witness after witness gave us horror stories of isolation  and fear and the absolute inability, because of the fine print, to do  anything about it.    Stefani Bambace alleged that she worked in a sexually charged and  hostile work environment, including being subjected to sexually  explicit language from her employer, sexual advances and groping. Let  me say that again. Touching in her space from her employer, sexual  advances and groping and explicit images. How can you work as a  professional or anyone? Think of the levels of work that women are in;  from domestic to as high a level as scientists and CEOs. But yet, they  are subjected to this kind of behavior.   According to Ms. Bambace's petition, she complained to human  resources to no avail about the harassment. And guess what her relief  was? Guess what empathy was shown? Guess what comfort and reforming the  system was? It was her being fired. That is right. She was fired. How  many stories of women are there, that are yet not told, who were fired?   And so this agreement of which my colleague has worked on, and we are  pleased in the Judiciary Committee to be part of moving this  legislation, this will end these arbitration agreements that are snuck  into a packet of materials that you sign.   It is imperative we pass it, but more importantly Madam Speaker, it  is imperative that it is passed in the Senate because it is bipartisan,  but it is signed by the President and becomes law.   I thank Ms. Bambace and all of the witnesses that came before us.  They sacrifice, they suffered, but yet today, hopefully, will be an  announcement, a pronouncement of freedom and justice for women who have  struggled with this all of the time.   H.R. 4445 is a relief that is a long time in coming, and it should  move away from blind, silent, quiet agreements that no one knows what  it is. Freedom and justice for women in the workforce today.   Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in strong support of H.R. 4445, the  Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act.   This bill will amend Title 9 of the United States Code, empowering  survivors of sexual assault and harassment by restoring their access to  justice and public accountability under the law.   By ending forced arbitration in lawsuits involving these claims,  survivors of sexual assault or sexual harassment are empowered with  making the decision on whether they wish to pursue legal action against  their assailants which often includes going to court to arbitrate their  claims.   It is estimated that 60 million Americans have signed away their  right to seek real justice and most don't realize it until they try to  get help.   H.R. 4445 will not allow any pre-dispute arbitration agreement or  predispute joint-action waiver to be valid or enforceable with respect  to a case which is filed under Federal, Tribal, or State law and  relates to a sexual assault dispute or a sexual harassment dispute.   In the Judiciary markup which brought this bill to the floor,  survivors of sexual harassment and sexual assault shared their stories  with the committee about their devastating experiences and the  subsequent arbitration process they were forced to endure as a  condition of their employment.   The #MeToo movement chipped away at the culture of secrecy that  protects predators and silences survivors.   Ending mandatory arbitration has the power to ensure that survivors  of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace have their  voices heard.   For example, in Bambace v. Berry Y&V Fabricators, LLC, Stefani  Bambace alleged that she worked in a sexually charged and hostile work  environment, including ``being subjected to sexually explicit images  from her employer, sexual advances, and groping.''   According to her petition, she complained to Human Resources about  the harassment and was fired three weeks later.   She filed a lawsuit alleging violations of Chapter 21 of the Texas  Labor Code.   Like more than half of non-unionized American workers, Bambace was  subject to an employer promulgated arbitration agreement.   These arbitration agreements are often snuck into a packet of  materials employers give employees on their first day of employment to  sign and they are rarely negotiated or even discussed.   In a well-reasoned opinion in Bambace, the Court held that the  arbitration agreement, which required the Plaintiff to litigate sexual  harassment claims in confidential and binding arbitration, violated  public policy, injured the public good, and was therefore void and  unenforceable.   Critically, the Court further rejected Defendant's argument that the  arbitrator, not the Court, should determine whether the sexual  harassment claims were subject to arbitration.   Fortunately, in the Bambace case Harris County Judge Lauren Reeder  understood that cases such as these should be determined by a court,  rather than an arbitrator irrespective of whether the agreement  purports to delegate such determinations to an arbitrator.   This is just one story out of millions where forced arbitration  agreements attempt, and usually succeed, to silence sexual assault and  sexual harassment victims.   These forced ``agreements'' strip survivors of the right to decide  how to pursue accountability of their predators.   Instead, these survivors' stories are heard in secret, behind closed  doors, and do little to nothing to stop the systematic abuse from  occurring again.   The Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment  Act of 2021 will ensure that these survivors will have their voices  heard in a court of law if they choose to do so.   No survivor of sexual harassment or sexual assault should be forced  into silence, especially by a piece of paper buried within their  employment agreement.   Forced arbitration allows companies to hide and shield sexual  predators and keep employees from knowing that their other colleagues  could be victims of the same person.   Voiding these clauses in sexual harassment and discrimination cases  would aid victims by pulling back the veil of secrecy on bad behavior  in the workplace.   More than 56% of Americans are subject to these mandatory arbitration  agreements.   These victims deserve the right to choose to go to court, it should  not be in the hands of their employer.   A 2011 Cornell University study found that employees are less likely  to win arbitration cases.   These corporations embrace arbitration because it is a cheaper and  faster way to settle disputes and can cut down frivolous lawsuits.   Corporations do not want to face juries because they know citizens  will punish them for their wrongdoing, so they sneak arbitration  language into their take-it-or-leave-it contracts.   Forced arbitration is a sexual harasser's best friend, it is an issue  of fundamental human rights.   Eliza Dushku, an actress, testified that she had been fired from the  CBS prime-time drama ``Bull'' after she asked her co-star, Michael  Weatherly, a producer on the show, to stop harassing her.   She said he had made rape jokes about her and had told her in front  of dozens of cast and crew members that he wanted to be in a threesome  with her.   She said she had later learned that the contract she signed with CBS  included a forced arbitration clause.   After a mediation, the company agreed to a confidential settlement  that would pay Ms. Dushku $9.5 million.   Situations such as Ms. Dushku's aim to sweep sexual harassment and  assault cases under the rug.   Silencing these victims is exactly what forced arbitration agreements  are meant to do and I believe we should no longer tolerate this  behavior.   This is an excellent and common-sense bill that will ensure victims  are not silenced by forced arbitration agreements any longer.   Although we cannot bring justice and a voice for those who have  already settled their cases to their arbitration agreements, we can  ensure that future victims will be heard and not suppressed in their  truth.                                time  1730     Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the House and  the Committee on Homeland Security, and as Chair of  [[Page H992]]  the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security,  I rise in strong support of H.R. 4445, the Ending Forced Arbitration of  Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 4445, the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual  Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021, is bipartisan and bicameral  legislation that empowers survivors of sexual assault and sexual  harassment by giving them a choice to go to court instead of being  forced into arbitration.   This legislation would amend the Federal Arbitration Act for disputes  involving sexual assault and sexual harassment in order to stop  employers and businesses from forcing employees and customers out of  the court system and into arbitration.   It would ensure that predispute arbitration clauses and waivers of  the right to bring joint actions in cases of sexual assault or sexual  harassment would not be valid or enforceable for cases that are filed  under Federal, Tribal, or State law.   Under current law, many employment and other contracts require  binding arbitration for a wide range of matters before a dispute  arises, which denies survivors the ability to decide whether to pursue  their claim with the procedural protections provided by courts, and  silences victims of abuse by forcing them into a confidential dispute  forum without the right to appeal.   Madam Speaker, more than 60 million Americans are subject to  mandatory arbitration clauses in the workplace, often without realizing  it until they come forward to bring a claim against their employer.   The Report of the Co-Chairs of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity  Commission's Select Task Force on the Study of Harassment in the  Workplace notes that between 50-75 percent of women have faced some  form of unwanted or unwelcome sexual harassment in the workplace.   Additionally, contracts for services may include mandatory  arbitration clauses in the fine print that shield companies and  businesses from being held publicly accountable for the harm caused.   I support this necessary legislation because it advances efforts to  prevent and address sexual harassment and sexual assault, strengthen  rights, protect victims, and promote access to justice.   Madam Speaker, I strongly support this legislation and urge all  Members to join me in voting for H.R. 4445, the Ending Forced  Arbitration of Sexual Assault and Sexual Harassment Act of 2021.    Madam Speaker, the head of the NFL said that racism  of any kind is unacceptable.   Having worked on these issues since the very beginning of my tenure  in the United States Congress, including hearings in Houston on brain  injuries that were undiagnosed, I take a special interest in the Brian  Flores lawsuit for the reality that it means something is wrong and it  must be changed.   Yesterday, I honored a Houston Texan who had a great history. Today,  as I tweeted early this morning, the vacancy should be filled by Lovie  Smith, an African American, a coach for the Houston Texans. Later today  they announced that Lovie Smith will be the new coach. With experience  having taken the Chicago team to the Super Bowl, could it be anyone  else?   Now, we need to begin to assess how we can act on the words ``racism  is unacceptable'' in any sport in any part of America's life.   I am excited. Congratulations to Coach Smith and to the Houston  Texans. But let us acknowledge David Culley and go forward so that the  example can be across the landscape of sports wherever it is and across  the Nation.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  California, as always, for reminding us in almost every moment of her  tenure here in the United States Congress of the spirit and the  investment that Shirley Chisholm made in her personally and the  investment that she made as a young college student, saying that I am  going to find Shirley Chisholm or accept the call and be in her  Presidential election. What a historic moment for her.   Also, the very pathway that she has taken in the United States  Congress is evidence that she is definitely a living example of the  fighting spirit of Shirley Chisholm.   It is great to be here to acknowledge this 50th commemoration of this  historic moment. I thank our chair, the Honorable Joyce Beatty, for  reminding us of Our Power, Our Message. I would like to say our  message, our power, and to recognize that the Congressional Black  Caucus is the pacesetter for justice and equality and the elimination  of racism, which still lifts its head today.   To my other colleagues that are here today, I am grateful for their  presence on the floor, for Shirley Chisholm deserves the recognition  and the acknowledgment of who she was but also what she did and what  she invested in America.   Let it be known that even as she was an African-American woman, she  was a great American that made differences that can be seen today.   I want to honor and acknowledge the shoulders upon which I stand.  That includes, in our Congress, Shirley Chisholm, John Conyers, John  Lewis, Ron Dellums, and Barbara Jordan.   I also want to acknowledge my parents, Ivalita ``Ivy'' Jackson, a  vocational nurse, and Ezra C. Jackson, one of the first African  Americans to succeed in the aftermath of being discriminated against in  the comic book industry.   All of that pours into the work of Shirley Chisholm and her campaign  slogan in this, her congressional district race in 1968: ``Fighting  Shirley Chisholm: Unbought and Unbossed.'' That continued throughout  her life.   She remarked that women in this country must become revolutionaries,  that we must refuse to accept the old, traditional roles and  stereotypes.   This is a sentiment that I take to heart myself and that the women of  the Congressional Black Caucus have taken to heart. We have told the  Nation that we must have self-determination. We want to lead. Shirley  Chisholm was at the core of the movement of women leading. That is why,  on January 25, 1972, Shirley announced her candidacy.   She stood before the cameras, and in the beginning of her speech, she  said--before I say these words, let me be very clear. There weren't  thousands of people. There may not have been hundreds and hundreds of  people. I can tell you there was a bounty of skeptics, people standing  back and saying: This is unimaginable. Why would she do this? We don't  need her to do this. She is getting in the way.   I am grateful that Shirley Chisholm, fighting Shirley Chisholm,  unbought and unbossed, maintained the dignity of the right of a Black  woman, an American, to run for the Presidency of the United States.   So, she said: ``I stand before you today as a candidate for the  Democratic nomination for the Presidency of the United States.''   How sweet those words are.   ``I am not the candidate of Black America, although I am Black and  proud. I am not the candidate of the women's movement of this country,  although I am a woman and I am equally proud of that. I am not the  candidate of any political''--bosses--``or special interests. . . . I  am the candidate of the people.''   We keep that in mind, this Congress, the Democratic Members of  Congress. The Congressional Black Caucus must keep in mind that we are  the candidates, the spokespersons of the people, that it is their truth  that we must tell. Shirley Chisholm always told their truth.   She did not win the nomination, but she went on to the Democratic  Convention in Miami and received 151 votes.   We know that the Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris,  stands on the shoulders of Shirley Chisholm. The women today that are  elected across America, in all different positions, stand on the  shoulders of Shirley Chisholm.   We recognize that barriers still stand. One that we hope will be  corrected in this month, Black History Month, in Shirley Chisholm's  fighting spirit, is that an African-American woman, a Black woman, will  be nominated to the United States Supreme Court.   We want more than that as well. We want an age-old bill that has been  languishing for so long, H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and Develop  Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act, that Congresswoman  Chisholm would have been on. We want it to be pronounced and announced  this month.   As we honor her tonight, fighting Shirley Chisholm, let me  acknowledge the different poses, the different leadership, as she has  stood for the people of Brooklyn, but the people of America. That is  the face of a fighting woman, and that is the face of the person we  honor tonight.   I am delighted to be here with my colleague, who has always put  Shirley Chisholm in the forefront of our thinking, of how progressive  and innovative and powerful and strong and empowering--I want to leave  you with that. She believed in empowering others and understood the  words of Martin Luther King: Injustice anywhere is injustice  everywhere. Shirley Chisholm was ahead of her time.   Shirley Chisholm is to be honored every day, as my colleague said, as  we walk through these Halls. I look up and see Barbara Jordan, and then  I look up and see Shirley Chisholm, unbought and unbossed. Honor her  tonight and always.    Congresswoman, thank you so very much. I wanted to  offer my appreciation first to you because I want you to be the last  word on this floor tonight because I truly mean what I said earlier,  and in almost every moment there has been an anecdotal story, a very  important one that you have reminded us of the strength of Shirley  Chisholm.   I do want to go back to Shirley's Caribbean roots, but her strong  roots in Brooklyn. I know that you said this, or I am sure it has been  referred to or you will, is that when she came to the United States  Congress, being the first African-American woman and being dismissed  not by her constituents, but by the hierarchy that was here, and I am  sure someone with a little chuckle thought: Brooklyn, urban, guess  where we will put her? On the Agriculture Committee. And that will get  her packing up and running out.   But Shirley Chisholm, again, fighting Shirley Chisholm was her theme,  showed them. I remember those words either said by her or describe her,  a tree grows in Brooklyn. Don't sell us short. A tree grows in Queens,  a tree grows in Manhattan, a tree grows in New York.   She did take to the leadership of the Agriculture Committee,  particularly becoming an expert on SNAP and many other aspects of  agriculture that really dealt with the vulnerable and starving people  in America. That was Shirley Chisholm.    And then as I intertwine the question of the selection and nomination  of an African-American woman to the United States Supreme Court, I want  to put in the Record the words, if you are always ruled but denied the  opportunity to rule, in turn, you are simply a subject and not fully a  citizen. And so Congresswoman Chisholm's presence was to deny being  only ruled and simply being a subject.   The cases that spoke to that are the Supreme Court decisions like  Dred Scott v. Sandford, Plessy v. Ferguson, Korematsu v. United States,  civil rights cases in 1883, Bowers v. Hardwick, Lochner v. New York,  and Buck v. Bell. These cases from 1857 to 1927 all showed where  America was in terms of this cancer called racism.   I want to refer us tonight in my final words on the floor in tribute  to Shirley Chisholm to the words she said about do women dare. As I do  so, with a little bit of sense of great honor is to show a picture of  myself and Shirley Chisholm that I now found and relocated and will  actually get framed, my presenting her with an award after a speech  that she gave in front of the Black women lawyers. When we were few,  unknown, and unlisted and probably unappreciated, she actually came to  speak before the Black women lawyers in Houston, Texas, having some  years before that worked as an intern in her district at one of the  State representatives' offices, Representative Bellamy.                                time  2045    And I might say, as I talk about Shirley, I have to put on the record  that she was selected for the Agriculture Committee, but I am told by  my former colleague, Pat Schroeder, that when she and Ron Dellums went  to the Armed Services Committee, they were given one chair. And they  had to sit in one chair because they were trying to diminish them and  dismiss them. They could not do that. And though this is not about Ron  Dellums, he became the chair of the Armed Services Committee.   But let me give these words in conclusion on the fighting Shirley  Chisholm. This is her speech ``Do Women Dare,'' and it just has been  discovered. ``The topic this morning of course is, `do women dare?' ''   These are her words.   ``And I have said, of course women dare. Do women dare? I assume that  the question implies do women dare take an active part in society, and,  in particular, do they dare to take a part in the present social  revolution?''   We need this now more than ever. And I would say, Do Americans dare?  Do men and women dare? Do African Americans dare? Do vulnerable people  dare?   ``And I find the question as much of an insult as I would the  question, `Are you, as a Black person, willing to fight for your  rights?' America has been sufficiently sensitized to the answer,  whether or not Black people are willing to both fight and die for their  rights. To make the question itself is asinine and superfluous. America  is not yet sufficiently aware, but such a question applied to women is  equally asinine and superfluous.''   And so she goes on to say: ``I am, as is obvious, both Black and a  woman. And that is a good vantage point from which to view at least two  elements of what is becoming a social revolution. The American Black  revolution and the women's liberation movement. But it is also a  horrible disadvantage. It is a disadvantage, my friends, because  America as a Nation, is both racist and antifeminist. Racism and  antifeminism are two of the prime traditions of this country that we  have to face objectively. For any individual, therefore, challenging  social traditions is a giant step. A giant step, because there are no  social traditions which do not have corresponding social sanctions, the  sole purpose of which are to protect the sanctity of the traditions.''   And so she goes on to talk about do women dare. I cannot think of  more important words in 2022 as we fight against racism and sexism, as  we fight to give a sense of reality and honesty and equality to the  idea of a Black woman going to the Supreme Court.   And as we raise up the issue of the study of slavery and the  development of reparation proposals under H.R. 40, can that be a  simple, obvious reality? Can that be something that is just accepted  because it is right?   Shirley Chisholm has taught us to keep fighting and to dare. I thank  the gentlewoman for bringing us to this place and also to this  understanding.   Madam Speaker, this February we recognize and celebrate the 44th  commemoration of Black History Month and the Jubilee anniversary of  Shirley Chisolm's historic run for the presidency in 1972.   I am honored to co-anchor this Congressional Black Caucus Special  Order with my dear friend and colleague, Congresswoman Barbara Lee of  California.   This month we celebrate the contributions of African Americans to the  history of our great Nation, and pay tribute to trailblazers, pioneers,  heroes, and leaders like Kamala D. Harris, the 49th Vice-President of  the United States and the first woman and person of color to be elected  to the office; 44th President of the United States and First Lady,  [[Page H1003]]  Barack Obama and Michelle Obama, respectively; Rev. Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr.; Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall; U.S. Senator  Blanche Kelso Bruce; U.S. Congresswoman Barbara Jordan; U.S.  Congressman Mickey Leland; Astronauts Dr. Guion Stewart Bluford, Jr.  and Mae C. Jemison; activists, intellectuals, authors, artists, and  entrepreneurs like Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, James  Baldwin, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison,  Gwendolyn Brooks, Shonda Rhimes, Ava Duvernay, Oprah Winfrey, and Super  Bowl LIV winning quarterback Patrick Mahomes and National Football  League Most Valuable Player Lamar Jackson, just to name a few of the  countless number of well-known and unsung heroes whose contributions  have helped our Nation become a more perfect union.   The history of the United States has been marked by the great  contributions of African American activists, leaders, writers, and  artists.   As a member of Congress, I know that I stand on the shoulders of  giants like Shirley Chisolm, John Conyers, John Lewis, Ronald Dellums,  and Barbara Jordan whose struggles and triumphs made it possible for me  to stand here today and continue the fight for equality, justice, and  progress for all, regardless of race, religion, gender, or sexual  orientation.   The greatest of these giants to me are Mrs. Ivalita ``Ivy'' Jackson,  a vocational nurse, and Mr. Ezra C. Jackson, one of the first African  Americans to succeed in the comic book publishing business.   They were my beloved parents, and they taught me the value of  education, hard work, discipline, perseverance, and caring for others.   And I am continually inspired by Dr. Elwyn Lee, my husband and the  first tenured African American law professor at the University of  Houston.   Madam Speaker, I particularly wish to acknowledge the contributions  of African American veterans in defending from foreign aggressors and  who by their courageous examples helped transform our Nation from a  segregated society to a nation committed to the never-ending challenge  of perfecting our union.   Several years ago about this time, I was honored to join my then  colleagues Congressmen John Lewis and former Congressman Charles  Rangel, a Korean War veteran, in paying tribute to surviving members of  the Tuskegee Airmen and the 555th Parachute Infantry, the famed  ``Triple Nickels'' at a moving ceremony sponsored by the U.S. Army  commemorating the 50th anniversary of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.   The success of the Tuskegee Airmen in escorting bombers during World  War II--achieving one of the lowest loss records of all the escort  fighter groups and being in constant demand for their services by the  allied bomber units--is a record unmatched by any other fighter group.   So impressive and astounding were the feats of the Tuskegee Airmen  that in 1948, it helped persuade President Harry Truman to issue his  famous Executive Order No. 9981, which directed equality of treatment  and opportunity in all of the United States Armed Forces and led to the  end of racial segregation in the U.S. military forces.   They proved that ``the antidote to racism is excellence in  performance,'' as retired Lt. Col. Herbert Carter once remarked.   It is a source of enormous and enduring pride that my father-in-law,  Phillip Ferguson Lee, was one of the Tuskegee Airmen.   Madam Speaker, Black History Month is also a time to remember many  pioneering women like activists Harriet Tubman and Rosa Parks;  astronaut Mae C. Jemison; mathematicians like Katherine G. Johnson,  Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson; authors Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison,  and Gwendolyn Brooks; all of whom have each in their own way, whether  through courageous activism, cultural or intellectual contributions, or  artistic creativity, forged social and political change, and forever  changed our great Nation for the better.   Madam Speaker, it is particularly fitting and proper this evening to  remember and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the historic and  audacious campaign for President of the late U.S. Congresswoman Shirley  Anita St. Hill Chisholm.   Shirley Chisholm became the first African American woman elected to  Congress, when she was elected to represent the New York's Twelfth  Congressional District in 1968 running on the slogan, ``Fightinq  Shirley Chisholm: Unbought and Unbossed.''   She reflected that spirit well during her 14 years in Congress.   During her first term she spoke out for civil rights, women's rights,  the poor and against the Vietnam War.   Her first term in Congress was set against the backdrop of the Civil  Rights Movement and the women's movement for equal rights.   Shirley Chisolm had an understanding that during those turbulent  times the Nation required a determined leader to represent the voice of  so many Americans who felt dismay at their treatment.   She took an extremely active role in changing the way women were to  be judged from that point on.   She remarked that ``Women in this country must become  revolutionaries. We must refuse to accept the old, the traditional  roles and stereotypes.''   This is a sentiment that I myself take to heart, women in this Nation  are now told they have a right to determine the kind of life they want  to lead; Shirley Chisholm was at the core of this movement.   On January 25, 1972, Chisholm announced her candidacy for President.   She stood before the cameras and in the beginning of her speech she  said:   ``I stand before you today as a candidate for the Democratic  nomination for the Presidency of the United States.   ``I am not the candidate of black America, although I am black and  proud.   ``I am not the candidate of the women's movement of this country,  although I am a woman, and I am equally proud of that. I am not the  candidate of any political bosses or special interests.   ``I am the candidate of the people.''   Shirley Chisholm did not win the nomination; but she went on to the  Democratic Convention in Miami and received 151 delegates' votes.   More than that, she demonstrated the will and determination of so  many Americans, particularly black women, who had previously felt  forgotten, and she lit the fire inspiring so many who had felt  disenfranchised.   I am glad to walk in their footsteps and will continue to encourage  women to uphold the principles they taught us to fight for and cherish.   Madam Speaker, because Shirley Chisolm dared to reach for the brass  ring 50 years ago, she ushered in the era where women could aspire,  seek, and win leadership roles in this country's local, State, and  national governments.   Before Shirley Chisolm, no black woman had ever served in the U.S.  House of Representatives or the U.S. Senate, but following in her  footsteps are 51 black women Members of Congress, two black women U.S.  Senators, including the President of that body and Vice-President of  the United States; 23 Hispanic members; and 15 Asian-Pacific Members,  along with the first woman Speaker of the House, and mayors of several  of the largest cities in the Nation, including the District of  Columbia, Chicago, San Francisco, Atlanta, New Orleans, Baltimore,  Hartford, Minneapolis, San Antonio, and St. Louis.   One barrier left to fall, however, is one of the most important, and  that is membership on the Supreme Court of the United States.   For most of our national history, Presidents and Senators have turned  a deaf ear to Abigail Adams' plea to her husband ``to remember the  ladies and be more generous and favourable to them than your  ancestors.''   Since Justice O'Connor's 1981 appointment, only four women have been  nominated to the High Court for the 18 vacancies occurring during this  time despite the fact that women constitute a majority of the general  population, 37 percent of all attorneys in America, a number that will  soon exceed the majority since a substantial majority (54 percent) of  all law students in America are women.   With the announcement of his retirement by Associate Justice Stephen  Breyer, President Biden and the U.S. Senate, now have been presented  and should move quickly to capitalize on this opportunity to begin to  rectify the High Court's gender imbalance and to diversify its  composition by nominating and confirming a member of the most  underrepresented, disadvantaged, marginalized, longest suffering, and  most patient demographic in America: black woman.   Longer than any other racial or ethnic group, black women have been  subjected to the coercive powers of the law while being excluded from  the opportunities to make the laws citizens are to live under.   If you are always ruled but denied the opportunity to rule in turn,  you are simply a subject, and not fully a citizen. And that is how you  get Supreme Court decisions like Dred Scott v. Sanford (1857), Plessy  v. Ferguson (1896), Korematsu v. United States (1944), Civil Rights  Cases (1883), Bowers v. Hardwick (1986), Lochner v. New York (1905),  and Buck v. Bell (1927).   Simply stated, the purpose of pursuing diversity in the composition  of a political system's decision-making institutions is not to elevate  any particular man or woman, but to enhance, as Condorcet's Theorem  posits, the quality and accuracy of institutional decision making and  to bolster institutional legitimacy by increasing its diffuse support  from marginal members of the political community.   Researchers have shown that people are more likely to trust those  with whom they share physical characteristics and thus as documented by  the Center for American Progress, ``in the interests of both equality  and  [[Page H1004]]  the perception of fairness, it is important that judges reflect the  parties and populations they serve.''   Or as described by scholars Jason Iuliano and Avery Stewart, ``In  dispensing justice to all citizens, the legal system cannot allow one  demographically homogenous group to hand down decisions while other  racial and ethnic groups bear the brunt of those decisions.''   The federal judiciary, particularly the Supreme Court, does not  resemble the public at large. Glaring disparities exist for women,  African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans, American Indians, and  LGBTQ individuals.   Consider for example that of all the judges currently sitting on  federal Article III courts, only about 10 percent are African American  and 2.6 percent are Asian American.   In contrast, Blacks and African Americans comprise 12.5 percent of  the U.S. population, while Asians make up 5.7 percent of the  population.   Hispanics are woefully underrepresented on the courts compared with  their share of the population with only 6.6 percent of sitting federal  judges of Hispanic origin despite the fact that this group comprises  18.3 percent of the U.S. population.   It is neither improper nor erroneous to say that President Biden owes  black women because without their overwhelming support, his reeling  campaign would not have cruised to victory in the 2020 South Carolina  presidential primary, which led to his resounding wins on Super  Tuesday, which put him on the glide path to the Democratic nomination  and victory in the general election.   So, if anybody is ever due to fulfill a key campaign promise, it is  President Biden vowing to make ``sure there's a Black woman on the  Supreme Court, to make sure we in fact get every representation.''   And when President Biden acts to keep his sacred promise, Shirley  Chisolm will be smiling down at us from Heaven.   It is also fitting, Madam Speaker, that in addition to those national  leaders whose contributions have made our Nation better, we also honor  those who have and are making a difference in their local communities.   In my home city of Houston, there are numerous men and women who are  great because they have heeded the counsel of Dr. King who said:   ``Everybody can be great because anybody can serve. You only need a  heart full of grace. A soul generated by love.''   By that measure, I wish to pay tribute to some of the great men and  women who help to make Houston the wonderful, dynamic, vibrant,  inclusive, and progressive city that it is.   As we celebrate Black History Month, let us pay tribute to those who  have come before us, and pay forward to future generations by  addressing what is the number one issue for African American families,  and all American families today: preserving the American promise of  economic opportunity for all.   Our immediate focus must be to work `For The People' to crush the  pandemic, continue this Administration's and this Congress's record  setting pace for job creation (6.5 million in the first year), and  enacting legislation that will foster and lay the foundation for  today's and tomorrow's generation of groundbreaking activists, leaders,  scientists, writers and artists to continue contributing to the  greatness of America.   We must continue to preserve the American Dream for all.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand here in celebration of the heroic  and historic acts of African Americans and their indispensable  contributions to this great Nation.   It is through our work in creating possibilities for today and future  generations that we best honor the accomplishments and legacy of our  predecessors.                   [From Rolling Stone, February 3, 2022]   Shirley Chisholm's Newly Unearthed `Do Women Dare?' Speech Is Just as                               Relevant Today         In July 1971, Shirley Chisholm began to talk about it.       Chisholm, who in 1968 had become the first African American       woman elected to Congress, would run for president. The       congresswoman from New York announced her intentions to       secure the Democratic nomination in September, and formally       announced on Jan. 25, 1972. The Democratic candidates who       sought to oppose President Nixon's bid for a second term       counted ``Fighting Shirley'' and nine white men, all of whom       had higher degrees, like Chisholm. Of the 10, all but       Chisholm, Wilbur Mills, and Hubert Humphrey had served in the       military. Chisholm was the first African American to contend       for the presidential nomination of a major party.        On the 50th anniversary of Chisholm's protest-era run,       America is again reassessing itself and its history; the       lesson of historical re-evaluation is seemingly how well we       forget, and how fallible we are in remembering. Chisholm       taught at the New School from 1971-75. ``Black Power and       White Politics,'' her inaugural course (eight sessions for       $40) posed the question: ``Can the political system be made       responsive to the needs of minorities?''        The issues are familiar, as is the broil of her audience       and a citizenship that feels unheard. Chisholm, in 1972, is       already a celebrity--simultaneously a voice of the people and       a spokesperson for a lying, thieving political system       manipulated by Ivy League elites. The Chisholm audience, as       well as the camera crew, chuckles uncomfortably as one       questioner takes the soapbox, picking up ``the hot coal'' and       imploring listeners to consider: ``Why do we fail as a       country to address these urgent needs . . . what is basically       wrong with America that we can keep talking and everything       gets worse?''        ``The American public as a whole is too complacent,''       Chisholm answers. ``Not only is it complacent but it's also       gullible. . . . We don't question enough. We don't concern       ourselves about things until they hit us on our front       doorstep. . . . For a long time we had been taught in America       about the need to bring about 'social justice' that nobody       worried about before in this society. But all of a sudden,       middle-class America woke up about six years ago, when we       began to have riots and conflagrations in the big cities of       this country. Prior to that, nobody wondered what was       happening to the Indian, the African American, or even the       Puerto Rican, or even the Black because we were getting along       as a whole and it didn't touch us on our front doorstep.''        Tracking back to 1969, we find Chisholm empaneled at the       New School with Gloria Steinem, author, feminist, and       activist, and Jacqueline Grenenwexler, the former president       of Webster College. The three women, inaugurating the Human       Relations Center at the New School, considered the       provocation ``Do Women Dare?''        In the wake of the social upheavals of recent years, the       speech, which is not known to have been published or       broadcast since the event 50 years ago, feels as vital today       as it did half a century ago. Through the discussion,       Chisholm pointed to what we would now call intersectionality;       the term was coined by Kimberle Crenshaw in 1989 to describe       the ways in which identity is nuanced and individual       experience is not based on skin color or class alone.       Intersectionality makes the invisible visible. It adds       dimensionality to a type of racism that can be one-      dimensional. What is diversity without diverse socioeconomic       backgrounds?        Recorded via a WBAI broadcast, and newly digitized and       transcribed here, Chisholm's opening remarks for the 1969       panel are expansive, yet immediate. She's radical in one       moment, citing the divisive author Eldridge Cleaver, and       pronouncedly centrist in the next, pointing back to personal       responsibility: ``The law cannot do it for us. We must do it       for ourselves.'' Chisholm's words are charged and nuanced and       controversial, she is hearing the unheard, endeavoring to       listen and to keep listening and vowing to fight. Here are       her remarks.        Shirley Chisholm:        The topic this morning of course is, ``do women dare?'' And       I have said, of course women dare. Do women dare? I assume       that the question implies do women dare take an active part       in society and, in particular, do they dare to take a part in       the present social revolution? And I find the question as       much of an insult as I would the question, ''Are you, as a       Black person, willing to fight for your rights?'' America has       been sufficiently sensitized to the answer, whether or not       Black people are willing to both fight and die for their       rights. To make the question itself is asinine and       superfluous. America is not yet sufficiently aware, but such       a question applied to women is equally asinine and       superfluous.        I am, as is obvious, both Black and a woman. And that is a       good vantage point from which to view at least two elements       of what is becoming a social revolution. The American Black       revolution and the women's liberation movement. But it is       also a horrible disadvantage. It is a disadvantage, my       friends, because America as a nation, is both racist and       antifeminist. Racism and antifeminism are two of the prime       traditions of this country that we have to face objectively.       For any individual, therefore, challenging social traditions       is a giant step. A giant step, because there are no social       traditions which do not have corresponding social sanctions,       the sole purpose of which are to protect the sanctity of the       traditions.        Then when we ask the question, ``do women dare?'' we are       not asking are women capable of a break with tradition so       much as we are asking, are they capable of bearing with the       sanctions that will be placed upon them? Coupling this with       the hypothesis presented by some social thinkers and       philosophers that in any given society the most active group       are those who are nearest to the particular freedom that they       desire, it does not surprise me that those women, most active       and vocal on the issue of freedom for women, are those who       are young, white, and middle class. Nor is it also too       surprising that there are not more from that group involved       in the women's liberation movement. There certainly are       reasons why more women are not involved, and this country, as       I said, is antifeminist. Few, if any Americans, are free of       the psychological wounds imposed by racism and antifeminism.
