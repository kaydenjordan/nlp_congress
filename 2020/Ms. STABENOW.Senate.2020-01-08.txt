 Mr. President, I rise today to honor someone who  has dedicated his entire career to promoting Michigan agriculture and  someone I am proud to call my friend.   I have always said that, in Michigan, we don't have an economy unless  we make things and grow things. For more than 40 years, Jim Byrum has  been helping Michigan do just that.   That is a big deal for our State. From West Michigan's fruitbelt, to  the forests of Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula, to sugarbeet  and dry bean fields in the Thumb, to biofuel production providing good  jobs in rural communities, to dairy and food processing businesses in  cities and towns of all sizes, agriculture is our State's second- largest industry, supporting one in four jobs.   During his nearly 25 years with the Michigan Agri-Business  Association, Jim has been a powerful advocate for those one in four  jobs and for his organization's more than 400 members. His vision,  insight, hard work, and great sense of humor have played a strong role  in the association's success.   It is no surprise that Jim knows exactly what his members need; he  has his own lifetime of experience to rely on.   Jim is the fourth generation of Byrums to live on his family's farm  in Onondaga. Before he joined the Michigan Agri-Business Association,  he was State executive director of Michigan's Farm Service Agency and  executive director of the Michigan Bean Commission.   Jim may be moving on, but the imprint he has left on the agribusiness  industry will live on. I know that Jim is particularly proud of the  work he has done to expand markets internationally and to build the  Michigan Agri-Business Leader Program, which has been bringing together  different sectors of agriculture and training the next generation of  leaders since 2008.   I have been especially grateful for the culture of cooperation and  bipartisanship Jim has helped cultivate in our State during a very  challenging time for the industry.   As Jim told Russ White of MSU Today back in September: ``There's  going to be more change in the next 20 years of this industry than  there has been in the past 50. And that change is coming at light speed  . . . it's going to benefit consumers . . . it's going to benefit  producers . . . but folks better be ready to embrace it.''   I know for a fact that Michigan's agricultural industry is better  positioned to embrace change thanks to Jim's hard work and dedication.  Speaking of change, I am so happy that Jim will have more time to spend  with his wife Dianne, who is a leader in her own right, and his two  children and grandchildren.   Jim, thank you for your friendship, your leadership, and your  lifetime of work on behalf of Michigan agriculture. It has been my  honor to be your partner in helping Michigan make things and grow  things.   Thank you.                            ____________________
