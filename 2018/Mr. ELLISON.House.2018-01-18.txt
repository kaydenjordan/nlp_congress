 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation that we are talking about today, the  Home Mortgage Adjustment Act, has to be looked at in the light of the  history that this country has had.   Our country has a HMDA bill, a home mortgage act, a Home Mortgage  Disclosure Act, because of years, literally centuries, of  discrimination and racism which has allowed for Americans to be  excluded from the hope of homeownership.   When people say: Look, I believe I have been the victim of mortgage  discrimination, they have been very difficult and hard-pressed to prove  it because the people who issue mortgages say: Well, that wasn't the  reason. Well, I know that your credit score and your downpayment and  everything is just like other people, but that is not the reason.   Well, the truth is that it is the data that the Home Mortgage  Disclosure Act provides for that puts people in a position where they  can say: Look, I have been discriminated against. How come there is  this wide racial disparity?                                time  1600    As a result of it, justice has been yielded to people who have been  victims of discrimination seeking nothing more than the American Dream  of homeownership.   So along comes the bill today, the bill we are considering at this  moment, which essentially says that we are going to backtrack on the  Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. We are not going to enforce it, even  though we know that it has yielded justice for people, equal protection  under the law for people, but we think that the needs of businesses are  just going to be so important that we are going to backslide on the  issue of justice.   So, Mr. Speaker, today I have to urge a very strong ``no'' vote on  this bill because this bill says that America's commitment to liberty  and justice for all is not something that this House wants to live up  to. We are going to say that we can't abide government regulations even  if it means we are going to advance the cause of a civil and human  equality for all Americans.   Now, of course, the folks might say: Well, it is not all HMDA that we  are trying to change. What we are trying to do is just stop the  implementation of HMDA data, and it is only going to be for  institutions that are of a smaller size; and even then, it is only  going to be certain data.   Yes, they will minimize the negative impact of this legislation. But  there is no doubt that this is backing off of a commitment that this  Nation has made so that all people in our country can freely  participate in homeownership.   They will try to minimize and say: It is only credit unions and banks  that only issue about 500 or fewer mortgages. When you add all those  folks up, that adds up to being a whole lot of mortgages, Mr. Speaker.  It is only certain kinds of data, and that data is critical to making  sure that people are included in the American Dream. So I am urging a  very powerful ``no'' vote.   Now, the people who advocate this legislation say: Well, it is just  too much burden on business. We can't be bothered with having business  fill out forms. It is quite inconvenient.   But the problem, Mr. Speaker, is that, if this were such a problem,  we would all come together and figure out how to make it easier to meet  the requirements of HMDA. But that is not what is going on. They just  want to delay the implementation of collection of critical data which  will lead to the furtherance of the American Dream, which is  homeownership.   Mr. Speaker, it was only 8 years ago that we went through the largest  foreclosure crisis in the history of our country other than the Great  Depression, just 8 years ago. It wasn't decades ago. It was really a  few years ago, well within the memory of people who serve in this body  right now. Many of us were serving in this body during that foreclosure  crisis.   Mr. Speaker, all Americans were hurt. They were hurt when the value  of their homes went down, and they were hurt when they saw unemployment  go up. All Americans were hurt. But if we are perfectly honest, Mr.  Speaker, not all Americans were hurt the same. African-American and  Latino household wealth took the biggest hit of all. Because of this  devastating blow, because of this shot, we saw the stripping away of  African-American wealth to extreme degrees, not to mention people from  Latino families.   We cannot say, on the one hand, ``Pull yourself up by the bootstraps,  work hard, save, and own a home,'' and, on the other hand, take away  the tools by which people can get that home. But that is exactly what  we are doing right here. We are saying that we are going to take the  tools that you need to make for a fairer, more open and more just  neighborhood, we are going to take those tools that you rely on, and we  are going to say that you cannot have those tools because the demands  of business require that we don't do that; it is just too expensive, it  is too burdensome, and it is too inconvenient.   Let me tell you this: 250 years of slavery, 100 years of Jim Crow,  and another 70 years of social discrimination are pretty doggone  inconvenient, too. If HMDA is a tool that we use to make our society a  more equal and more perfect Union, then why would we backtrack on it?  Why would we backslide on it? Why would we do those things?   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act,  the underlying bill, the bill that is being attempted to be amended  today, didn't drop out of the sky. We have it because there was  historic, provable, and demonstrable discrimination. That is why we had  it.   This bill, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act--a completely  different piece which, I argue, backslides on our commitment to fair  housing--would undermine our ability to stop discrimination by  exempting 85 percent of the Nation's banks and credit unions and 48  percent of the Nation's nonbank lenders from having to follow the  updated reporting requirements.   What are these reporting requirements? They are things that banks  collect already. They are pieces of information being collected now.  All they have to do is take one piece of paper that they have already  prepared the documentation for and put it into another document. That  is it.   Now, the application borrower's age, that is an important thing to  combat age discrimination.   Credit score, name, and version of the credit scoring model, that is  an important piece of information. That is already in the underwriting  file and in FCRA.   The debt-to-income ratio is already in the underwriting file and is  required by QM compliance.   Automated underwriting system name, that is in the underwriting file.   Other information about the property, securing the loan, and the  value of the property to secure the loan, that is in the underwriting  file and it is in TILA requirement.   Combined loan-to-value ratio, that is in there already because of  underwriting.   Manufactured home property type, land or without land, that is in the  underwriting of the file.   Let me tell you, Mr. Speaker, that information is critical because,  in the manufactured housing industry, we know there is predatory  lending and unfairness to borrowers a lot, so we need that kind of  information to protect borrowers.   I reject the argument that somehow, if we don't have commonsense  regulations and disclosure, that is going to result in more--more-- loans being issued. There is no evidence to support that. What it will  likely result in is more discrimination happening and perhaps people  who own the banks and the credit unions just pocketing more money. But  the fact that less regulation and oversight is going to yield more  justice for people who have historically been excluded, there is no  basis to believe that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentleman made a point that I thought was definitely  worth mentioning. He said that he wanted to know how the law plays out  boots on the ground back at home. He talked about: Does it hurt you or  does it help you? The gentleman made a specific point about getting  real-life, tangible experience people have with the law.   I am glad he mentioned that, and the reason why is that I talked to a  woman earlier this week as I prepared to be here today. She said she  scrubbed floors in a hospital for 30 years. She scrubbed floors in a  hospital for 30 years. She got up every day, and she saved her money.  Her family never owned a home; they rented. That is all they could ever  afford to do. She applied for a loan in a bank for a home once she got  her money together.  [[Page H519]]                                     time  1615    She was hopeful. She was optimistic. She even had a home picked out  that she wanted to own and have her grandchildren and kids live with  her in that home. She was denied. She had a good credit score. She  saved her money. She shared with me that she felt like it was because  of her race.   Now, of course, nobody is going to admit that. When it comes to  mortgage lending, Mr. Speaker, the people who make decisions that  exclude one group of people and include another one don't use the  nasty, ugly language that all of us condemn. They don't come in here  and use the N word. They don't say ugly stuff.   These people wear suits. They wear ties. They have nice, pressed  white shirts. Many of them have monograms on those shirts. These are  the members of the country club. Yet this lady who worked so hard for  so long to own a home was denied.   It was when statistical analysis was brought forth that people  decided maybe they should just give her that loan after all. It was  when she went to legal aid and complained.   I can tell you this, it is the kind of thing that is important.   How do people on the ground experience the Home Mortgage Disclosure  Act?   They experience it as something that gives them a chance to have a  good life, too. If you never felt the sting of discrimination, maybe it  is just a business regulation to you. But if you have been looked in  the eye and told ``no,'' and you know that this is not right and you  know it is probably because of who you are, then, and only then, will  you understand why it is important not to weaken the Home Mortgage  Disclosure Act.   I don't doubt that people who are offering this amendment to relieve  the regulatory ``burden'' have animus in their heart. I really don't  believe they do. But I will tell you this: they are listening to the  folks in the country club. They are listening to the folks who are on  the other side of the table. They are not listening to the people who  need that mortgage, who work for that mortgage, who deserve that  mortgage.   That is not who they are talking to. If they would sit down and  listen to folks who just want to own a home, maybe they wouldn't see  this as just some sort of a bothersome regulation. It is getting in the  way of business.   How can we possibly ever allow that?   To the folks who would say that, discrimination is a theoretical  concept. It might happen to some people, but none of the fine people  they know in the banking industry would ever do that.   Mr. Speaker, the underlying bill came up because people were living  with mortgage discrimination. It came up because people were being  denied. It came up because people that were being told ``no'' should  have been told ``yes.'' That is what is going on right here. This is  why this bill, this Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act, needs to  be defeated.   If you want to talk about ease of regulation, we can always talk  about how to help people comply with the law. I am not against that.  But what I am against is backsliding and backtracking on the progress  that this country has made in favor of equal access to credit and  mortgage lending. This bill is a threat to that.   There shouldn't be anyone who votes for this piece of legislation who  seriously considers how damaging discrimination has been historically  and who seriously considers how the lives of people who spent so much  time simply trying to be part of this country have been told ``no.''   There are a lot of groups that agree. There are 173 national and  State-based civil rights, fair housing, and consumer and community  organizations that agree. There are 25 community labor and public  interest groups that agree. They say this:         H.R. 2954 would nearly quadruple the number of banks       exempted from the key mortgage disclosures designed to detect       predatory and discriminatory lending, leading to 5,400 banks       being exempted, as well as an additional 487 nonbanks.    This is not a small thing. I just say that I give everybody credit  for good intentions. I really do. But I think that folks need to really  think about what it means to be on the other side of that desk when you  are applying for that mortgage, not just the businessmen and -women who  deny mortgages or grant them as they see fit.   Public Citizen says:         This bill would eliminate race and gender home mortgage       reporting requirements for lenders who make fewer than 500       closed-end mortgage loans and fewer than 500 open-end lines       of credit. There is really no benefit to such an exemption,       as the reporting requirements are negligible.        Lenders who write mortgages obtain significant data on       their customers, as they should. Reporting a few items of       this data is not cumbersome. The potential harm, on the other       hand, is to subvert the basic intent of the Home Mortgage       Disclosure Act, which is to publicize whether a bank is truly       serving its geographic market on a race and gender blind       basis.    What about CAP, the Center for American Progress?   They say:         While on its face this appears to be a simple regulatory       relief bill, this provision would exempt the majority of       mortgage lenders from new Home Mortgage Disclosure Act       reporting requirements.        The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act reporting is the primary       source of information on the availability and quality of       mortgage lending and serves a vital function in fair lending       assessments.        This bill would effectively paint an incomplete or       inaccurate picture of lending activity in the communities       across the country, making it vastly more difficult for       regulators and researchers alike to assess the state of the       mortgage market.    Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``no'' on this piece of  legislation. It is wrong. It is not the right thing. There are other  ways to do what the authors want to do. But simply saying, ``All these  people are exempt and you don't have to comply,'' is not the right way  to go. It will set us back as a nation. It will turn us back as a  nation. I am urging a ``no'' vote.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters), the ranking member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Yes.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.   As we have heard today, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act is a  critical civil rights bill. It is a civil rights bill designed to  increase opportunity for all Americans. It is about liberty and justice  for all. It is about the Equal Protection Clause. It is about those  things that men and women laid their whole lives down for to make this  country more fair, more equal.   The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act's intent was to ensure that equal  opportunity was given to everyone with respect to mortgages. The law is  necessary, given our country's long history of discrimination. Through  slavery, we took away rights and freedoms of Black men and women for  250 years. We made them property rather than human beings. It was  followed by nearly a century of segregation and disenfranchisement.   As a result of it, people stood up to say we have got to have laws to  protect people. We might not be able to change hearts and minds, but we  can change behavior. And HMDA helped change behavior.   We are still fighting to make sure we have a more equal society. The  Home Mortgage Disclosure Act empowers the Department of Justice, State  attorneys general, Consumer Bureau, and the public to fight back  against discriminatory lending and monitor access to mortgage credit by  traditionally underserved communities and populations.   If a financial institution denies a family a mortgage, they can  provide a number of excuses for that denial. Only the data collected  through the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act proves that there is a broader  issue of discrimination at play.   This bill, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act, exempts  institutions from certain HMDA reporting requirements if they originate  500 or fewer closed-end loans, which includes mortgages and car loans,  and institutions that issue 500 or fewer open-ended loans. That is  nearly 6,000 institutions across America that will stop reporting HMDA  data if this bill goes into effect.   This opens the door for discrimination. It opens the door for red- lining, and it is not acceptable. That is why I am offering a motion to  recommit that would ensure that individual banks affected by this bill  take steps to reduce discrimination in mortgage lending. If opening the  door for discrimination is not the intent of the bill, there should be  no issues why my amendment is not passed.   My amendment simply says that the CEO and the president of any  financial institution now exempted from collecting and reporting  important HMDA data fields must attest that, one, the institution is  compliant with all relevant fair-lending laws; two, the institution has  established adequate internal controls to detect whether the  institution provides equal opportunity; and, three, the institution's  senior executives, managers, and loan officers and other employees who  are substantially involved in underwriting residential mortgage loans  complete an antidiscrimination and diversity training.   Ultimately, my amendment is meant to ensure that each exempted  institution is properly incentivized to do what they're supposed to do:  lend to all qualified borrowers. By holding the CEO accountable, my  amendment ensures that lenders will take the actions necessary to begin  to overcome historic racism, sexism, and other discrimination just like  HMDA was intended.   If it is a fact that the Home Mortgage Disclosure Adjustment Act is  not designed to open the door and green-light discrimination, then this  amendment is a commonsense proposal to make sure that that does not  happen and that the leader of the institution maintains responsibility  for that not happening.   Mr. Speaker, I urge every Member to vote for this motion to recommit,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
