 Madam Speaker, I rise today as a proud American. In 1776,  our Founding Fathers proposed e pluribus unum, ``Out of many, we are  one,'' for the first Great Seal of our country. It can be found on our  currency, on buildings, and in the seal of the U.S. House of  Representatives.   Sadly, this fundamental value is rarely seen in today's day and age.  I am proud because I have come across an American faith-based  organization that should serve as an example to all of us and this  principle of e pluribus unum.   I am referring to the Tzedek Association. Recently, though they are  of a completely different faith, and though this is really outside the  purview of what they normally do, Tzedek has dedicated itself to saving  the people from Afghanistan.   The Tzedek Association is a Jewish national nonprofit that advocates  for criminal justice reform and religious liberty and fights for  humanitarian cases throughout the globe.   Tzedek championed the First Step Act, as well as other commonsense  criminal justice reforms. In fact, the president and founder of Tzedek,  Rabbi Moshe Margaretten, was honored by former President Trump and the  First Lady with the lighting of the menorah at the White House Hanukkah  party in recognition of Tzedek's contribution to prison reform.   After the Taliban took over Kabul, it came to Tzedek's attention that  the last remaining Jew of Afghanistan was in danger of being killed.  They were requested to utilize their political connections to save his  life. One thing led to another, and this led to Tzedek coordinating the  escape of dozens and dozens of Afghans.   Let me stress the novelty of this: An Orthodox Jewish organization,  led by Orthodox rabbis, is working day and night to save the lives of  Muslims, Christians, and people of other faiths--mostly many women and  children--because they clearly live by the value ``out of many, we are  one.''   Tzedek has thus far coordinated the rescue of female judges, orphans,  translators, and other individuals who helped the United States and the  U.K. in the war on terror. They also saved the lives of female soccer  players, who are at risk of being killed by the Taliban simply because  they have chosen to play this global sport.    They recently led an effort to save two pregnant women who were high- risk targets, one of whom gave birth to a healthy baby girl just 3 days  after being rescued. And yes, they also saved the last remaining  Afghanistan Jew, Zebulun Simantov.   But along with him, they rescued 30 other people, religious  minorities who were at risk of persecution just because of their faith.  To accomplish all of this, Tzedek has raised hundreds of thousands of  dollars, all of which has come from the Jewish community. It is awe- inspiring and a lesson to us in Washington and to those all across the  world that we must come together more often for the greater good.   Despite our differences, we must unite as creations of an Almighty  God and do what we can together to make this world a better place.                      Recognizing Troop 60 of Papillion     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Boy Scout Troop  60 of Papillion, Nebraska, for their efforts to partner with the city  of Papillion to preserve the community's historic 100-year-old Boy  Scout cabin.   Originally formed in 1913 as Troop 1, they began building the log  cabin in 1921 under the leadership of Scoutmaster Reverend B. Johansen  to be used as the troop's headquarters. In June 1922, the Papillion  community dedicated the Scout cabin, and it has been in continuous use  ever since.   The cabin is an iconic local landmark in Papillion's City Park,  celebrating pride in both Scouting and the community. It is believed  that this Scout cabin could be one of the oldest Scout cabins in  continuous use west of the Mississippi. Troop 60 recently finished  renovation of the historic cabin, preserving it for another 100 years  and for generations to come.   This restoration was part of the Papillion 150 celebration. Papillion  150 was a community movement that recognized the city of Papillion's  150th anniversary, having grown from an 1870s railroad town that was on  the mainline of the Union Pacific Railroad to now being one of the  fastest growing cities in Nebraska.   I also recognize the troop's longtime sponsor, the Harry Bossard  American Legion Post 32, which has mentored Troop 60 to be the shining  example of positive impacts of Scouting. Throughout Troop 60's history,  it is estimated that over 200 individuals have attained the rank of  Eagle Scout, and many of those have gone on to become leaders  throughout the community of Papillion, the State of Nebraska, the  military, and even in the Halls of Congress with our own chief of  staff, Mark Dreiling.   Madam Speaker, I salute Troop 60 of Papillion.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the need to improve  access to critical mental health resources for veterans battling with  Post-Traumatic Stress and TBI, and to pledge my continued support on  these vital issues facing our countless brave and heroic men and women  who have dedicated their lives to serving our nation. It is imperative  that we as a country and the United States Congress continue to work  with our partners in government, industry, academia, and with private  citizens to provide the best possible tools needed for their mental  health and well-being.   TBI is a serious and complex injury that happens on and off the  battlefield. In fact, most TBl's occur during training. While many  injuries appear to be psychological, many of them are physical and are  caused by actual damage to the brain because of blast exposure, heavy  weaponry, or just doing the day-to-day job of a service member.   I stand firmly behind my colleague, Representative Lee Zeldin, as a  partner in his efforts and a cosponsor of H.R. 1476, the PFC Joseph  Dwyer Peer Support Program Act--a wonderful tool for our military that  provides grants for peer-to-peer mental health support authorized by  the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. I will continue to support efforts  like this and other measures to improve the safety, research, and well- being of those who volunteer to keep our nation safe.   The timing of this cannot be more critical. We know that following  the debacle in Afghanistan, we have seen a significant increase of  veterans calling the suicide hotlines and, very unfortunately, we've  seen an increase in suicides. Many veterans are questioning the value  of their service in Afghanistan, and hurting knowing that friends and  colleagues died for what General Millie has called a strategic failure.  I share in that pain frankly. I encourage anyone struggling with this  to reach out and get help. You are not alone. But also know, that your  service was worth it. We stopped terrorism for 20 years coming out of  Afghanistan and protected the homeland. We killed or captured the  terrorists that masterminded 9/11. I think the decisions by President  Biden were wrong in the failed withdrawal from Afghanistan, but our  country will learn from its mistakes and we will rebound. We always do  because we are a free country. I encourage my fellow veterans to keep  the faith . . . in our God and country.   I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to work together  and ensure we do all we can to serve and support our men and women in  uniform by keeping their physical brain health and mental health a  priority.                            ____________________
