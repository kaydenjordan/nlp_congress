 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the  President's national emergency declaration.   First and foremost, I support President Trump, and I support the  wall. Walls work to protect our security, combat human trafficking,  stop the flow of drugs, and encourage legal immigration.   Democrats have pushed for zero wall money, open borders, and  abolishing ICE. These policies make our Nation vulnerable and threaten  our security, and it is a tragedy.   So I don't blame the President for proposing extreme measures to  respond to their extreme policies and tactics. However, yesterday, I  made the difficult decision to disapprove of this type of unilateral  executive action, just as I could not approve any such unilateral  action by any President.   I am 100 percent with President Trump for building the wall, but the  emergency declaration only maintains the status quo. Securing our  border is fundamental to who we are as a sovereign nation, and that is  why I voted over a dozen times for stronger border security, including  $25 billion for the wall last year.  [[Page H2238]]    Unfortunately, as the President recognized, himself, this national  emergency could be tied up in the courts for years with no guarantee  that judges will rule in favor of the wall to be built. It is Congress'  job to provide the resources our Nation needs to keep us safe, and I am  concerned that if this is tied up in the courts, we will be stuck with  the status quo of no wall and a border that isn't secure.   My vote to disapprove of this unilateral executive action had nothing  to do with the merits or need to build President Trump's wall; it was  about our Constitution and this body's exclusive Article I powers to  make laws and use the power of the purse.   I spoke out strongly when President Obama said that if Congress  didn't act, he would use the pen and the phone, and then he proceeded  to act alone on DACA and act alone in reappropriating money within  ObamaCare and regulating every mud puddle in America.   Remember, President Obama initially said he couldn't act alone on  DACA because he wasn't a king or an emperor. After a robust debate in  Congress, he flip-flopped and took executive action. His executive  action took away Congress' authority to act, and DACA still isn't  solved.   These unilateral actions by President Obama put more power in the  hands of unelected people sitting in cubicles in Washington, D.C., and  they turned elected Representatives into elected bystanders. When  Representatives become irrelevant, citizens become irrelevant, and we  the people are powerless against faceless, unelected bureaucrats.   Unilateral executive actions set bad precedent. If it is okay for the  executive branch to act alone after the legislative branch doesn't  reach an agreement, where does that take us?   Governor Jay Inslee already has said that he would be willing to  declare a national emergency on climate change allowing for drastic  Federal action that would never have to be approved by Congress.   What if, without any congressional approval, a future President used  a national emergency to take money from our VA clinics, Fairchild Air  Force Base, or force management at the Colville National Forest to  force a Green New Deal on the American people?   Whether it is at the border or upholding the separation of powers in  our Constitution, we, conservative Republicans, must be consistent  about being the party for the rule of law. It is those principles that  define us.   Mr. Speaker, I say to Speaker Pelosi: I am 100 percent with Trump on  the wall. I am also 100 percent with the Constitution. As  Representatives of the people, it is our call to put aside any personal  ambition or partisan divides so that the people are protected.   This isn't about political parties, personalities, or power. It never  has been. It is about making sure that the promise of America is never  breached and knowing that the only ones who can preserve it are we the  people. I take this seriously and will always lead by upholding my  Article I constitutional authority to be a strong voice for those I  have the privilege of serving in the United States House of  Representatives.                            ____________________
