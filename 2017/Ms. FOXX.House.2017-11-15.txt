 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to salute a brave, dedicated  nurse of Ashe County, North Carolina, Mrs. Maggie McNeill.   Recently, the Fifth Congressional District of North Carolina  experienced torrential downpours and flooding, causing severe damage to  many residents and their property.   Mrs. McNeill, scheduled for her shift at Ashe Memorial Hospital,  found her car's path blocked by flood waters and a downed tree.  Undeterred by this danger, Mrs. McNeill hiked on foot up a steep hill  to her helpful father who gave her a ride to the hospital in time to  help deliver two babies.   What a fantastic role model Mrs. McNeill is. She understood she was  needed, and she risked herself to get to her patients. She exemplifies  the best characteristics of Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I know I speak for many when I say that future  generations of the Ashe County community are blessed by Mrs. McNeill's  dedication to her calling.                            ____________________
