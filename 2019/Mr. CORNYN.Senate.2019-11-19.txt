 Mr. President, history has taught us that the closer you  get to election day, the harder it gets to pass legislation here in the  Congress. It is hard, anyway, by design. You have to pass a bill  through committees in the House and in the Senate. Both bodies have to  pass a bill if they are different. They have to reconcile those in a  conference committee. Then, you have to negotiate with the White House  in order to get the President's signature. So, by design, it is hard to  pass legislation, but it shouldn't be this hard.   With less than a year to go before the 2020 election, we are racing  against the clock. We started this year with bipartisan ambitions to  address healthcare costs, to bolster international trade, and to get  the appropriations process back on track and avoid unnecessary  government shutdowns. Yet, somewhere along the way, politics hijacked  the process.   Our colleagues across the aisle decided that no matter how critical  legislation may be, foiling President Trump was even more important.  They are so outraged by the President and so consumed by his every word  and every tweet that they have brought the work of this body to a  screeching halt in an effort to remove him from office less than a year  before the next general election. It seems they have no desire  whatsoever to pass legislation that would benefit the American people,  let alone any urgency to get things moving. The only thing our  Democratic colleagues seem to care about is stopping the President from  getting anything that could be construed as a win.   Over in the House, the Democrats have put legislating on the back  burner and are spending their days trying to nullify the results of the  2016 election. They are slow-walking negotiations on the National  Defense Authorization Act, which has passed every year without fail  since 1961. Their negotiations with the administration over the USMCA-- that is the successor to NAFTA, which helped to benefit the employment  of roughly 13 million Americans--have kept farmers, ranchers, and  manufacturers in limbo for months. Along with the necessary funding to  help to make up for the lack of funds in the highway trust fund, they  have also complicated efforts to get a long-term highway bill  reauthorization passed.   Despite the partisan frenzy in the House, I have always believed the  Senate should do its best to stay above the fray, but the minority  leader has proven me wrong. In fact, last week, I came to the floor to  ask unanimous consent to pass a bill that Senator Richard Blumenthal,  of Connecticut, a Democrat, and I, a Republican, introduced together.  Incredibly, this bill passed unanimously out of the Committee on the  Judiciary.   Our legislation is designed to do what all here in Washington say  they want to do, which is to reduce drug prices--in this case, by  stopping drug makers from gaming the patent system. Our bill strikes a  delicate balance of protecting innovation, which is very, very  important--we must not lose sight of that--while it increases  competition, and you know competition helps to bring down prices. As an  added bonus, it would lower Federal spending by more than a half a  billion dollars over 10 years. That is not even talking about what it  would do in the nongovernmental sector for savings.   Senator Blumenthal and I have done what you are expected to do here  in a legislative body, which is to work hard to build consensus and  come up with a bill that could gain bipartisan support. By any measure,  we have succeeded in doing that, as it has a dozen bipartisan  cosponsors. As I mentioned, when this legislation was reviewed by the  Committee on the Judiciary--a committee that, notably, can be pretty  contentious at times--the committee passed it unanimously. Every  Republican and every Democrat voted for it.   I had hoped that would have been some indication that this bill would  have quickly passed the full Senate when brought to the Senate floor.  Apparently, the minority leader, the Senator from New York, had other  plans in mind, because when I, along with Senator Blumenthal, came to  the floor last week to try to get this legislation passed, he  objected--hence, the Schumer graveyard.    On November 18, 2019, when referring to S. 1416, regarding the  lowering of drug prices, Senator Schumer said: ``Democrats are happy  and eager to work on those issues.''   One thing I have learned around here is that it is not just what  people say but what they do that counts, and he objected to this  virtually unanimously supported bill, on a bipartisan basis, to lower  drug prices. He actually called it a good bill. He said it was well- intentioned, but he said there were other ideas that had to be included  before he would lift his objection. So he doesn't have any objection to  our bill. He understands it is a good bill but that it may not be as  comprehensive as he would like.   Another thing I have learned in my time in the Senate is that if you  demand everything and are not willing to compromise, you are going to  end up with nothing. Apparently, that is what the Democratic leader is  happy with, including for his constituents in New York, by the way, who  will have to pay more money out-of-pocket as a result of his objection  to this commonsense bill.   I would hope that he would talk to his own Members who have  cosponsored this bill. Most notably, the Democratic whip, Senator  Durbin, of Illinois, has cosponsored the bill as well as Senator  Murray, of Washington, who is the ranking member on the Committee on  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. They are both cosponsors of  this bill that the Democratic leader objected to.   While all Senators have said they want to address rising drug prices,  Senator Schumer has the distinction of being the only Senator to have  actually blocked a bill that would do exactly that. Why would he do  that? He claims--I think, mistakenly so--that passing my bill would  somehow render the Senate incapable of passing any other drug pricing  legislation. That is, obviously, ridiculous and untrue.   I happen to sit not only on the Committee on the Judiciary but on the  Committee on Finance. There is a significant bipartisan Committee on  Finance bill, together with the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions  Committee's bill, that has been produced by Senator Alexander and  Senator Murray. Both of those contain many good ideas. I wish we had  the time and the bandwidth to debate and vote on those on the Senate  floor and in the House. But for the fact that our House colleagues are  so obsessed with impeachment and seem incapable of doing anything else,  I think we could do that.   Of course, even though the Democratic leader himself is the reason  this  [[Page S6641]]  bill did not pass last week, it hasn't stopped him from complaining  about the lack of progress on other legislation. Yesterday evening, for  example, he came to the floor and said: ``Democrats are happy and eager  to work on those issues.'' I would suggest, when he says they ``are  happy and eager to work on those issues,'' that it is just happy talk,  not our actually rolling up our sleeves and working together to get the  work of the American people done, which is the reason I thought we were  here.   The Democratic leader went on to say that the Senate Democrats are  waiting with bated breath for the Republican leader to put any of these  bills on the floor and for any Republican to speak out and demand they  go on the floor. Yet, when I asked for this bill to be passed on the  floor, it was not a Republican who blocked it. It was the same person  who said he would be happy and eager to work on those issues. Again,  what people say in Washington, DC, is not what they actually do  sometimes. I suggest it is important to see what people do, not just  listen to what they say.   Sadly, this isn't the only time the Democratic leader has blocked  progress on bipartisan priorities. It is just the latest. Here are some  other tombstones in the Schumer graveyard.   Over the summer, our colleagues on the Committee on Appropriations  had the foresight to prepare for the funding fight that we expected  this fall. That was a normal part of the process. They negotiated a  spending caps agreement to make the appropriations process much more  straightforward in both Chambers of Congress, and the House and the  Senate approved the terms. We agreed to that top-line funding level  both for defense and nondefense spending. There was also a promise not  to derail the process with poison pills in the form of policy riders.  We got all of it done with plenty of time to spare.   After we voted on that, there was reason for hope and optimism in  that, somehow, we had made it much easier for us to do the Nation's  business when it had come to the spending bills. While there was still  a lot of work to do, we thought this put us on a strong footing to get  funding bills passed before the end of the fiscal year. Yet here we are  today, on November 19--a long time from those votes in August--and we  still don't have those spending bills passed.   Our Democratic colleagues have, on two instances, actually objected  to even debating the Defense appropriations bill, which provides a pay  raise for our troops. They will not even talk about it. They will not  offer amendments. They just blocked it. They just stopped it dead in  its tracks. You would have thought everybody would have learned not to  play politics with the appropriations bills. Our Democratic colleagues  have held up government funding due to a disagreement that is equal to  about 0.3 percent of the discretionary spending budget, and they are  trying to reopen the very budget agreement that they agreed to last  summer that has become law.   They blocked vital education funding, which would have provided more  than $71 billion to the Department of Education. This spending bill  would bolster a number of the grant programs that our students and our  schools rely on, and it would promote college access and affordability  to help more prospective college students. That same funding bill would  have invested nearly $4 billion in our fight against the opioid  epidemic, supported workforce training programs, and strengthened our  nationwide mental health system.   Could the majority leader put aside politics just long enough to let  this funding bill, which would do so much good, pass? Well, apparently  not.   If you think that is bad, it just gets worse. Our most fundamental  responsibility in Congress is to provide for the common defense. Before  we can worry about anything else, we need the safety and security that  our military provides to fight, if necessary, our Nation's wars and to  defend our democracy. Actually, the strength of our military is  directly related to our ability to live in peace because when our  adversaries see us as tentative or weak or withdrawing or unwilling to  fund our military training and readiness, they view that as a sign of  weakness, which itself can be a provocation, which, again, ignores our  most basic job as Members of the Congress.   There have always been disagreements about exact dollar figures; we  are not talking about that. But the top-line figures were agreed upon  last summer, so I thought we were ready to fund our military on time.   Well, shame on me for being an optimist or at least optimistic enough  to believe that people would keep their commitments, keep their word,  and we would somehow head down this path to funding the U.S.  Government.   Here we are, with one continuing resolution expiring in 3 days' time.  I believe the House will vote on an additional continuing resolution  that will take us to December 20, and then the Senate will have to do  that just to keep the lights on here in Washington, DC--just to make  sure that government actually functions.   None of this is necessary, and all of it is directly related to  hyperpartisan conflict, which we all understand, but it simply is  getting in the way of our ability to do our business.   The one that strikes me as the most indefensible, beyond the  prescription drug objection, is blocking funding for our troops. We  depend on an all-volunteer military, and obviously many of our military  members are not just single; they have families who depend on them and  on the funding that Congress provides. But our colleagues blocked it  two different times--again, voting against the motion to proceed to the  bill which, in plain English, is just saying that they didn't even want  to start talking about or amending the underlying bill, which each  Senator would have the opportunity to do if they would allow us to  begin that process, which they blocked.   Well, the Democratic leader loves to talk about the legislative  graveyard here in the Senate. What he really means is that he wants to  control the agenda, even in his seat as the minority leader. Well, he  knows the rules of the Senate don't permit the minority to control the  agenda. That is why it is so important that Senator McConnell is where  he is and that Republicans have a majority.   We are not saying that you have to do it our way or the highway. We  are saying: Let's engage in the legislative process. Let's take up  legislation on the floor of the Senate and let Senators offer their  amendments, their suggestions, and then let's vote on them. But let's  not just stop things dead in their tracks because of partisan politics  or because somebody doesn't want somebody who happens to be on the  ballot in 2020 to get a ``win.'' That is really beneath the dignity of  the Senate or any Senator. It is less than what the American people  have a right to expect of us.   I would ask the Democratic leader again: Please don't head down this  path by creating a graveyard of your own for bipartisan legislation  that could and should become law. It is not my way or the highway. We  have to work on this together, and we are willing to do our part.   Let's work on bills that strengthen our military, lower drug prices,  help students, assist in the fight against the opioid crisis, and so  much, much more.   I think it is a shame that our Democratic colleagues seem to be  unable to compartmentalize their feelings about the President from the  urgent need for them to do the jobs they were elected to do here in the  Congress. They have been given countless opportunities to engage with  us on a bipartisan basis to pass meaningful legislation that would make  the American people's lives better. Again, that is why I think we are  here, but they refuse to do anything that could be construed as giving  somebody a victory because of political considerations. While Senator  Schumer continues to kill bipartisan bill after bipartisan bill-- really, because of it--the work of this Congress has become paralyzed.   We are not going to give up, though. We will keep fighting to ensure  that the American people are not the ultimate victims of our Democratic  colleagues' war against this President--again, less than a year before  the election. Why can't they channel all of their anger, all of their  energy into the election rather than invoking the impeachment process?  This would be the fourth time that has been initiated in American  history, and it has never been successful in getting a Senate  conviction and a removal of any President in American history. Our  Democratic colleagues know they are likely  [[Page S6642]]  headed to the same conclusion here, but they nonetheless want to occupy  all of our time and all of our attention on something that they know,  ultimately, will likely be futile, will be unsuccessful, and in the  meantime leave the American people on the sideline and not care or do  anything that would help make their lives just a little bit easier and  our country just a little bit stronger.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, for months, the world has watched as the  brave citizens of Hong Kong have sustained protests against China's  decades-long degradation of their civil liberties.   The U.N. High Commissioner has found credible evidence of the Hong  Kong Police Force using nonlethal crowd-control weapons in ways that  violate international norms and standards. That is why I am proud to  support the bipartisan PROTECT Hong Kong Act, as described by our  colleague Senator Merkley.   The PROTECT Hong Kong Act would direct the President to ban the  issuance of licenses for commercial export of riot-control weapons like  tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, stun guns, and tasers to the  Hong Kong Police Force. This ensures that the Hong Kong pro-democracy  protesters are not subjected to police brutality using products made in  the United States of America. I am also proud to support the just- passed Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act.   I think the statement being made by the passage of these two pieces  of legislation and the presence today of so many of our colleagues on a  bipartisan basis standing with the people of Hong Kong against this  oppression by their Communist overlords is very, very significant.   Now more than ever, the United States must send a clear message to  [[Page S6661]]  China that the free world stands with Hongkongers in their struggle.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I have request for one committee to meet  during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                         Committee on Armed Services    The Committee on Armed Services is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Tuesday, November 19, 2019, at 9 a.m., to  conduct a hearing on pending nominations.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  now proceed to the en bloc consideration of the following Senate  resolutions, which were submitted earlier today: S. Res. 430, S. Res.  431, S. Res. 432, S. Res. 433, and S. Res. 434.   There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the  resolutions en bloc.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolutions be agreed to, that the preambles be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table all en  bloc.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4258, which was received  from the House and is at the desk.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed and that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  postcloture time on the Lagoa nomination be considered expired at 11:30  a.m. on Wednesday, November 20. I further ask that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m.,  Wednesday, November 20; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time  [[Page S6680]]  for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, morning  business be closed, and the Senate proceed to executive session and  resume consideration of the Lagoa nomination under the previous order.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:23 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, November 20, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
