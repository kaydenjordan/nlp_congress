 Mr. Speaker, today, I introduce a resolution  commemorating the 100th anniversary of the Department of Minnesota  Veterans of Foreign Wars.   The Minnesota VFW was founded on January 17, 1921, and, today, has  over 200 posts across the State and serves more than 32,000 veterans  who fought for America honorably overseas, as well as an additional  21,000 auxiliary members, consisting of veterans' family members.   The Minnesota VFW Century of Service has helped strengthen the common  bonds of our military heroes by improving the quality of life for  veterans and their families. The VFW provides a wide array of services  to its members, including youth development and scholarships, national  security advocacy, legislative affairs, citizenship education,  veterans' fellowship retreats, and financial assistance for disabled  veterans.   I am incredibly grateful to those at the Minnesota VFW who work  tirelessly on behalf of our States' veterans. Here is to another 100  more years. I ask Members to cosponsor my resolution.                            ____________________
