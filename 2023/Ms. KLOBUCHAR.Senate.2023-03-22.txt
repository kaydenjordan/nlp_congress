 Madam President, I rise in support of the legislation  repealing the 1991 and 2002 authorizations for use of military force  against Iraq. I am pleased about the vote.   I want to thank Senator Tim Kaine and Senator Todd Young for leading  this bipartisan legislation as well as Chair  Bob Menendez for moving  it through the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   With this bill, we are asserting Congress's constitutional power to  determine when to begin and end wars. These AUMFs were passed 32 and 21  years ago respectively. The Gulf war ended in a matter of months, and  the Iraq war that began more than a decade later has been over for 12  years. It is time for Congress to act.   Open-ended AUMFs serve no strategic purpose and undermine Congress's  authority to determine if and when to send our troops into battle,  which is a major decision that we should make.   On top of that, they come with great risk. It is far too easy for a  Presidential administration to treat an AUMF as blanket permission to  enter into or to stoke conflicts abroad. It doesn't matter which party  is in the White House--our Constitution grants war powers to Congress.   We also must recognize that the situation on the ground has changed.  Iraq is now a sovereign democracy and America's strategic partner in  the Middle East. If we want to work with them to advance stability in  the region--and we should--what kind of signal does it send to have our  laws identify Iraq as an enemy nation?   Repealing the AUMFs will not halt our military's strategic operations  in Iraq, and it will not harm our national defense; but it will offer a  measure of closure to the veterans and servicemembers who sacrificed so  much on the battlefield.   I will not soon forget when I went to Baghdad and Fallujah and saw  firsthand the bravery and commitment of our troops. The Minnesota  soldiers I met over there--as, I am sure, the Presiding Officer met  with New Hampshire soldiers--never once complained about their  missions. Instead, they asked me to call their moms and dads at home to  tell them they were OK.   And not a day goes by that I don't think of that afternoon at the  Baghdad Airport. By circumstance, we were getting on a plane. I saw a  group standing, and I went over there. They were members of the Duluth  National Guard, whom I have met many times since. They were there,  saluting, as six caskets, draped in American flags, were loaded onto a  plane to be flown home.   Our troops did their jobs and more. Let's do ours. It is time to  bring an end to the AUMFs and the war.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it stand adjourned until 10 a.m.  on Thursday, March 23; that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; that following the  conclusion of morning business, the Senate resume consideration of  Calendar No. 25, S. 316; further, that at 11:30 a.m., the Senate vote  on the Lee amendment, No. 22, as provided under the previous order.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the  previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 7:35 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, March 23, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
