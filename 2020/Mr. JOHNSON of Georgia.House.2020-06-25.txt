 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the George Floyd Justice in  Policing Act because Black lives matter.   Police killed George Floyd over a counterfeit $20 bill as if his life  didn't matter.   Police in Atlanta, Georgia, killed Rayshard Brooks for running away  as if his life didn't matter.   Breonna Taylor, Kathryn Johnston, Tamir Rice, Walter Scott, Philando  Castile, Eric Garner, and a long list of others, each killed by police  and robbed of their constitutional right to due process.                                time  1345    None of these notorious killings moved Congress to act. It took  regular folks of all races, creeds, and colors taking to the streets in  every part of this country, even in the face of a global pandemic, to  tell the world that we have had enough of police killing Black folks.  Our people need to know that we hear them. And Congress knows that on  the one hand, President Trump's cronies, like Roger Stone and Michael  Flynn, can lie to Federal investigators only to receive a get-out-of- jail free card from the President's protector, Attorney General William  Barr. But on the other hand, regular Black folks, like George Floyd and  Rayshard Brooks--accosted for broken-taillight types of offenses--get  executed by the police acting as judge, jury, and executioner.   The only way that Congress can prove to the American people that we  believe that Black lives matter is for all of us--Republicans and  Democrats alike--to take legislative action, to stop police from  brutalizing and killing Black people--not tomorrow, not next year. Now.   Madam Speaker, in the name of Michael Brown and the citizens of  Ferguson, Missouri, let's demilitarize police departments.   In the name of Breonna Taylor and Kathryn Johnston, let's ban no- knock warrants.   In the name of George Floyd and Eric Garner, let's ban chokeholds and  make it easier for police departments to fire bad cops.   In the name of Tamir Rice, let's enact a national registry of bad  cops.   Madam Speaker, for the people of the United States demanding action,  let's pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act now.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 7259) to allow acceleration certificates awarded  under the Patents for Humanity Program to be transferable.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 7259         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Patents for Humanity Program       Improvement Act''.       SEC. 2. TRANSFERABILITY OF ACCELERATION CERTIFICATES.         (a) In General.--A holder of an acceleration certificate       issued pursuant to the Patents for Humanity Program       (established in the notice entitled ``Humanitarian Awards       Pilot Program'', published at 77 Fed. Reg. 6544 (February 8,       2012)), or any successor thereto, of the United States Patent       and Trademark Office, may transfer (including by sale) the       entitlement to such acceleration certificate to another       person.        (b) Requirement.--An acceleration certificate transferred       under subsection (a) shall be subject to any other applicable       limitations under the notice entitled ``Humanitarian Awards       Pilot Program'', published at 77 Fed. Reg. 6544 (February 8,       2012), or any successor thereto.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7259, which strengthens the  U.S. Patent and Trademark Offices' Patents for Humanity Awards  competition by allowing the competition's prize to be transferable to  third parties, introduced by my colleague, Lucy McBath, the  Representative from the great State of Georgia.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7259 has bipartisan support. As chairman of the  Committee on the Judiciary's Intellectual Property Subcommittee, I am  proud to cosponsor this legislation alongside Representative Martha  Roby, ranking member of the subcommittee, and our subcommittee  colleague, Representative Ben Cline.   Intellectual property and innovation are what help our country  flourish. In Congress, we have been committed to ensuring that the  intellectual property system incentivizes innovation to the greatest  extent possible.   Through its support for the USPTO's Patents For Humanity Program,  this bill accomplishes that goal. And I want to read a little bit from  the USPTO.gov website about the Patents for Humanity Program.   How do patents help improve lives globally through inspired  innovators making a difference? And I will quote here: ``Patents for  Humanity is the USPTO's awards program for those using game-changing  technology to address global challenges. It provides business  incentives for patent holders who find ways to reach underserved  communities. These success stories can help others learn how to harness  innovation for human progress. All patent holders can participate,'' it  says.   Since 2012, the program has given 21 awards, not just to big  companies, but also small and medium-sized enterprises, startups,  universities, and non-profits. Together, their work has improved  millions of lives around the globe. In addition to receiving public  recognition of their work, winners will be issued certificates  entitling them to expedite select proceedings at the USPTO.   Mr. Speaker, I believe we have a list of some of those winners thus  far, and I would love to read those names into the Record.   The Patents for Humanity Program highlights the ways that innovation  and intellectual property can help solve global humanitarian  challenges. Past award recipients have created low-cost phototherapy  devices to treat infants with jaundice and distributed chemical packets  that removed contaminants from drinking water, to name just a few.  Winners receive a certificate that allows them, as I said, to  accelerate certain patent matters at the USPTO.   Mr. Speaker, I would read into the Record the names of some award  winners to you:   In 2018, Russell Crawford won the award for creating tools for low- cost drilling of water wells to reach deep aquifers free from soil  contaminants.   The organization, Brooklyn Bridge to Cambodia, Incorporated, won in  2018 for creating an affordable rice planting device that helps  Cambodian farmers improve their crop yields and which minimizes the  number of farmers--mostly women--who have to work in the most  exhausting and unhealthy conditions.   Also, the firm, Solight Design, won the award in 2018 for designing a  portable solar light that has been distributed to over 200,0000 people  worldwide, including many in refugee camps.   Also, the firm, Sanivation, LLC, for designing a waste processing  plant that transforms human waste into sanitary briquettes that replace  wood and charcoal for heating and cooking, with four plants serving  10,000 people in Kenya by the end of the year.   And also, in 2018, Because International won the award for  distributing 180,000 pairs of resizable shoes in over 95 countries,  with local manufacturing taking place in Ethiopia, and plans for Haiti  and Kenya.   And there are a number of others that have won this prestigious  Patents for Humanity Award. All the way back to 2013, American  Standard, SunPower Corporation, Nutriset, Golden Rice, GRIT: Global  Research Innovation and Technology. And also, Nokero, DuPont Pioneer.  And last but not least, Intermark Partners Strategic Management, LLP.   Mr. Speaker, all should be commended for winning this prestigious  award and contributing to the betterment of humanity.   Mr. Speaker, under H.R. 7259, award winners will be able to transfer  this acceleration certificate to third parties. This will strengthen  participation in the Patents for Humanity Program and further encourage  the use of innovation and the intellectual property for critical  humanitarian purposes.  [[Page H2504]]    The USPTO's program and this legislation reflect our country's strong  commitment to intellectual property and our understanding of the  important ways that innovation can do good and solve hard problems.   I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation, which is sponsored, as I  said, by my colleague, Lucy McBath from Georgia's Sixth Congressional  District. And I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to support its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Georgia (Mrs. McBath), the sponsor of  this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7259 is a straightforward but important bill that  will encourage additional innovations that address humanitarian  challenges. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
