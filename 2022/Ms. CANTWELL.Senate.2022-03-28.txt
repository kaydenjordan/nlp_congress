 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able  to complete my remarks before the vote.    Madam President, I come to the floor tonight happy that  the Senate is going to move forward on substituting what is originally  the Senate-passed Schumer-Young bill on the U.S. Innovation and  Competition Act. That is what we are going to be voting on and then  sending that over to the House of Representatives to basically convey  that that is our desire here in the Senate and, hopefully, get this  process of going to conference and a response back from the House of  Representatives so we can move forward on reinvigorating America's  supply chain.   Madam President, I know you know how important this is, but the  Senate bill, again, brought to us by Senators Schumer and Young, I  think, was quite prescient on the problems that we were going to face  as it relates to supply chains. But I don't think that everybody really  understands that the Senate position is really about the fact that we  need to have technology transfer happen at a faster rate; that other  countries, because the United States has been such a prolific publisher  of information and content, actually have taken that content and  information and been able to turn it into actual commercial  applications.   So in the United States we want to do something to create, while  still protecting NSF, the National Science Foundation, on basic  research and advanced research and the Department of Energy on  research, and also work faster at translating the successes of our  science into true application and translating that into helping our  manufacturers here in the United States of America.   This is so important because we know that in various sectors of our  economy, we are seeing much of the supply chain controlled in other  parts of the world. We see that Asia now controls much of the supply  chain for pharmaceuticals.    We are having a big debate about how we are going to drive down the  cost of pharmaceuticals. We are going to invest here in the United  States, I think, in more biotechnology and synthetic biology to find  new ways to discover and make lifesaving drugs, and it is very  important that we do that research here.   In the Senate bill, we are very focused on: In what areas do we want  to do faster translational science to help bring the supply chain back  to the United States?   As we talked last week, we see that Taiwan makes more than 90 percent  of the world's leading-edge chips which drive our national security and  our economic security, and we want to do the research here in the  United States through the acceleration with the Tech Directorate to  invent the next generation of chips and build them here domestically.   And we have heard about the risk of Americans falling behind on  advanced communications, like 5G or 6G, and so we have ideas here about  how to translate that into faster deployment of technology that could  help our manufacturing base.   So I am actually very excited about all of that innovation because if  we all work together, we collaborate, we have done the R&D, and we  actually work harder at getting it translated, I think there are lots  of solutions that we can put before our manufacturers here to help them  with their competitiveness on a worldwide basis.   That is what the Tech Directorate does. The Manufacturing USA  Institutes, the technology hubs, and the technology centers are all  parts of this legislation that would help us move technology out into  the world at a faster pace and work collaboratively to solve these  problems that, again, would bring the manufacturing and the supply  chain back into the United States of America.   I get really excited about the issues related to the automobile  sector and the grid. Coming from a State that has had cheap electricity  for a long time, it has built our economy over and over and over again;  that is, that people want to locate there because the electricity is so  affordable.   It is one of the reasons why we have one of the highest deployments  of electric vehicles in the country, because it really only costs you  about a dollar a gallon to fill up versus the rising, well-above $4 a  gallon that we are seeing today.   So people are very excited about an electricity grid and a supply  chain here in the United States that would build here the battery  technology, implement this faster integration into our economy, and get  a grid that works and enables that kind of electrification of the  transportation sector.   I guarantee you the United States could be world leaders in the  deployment of this if we get this legislation passed and we continue to  make investments in the National Science Foundation and the Tech  Directorate.   Now, I know some of our colleagues have been concerned that this  somehow takes away from the National Science Foundation's focus on  basic research. I would tell you that it does both. The Senate bill  that we will be voting on does both. It basically continues to invest  in the NSF in their traditional role and also gets this idea of a Tech  Directorate which focuses on the translational science--again, to help  us get more of the supply chain back in the United States. It does  both.   This underlying bill, also, as I said, is the Senate version which  made the same investment in the Department of Energy, which was so  important because the Department of Energy plays such an important  aspect in this.   It also does something that my colleague Senator Wicker and I and  others worked on, which is trying to make sure that we are getting more  technology development in a variety of places; that is, that we are  building on STEM and the amount of investment in STEM education--the  fact that we want to have innovation everywhere so that opportunity is  also anywhere.  [[Page S1799]]    And we also make more investments in the idea of our EPSCoR Program,  which is helping areas of the United States that may not have as much  tech investment, to continue to increase the investment in their  institutions.   I hope this is something my colleagues understand, that this is about  growing the capacity for us to innovate in many different parts of the  United States and across many different sectors of our economy and with  increasing the capacity of women and minorities to also participate in  the kinds of programs that will help America be competitive.   So I encourage my colleagues to support the underlying Senate bill.  Help us get it moved forward and to also send this over on the second  vote to the House and continue the process to get us to real  negotiations and get us working on these supply chain issues.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion
