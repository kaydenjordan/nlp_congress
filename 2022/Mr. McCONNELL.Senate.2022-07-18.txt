 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last week, American families' pain  was confirmed by yet another round of awful statistics. Year-on-year  inflation set a new 40-year high in June. The painful fallout of  Washington Democrats' 2021 spending binge continues to spread. A loaf  of bread costs the American consumer 10 percent more than it did a year  ago. A dozen eggs will run you 33 percent more. The price of a gallon  of gas, of course, rose more than 100 percent on Democrats' watch.   Across the board, the American people's hard-earned dollars are not  going nearly as far as before Democrats' inflation. Even as nominal  wages rise, millions of families have seen their real income decrease;  a net pay cut for workers, courtesy of Washington Democrats' runaway  spending. No wonder three out of four Americans--three out of four--say  inflation is causing them financial hardship. Seventy-five percent of  the country is in a tough spot.    Of course, it is not affecting everyone equally. The lowest earning  Americans consistently spend larger portions of their incomes on the  sort of essentials that are most expensive right now, from housing to  fuel, to groceries. And workers in blue-collar industries are among  those having the hardest time  [[Page S3321]]  keeping up. U.S. manufacturing workers are seeing their lowest average  earnings--adjusted for inflation--since 2014, while the overall  private-sector workforce is seeing wages at 2019 levels.   Unfortunately, these hardships show little sign of slowing anytime  soon. Last month's core inflation, when compared to just a few months  earlier, is actually accelerating. So we have got the worst inflation  since 1981. The vast majority of Americans are saying it has them in a  bind financially. And it is low- and middle-income families who are  actually bearing the brunt of it.   This, Madam President, is the landscape as Washington Democrats keep  trying to force even more party-line liberal bills with even more new  Washington spending and--for a bonus--a bonus--massive new tax hikes.  For the better part of a year, our colleagues have been trying to cook  up legislation that would make life harder for small businesses, attack  affordable American energy, and hike income taxes on families in every  single tax bracket.   Apparently, for most Washington Democrats, spending the country into  inflation actually wasn't enough. Now, for a second act, they want to  tax us into a recession. The response for Democrats robbing American  families once cannot be for Democrats to rob American families a second  time.    Mr. President, after more than 50 years as a pillar of  Owensboro, KY, news media, Keith Lawrence is retiring. As the  Messenger-Inquirer's longest tenured reporter, Keith was his  community's ever-present voice, covering stories that ranged from local  businesses to U.S. Presidents. As the city's mayor put so well, Keith  ``will be hard to replace.'' Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in  honoring Keith in his retirement.   Keith has written for one newspaper or another since September 1963,  when he first discovered his passion for journalism in high school. He  cut his teeth during his undergraduate years at Murray State University  writing for the Murray State News. After graduating, Keith entered the  military, stationing in Fort Hood, TX. Loathe to give up any  opportunity to write, he helped publish newsletters on base and worked  at the post's newspaper.   Following his military service and some short stints at a series of  weeklies, Keith and his wife Sandy made their way to Owensboro, where  he began his extensive career at the Messenger-Inquirer in 1972. Though  he has covered local, State, and national stories, community journalism  always remained his top priority. Keith felt he needed to be the ``eyes  and ears'' of his readers.   Keith's journalistic gifts have earned him fans both in Owensboro and  across the wider Commonwealth. He recently received the Mayor's Award  for Excellence for his commitment to community coverage and joined the  Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame.   Throughout my time in office, Keith has been a constant at any of the  events I held in Owensboro. He asked insightful questions, squarely  focused on how my work in the Senate affected his city.   Though he is taking a step back from his position at the Messenger- Inquirer, Keith plans to continue his column and write news stories as  a freelancer. Anyone who knows Keith shouldn't be surprised. He will  always live and breathe community journalism. For Keith, his work with  the Messenger-Inquirer was more than just a job; it gave him a home in  which his family flourished and provided a deep bond to his city.   In honor of Keith's retirement, I would like to thank him for his  service to the Commonwealth and persistent loyalty to strong local  journalism. He has delivered an invaluable service to Owensboro  residents for more than 50 years.   The Messenger-Inquirer paid tribute to Keith's career in a recent  article. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From Messenger-Inquirer, July 8, 2022]                    ``Lawrence Retiring After 50 Years''         Keith Lawrence, the Messenger-Inquirer's longest-tenured       reporter, is retiring after more than 50 years with the       newspaper.        Lawrence, 75, is a Ballard County native who found a       journalism career and home in Owensboro.        He joined the staff in January 1972. Since then, he's       covered everything from mom-and-pop businesses to U.S.       presidents.        According to Lawrence, being a journalist is all he ever       wanted to do since discovering it in high school.        ``When I was a freshman, my English teacher asked us to       write poetry . . . and whatever I wrote she took across the       hall to the journalism teacher and asked her to run it in the       (school) newspaper--and they did,'' Lawrence said. ``She told       me I should take journalism next year. I didn't think I could       do any of that stuff, but I did it and fell in love with it.        ``I've been writing for some kind of newspaper since       September 1963.''        While in that journalism class, he met his wife, Sandy,       whom he married a year after graduating from high school.        Sandy Lawrence said it was journalism that brought her       husband out of his shell.        ``Keith is really a shy person,'' she said. ``But it was       being a reporter that allowed him to talk to anyone.''        Lawrence pursued his newfound passion at Murray State       University, where he would write for the Murray State News       and eventually earn his bachelor's degree in journalism and       master's degree in communications.        In February 1970, Lawrence received his draft notice for       the Vietnam War, but he was allowed to graduate from college       before entering the military.        Lawrence was sent to Fort Hood, Texas, where he furthered       his journalism talents by working on the post's newspaper.        Although he did spend time writing newsletters, Lawrence       said he took on heavier stories that would help him later in       civilian life.        ``We did a lot of things that weren't fluff pieces,'' he       said. ``We investigated off-post housing. People would buy up       an old army barracks and turn it into eight apartments. These       were World War II army barracks, and people were being       charged outrageous rents.''        Lawrence was honorably discharged after less than two years       and began looking for a journalism job.        His first attempt was working for a start-up shopper--a       free weekly community paper--in Erin, Tennessee.        ``It lasted about two months and we quit,'' Lawrence said.       ``We were working about 80 hours a week. We were salary and       didn't get any overtime.''        That's when Lawrence reached out to Murray to see if anyone       there was aware of any newspaper openings.        Lawrence said there was a weekly in Benton and a daily in       Owensboro that were hiring.        ``I had enough of weekly newspapers so I applied up here,''       he said.        Prior to his starting at the Messenger-Inquirer on Jan. 24,       1972, Lawrence had only made two brief visits to Owensboro--      once in high school and during a plane layover from basic       training.        And when he and his wife, Sandy, moved to the city,       Lawrence said he didn't think it would be permanent.        ``I thought two years and I'd go look for something else,''       he said.        Five decades later, Lawrence has written countless stories       and planted roots in Owensboro. The Lawrences have one son--      Christopher--who's a writer for the Las Vegas Review-Journal.        In his time with the Messenger-Inquirer, Lawrence not only       covered local and state stories but also national ones.        Among them were the 1988 Republican and Democratic       conventions and the first inauguration of U.S. President Bill       Clinton in 1993. He also spent a week with U.S. Sen. Wendell       Ford in Washington, D.C., before he retired.        But for Lawrence, it has been community journalism that       mattered most; knowing he was supposed to be the ``eyes and       ears'' of the readers was something he took seriously.        ``I always wanted to know why somebody was the way they       were,'' he said.        On Thursday, Mayor Tom Watson presented the Mayor's Award       for Excellence to Lawrence in appreciation for his coverage       of community issues.        ``He always treated the city and all of us fair,'' Watson       said. ``. . . Keith will be hard to replace. The stories he       tells are accurate, and you don't have to worry about him       editorializing your comments.''        It was last year that Lawrence's dedication to his craft       was recognized by his being inducted into the Kentucky       Journalism Hall of Fame.        For Lawrence, it was an accolade that capped off his       career.        ``It's definitely the pinnacle,'' he said.        As a journalist, Lawrence has a unique writing style that       is concise but still manages to convey all the pertinent       information, said Matt Francis, Messenger-Inquirer executive       editor.        He also has a work ethic that is unmatched, having never       taken a sick day in 50-plus years at the paper, and the       ability to cover multiple areas from business to government       to entertainment, Francis said.        ``But what truly sets Keith apart is his ability to keenly       understand this community and the readers of this       newspaper,'' Francis said. ``They feel a connection with him,       as he does with them, and I think he always understood what a       privilege it is to be a part of informing and entertaining a       community  [[Page S3330]]       through journalism. He never took that for granted, and I       think readers recognize and appreciate that. I know I       certainly do.''        Mike Weafer, Messenger-Inquirer publisher, said Lawrence       will be missed by both the newspaper and its readers.        ``It's not very often that you get to use words like `hall       of fame' and `icon' when you are describing someone, but you       would not describe Keith's work at the Messenger-Inquirer       without using them,'' Weafer said. ``Keith has meant so much       to us and to this community.''        Although Lawrence is retiring from his full-time position       at the newspaper, he will continue his column and write news       stories as a freelancer.        And along with being proud of being affiliated with the       newspaper, Lawrence said it's been special watching Owensboro       and Daviess County blossom as a community.        When he first moved here, Lawrence said the Frederica       Street sassafras tree, known as the largest in the world, was       the biggest attraction.        But with the riverfront revitalization, the growth on       Kentucky 54 and destinations such as the Bluegrass Music Hall       of Fame & Museum, Lawrence said there's no place else he'd       rather be.        ``Owensboro has come a long way; people who can't find       something to do in Owensboro aren't looking very hard,'' he       said. ``But through the years, I've found out that Owensboro       is whatever you want it to be.''                            ____________________
