 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding. I am pleased to be joined by my wife, who has supported me  through this journey. She is in the gallery.   I will say that I love you because I can do that in real time.   Judith Kay Alguire was born in Duncan, Oklahoma. Her father was a  self-educated carpenter who never finished high school.   She changed schools frequently as their family chased the postwar  housing boom all over the Southwest, and she landed in Roswell, New  Mexico, for her senior year in high school.   She married at 18 and narrowly missed earning a science degree in  college. Instead, she took a job as a medical technician while she was  5 months pregnant right here in D.C. to allow her husband to attend law  school.   Working up to the moment of labor and returning to work just 2 weeks  later would be par for the course--whatever it takes, family first,  never counting the cost.   What makes Judy remarkable is her powerful intellect. She reads  medical journals for fun. Growing up poor, power and wealth don't  impress her. Every person is measured by their own merits.   Raising children made her funny--well, humorous, I mean. Although,  you may understandably imagine the effects of five strong personalities  and having to care for them.   Perhaps Judy's most remarkable quality and the source of much of her  renown is her generosity. Countless children have attended college,  worn shoes, been clothed, and attended summer camp, and an endless  number of anonymous blessings have flowed from her heart out to so  many.                                time  1600    Judith Kay Alguire Williams passed from this life into the next just  this morning. She passed in peace, and more importantly, she passed  into peace.   I will miss my mom every day, but her humor, intelligence, and I hope  her generosity will live on in me and my siblings. God bless her.
