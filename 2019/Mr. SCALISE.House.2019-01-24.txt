 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), my friend and the majority leader of the House, for the purpose  of inquiring as to the schedule for next week.    As we, Mr. Speaker, work to reopen the government and to  secure the border, clearly, there has been a divide on the other side.  We were trying to get some kind of agreement on how much the majority  is willing to work with us on, to put an offer on the table.   If you look, Mr. Speaker, last week on Saturday, the President of the  United States addressed the Nation and laid out a new proposal. And,  Mr. Speaker, what the President laid out was not only a proposal that  reopens the government and secures the border, but also offered the  suggestion that DACA could be a part of this negotiation, at least to  start working on some kind of solution on DACA.   In the past, Mr. Speaker, we were just talking about the request from  the Department of Homeland Security, the $5.7 billion that was  requested by the people who risk their lives to keep our country safe.  Their request, Mr. Speaker, was that is how much it was going to cost  to secure the border.   So far, we have not seen a single counteroffer from the majority. In  fact, when the President spoke to the Nation at 4:07 p.m., before the  President even walked to the microphone at 4:07 p.m., at 4 p.m., the  Speaker of the House had already put out a statement opposing the plan  that hadn't even been presented.   Mr. Speaker, what I would like to ask the majority leader is, if we  are trying to get a resolution and if the President continues to try to  lay out alternatives, if the President's latest alternative wasn't even  offered until 4:07 p.m., why did the Speaker of the House already  reject it before it was even presented? Is there an actual desire to  work together to solve the problem, or is the answer going to continue  to be no alternative, no alternative?   At some point, we have to get an agreement on how to solve this  problem.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman uses terms like ``hostages.''  The gentleman uses terms like ``ransom.'' I was in those meetings in  the White House with the gentleman from Maryland and the Speaker of the  House. In fact, in our third meeting--by the way, in all three  meetings, not one time did the Speaker of the House put any alternative  on the table.    President Trump isn't the one who said: I need $5.7 billion to secure  the border.   Our experts, our experts at the Department of Homeland Security, who  risk their lives to keep our country safe, said it is going to take  $5.7 billion to secure the border.   We can all talk about border security, Mr. Speaker. At some point,  you have to be willing to put the dollars behind the rhetoric. So when  the Department, Mr. Speaker, says we need $5.7 billion, if your side  thinks that there is some lesser amount that it is going to take to  keep our country safe, then put the amount of money on the table. So  far, the only offer that has been put on the table by the Speaker of  the House, she said a dollar, and she laughed about it, a dollar. That  is the only offer that has been put on the table. It is not a joking  matter, by the way. And a dollar is not going to secure America's  border. So what amount will the other side agree to?   The President of the United States looked at the Speaker and said:  Okay, I will tell you what, we disagree on a lot of this, but I will  agree to keep the government open, even with the things I disagree  with, for the next 30 days, if, at the end of that 30 days, you are  willing to negotiate with me on the wall and the border security.   The Speaker of the House said no. She said no to that offer from the  President. She wants to keep everybody hostage. She wants to keep the  pay of workers hostage.   In fact, now the Speaker of the House wants to keep the State of the  Union hostage. How ludicrous is that? George Washington, in 1790,  addressed a joint session of Congress. They were meeting in New York  back then. George Washington addressed a joint session of Congress.   This is a constitutional requirement of the President. Historically,  for generations now, every single year, for generations--Republican  Speaker, Democrat Speaker, Republican President, Democrat President-- the Speaker of the House has invited the President to give a State of  the Union.   In fact, that agreement and that offer went out on January 3. The  Speaker sent a letter to the President, inviting him to come here in  this Chamber and address the State of the Union next Tuesday, and the  President accepted that offer. And the Speaker of the House this time,  for the first time in the history of our country, rescinded the offer,  took it back. She doesn't want the people in this country to hear what  the President has to say about the security of this country.   Maybe, Mr. Speaker, the Speaker of the House doesn't want the country  to hear the President's message, but do you know what? The people of  this country want to hear the President's message and deserve that  opportunity. So who is holding whom hostage?   Look at some of the votes. We had a vote today on the House floor to  pay everybody, to pay everybody who has worked or who has been  furloughed. Those people who are securing our border today without pay,  they ought to get paid. We had a vote on the House floor, and we almost  got there: 200-214. Mr. Speaker, every Republican voted yes; 13  Democrats voted yes. Last week, only six Democrats voted yes.   The good news is, Mr. Speaker, a growing number of Democrats are  recognizing they have to be willing to work to solve this problem and  pay people who have worked. So we have had those votes on the House  floor.   The gentleman talks about opening government. The gentleman talks  about bills they have brought to the House floor that we voted against.  The gentleman talks about the Senate bills that were passed. At the  beginning, the first week of this new majority, when they brought a  bill to the floor to fund what was so-called, or presented as, the  Senate bills, some of those bills had passed the Senate, Mr. Speaker,  but not all of them. In fact, one of those bills would not have passed  the Senate because it would have allowed taxpayer funding to go to  foreign government entities that provide abortion.   So let's get this right, Mr. Speaker, and let the Record reflect that  the other side was willing to bring a bill to the floor a few weeks ago  that allows taxpayer money to go to fund abortion in foreign countries,  but they wouldn't put a dime of money in that bill to secure America's  border. There was not a dime of money from the President's request to  secure America's border, but taxpayer money went to fund abortions in  foreign countries. That was in that bill.   Sure, I voted no on that, because those are not the values of this  country. Let's be serious about this.   Mr. Speaker, if we want to talk about what it will take to resolve  it, I think the gentleman from Maryland and I could come to an  agreement. So far, for whatever reason, the Speaker has been unwilling  to put a counteroffer on the table.   When you have a negotiation, when two sides are apart--frankly, I  don't know why we are apart on this. It is not the President's number.  The $5.7 billion request is from the people who are risking their lives  to keep our country safe. If they say that is what they need, we ought  to take them at their word.   And if we disagree with them, if we disagree, Mr. Speaker, then at  least show what their offer is, what their amount of money is, and put  that on the table and back it up with something.   If they say the wall is the issue, maybe it is personal, maybe it is  because President Trump wanted it. Back in 2006, Chuck Schumer voted  for the Secure Fence Act, which would have authorized $50-plus billion  to build fencing, which, in essence, is a lot of what the Department is  asking for today. If he was authorizing $50 billion--by the way, they  didn't put any money behind it.   Again, it is always good to give the Fourth of July speech and say  you are for something. Unless you are willing to put the money behind  it, you are not there.   So he said $50 billion was okay for fencing, but, today, he is not  willing to put a dollar behind, in essence, fencing, or whatever you  want to call it.   The President said he is willing to negotiate and let you ban a  cement wall. The President said he is willing to do that. Right now,  the experts are saying steel slats are the best approach.    The majority leader himself, just a few days ago, said, ``Physical  barriers are part of the solution.'' I think we are making headway. The  majority leader agrees that physical barriers are part of the solution,  maybe because the Speaker is saying that walls are immoral. In some  strange way, people who build a house, you could build the strongest  door in the world--and I agree, the gentleman from Maryland and I agree  on enhancing port security, the points of entry.   We have points of entry all around our country. If you want to come  here and seek asylum, if you want to come here and just be a part of  the American Dream, like more than a million people a year who we let  in, we have that. And we need to bulk that up. There is a lot more we  can do with technology there.   But you don't put a door in your house and then leave the windows  [[Page H1186]]  open. Who would do that? Who would call that security of your house?   What the President is saying is, we have more than 500 miles of area  in our country that is not secure. So you have a big door, and we are  going to strengthen the door. But if you are going to leave 500 miles  wide open, you are going to wonder why people are coming in illegally.   If we are for border security, it is going to take something to  actually back that up. I would ask the gentleman: What amount is the  majority willing to put on the table for real border security, which  includes a physical barrier? And I quote the gentleman again:  ``Physical barriers are part of the solution.''                                time  1115    And I agree with the gentleman from Maryland on that. But I guess  maybe the question I have is: The experts have told us it is going to  cost $5.7 billion to build that physical barrier. How much of that $5.7  billion is the gentleman willing to support?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, let's reflect on why we  are here.   We are here because the President said we have a difference of  agreement on parts of government. We negotiated over the course of  months to fund 75 percent of our government.   The good news, Mr. Speaker, is that the vast majority of our  government has been funded, including our troops. Our military are  being paid. We were able to come to an agreement there.   The bad news is, Mr. Speaker, we were not able to come to an  agreement over the remaining 25 percent. And people around the country,  I am sure, wonder: Why can't they work it out?   And I think, Mr. Speaker, you just saw a display of why this can't be  worked out. Because, Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States  got a request from his Homeland Security officials, people who risk  their lives to keep our country safe. They said, Mr. Speaker: It is  going to take $5.7 billion to give us the tools we need to secure our  border.   And I asked the gentleman just a moment ago, Mr. Speaker, once again,  how much are you willing to support if you won't support the $5.7  billion? The entire time, not once did the gentleman from Maryland give  a number--not once.   If the gentleman would give a number, I would yield, but there are a  lot of other things that he said that need to be corrected that I want  to also address.   Is the gentleman willing to give a number over $1, which is the  Speaker's number? $5.7 billion, $1. Is he willing to give some number  more than $1 that would secure the border?   Mr. Speaker, I yield if the gentleman would give that answer.    Mr. Speaker, I will be happy to tell the gentleman.   I think the gentleman knows, one of the dilemmas we have been facing  with negotiations is that the Senate has a 60-vote requirement. The  Senate had that 60-vote requirement back when you all were in the  majority last time. When we were in the majority, they had that 60-vote  requirement as well.   When we were negotiating all of those bills, all the bills that fund  our government, we were able to get an agreement on 75 percent of  government funding. We had that negotiation with the Senate. We can't  just negotiate with ourselves.   As you see, you can pass bills in the House and they go nowhere in  the Senate. We brought a bill in December--and, by the way, the  gentleman from Maryland said we didn't have the votes, that is why we  didn't do it. The Speaker of the House went into the Oval Office and  told the President: Your side can't deliver the votes for the $5.7  billion. She said that.   Well, guess what, Mr. Speaker. We did deliver the votes for the $5.7  billion, and we were able to do that all along, but the Senate wasn't  there. And why wasn't the Senate there? The Senate Republicans were  willing to support that, but Senate Democrats weren't. It is the same  dilemma we are in today. The Senate Democrats and House Democrats have  refused to negotiate with the President.   I think the gentleman from Maryland knows the legislative process. He  has  [[Page H1187]]  been here enough to know you can't just pass a bill out of the House,  and you can't just pass a bill out of the Senate. You have to reconcile  the two bills. And even then, you need a bill that the President will  sign.   So the legislative process has to play out. It played out for 75  percent of the government, and it is funded. We never got that  agreement on the remaining amounts.   We proved to the Speaker and to the President we could deliver the  votes to pass the bill to fund the $5.7 billion. The problem has been  that this majority, the Democratic majority in the House and the  Democratic minority in the Senate have refused to negotiate. They have  refused to put a dollar amount.   If the gentleman is willing to start at $1.3 billion--by the way,  that $1.3 billion had strings attached, important strings that limited  our ability to actually secure the border. In those strings, Mr.  Speaker, they actually told the President where he can and can't build  wall.   So our security experts are saying, for example, we need to build  wall around the Rio Grande. That is where a lot of people are bringing  drugs and human trafficking across our country. And yet law says you  can't build it there. How ridiculous is that?   So, in our legislation that we passed, we removed that limitation.  Why should we be micromanaging the experts who risk their lives and  telling them they can't do the things it takes to support the border?  That was in our bill.   Current law also prohibits what kind of security, what kind of  physical barriers--to use the gentleman's term--can or can't be used.  And so our experts say there are some physical barriers that don't  work.   Why would you want to spend $1.3 billion of taxpayer money to build  things that won't actually work when you can spend the money to build  things that actually do work? And again, these aren't the President's  designs. These are the experts who risk their lives, who said: This is  what we need.   So, yes, Mr. Speaker, we weren't able to get an agreement with the  Senate over that 25 percent. We proved we could put the votes together  in the House to do it. The Senate couldn't pass the bill. So,  ultimately, there was nothing that got to the President's desk on those  remaining items, so the President convened us.   The President got all the principals together, Mr. Speaker, and in  three different meetings in the White House, not one time--not one  time--was a single dollar amount put on the table by the Democrats in  the room--not once. So then you can look at other votes, you can look  at other plans.   So the President said: Well, if the Speaker of the House won't  negotiate, maybe I will bring in other Democrats.   And, by the way, it is a growing list of Democrats who are starting  to say we need to address this problem.   I will read from the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Mr.  Collin Peterson, Democrat from Minnesota: ``Give Trump the money. . . .  I'd give him the whole thing . . . and put strings on it so you make  sure he puts the wall where it needs to be. Why are we fighting over  this? We're going to build that wall anyway, at some time.''    Representative Adam Smith, chairman of the House Armed Services  Committee: ``The wall is not in itself a bad idea, it's just--it's been  done.''   Representative Cheri Bustos from Illinois: ``If we have a partial  wall, if we have fencing, if we have technology used to keep our  borders safe, all of that is fine . . . .''   So we see a growing list of rank-and-file Democrats, and even  committee chairmen, who are saying let's just do this, and yet the  Speaker refuses to do it.   So the President invited some members of the Democratic majority in  the House to the White House. The first meeting, Mr. Speaker, some of  them didn't even show up. And we want to talk about civility?   We are in a shutdown, and the President of the United States says: I  want to bring some Democrats in to see if we can resolve this. Then  they don't even show up. And maybe they were told not to go.   So a few days later, the President invites a different group, and in  that group we actually did have some Members that went.   The gentleman from Maryland, that day, was on a TV show, and he  said--when they were asked do those Democrats who are going to the  White House have the authority to negotiate, the majority leader of the  House said they do not have the authority to strike a deal.   So now the Democratic majority is telling other Democrats who want to  solve the problem and are going to the White House to try to solve the  problem, he is telling them they don't have the authority to solve the  problem.   So if the gentleman from Maryland is telling other Democrats they  don't have the authority to strike a deal, I would ask the gentleman:  Who does have the authority to strike a deal?   He is saying that physical borders are part of the solution. The  Speaker of the House doesn't necessarily share that view, from the  comments I have heard from her.   But if the gentleman from Maryland thinks physical borders are part  of the solution, other Democrats want to negotiate a solution, who is  authorized? Who does have the authority to strike a deal?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.                                time  1130     Mr. Speaker, once again, we are in a government  shutdown. I could clearly argue that the gentleman from Maryland voted  to shut the government down in December before we had hit an expiration  of funding. Before there was a shutdown, we had a bill to fund  government and secure the border. My friend can say it was dead on  arrival in the Senate. The reason it was dead on arrival in the Senate  is because Senate Democrats refused to negotiate over securing the  border.   So here we are. We could talk about 2013. We are in 2019, and we are  in the middle of a government shutdown that could end tomorrow. The  majority just voted to adjourn again. Literally--and here is the quote  my friend just said--the gentleman from Maryland said: ``We are not  going to talk until the government is open.''   So during the shutdown, the gentleman is not going to negotiate how  to get out of a shutdown.   The gentleman wonders why people look and say: why can't you figure  it out?   The President has offered idea after idea, and eventually you are  negotiating against yourself when the other side says: we are not going  to talk until we get everything we want.   Well, do you know what, Mr. Speaker? In divided government, Mr.  Speaker, nobody gets everything they want, but you have to start  talking today. The 800,000 people who are working or not working and  not getting paychecks--which, by the way, we voted again today to pay  all of them, we had a vote on the House floor to pay all of them, and  we got 13 Democrats to vote for that. Last week it was only six. A  growing number of Democrats are recognizing stop all this foolishness  of saying: we are not going to talk to you when the President is trying  to talk. We are going to reject your offer before you put it on the  table. At 4 o'clock Saturday the Speaker rejected an offer that wasn't  even proposed until 4:07.    So to say: we are not going to talk while we are in the shutdown, how  do we get out of the shutdown unless people are talking?   I think the gentleman from Maryland and I could solve this problem.  He quoted: Physical barriers are part of the solution.   I agree with the gentleman from Maryland on that. Unfortunately, the  Speaker of the House doesn't agree with that. So rank-and-file  Democrats who want to solve this problem are invited to the White  House, but told by the Democrat leadership: you are not authorized to  negotiate.   So I ask the gentleman from Maryland: Who is authorized to negotiate?  And the gentleman from Maryland says: we are not going to talk until  the government is back open.   But the government is not open because we are at an impasse, and the  way you solve an impasse is to talk. You can't say: ``We are not going  to talk'' and expect it just to solve itself and expect the President  just to keep offering and offering and offering and the Speaker of the  House say: we are not even going to let you come talk to the country;  we are not going to let you have a State of the Union; my way or the  highway.   That is not how you solve this problem. You have to talk to solve  this problem. The country expects you to talk to solve this problem.   It is divided government. Sure, we are not going to agree on  everything. Our experts--it is not the Republican Party saying $5.7  billion is what it would cost to secure our border--it is the experts  who secure our border who say it is going to cost $5.7 billion.   Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman disagrees with that number, if he  doesn't like the color of the wall or the style of the slats and the  steel, if he wants to make it out of bamboo, I don't know what the  gentleman's offer is because he has never put an offer on the table.  But at some point the gentleman has to. He has to put a counteroffer on  the table if we are going to get out of this.   I want to get out of this. I voted multiple times to get out of it  and to pay people. The gentleman from Maryland can show votes, and I  can show votes. Ultimately we need to talk to get an agreement.   So I continue to stand ready, the President stands ready; our  minority here in the House and our majority in the Senate stands ready.  But if only one side is saying: ``We are going to talk,'' and the other  side says: ``We are not going to talk'', that is not going to resolve  itself.   We have to talk if it is going to resolve itself, and, hopefully, Mr.  Speaker, we do.   I stand ready, and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
