 Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak in support of H.R.  1873--the Electricity Reliability and Forest Protection Act.   North Carolina is home to four national forests that offer visitors  and residents access to incredible scenery, wildlife, and a wide  variety of recreational activities.   In my district in Western North Carolina, American Forestry  management has its roots in the Pisgah National Forest: The Cradle of  Forestry, the very first forestry school in the country, is located  there.   Proper forestry management is a part of North Carolina's history that  we hope to pass on to for our future generations to come.   I commend my colleagues, Reps. Doug LaMalfa and Kurt Schrader, for  identifying a problem and for providing a common-sense solution to make  vegetation management in national forests easier.   Managing vegetation around power lines is important for ensuring  electric grid reliability, and for keeping overgrown and falling trees  from interfering with nearby power lines which can cause blackouts,  wildfires, and other safety hazards.   This bill would ensure utility companies, who are responsible for  vegetation management near power lines on federal lands, are no longer  delayed by bureaucratic red tape and inconsistent federal standards  between agencies.   With the passage of this bill, we will be a step closer to providing  expedited forestry management plan approval, while also giving utility  companies the authority to remove hazardous debris in emergency  situations.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased we are advancing a bipartisan proposal  today--I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
