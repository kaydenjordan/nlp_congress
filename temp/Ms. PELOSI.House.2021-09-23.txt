 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished chairwoman of the  Appropriations Committee for yielding, but more importantly, for her  unwavering support for this important priority. Thank you, Ms. DeLauro,  for your leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor to  further express the will of Congress in a bipartisan way for the  security of Israel.   Iron Dome is a purely defensive system designed to safeguard all  civilians living in Israel. The system was codeveloped by the United  States and Israel and has saved thousands of lives.   Additional financial support for Iron Dome was part of the memorandum  of understanding negotiated by President Obama in 2016. The funding  being appropriated today simply continues and strengthens this support.   Passage of this bill reflects a great unity in Congress on a  bipartisan and bicameral basis for Israel's security.   Assistance to Israel is vital, because Israel's security is an  imperative for America's security.   Today and every day, Congress stands in support of a comprehensive,  durable peace in the region, and we pray for every life lost on all  sides of this conflict.   I urge a strong bipartisan vote for the security of the people of  Israel and for this legislation.   Again, I commend all who have been a part of putting this together,  Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz, Congressman Deutch, and so many others  that I see here.
