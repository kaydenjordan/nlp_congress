 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, next week, America's world-leading  medical innovation sector will face their first deadline in the Biden  administration's push for prescription drug socialism.   Under Washington Democrats' so-called Inflation Reduction Act, the  companies behind certain major treatments for seniors, for everything  from arthritis to diabetes, to cancer, will have to choose, by the end  of next week, whether to enter into a so-called ``negotiation program''  run by Federal bureaucrats, pay an excessive fine, or take their drugs  off the market.   Well, the devil is in the details. Unsurprisingly, Democrats intend  for this ``negotiation'' to be anything but. It turns out, the IRA  empowers the Biden administration to reject any counteroffer during the  process and, thus, arbitrarily set the maximum price to whatever number  the bureaucrats choose.   Now, the Biden administration claims that this policy will save  consumers money and lead to cheaper treatments, but this couldn't be  further from the truth. In reality, this so-called ``negotiation'' with  unelected bureaucrats will ensure that fewer lifesaving treatments make  it to the markets in the first place.   I was very proud to have worked alongside then-Vice President Biden  on his Cancer Moonshot Initiative and the 21st Century Cures Act back  in 2016. Unfortunately, by one estimate, the Biden administration's own  price-fixing scheme would destroy nearly nine times as much funding for  cancer research as that legislation, back in 2016, provided by  eliminating incentives for drug companies to invest in R&D. Already,  several companies announced last year that they were discontinuing  research into treatments for cancer and other diseases due to concerns  about the impact of Washington Democrats' regulations.   The Biden administration wants to dry up the world's most prolific  pipeline of lifesaving cures. The American people deserve better than  prescription drug socialism.                                   Ukraine    Mr. President, now, on another matter, yesterday, President Biden  told the world we would support Ukraine's fight ``as long as it  takes.'' Unfortunately, for all of his lofty rhetoric about Ukraine,  the President's actual approach to Russia's escalation--his passive,  indecisive leadership--has risked prolonging the war and jeopardizing  public support for our efforts. In some cases, his open fretting about  escalation and ``World War Three'' has contributed to the hesitation of  allies like Germany.   Like most Republicans, I have been clear-eyed about the threat of  Russian aggression since long before Putin's so-called ``little green  men'' seized Ukrainian territory back in 2014, long before the last  Democratic President mocked realism about Russia to score points in a  political debate. And I have urged the administrations of both parties  to take steps to help Ukraine deter Russian aggression before it  escalated--like the previous administration's decision to send the  lethal weapons that President Obama had found too provocative.   When President Biden took office, he focused on lowering tensions  with Moscow with giveaways like the 5-year extension of the New START  Treaty, rather than shipping lethal weapons to Ukraine to help shore up  their defenses. As Vladimir Putin massed forces on Ukraine's border  over the  [[Page S4611]]  winter of 2021, I urged the President to move quickly to provide  critical military capabilities like Stingers and Javelins and to build  the logistical infrastructure needed to support Ukraine should Russia  escalate. Ah, but President Biden delayed. He dithered for months  before approving shipments of advanced air defense systems or medium- range rocket systems like HIMARS. And he anguished for over a year  about authorizing F-16s and Abrams tanks.   Eventually, under duress from both parties in Congress, the Biden  administration provided each of these capabilities, but the President's  hesitation kept our allies, who follow American decisions very closely,  from unlocking similar capabilities of their own sooner.   At every step of the way, President Biden's decisions on support for  Ukraine have been slow, his actions have been tentative, and his  caution has been debilitating. Unfortunately, the President's public  messaging has been similarly insufficient. He has an obligation to  speak to all Americans, but most of his messaging about lofty and  abstract principles seems tailored to Washington think tanks.   President Biden and his administration need to explain to the Nation  in practical terms that our Nation has a fundamental interest in  Ukrainian victory and European security, that our support for Ukraine  isn't distracting from competition with China but contributing  materially to it, that Europe has turned a corner on collective defense  and burden sharing and is actually contributing more to Ukraine than  the United States, that U.S. assistance is subject to rigorous  oversight and accountability protections, that most of the security  assistance is actually being invested in America's own--our own-- defense industrial base, and that pulling the plug would be far more  ruinous than our disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.   I sometimes get the sense that I speak more about Ukraine matters  than the President does. Well, I hope his administration will use this  evening's classified Senate briefing to begin making his case more  forcefully.   I am encouraged by reports that the United States may finally provide  ATACMS, a capability that could have made an impact on the battlefield  sooner. And I hope we will learn why this decision, like those  preceding it, has taken so long.   Tomorrow, I will join colleagues in welcoming President Zelenskyy to  the Capitol, and I will continue to make the case myself for sustained  support of the Ukrainian cause--not out of charity but out of primary  focus on America's interests. But until President Biden takes on his  responsibility to actually lead the case publicly here at home, his  administration's timid leadership will continue to speak volumes, both  at home and abroad.
