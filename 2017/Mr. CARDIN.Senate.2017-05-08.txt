 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, on December 19, 2015, in Paris, France,  diplomats representing more than 190 countries finalized the world's  most ambitious, comprehensive, and achievable multilateral agreement to  combat climate change at the United Nations Framework Convention on  Climate Change's 21st Conference of Parties, or COP21.   I led a delegation of 10 Senators to COP21 to bolster U.S. leadership  and to provide confidence in the U.S. commitment to the global effort  to fight the existential threat of climate change. The result was an  agreement that has nearly universal support, with every party committed  to reducing carbon emissions. The momentum coming out of COP21 felt  unstoppable.   That momentum continued through 2016. On Earth Day, an impressive 175  nations signed the Paris Agreement. Six months later, and in less than  a year's time, the Paris Agreement reached the threshold for entry into  force. Up until recently, the United States has led this global effort.  The strength of our commitment and diplomacy spurred global enthusiasm  for the Paris Agreement.   Some have said that we are the first generation to feel the effects  of climate change and the last generation who can do something about  it. Climate change impacts are apparent in my home State of Maryland.  Recently, Annapolis began experiencing routine tidal flooding. Today's  generations of Smith Islanders may be the last as a rising Chesapeake  Bay encroaches further ashore each year.   Around the world, climate change is expanding the range and duration  of regional wildfire seasons, prolonging extreme droughts in the Middle  East and Southern Africa, which I have witnessed firsthand, and has  caused Bolivia's Lake Poopo to evaporate entirely, and entire island  nations are being swallowed up by the South Pacific.   The good news is, acting to prevent the worst effects of climate  change holds tremendous economic and job growth opportunities for our  Nation. The world looks toward the United States for leadership, not  just in terms of domestic emissions reductions but also in our private  sector and academia for clean energy solutions to power the world.  Maryland is positioned to be at the forefront of U.S. leadership in  technology innovation.   For example, the University of Maryland, in partnership with the U.S.  Department of Energy and a number of Maryland private sector companies  like Redox Energy, are leading the way in developing commercial-scale,  in-demand technology that the global energy market is demanding.   In 2015, global investment in renewable energy was nearly $350  billion, which was more than the global investment in fossil fuel  energy. The Department of Energy's 2017 U.S. Energy and Employment  Report showed that nearly 1 million Americans work in the energy  efficiency, solar, wind, and alternative vehicles sectors. This is  almost five times the current employment in  [[Page S2790]]  the U.S. fossil fuel electric industry, which includes coal, gas, and  oil workers. Even though gas and oil have hit record-low prices on the  global market, current and projected price per watt for renewables is  also low, making clean energy remarkably affordable and competitive in  the market.   The United States stands at the crossroads of global clean energy and  climate change leadership, and the policy path we take on these issues  could not only shape the strength of our economic future but our  overall standing in the world. Forward thinking domestic climate change  and clean energy policy, including substantial investments in clean  energy R&D and clean energy production incentives, have made the United  States an incubator for clean energy investment and entrepreneurship.   We see these things in every State of the Nation--new innovators and  investors in the clean energy sector.   Creating a robust domestic market helps U.S. companies develop tested  records of accomplishment, skilled workforces, and scalable products to  export around the world to a global energy market that is hungry for  clean energy solutions. This is where domestic policy intersects with  U.S. climate diplomacy, which is priming that export market by building  good will and faith in U.S. capacity and commitment.   The United States must not squander the considerable time and effort  it took to build the world's confidence in the United States when  combating climate change.   The rejection of the Kyoto Protocol by the United States severely  strained a wide range of diplomacy issues for the Bush administration.  That is not just a Senator saying this. Let me quote Secretary of State  Colin Powell, when he stated:         Kyoto--this is not talking out of school--was not handled       as well as it should have been, and when the blowback came I       think it was a sobering experience that everything the       American president does has international repercussions.    That was General Powell warning us about the importance of  international diplomacy and that our actions have consequences.   Hindsight on the impact U.S. participation in Kyoto would have had on  the protocol's success and on the U.S. economy is another debate  entirely--and we will leave that for a different day--but a clear  lesson from the episode is that the United States must not  underestimate how seriously the world takes the issue of international  cooperation to combat climate change.   Should the Trump administration withdraw the United States from the  Paris Agreement, it will be an incredible insult to our global partners  and severely tarnish the trust nations have in the United States. That  distrust will bleed over into all areas of U.S. diplomacy and  cooperation.   While the Paris Agreement does not have enforceable, binding  provisions that would punish parties for missing self-determined  mitigation targets, nothing precludes other countries from acting  outside the confines of the agreement to create uncomfortable  conditions for nonmembers. It is worth noting here that if we were to  pull out, we would be in a club with Syria and Nicaragua.   For example, in November of last year, immediately after the election  and during COP22, the New York Times reported that leaders from other  countries--so deeply offended by the President-elect's ill-informed  rhetoric on climate change and the Paris Agreement--were contemplating  implementing border tariffs on goods imported from nations failing to  account for carbon emissions.   Staying in the agreement and continuing to advocate for what is in  the best interests of the United States could prevent countries from  taking such actions.   Many critics of the Paris Agreement sound as though they are stuck in  1997, echoing concerns about the 20-year-old Kyoto Protocol that are  simply untrue about the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement takes a  different approach to international climate change cooperation by  creating an action model that allows for ambitious action and  accountability through peer review.   The agreement takes a radically different approach to pollution  mitigation that incorporates many conservative principles our  Republican colleagues routinely espouse: increased transparency and  universal reporting requirements for all parties. All parties, both  developing and developed nations, commit to reducing greenhouse gas  pollution. All parties determine their own greenhouse gas pollution  mitigation commitments. Nationally determined commitments are  nonbinding.   Let me repeat that. The nationally determined commitments are  nonbinding. It is up to us, our country, to determine how we will meet  our targets and when we will meet our targets, and the enforcement is  solely within our own means. No international group can enforce any of  these commitments on us. That was at the request of many Members of  this body, and that was followed in the Paris Agreement.   The Paris Agreement was forged by the lessons the United States  learned from the Kyoto Protocol process. Each addressed commonly  criticized elements of the Kyoto Protocol.   I cannot stress enough how seriously committed leaders around the  world are to the success of the Paris Agreement. For example, it is the  top agenda item for both the upcoming G7 and G20 meetings. As such, we  absolutely cannot underestimate how thoroughly insulted our friends and  allies around the world will be if the United States retreats from the  agreement.   Make no mistake, callously disregarding cooperation and partnership  with the global community on a crisis that is literally threatening the  very physical existence of countries will have consequences for our  foreign policy, diplomacy, national security, and U.S. economic  opportunity in an undeniably globalized economy. Retreating from the  Paris Agreement puts America alone, not America first, and being alone  is tantamount to being last.   The expectation among our partners to the Paris Agreement is that the  United States will remain engaged, although a common refrain among  foreign delegations is that the world is moving ahead regardless. I  take that to mean that if U.S. leadership falters, other countries will  jump at the opportunity and fill the void we create and receive the  gains which should have been ours.   U.S. energy policy should support the goals of the Paris Agreement.  We have already seen hundreds of American corporations make commitments  in the agreement's name. There is infinite potential from enhanced U.S.  production of scalable and exportable clean energy technology that the  world is demanding to power our collective future. If we do the  opposite and retreat from the global effort to combat climate change,  then we can expect to lose out on this economic growth potential  because countries like Germany, China, and India will gladly take our  place as the world's leader for clean energy innovation and finance. I  will do what I can to protect against this loss.   It is in our national security interests for the United States to  remain actively engaged with the world community to fight climate  change.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.
