 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize C.J. and Dave  Dunklee, founders of The Healing Box Project. Mr. and Mrs. Dunklee are  serving our Nation's veterans through providing guitar lessons at the  Truman VA Hospital in Columbia, Missouri.   The Healing Box Project came to life at the Truman VA Hospital a  couple of years ago. C.J. and Dave provide guitars, picks, and lessons  to disabled veterans in order to help them ease the wounds that so many  of them are facing.   These weekly lessons provide an outlet for veterans to use the joy of  music to heal their souls. Weekly, they provide these lessons for up to  50 veterans. C.J. and Dave provide the fundraising through their  501(c)(3) nonprofit to pay for the supplies and lessons needed to help  this project succeed.   I am thankful for their efforts to provide services to our Nation's  heroes who have so graciously given service to our great country.   Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to take this opportunity to recognize  C.J. and Dave for their efforts on behalf of our Nation's veterans. I  am blessed to represent them in Congress and wish them continued  success with this very special project.                            ____________________
