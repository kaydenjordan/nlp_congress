 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  resolution (H. Res. 189) recognizing the importance of sustained United  States leadership to accelerating global progress against maternal and  child malnutrition and supporting United States Agency for  International Development's commitment to global nutrition through its  multi-sectoral nutrition strategy, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 189         Whereas 151 million children under the age of 5 in the       world--22 percent--are stunted, or chronically       undernourished, and in countries highly affected by       undernutrition, stunting affects 1 in every 3 children;        Whereas wasting, or acute malnutrition, continues to       threaten the lives of an estimated 7.5 percent or nearly 51       million children under the age of 5 globally, and more than       38 million children under the age of 5 are overweight;        Whereas malnutrition directly or indirectly causes 45       percent of all deaths--2.6 million--of children under age 5       annually and puts those who survive at risk of impaired brain       development, lower IQ, weakened immune systems, and greater       risk of serious diseases;        Whereas undernourished adolescent girls have impaired       cognitive ability and productivity and their future babies       are at increased risk for low birth weight and death;        Whereas iron deficiency anemia, associated with       undernutrition, contributes to 1 in 5 maternal deaths (or 20       percent of maternal mortality);        Whereas poor maternal nutrition contributes to poor fetal       development and low birth weight, and an estimated 60 to 80       percent of neonatal deaths occur in low birth weight babies;        Whereas a large body of scientific evidence supports the       benefits of improved breastfeeding practices on the short-      term and long-term health and development of children and       their mothers;        Whereas a growing evidence base demonstrates that reducing       maternal and child malnutrition, especially in the critical       1,000 days between pregnancy and age 2, is imperative to       ending preventable maternal and child deaths, improving       cognitive and physical development, and strengthening       children's immune systems to bolster resistance to disease;        Whereas leading economists and Nobel Laureates have       identified improving child nutrition as the most cost-      effective way to enhance global health and development;        Whereas the United States Agency for International       Development's Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Strategy's approach       addresses both direct and underlying causes of malnutrition,       and its focus on linking humanitarian assistance with       development programming helps build resilience to shocks in       vulnerable communities;        Whereas malnutrition is a universal issue that no country       in the world can afford to overlook, and countries with high       burdens of malnutrition, including stunting, wasting, anemia,       and micronutrient deficiency, will struggle to achieve       sustainable and equitable economic growth;        Whereas the United States plays a lead role supporting the       goals of Scaling Up Nutrition, a global movement of 60       countries to prioritize nutrition, particularly during the       1,000-day window of opportunity between a mother's pregnancy       and her child's second birthday, through effective policy and       dedicated national resources; and        Whereas the world has reduced undernutrition since 1990,       yet global progress has been too slow to ensure each child       can attain a full and prosperous future regardless of where       he or she was born and at the current pace, the global       community will not reach its global nutrition targets set for       2025: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) reaffirms that--        (A) food security and good nutrition in early childhood       saves lives and lays the foundation for healthy physical and       cognitive growth and development;        (B) the potential benefit of good nutrition is life-long       and influences a child's entire future, with entire       communities and nations ultimately prospering;        (C) the right nutrition helps children learn, helps protect       them from illness, increases their productivity and earning       potential, and supports the well-being and health of their       future offspring; and        (D) women who are well-nourished and do not suffer from       anemia are less likely to die in childbirth and to give birth       to children who are malnourished, breaking the       intergenerational cycle of malnutrition;        (2) reaffirms that--        (A) good nutrition is also an economic issue central to       reducing poverty and putting countries on path to economic       development;        (B) adults who were well-nourished as children earn up to       46 percent more than those who were malnourished;        (C) countries with a very high burden of early childhood       malnutrition have lower economic growth rates due to lost       income and productivity; and        (D) the cost to nations is substantial with Gross Domestic       Product (GDP) losses estimated between 3 to 16 percent with       overall potential impacts to the global economy as high as       $3.5 trillion per year;        (3) supports United States leadership in helping developing       countries meet the nutritional needs of women and children,       and supports continued efforts;        (4) supports United States Agency for International       Development's (USAID) recognition that nutrition       interventions are among the lifesaving interventions that can       have the greatest impact in ending preventable child and       maternal deaths;        (5) supports the use of the USAID Multi-Sectoral Nutrition       Strategy, the United States Government Global Nutrition       Coordination Plan, and the Global Food Security Strategy as       platforms through which to help reach global nutrition       targets by 2025, as agreed to at the World Health Assembly in       2012;        (6) acknowledges the vision and goals of the Scaling Up       Nutrition movement as a  [[Page H6870]]       global partnership to support country-led efforts to improve       maternal and child nutrition involving governments, civil       society, the United Nations, donors, businesses, and       researchers;        (7) acknowledges that progress against global malnutrition       must be accelerated using innovative, scaled-up approaches to       improve the systems that affect the nutritional status of       women and children; and        (8) calls for transformative efforts across sectors at       USAID--        (A) to accelerate progress to end maternal and child       malnutrition, including through Country Development       Cooperation Strategies that align with country's national       nutrition plans; and        (B) to include improved and clear methods to track       nutrition funding and outcomes across all United States       Government global nutrition programs, especially those in       global health, food security, agriculture, basic education,       food assistance, and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 189.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, malnutrition is a devastating crisis across the world  with far-reaching effects. People cannot lead full, healthy, productive  lives without access to food and proper nutrition, especially in the  early stages of life. The impacts of malnutrition extend from health  challenges like child stunting and infant mortality to reduced economic  productivity that can keep communities and countries from achieving  greater prosperity.                                time  1245    That is why we cannot afford to have our international development  programs look at malnutrition as an isolated problem. To tackle this  crisis, particularly as we continue to grapple with the coronavirus  pandemic, we also have to address related economic, educational,  health, and social issues.   This good resolution, authored by Representative Marshall, outlines  the importance of continued American leadership in the fight against  global malnutrition and underscores the significance of USAID's work on  this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support it, and I urge my colleagues to  do the same. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, malnutrition around the world devastates the lives of  millions of people and prevents communities from prospering. This  problem has been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic, putting years of  work on nutrition at risk.   It is critical that the United States work to make even greater  progress on this major humanitarian and developmental challenge. This  resolution reaffirms the importance of American leadership in that  mission.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support it, and I urge my colleagues to  do the same. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the author of this important resolution  and the co-chairman of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission.  [[Page H6871]]         Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 189 is a very important resolution. I  support it and encourage my colleagues to do so as well. I think that  both sides of the aisle understand how important this is, and it is  good to see us working together.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 8428) to provide for temporary protected status for residents of  Hong Kong, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 8428         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Hong Kong People's Freedom       and Choice Act of 2020''.       SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.         For purposes of this Act:        (1) Joint declaration.--The term ``Joint Declaration''       means the Joint Declaration of the Government of the United       Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the       Government of the People's Republic of China on the Question       of Hong Kong, signed on December 19, 1984, and entered into       force on May 27, 1985.        (2) Priority hong kong resident.--The term ``Priority Hong       Kong resident'' means--        (A) a permanent resident of Hong Kong who--        (i) holds no right to citizenship in any country or       jurisdiction other than the People's Republic of China       (referred to in this Act as ``PRC''), Hong Kong, or Macau as       of the date of enactment of this Act;        (ii) has resided in Hong Kong for not less than the last 10       years as of the date of enactment of this Act; and        (iii) has been designated by the Secretary of State or       Secretary of Homeland Security as having met the requirements       of this subparagraph, in accordance with the procedures       described in section 7 of this Act; or        (B) the spouse of a person described in subparagraph (A),       or the child of such person as such term is defined in       section 101(b)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8       U.S.C. 1101(b)(1)), except that a child shall be an unmarried       person under twenty-seven years of age.        (3) Hong kong national security law.--The term ``Hong Kong       National Security Law'' means the Law of the People's       Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the       Hong Kong Special Administrative Region that was passed       unanimously by the National People's Congress and signed by       President Xi Jinping on June 30, 2020, and promulgated in the       Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (referred to in this       Act as ``Hong Kong SAR'') on July 1, 2020.        (4) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term       ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--        (A) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       the Judiciary of the House of Representatives; and        (B) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       the Judiciary of the Senate.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The Hong Kong National Security Law promulgated on July       1, 2020--        (A) contravenes the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special       Administrative Region (referred to in this Act as ``the Basic       Law'') that provides in Article 23 that the Legislative       Council of Hong Kong shall enact legislation related to       national security;        (B) violates the PRC's commitments under international law,       as defined by the Joint Declaration; and        (C) causes severe and irreparable damage to the ``one       country, two systems'' principle and further erodes global       confidence in the PRC's commitment to international law.        (2) On July 14, 2020, in response to the promulgation of       the Hong Kong National Security Law, President Trump signed       an Executive order on Hong Kong normalization that, among       other policy actions, suspended the special treatment of Hong       Kong persons under U.S. law with respect to the issuance of       immigrant and nonimmigrant visas.        (3) The United States has a long and proud history as a       destination for refugees and asylees fleeing persecution       based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or       membership in a particular social group.        (4) The United States also shares deep social, cultural,       and economic ties with the people of Hong Kong, including a       shared commitment to democracy, to the rule of law, and to       the protection of human rights.        (5) The United States has sheltered, protected, and       welcomed individuals who have fled authoritarian regimes,       including citizens from the PRC following the violent June 4,       1989, crackdown in Tiananmen Square, deepening ties between       the people of the United States and those individuals seeking       to contribute to a free, open society founded on democracy,       human rights, and the respect for the rule of law.        (6) The United States has reaped enormous economic,       cultural, and strategic benefits from welcoming successive       generations of scientists, doctors, entrepreneurs, artists,       intellectuals, and other freedom-loving people fleeing       fascism, communism, violent Islamist extremism, and other       repressive ideologies, including in the cases of Nazi       Germany, the Soviet Union, and Soviet-controlled Central       Europe, Cuba, Vietnam, and Iran.        (7) A major asymmetric advantage of the United States in       its long-term strategic competition with the Communist Party       of China is the ability of people from every country in the       world, irrespective of their race, ethnicity, or religion, to       immigrate to the United States and become American citizens.       SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         It is the policy of the United States--        (1) to reaffirm the principles and objectives set forth in       the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law       102-383), namely that--        (A) the United States has ``a strong interest in the       continued vitality, prosperity, and stability of Hong Kong'';        (B) ``support for democratization is a fundamental       principle of United States foreign policy'' and therefore       ``naturally applies to United States policy toward Hong       Kong'';        (C) ``the human rights of the people of Hong Kong are of       great importance to the United States and are directly       relevant to United States interests in Hong Kong and serve as       a basis for Hong Kong's continued economic prosperity''; and        (D) Hong Kong must remain sufficiently autonomous from the       PRC to ``justify treatment under a particular law of the       United States, or any provision thereof, different from that       accorded the People's Republic of China'';        (2) to continue to support the high degree of autonomy and       fundamental rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong,       as enumerated by--        (A) the Joint Declaration;        (B) the International Covenant on Civil and Political       Rights, done at New York December 19, 1966; and        (C) the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, done at       Paris December 10, 1948;        (3) to continue to support the democratic aspirations of       the people of Hong Kong, including the ``ultimate aim'' of       the selection of the Chief Executive and all members of the       Legislative Council by universal suffrage, as articulated in       the Basic Law;        (4) to urge the Government of the PRC, despite its recent       actions, to uphold its commitments to Hong Kong, including       allowing the people of Hong Kong to govern Hong Kong with a       high degree of autonomy and without undue interference, and       ensuring that Hong Kong voters freely enjoy the right to       elect the Chief Executive and all members of the Hong Kong       Legislative Council by universal suffrage;        (5) to support the establishment of a genuine democratic       option to freely and fairly nominate and elect the Chief       Executive of Hong Kong, and the establishment of open and       direct democratic elections for all members of the Hong Kong       Legislative Council;        (6) to support the robust exercise by residents of Hong       Kong of the rights to free speech, the press, and other       fundamental freedoms, as provided by the Basic Law, the Joint       Declaration, and the International Covenant on Civil and       Political Rights;        (7) to support freedom from arbitrary or unlawful arrest,       detention, or imprisonment for all Hong Kong residents, as       provided by the Basic Law, the Joint Declaration, and the       International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;        (8) to draw international attention to any violations by       the Government of the PRC of the fundamental rights of the       people of Hong Kong, as provided by the International       Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and any encroachment       upon the autonomy guaranteed to Hong Kong by the Basic Law       and the Joint Declaration;        (9) to protect United States citizens and long-term       permanent residents living in Hong Kong, as well as people       visiting and transiting through Hong Kong;        (10) to maintain the economic and cultural ties that       provide significant benefits to both the United States and       Hong Kong, including the reinstatement of the Fulbright       exchange program with regard to Hong Kong at the earliest       opportunity;        (11) to coordinate with allies, including the United       Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, and the Republic of Korea,       to promote democracy and human rights in Hong Kong; and        (12) to welcome and protect in the United States residents       of Hong Kong fleeing persecution or otherwise seeking a safe       haven from violations by the Government of the PRC of the       fundamental rights of the people of Hong Kong.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, during the 5       fiscal year period beginning on the first day of the first       full fiscal year after the date of enactment of this Act,       Hong Kong shall continue to be considered a foreign state       separate and apart from the PRC as mandated under section 103       of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1990 (Public Law       101-649) for purposes of the numerical limitations on       immigrant visas under sections 201, 202, and 203 of the       Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1151, 1152, and       1153).       SEC. 7. VERIFICATION OF HONG KONG PRIORITY RESIDENTS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in       consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, shall       publish in the Federal Register, an interim final rule       establishing procedures for designation of Hong Kong Priority       Residents. Notwithstanding section 553 of title 5, United       States Code, the rule shall be effective, on an interim       basis, immediately upon publication, but may be subject to       change and revision after public notice and opportunity for       comment. The Secretary of State shall finalize such rule not       later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this       Act. Such rule shall establish procedures--        (1) for individuals to register with any United States       embassy or consulate outside of the United States, or with       the Department of Homeland Security in the United States, and       request designation as a Priority Hong Kong Resident; and        (2) for the appropriate Secretary to verify the residency       of registered individuals and designate those who qualify as       Priority Hong Kong Residents.

(d) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a       report to the House Committees on Foreign Affairs and the       Judiciary and the Senate Committees on Foreign Relations and       the Judiciary detailing plans to implement the requirements       described in this subsection.        (e) Protection for Refugees.--Nothing in this section shall       be construed to prevent a Priority Hong Kong Resident from       seeking refugee status under section 207 of the Immigration       and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1157) or requesting asylum       under section 208 of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1158).

SEC. 11. STATEMENT OF POLICY ON ENCOURAGING ALLIES AND                     PARTNERS TO MAKE SIMILAR ACCOMMODATIONS.         It is the policy of the United States to encourage allies       and partners of the United States to make accommodations       similar to the accommodations made in this Act for residents       of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region who are       fleeing oppression by the Government of the People's Republic       of China.       SEC. 12. TERMINATION.         Except as provided in section 6 of this Act, this Act shall       cease to have effect on the date that is 5 years after the       date of the enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 8428.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Malinowski for his tireless  work on the Foreign Affairs Committee and particularly his advocacy on  behalf of those maligned and abused by the Chinese Government.   Mr. Speaker, China's attacks on Hong Kong's autonomy came to a head  this year when they rammed through the National Security Law,  effectively undermining the one country, two systems framework the Hong  Kongers were promised.   Since then, Beijing has used the law to arrest a number of pro- democracy activists. Just last week, Joshua Wong, Agnes Chow, and Ivan  Lam were sentenced to prison in an attempt by the People's Republic of  China to silence dissent.   When the National Security Law was passed, the Trump administration  abruptly eliminated a number of policies that gave Hong Kongers  preferential treatment under U.S. law, including terminating  immigration-related benefits to Hong Kong passport holders just when  they needed it most.   While the United States has shut our doors to the people of Hong  Kong, the United Kingdom was welcoming those fleeing Xi Jinping's  tyranny, with Canada now following suit. H.R. 8428 would allow the  United States to do the same, telling the people of Hong Kong that the  U.S. is open to them, that we want Hong Kongers to come to America and  contribute their talents to our society.                                time  1300    China is currently detaining 12 young Hong Kong activists who bravely  tried to hold their government accountable for the commitments under  international law. These are the kinds of people we should be helping.  We really need to admire them. They are really on the front line, and  we should not let China, the Beijing regime, get away with this.   This legislation corrects the unforced error of the administration  which closed our doors to people whom we should be defending.   Congress has constantly demonstrated strong bipartisan support for  Hong Kong, and I urge my colleagues to do the same today. It is really  terrible to allow Beijing to get away with this.   People of Hong Kong, as I said before, were promised that, when the  United Kingdom gave up Hong Kong, the agreement with the Beijing  Government was that Hong Kong would have lots of autonomy and lots of  freedom. And as they are doing in many places around the world, the  People's Republic of China, the Beijing Government, is just taking all  their promises and throwing them away.   We cannot allow that to happen. The United States must play a very  major role, a very vocal role, and that is what the Congress is doing  here today. It has bipartisan support by Democrats and Republicans. It  should be supported by all Americans. I think perhaps it is, and we  will send a clear message, not only to China, but all around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, December 1, 2020.      Hon. Eliot Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 8428, ``Hong Kong People's       Freedom and Choice Act of 2020'' that fall within our Rule X       jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us on those       provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection to your       including them in the bill for consideration on the House       floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to forgo       action on H.R. 8428, with the understanding that we do not       thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, November 11, 2020.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       8428, Hong Kong People's Freedom and Choice Act of 2020. I       appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the House Committee on the Judiciary under       House Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo  [[Page H6875]]       action on H.R. 8428 to expedite floor consideration. I       further acknowledge that the inaction of your Committee with       respect to the bill does not waive any future jurisdictional       claim over the matters contained in the bill that fall within       your jurisdiction. I will also support the appointment of       Committee on the Judiciary conferees during any House-Senate       conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, as you can see, there is bipartisan support  for this. As Americans, we have an absolute stake in what goes on in  China and Hong Kong.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Malinowski), the author of this important bill, a valued member of the  Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Malinowski).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for the  purpose of closing.   I want to first comment on some of the things that my good friend Mr.  McCaul said. I am touched by his statement. I am touched by the work we  have done together. It has been a pleasure. And I think that the way we  work on the Foreign Affairs Committee is the way I think all committees  should work and Congress should work. I think people are tired of  fighting and people want to see us work together.   It has been a pleasure for me to be chairman of the Foreign Affairs  Committee, and it has been a pleasure for me to work with such good  people like Mr. McCaul of Texas.   Saturday night we, as you alluded to, we got together for dinner,  actually in your house, with Mr. Royce, as well, and we had a very good  time. Most of the time we talked about work, but many of the other  times we just talked about our relationships and the general direction  that we would like to see the United States take in the international  field.   It is very difficult to leave a place that you love. I have been  fortunate to have spent 32 years in this robust body. These have been  the 32 best years of my life, and something that I will always  remember. I will remember it because we have done good work for people.  We have done good work for Americans. We have done good work for people  around the world. But I will remember it even more because of the good  friends that I met, friends like Mr. McCaul who work hard, who reach  out to the other side of the aisle.   And you know what, when you get together with people on the other  side of the aisle, you realize that you have so much in common with  them that perhaps you didn't even realize because the truth of the  matter is, here in Congress, if somebody is not on your committee and  they are from the other party, you hardly ever get to see them. You  hardly ever get to know them. You hardly ever get to be able to work  with them. I have tried to change that. So has Mr. McCaul. And we have  succeeded. We really have succeeded.   I hope that the rest of the Congress in the years to come will see  what we have done and will try to emulate us and try to do things that  really push the government and the people of this great country to work  together on issues because we all want the same thing for this  wonderful country. We are all pleased to serve this wonderful country.  And we want to make sure that others will get all of the benefits that  we have, as well, being able to just be free, support freedom, and work  together.   In closing, I want to, again, say to Mr. McCaul that it is a pleasure  working with you. It has been a pleasure. But we are going to continue  to do other things together. And I hope that all our colleagues on both  sides of the aisle will see what we have done on the Foreign Affairs  Committee and try to do the same thing. People want us to work  together. We may disagree on issues. That is what this body is for. But  I don't disagree with anybody's right to say what they want, and I  don't disagree with people wanting to let everyone know how strongly  they feel about the issues.   To Mr. McCaul, my good friend, I hope you will invite me back for  dinner. It has been a pleasure being your friend. It has been a  pleasure working with you.   Again, the Foreign Affairs Committee has just been a wonderful place.  It was the first committee which I joined when I came to this body 32  years ago.   So I tell my friends that I am not going away. I will be around. And,  hopefully, we can continue all the good things that we have done like  this bill, the national security law. It is a devastating blow to the  cause of human rights, democracy, and prosperity in Hong Kong. It is  the national security law that Beijing has forced Hong Kong to swallow.  It is a blow to the cause of human rights. We will not countenance it.  H.R. 8428 opens America's doors to Hong Kongers searching for freedom  from Beijing's aggression.   I once again thank Mr. Malinowski for authoring this legislation,  which not only protects U.S. interests but supports the people of Hong  Kong whose independence has slowly been stripped away from them.   Again, let me thank all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. It  has been a pleasure working with you. Let me especially thank my  friend, Mr. McCaul. In working together, we are going to make sure that  the American people get the kind of government they deserve, get the  kind of things that they deserve.   This is a wonderful country, and we are fortunate to be representing  our home districts in this country. So let me say, God bless America.  God bless all the people in our country who work every day, who want  help.   We are undergoing difficulty right now with the virus in this  country, but as Americans we will persevere, and we will continue to  have our role as the leaders of the free world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
