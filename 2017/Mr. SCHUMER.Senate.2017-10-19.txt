Without objection, it is so ordered.                                  Healthcare     Mr. President, first, on healthcare, my two good friends  Senators Alexander and Murray have constructed a good, fair, bipartisan  agreement that gives us a way forward on healthcare. It will offer  stability in the markets, and it will help lower premiums.   We have seen President Trump's near-constant equivocation on the  agreement. We shouldn't let it impede the progress of this very  important bipartisan compromise. He is for the bill one day, against it  the next. That is not uncommon; the President sometimes is for and  against something in the same sentence. We can only hope he comes  around again once he grasps what is in the bill.   The Alexander-Murray deal is not a bailout to the insurance companies  at all; it is the opposite. We have taken pains to ensure that  insurance companies do not reap any benefits from this program. That is  what Alexander and Murray have done. They have explicit provisions in  the bill to ensure that the cost-sharing program does what it is  intended to do: Lower premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket costs  for Americans who can least afford it.   I was reading an article this morning where they interviewed a  retired manufacturing worker in Pennsylvania who was upset by the  President's decision. The man said:         It seems like he is trying to hurt the middle class. . . .       He [President Trump] says he's going to make it better for       everyone. How does a (premium) increase make it better?    That is the question the President should ask himself. Ending cost- sharing hurts people, not insurance companies. Restoring cost sharing  will help people, not insurance companies. Senators Alexander and  Murray have made sure of it. I have talked to them about their  language. It is good language, well intended. Maybe we can make it  better. If the President has a suggestion, we welcome it, but as it is,  it is pretty strong.   Well-intentioned Members on both sides should continue to sign their  names onto this bill. I believe it has significant support within my  caucus, and if Leader McConnell puts it on the floor of the Senate, I  am pretty certain it would pass.   I urge my Republican colleagues to take a good, hard look at the bill  and to cosponsor it. So many of my Republican friends have said: Why  can't we be more bipartisan? This is a bipartisan agreement. It wasn't  one party coming up with something and telling the other to be for it,  as too often happens in this Chamber. It was done together by the chair  of the HELP Committee and the ranking Democrat of the HELP Committee.  It is truly bipartisan, and it is a good way for us to go forward and  set a metaphor for future bipartisanship.   Mr. President, now on the budget, today the Senate will vote on more  amendments to the GOP budget resolution, which increases deficits by  $1.5 trillion, slashes Medicare and Medicaid by $1.5 trillion, and sets  up this awful, partisan process--the same one our Republican friends  used in healthcare.   The Democrats could have offered an unlimited number of amendments on  the bill, but this bill is so bad that we didn't want to be all over  the lot. We wanted to focus on a few issues where we know the American  people are overwhelmingly with us, not with the language in the bill.   Here is some of what we are doing.   We are going to make our colleagues say that they want to vote to  increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. After 8 years of crowing about  debts and deficits under a Democratic President, the Republican deficit  hawks seem to have flown the coop. This budget is going to increase the  deficit by $1.5 trillion. Our amendment would say: No, it should be  deficit neutral. We have heard that for the last 8 years. Whenever a  spending program comes about, I know our side says that spending  programs grow the economy; their side says that tax cuts grow the  economy. But if there is going to be an actual deficit, we should vote  for it. Put your convictions where your votes are.   We are also going to make our Republican colleagues vote on whether  they want to raise taxes on the middle class. The President claims that  his tax plan will cut taxes, but it actually will raise them on  millions of hard-working families. Today our Republican colleagues will  decide whether they want to support those tax increases or protect the  middle class from paying more taxes.   We are going to make our Republican colleagues vote on their specific  proposal to eliminate the State and local deduction. Nearly one-third  of all taxpayers take the deduction--red States,  [[Page S6596]]  blue States, everyone in between. As the chairman of the Finance  Committee knows, 35 percent of Utahns take the State and local  deduction. It goes right to the heart of the middle class and upper  middle class, giving families tens of thousands of dollars in  deductions so taxes are lower. The elimination of State and local  deductibility is a sure sign that the Republican tax plan does not  favor the middle class.   In fact, AP reported yesterday that, according to experts, the GOP  tax plan may still allow corporations to claim State and local  deductibility but not individuals. Did you hear that? Corporations can  claim it, but individuals can't. Isn't that backward? It shouldn't be  taken away from either one. What the GOP plan takes away from  individuals and families, it makes sure remains for big corporations.   So today Democrats will ask our Republican friends to vote on our  amendment, led by Senators Cantwell and Van Hollen, to protect State  and local deductibility for middle-class families.   Senator Capito has an alternative amendment that is incredibly vague  and leaves the door open to eliminating State and local. It doesn't say  it will, but it leaves it open. That is why a coalition of groups,  including the National Governors Association, the U.S. Conference of  Mayors, and organizations representing firefighters, teachers, and  sheriffs have just come out against Senator Capito's amendment.   Senator Cantwell and Van Hollen's amendment, by contrast, is crystal  clear: no elimination of State and local. I hope my Republican friends  won't vote to raise taxes on so many of their middle-class residents.   Mr. President, finally, every morning I hear my friends the majority  leader and the chairman of the Finance Committee talk about the need  for tax reform because the middle class is stuck in a rut and the  economy isn't working the way it should for American families. I agree  with that assessment. We need to do more to grow the economy, create  jobs, raise wages, and put money in the pockets of average Americans,  but when you hear the details of the plan they have to solve those  problems, your head spins. Lower the tax rate on big corporations and  the top 1 percent, repeal the estate tax, which goes only to estates of  over $5 million, and eliminate critical middle-class tax breaks like  State and local deductibility. In what world does that deliver middle- class tax relief or solve the problems we are talking about?   It is the same game they played with healthcare: Complain about high  premiums, deductibles, counties without enough insurers, and then each  Republican bill exacerbates the problem.   The Republicans slide in their favorite solution--tax cuts for the  rich--as the answer to every ill. If the economy is doing well,  Republicans push tax cuts for the rich. If the economy is doing poorly,  Republicans push for tax cuts for the rich. If our healthcare system  needs to be improved, tax cuts for the rich. It is entirely divorced  from the real problems in the economy and our society.   Our economy suffers from massive inequality, which is growing, with a  concentration of wealth at the very apex of our country's elite. The  rich are doing well in America. God bless them; I am glad they are.  American corporations are recording record-high profits. Look at the  stock market, which reflects that. God bless them too. We hope they do  well. But looking at the GOP tax plan, the American people have to  wonder, is now the time to tilt the scales even further in favor of big  corporations and the very rich? I believe the American people will  reject that approach soundly and roundly, and after the amendment votes  today, the American people will have a much clearer picture of what the  Republican budget and tax plan is about.   There is still a chance to turn back from this budget and the one- party legislating that has stymied this Congress. I urge my colleagues  on the Republican side to reject this budget. Come work with Democrats,  and we can produce real, successful, bipartisan tax reform.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one yields time, the time will be  charged equally to both sides.   The Senator from Alaska.    Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. We  completely agree on this issue. We hope Members on both sides will stay  in their seats so we can finish quickly, without going through the  ridiculous vote-arama that we have done in previous years.   I yield the floor.                              Amendment No. 1553    The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally  divided, prior to a vote in relation to Udall amendment No. 1553.   The Senator from New Mexico.    Our side was in early.    Our side was in early.
