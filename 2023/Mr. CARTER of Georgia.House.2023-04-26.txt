 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate  Kristy Griffis Arnold on her appointment to the Cattlemen's Beef  Promotion and Research Board by the USDA.   Kristy has been involved with farming and agriculture her entire  life. She was born into a farming family, growing up on her family's  465-acre farm which has been passed down through multiple generations.  It was on her family farm that she learned the tools of the trade  related to cattle farming.   In addition to her recent appointment, Kristy has also been awarded  the Georgia Producer of the Year Award in 2010 by the Georgia  Cattlemen's Association.   In 2012, Kristy and her family won the 2012 Wayne County Farm Family  of the Year Award. In 2014, they won the Georgia Beef Quality Assurance  Award.   Kristy has proven time and time again that not only is she one of the  most accomplished and knowledgeable farmers in the district, but she is  also one of the best in the country.   Kristy's expertise in agriculture speaks for itself, and I believe  she will be an excellent addition to the Cattlemen's Beef Promotion and  Research Board.     Calling on the FDA to Reverse Restrictions on Alzheimer's Treatments     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand with the  6.7 million Americans who are living with Alzheimer's disease, their  family members, and their caregivers.   One in three seniors dies of Alzheimer's or a form of dementia. These  are our sisters, our brothers, our mothers, our fathers, our neighbors,  our fellow Americans, who are living with this heartbreaking disease.   Thanks to bipartisan efforts in Congress, we have made great progress  advancing research on Alzheimer's and dementia, providing hope to  families struggling with this tragic disease.   However, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently  declined to cover an entire class of FDA-approved Alzheimer's  treatments for Medicare patients. This has significantly reduced access  to care for our most vulnerable patients with no other options to treat  the disease.   Unfortunately, this administration continues to put patients last and  this decision of restricting Medicare coverage of FDA-approved  Alzheimer's treatment is just the latest example.    I ask my colleagues to join me in calling on this administration to  reverse this restrictive decision and provide those living with  Alzheimer's access to FDA-approved treatments.   To all the patients, families, and caregivers out there who are  struggling with Alzheimer's, I stand with them, and I will continue to  fight for them.         Congratulating the Camden County High School Wrestling Team     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the  Camden County High School wrestling team on their ninth consecutive  State championship.   It seems like winning a State championship is just part of the yearly  routine for the wrestlers at Camden County, but it was not always that  way. When Coach Jess Wilder took over the program in 2006, the school  had not won a State championship since 1984. Some even called Camden  the land of no chance, in reference to its State title aspirations.   Coach Wilder and the wrestlers of Camden County did not let that  discourage them, and after 2 years of hard work and determination,  Camden County won a State championship in 2008. The team took  championships home in both 2012 and 2015. Their 2015 win marked the  beginning of a yearly State championship run that still continues  today.   I congratulate the team and Coach Wilder on their hard work and  determination. They continue to make their school and the First  District proud.               Congratulating Inga Cashon and Brittany Nearhoof     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Inga  Cashon and Brittany Nearhoof for being recognized as 2024 Georgia  Teacher of the Year finalists.   State school superintendent Richard Woods, who surprised the  finalists with their selection throughout the month of March, said each  one of them is a shining example of the profession. I could not agree  more.   Inga Cashon is a science, technology, engineering, and math teacher  at North Tattnall Middle School. In 2020, she received the Georgia STEM  Scholar Award for her efforts to integrate effective STEM education in  the classroom.   Brittany Nearhoof is an art teacher at McAllister Elementary School  in Bryan County in the First District. She is also a leadership team  member and chair of the Fine Arts Night Committee.   I congratulate Inga and Brittany for their hard work and their  dedication to their students. They are very deserving of this honor.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Let me begin by thanking leadership and, particularly, the chair of  the Budget Committee for all of their hard work in putting this  together.   Let me also say that my colleague on the other side of the aisle  talks about fiscal irresponsibility. Well, if you want to talk about  fiscal irresponsibility, you only need to look at the White House and  what this administration has done.   Day one, they declared war on fossil fuels. You can make the  argument, and a valid argument, that what has happened in our economy  is a self-inflicted wound brought about by this war on fossil fuels  that caused an increase in gas prices, that caused an increase in  inflation, that caused an increase in interest rates and put this  economy in the shambles that it is in right now.   Since the first day of the administration, this Biden administration  has recklessly spent taxpayer dollars. As a result, as I say, you see  inflation at record highs, stealing money and opportunities from  hardworking Americans.   Our credit cards are maxed out. The gentleman talks about future  spending. That is what this is about, limiting future spending. That is  the conversation we are having.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  life of Reverend Charles Stanley, an influential Baptist pastor who for  more than 50 years preached from First Baptist Church of Atlanta.   A native of Dry Fork, Virginia, it was his mother, Rebecca, who first  introduced him to the Bible. His paternal grandfather was also a  preacher, and at age 14 Reverend Stanley felt a calling to the  ministry.   He graduated from the University of Richmond with a bachelor's degree  in history in 1954, and 2 years later was ordained at a Baptist church.   He later became a pastor at churches in Hendersonville, North  Carolina; Fairborn, Ohio; and Miami and Bartow, Florida, before joining  First Baptist Church of Atlanta in 1969 as associate pastor.   As the senior pastor at First Baptist Church of Atlanta, he was known  as one of the leading American preachers of his time, alongside figures  like Reverend Billy Graham. In 1984, he was elected president of the  Southern Baptist Convention, the Nation's largest Protestant  denomination.   His leadership and dedication to spreading the word of God has  impacted many generations of Christians. He will be dearly missed by  all who knew him.                            ____________________
