 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 5, I  call up the bill (H.R. 23) to rescind certain balances made available  to the Internal Revenue Service, and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on the bill currently under  consideration.  [[Page H77]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the process for considering our first bill of the 118th  Congress reflects our commitment to Americans and an open legislative  process.   Congresswoman Michelle Steel and I first introduced this bill in  September. Members were given more than 72 hours' notice prior to  today's consideration.   Mr. Speaker, 72 hours is more than enough time for Members to review  this bill. In fact, it is two pages long and covers only one topic.   If Members wish to vote on this bill, they must be present in the  House Chamber because proxy voting is no longer an option.   Now let's focus on what this bill does--it repeals the vast majority  of the Internal Revenue Service funding Democrats enacted last year in  order to pay for their Green New Deal.   The primary purpose of that funding is hiring more auditors and  support staff to vastly expand IRS's audit capacity. And not just  audits on wealthy Americans. With that expanded capacity, IRS can bring  in more revenue by auditing more middle- and lower-income families and  more small businesses.   Families and small businesses are struggling under the weight of  record inflation and supply chain shortages. Small businesses are  struggling to find workers at any wage.   The overwhelming majority of Americans, about 85 percent, follow the  law and pay their taxes. The last thing they need is more IRS agents  knocking on doors to conduct audits.   Yet, this IRS funding is part of the broad Biden administration  strategy to tax and audit exponentially more Americans by looking into  their bank accounts, requiring online payment services to report them  when they split a dinner check with friends or pay their babysitter  after a night out, and then target them using 87,000 new IRS employees.   Americans deserve to know their government is working for them, not  against them.   Today, Mr. Speaker, you are going to hear Democrats claim there  really won't be 87,000 new IRS employees. I imagine that they will say  that new employees aren't going to target middle-class families and  small businesses, and that Republicans don't care about IRS's customer  service failings.   Let's focus on the facts. When a Federal agency hires a new employee  to replace one who retires, it does not increase the agency's head  count. Yet, the Biden administration's own documents say they are  increasing the head count by 87,000 over the next decade with these  funds.   Secretary Yellen's own instructions to IRS stated audit rates of  families earning less than $400,000 should continue to be audited at  historically similar rates. Under those instructions, 9 out of every 10  new audits can target families earning less than $400,000.   And because Republicans are committed to delivering a government that  is accountable, this bill retains funding for customer service and IT  modernization at IRS--despite the fact these accounts would be more  appropriately addressed through regular appropriations--to ensure IRS  has the resources to make much-needed improvement to taxpayer services.   Mr. Speaker, there are numerous reasons to support this bill. It  protects families and small businesses. It ensures agencies are funded  appropriately. Most importantly, it stops autopilot funding for an out- of-control agency that is perhaps most in need of reform. IRS needs to  fix its customer service and return processing problems, not focus on  auditing families and small businesses.   Americans want an IRS that works for them, not against them.   This bill is a great first step in that direction, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an  excerpt from a 2021 Biden administration proposal called ``The American  Families Plan Tax Compliance Agenda'' that asks for $80 billion in IRS  funding and clearly shows a plan for 86,852 new hires.            [From the U.S. Department of the Treasury, May 2021]              The American Families Plan Tax Compliance Agenda                           Restoring IRS Resources         The first step in the President's efforts to restore IRS       enforcement capability is a sustained, multi-year commitment       to rebuilding the IRS. This involves spending nearly $80       billion on IRS priorities over the course of the decade       including hiring new specialized enforcement staff,       modernizing antiquated information technology, and investing       in meaningful taxpayer service--including the implementation       of the newly expanded credits aimed at providing support to       American families. Importantly, the additional resources will       go toward enforcement against those with the highest incomes,       and audit rates will not rise relative to recent years for       those earning less than $400,000 in actual income.        The President's proposal includes two components: a       dedicated stream of mandatory funds ($72.5 billion over a       decade) and a program integrity allocation ($6.7 billion over       a decade). These mechanisms provide for a sustained, multi-      year commitment to revitalizing the IRS that will give the       agency the certainty it needs to rebuild.        The IRS proposal includes year-by-year estimates of the       additional resources that will be directed toward the agency       as well as the specific activities that these resources would       support. The design ensures that the IRS is able to absorb       and usefully deploy additional resources over the entire 10-      year horizon and keeps budget growth manageable at around 10       percent per year.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. Murphy), a member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a  Republican Ways and Means Committee release that explains the  Congressional Budget Office's determination that it expects over $20  billion in revenue to come from the increased audits on taxpayers--that  means families and small businesses making less than $400,000.               [From waysandmeans.house.gov, August 12, 2022]  CBO: New IRS Audits Will Grab at Least $20B from Lower- & Middle-Income                                  Families         Key Point: At least $20 billion of the revenue Democrats       hope to collect from taxpayers with a supercharged IRS would       come from lower- and middle-income earners and small       businesses, according to a new analysis  [[Page H80]]       by the nonpartisan congressional scorekeeper. That's in       addition to existing audits of these income levels.        Explanation: Last weekend, all 50 Senate Democrats voted       against an amendment offered by Senate Finance Republican       Leader Mike Crapo (R-ID) that would have protected lower- and       middle-income American taxpayers against new audits by the       IRS.        The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) confirms that had       this amendment passed and lower- and middle-income taxpayers       been protected, revenue in Democrats' bill would have been       reduced by at least $20 billion--confirming that at least $20       billion of the $124 billion in new revenue expected by a       supercharged IRS will be coming from higher audits on low-       and middle-income Americans. This will be in addition to       existing audits on these income levels.        From CBO:        ``CBO has not completed a point estimate of this amendment       but the preliminary assessment indicates that amendment 5404       would reduce the 'non-scorable' revenues resulting from the       provisions of section 10301 by at least $20 billion over the       FY2022-FY2031 period.''        Additional Background:        Lower- and middle-income earning Americans are the primary       target in Democrats' bill:        A previous Congressional Budget Office analysis makes clear       that under this plan, audit rates will ``rise for all       taxayers'' and the policy ``would return audit rates to the       levels of about 10 years ago.''        The Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress's official tax       scorekeeper, says that from 78 percent to 90 percent of the       money raised from under-reported income would likely come       from those making less than $200,000 a year. Nearly half of       the audits would hit Americans making $75,000 per year or       less and only 4 percent to 9 percent would come from those       making more than $500,000.        Democrats voted against guardrails preventing audits for       middle-income earners, instead using non-binding legislative       language that would do nothing to protect taxpayers from       agency abuse.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Van Duyne).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a  Republican Ways and Means Committee release explaining that Senate  Democrats voted down an amendment that would prevent increased audits  on taxpayers making less than $400,000 a year and House Democrats  refuse to take up a bill that would do the same.                [From waysandmeans.house.gov, Aug. 17, 2022]           Democrats Fail To Protect Middle Class From IRS Audits         Democrats voted against guardrails that would have       protected lower- and middle-income taxpayers from more audits       as a result of supercharging the IRS with 87,000 new agents.        Instead, they hope you'll just ``take their word for it''       that the IRS won't target American families who are living       paycheck to paycheck. Various news outlets have circulated       these claims as facts, but the bill text says otherwise,       Reason Magazine's Matt Welch reports.        Democrats claim they won't target lower- and middle- income       earners with their expansion of the IRS by 87,000 agents . .       .        ``. . . top Democrats have been busy escalating their       already implausible claims that goosing the IRS enforcement       budget by 69 percent over a decade, hiring 87,000 additional       new staffers at an agency that currently employs 79,000, and       nabbing an estimated extra $124 billion in tax revenue will       miraculously not bring any percentage increase in audits       performed on Americans earning less than $400,000 a year.''        . . . but the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office       predicts boosted IRS funding will increase audits for all       taxpayers . . .        ``CBO Director Phillip L. Swagel estimated that boosting       IRS funding by $80 billion would increase tax revenues by       $200 billion (the number would later rise to $207 billion,       before settling at $204 billion), adding that `the proposal .       . . would return audit rates to the levels of about 10 years       ago; the rate would rise for all taxpayers' (italics mine),       though `higher-income taxpayers would face the largest       increase.' ''        . . . and Democrats voted against Republican amendments       preventing lower income earners from being targeted by higher       audits.        ``In the final IRA bill, in fact, $45.7 billion is       earmarked for `enforcement,' and $25.3 billion goes to       `operations support.' There is no reason to conclude from       those dollar amounts that the number of resulting audits will       be less than originally projected.''        Many ``fact checkers'' have refused to verify claims by       Democrats:        ``As Liz Wolfe has reported repeatedly in the pages of       Reason, none of these assurances live in the text of the       Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) itself. One Republican       amendment ``to prevent the use of additional Internal Revenue       Service Funds from being used for audits of taxpayers with       taxable incomes below $400,000'' was voted down on party       lines. You'll just have to take Democrats' word for it.       ``That's good enough for many news organizations, who have       been coughing up ``fact-checks'' aimed not at the       demonstrable veracity of White House promises about       significant legislation impacting literally all adult       Americans but at the hyperbole of Republican criticism       thereof.''        Democrats will raise audits on the middle class under the       guise of going after the tax gap.        ``The fact remains that you can't close the tax gap without       greater enforcement on the poor and that enforcement on the       poor is considerably less expensive.''        ``It is true that Yellen has freshly directed the IRS to       not increase the audit rate of under-$400,000s. And it's also       true that there's no structural enforcement mechanism       preventing the agency from continuing to go after low-hanging       fruit to meet revenue targets.''        Only $3.2 billion of the $80 billion total goes towards       improving services for taxpayers.        ``. . . just $3.2 billion of the $80 billion is earmarked       for customer service, producing a mere 9 percent increase       over the previous baseline. If the agency is bad at answering       phone calls--and it's bad at answering phone calls--a 9       percent bump seems inadequate to the task.''     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. LaHood), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Oklahoma (Mr. Hern), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, very briefly, I point out that  the Biden administration is not giving us all the information.  Secretary Yellen said that the IRS will not raise audit rates for  taxpayers making less than $400,000 ``relative to historic levels.''  What does ``historic levels'' really mean?   I include in the Record a CBO blog post from 2021 examining the Biden  administration's $80 billion proposal and stating that it would  ``return audit rates to the levels of about 10 years ago'' and that  ``the rate would rise for all taxpayers.''                     [From the CBO Blog, Sept. 2, 2021]                The Effects of Increased Funding for the IRS                             (By Phill Swagel)         Last month, the Congressional Budget Office published An       Analysis of Certain Proposals in the President's 2022 Budget.       Since then, CBO has completed its analysis of another       proposal in the President's budget, an increase in spending       for the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS's) enforcement       activities. CBO estimates that portions of the       Administration's proposal to increase funding for the IRS by       $80 billion over the 2022-2031 period would increase revenues       by approximately $200 billion over those 10 years. That       estimate does not include changes in revenues resulting from       portions of the proposal that involve new information-      reporting requirements and other changes to the tax code;       those changes are estimated by the staff of the Joint       Committee on Taxation (JCT).                                 the proposal         The Administration proposes funding for the IRS that is $80       billion greater over 10 years than the amounts in CBO's July       2021 baseline projections (which reflect the assumption that       current laws generally do not change). Two types of funding       would be provided: discretionary appropriations, which would       mainly be used for enforcement activities; and mandatory       funding, which would be used for a variety of activities (not       only enforcement but also operations support, business-      systems modernization, and taxpayer services).        Spending would increase in each year between 2021 and 2031,       though the highest growth would occur in the first few years.       By 2031, CBO projects, the proposal would make the IRS's       budget more than 90 percent larger than it is in CBO's July       2021 baseline projections and would more than double the       IRS's staffing. Of the $80 billion, CBO estimates, about $60       billion would be for enforcement and related operations       support.        The Administration also proposes that financial       institutions increase their reporting about account inflows       and outflows. Part of the increased funding would support the       implementation of a new information-reporting system to be       used by those institutions. The resulting effects on revenues       are estimated by JCT and are not included in CBO's estimate       of an approximately $200 billion increase.      how cbo estimates the effect on revenues of increased irs funding         CBO's estimate of revenues is based on the IRS's projected       returns on investment (ROIs) for spending on new enforcement       initiatives. The IRS estimates those ROIs by calculating the       expected revenues that would be raised from taxes, interest,       and penalties as a result of the new initiatives and dividing       them by their additional cost. (The agency has provided ROIs       over the past five years as part of its budget       justification.) The IRS's ROIs ramp up over three years as       staff become trained and fully productive, arrive at the peak       level, and then stay there. In recent years, peak ROIs have       ranged from 5 to 9. That is, a $1 increase in spending on the       IRS's enforcement activities results in $5 to $9 of increased       revenues.        CBO adjusts the ROIs so that they better reflect the       marginal return on additional spending. First, CBO expects       the IRS to prioritize the enforcement activities that it       thinks will have the highest average return; additional       enforcement spending would therefore have lower returns than       previous spending. Second, CBO expects taxpayers to adapt to       the IRS's enforcement activities and adopt new ways of       evading detection, so an enforcement activity may have a       lower return in later years. Finally, the productivity of the       IRS's enforcement activities will also depend on the IRS's       other capabilities. For example, modernized information       technology that stored all of a taxpayer's information in       digital form could increase the productivity of examiners       (the employees who detect taxpayers' noncompliance).        CBO's estimate of revenues also accounts for the timing of       collections resulting from enforcement activity by new hires.       Taxes are assessed at the end of an audit; if taxpayers       disagree with the assessment, they can appeal and continue to       litigate. The length of each step depends on the complexity       of the case. CBO estimates that an audit of medium complexity       would take 24 months to complete. That time, combined with       the expected training time for an experienced new hire,       suggests that the IRS would begin to collect revenues 30       months after the new hire joined the agency. (The timing       would be longer when cases were more complex or when the       taxpayer did not agree to the assessment and appealed.)                   what is incorporated into cbo's estimate         CBO's estimate of the change in revenues is relative to the       amount of revenues collected under current law (which is       reflected in CBO's baseline budget projections). Under       guidelines agreed to by the legislative and executive       branches, this change in revenues typically would not be       included in a cost estimate for legislation that brought       about the change, but it would be reflected in CBO's baseline       budget projections once the legislation was enacted. CBO's       estimate reflects the assumption that the proposed       increase in funding would follow the proposed expansion of       information reporting. Expanded information reporting       might allow the IRS to better target potentially       noncompliant taxpayers; it might also prompt taxpayers to       file more accurate tax returns. It might have a positive       effect on revenues collected, but it might also reduce the       ROIs from enforcement activities, because if returns are       more accurate, there will be less noncompliance to audit.       In CBO's and JCT's judgment, those effects roughly offset       each other, on net, resulting in a small positive effect       on ROIs.        CBO's estimate includes ``direct revenues'' and ``protected       revenues.'' Direct revenues are generated from the IRS's       auditing and collection efforts. Protected revenues result       when the IRS prevents a taxpayer from recouping previously       assessed and paid taxes--for example, when the IRS prevents       fraudulent refunds or disallows claims in taxpayers' amended       returns.        The estimate reflects CBO's expectation that the increased       enforcement activities would change the voluntary compliance       rate--that is, the share of taxes owed that are paid       voluntarily and on time--only modestly. The magnitude of that       effect is highly uncertain, however, and the empirical       evidence about the effects of audits on taxpayers' behavior       is inconclusive. Research about such deterrence finds varying       responses, depending on the type of taxpayer. People       generally increase their reported income in the years       following an audit, but people with higher income generally       do not, and neither do corporations. (For more discussion,       see Box 1 in CBO's July 2020 report Trends in the Internal       Revenue Service's Funding and Enforcement.)           how the current analysis differs from previous analyses         In that July 2020 report, CBO estimated that a $40 billion       increase in enforcement funding would raise $103 billion (for       a net effect of $63 billion). The methods used for this       estimate differ in several ways from the methods used for       that one.        First, CBO used updated ROIs that incorporated the IRS's       most recent estimates of the return on enforcement       activities. CBO then adjusted the ROIs to reflect both direct       revenues and protected revenues, increasing the peak ROI from       6.4 to 7.1.        Second, CBO's current methods allow for positive       interaction between enforcement spending and other IRS       funding. That is, CBO accounts for ways in which increased       capabilities, such as more digitization of  [[Page H87]]       taxpayers' information and greater visibility of income       flows, can increase the productivity of enforcement       activities.        Third, this analysis reflects a longer time frame for       receiving enforcement revenues because of the complexity of       audits associated with high-wealth individuals, large       corporations, and partnerships. Taxpayers with greater       resources may be more likely to appeal assessments or to       litigate their disputes in the U.S. Tax Court, delaying the       receipt of assessed taxes. As a result, revenues from some       audits will not be received until later than CBO estimated in       its July 2020 analysis.                            sources of uncertainty         The change in revenues resulting from an increase in the       IRS's funding could be different from CBO's estimate. It       depends on the IRS's ability to hire experienced candidates,       changes in voluntary compliance, and the interaction of       enforcement funding with the IRS's other capabilities.        The IRS intends to hire mid- and senior-level people with       private-sector experience who will not require a great deal       of training to become productive. But it might not be able to       hire its desired mix of candidates. If it hired less       experienced candidates, it would have to spend more resources       training them. Not only would they take longer to become       productive, but current staff members would have to devote       more time to training them. A related source of uncertainty       in CBO's estimate is attrition: If it proved higher than       expected, personnel would have fewer years at full       productivity.        An increase in the IRS's funding could signal that the       agency was more capable of detecting noncompliance, thus       increasing voluntary compliance and revenues. However, if       there were fewer noncompliant taxpayers to audit, the ROIs       from the IRS's enforcement activities would drop, and the       direct revenues from increased enforcement would be lower       than CBO estimated.        Finally, it is unclear how much the greater information       reporting or the increased IRS spending in areas other than       enforcement (such as technology) could improve examiners'       productivity. Greater nonenforcement spending might increase       overall revenues but decrease ROIs--for example, if improved       services for taxpayers enabled those taxpayers to more       accurately determine their tax liability, reducing the pool       of noncompliant taxpayers to audit.                             effects on taxpayers         The proposed increase in spending on the IRS's enforcement       activities would result in higher audit rates than those       underlying CBO's baseline budget projections. Between 2010       and 2018, the audit rate for higher-income taxpayers fell,       while the audit rate for lower-income taxpayers remained       fairly stable. In CBO's baseline projections, the overall       audit rate declines, resulting in lower audit rates for both       higher-income and lower-income taxpayers. The proposal, by       contrast, would return audit rates to the levels of about 10       years ago; the rate would rise for all taxpayers, but higher-      income taxpayers would face the largest increase. In       addition, the Administration's policies would focus       additional IRS resources on enforcement activity aimed at       high-wealth taxpayers, large corporations, and partnerships.       CBO estimates that if the proposals were enacted, tax       compliance would be improved, and more households would meet       their obligation under the law.        Higher audit rates would probably also result in some       audits of taxpayers who would later be determined not to owe       additional taxes. However, the Administration's proposal for       more information reporting, as well as additional spending on       IRS technology, might reduce the burden on compliant       taxpayers by allowing the IRS to better target noncompliant       ones and to reduce the number of audits that resulted in no       change in tax assessment.

Mr. Speaker, I include in the record a CBO  post from 2021 examining the Biden administration's $80 billion  proposal and stating that ``CBO projects the proposal would make the  IRS' budget more than 90 percent larger than it is in CBO's July 2021  baseline projections and would more than double the IRS' staffing.''                       [From CBO Blog, Sept. 2, 2021]                The Effects of Increased Funding for the IRS                              (By Phil Swagel)         Last month, the Congressional Budget Office published An       Analysis of Certain Proposals in the President's 2022 Budget.       Since then, CBO has completed its analysis of another       proposal in the President's budget, an increase in spending       for the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS's) enforcement       activities. CBO estimates that portions of the       Administration's proposal to increase funding for the IRS by       $80 billion over the 2022-2031 period would increase revenues       by approximately $200 billion over those 10 years. That       estimate does not include changes in revenues resulting from       portions of the proposal that involve new information-      reporting requirements and other changes to the tax code;       those changes are estimated by the staff of the Joint       Committee on Taxation (JCT).                                 The Proposal         The Administration proposes funding for the IRS that is $80       billion greater over 10 years than the amounts in CBO's July       2021 baseline projections (which reflect the assumption that       current laws generally do not change). Two types of funding       would be provided: discretionary appropriations, which would       mainly be used for enforcement activities; and mandatory       funding, which would be used for a variety of activities (not       only enforcement but also operations support, business-      systems modernization, and taxpayer services).        Spending would increase in each year between 2021 and 2031,       though the highest growth would occur in the first few years.       By 2031, CBO projects, the proposal would make the IRS's       budget more than 90 percent larger than it is in CBO's July       2021 baseline projections and would more than double the       IRS's staffing. Of the $80 billion, CBO estimates, about $60       billion would be for enforcement and related operations       support.        The Administration also proposes that financial       institutions increase their reporting about account inflows       and outflows. Part of the increased funding would support the       implementation of a new information-reporting system to be       used by those institutions. The resulting effects on revenues       are estimated by JCT and are not included in CBO's estimate       of an approximately $200 billion increase.      How CBO Estimates the Effect on Revenues of Increased IRS Funding         CBO's estimate of revenues is based on the IRS's projected       returns on investment (ROls) for spending on new enforcement       initiatives. The IRS estimates those ROls by calculating the       expected revenues that would be raised from taxes, interest,       and penalties as a result of the new initiatives and dividing       them by their additional cost. (The agency has provided ROls       over the past five years as part of its budget       justification.) The IRS's ROls ramp up over three years as       staff become trained and fully productive, arrive at the peak       level, and then stay there. In recent years, peak ROls have       ranged from 5 to 9. That is, a $1 increase in spending on the       IRS's enforcement activities results in $5 to $9 of increased       revenues.        CBO adjusts the ROls so that they better reflect the       marginal return on additional spending. First, CBO expects       the IRS to prioritize the enforcement activities that it       thinks will have the highest average return; additional       enforcement spending would therefore have lower returns than       previous spending. Second, CBO expects taxpayers to adapt to       the IRS's enforcement activities and adopt new ways of       evading detection, so an enforcement activity may have a       lower return in later years. Finally, the productivity of the       IRS's enforcement activities will also depend on the IRS's       other capabilities. For example, modernized information       technology that stored all of a taxpayer's information in       digital form could increase the productivity of examiners       (the employees who detect taxpayers' noncompliance).        CBO's estimate of revenues also accounts for the timing of       collections resulting from enforcement activity by new hires.       Taxes are assessed at the end of an audit; if taxpayers       disagree with the assessment, they can appeal and continue to       litigate. The length of each step depends on the complexity       of the case. CBO estimates that an audit of medium complexity       would take 24 months to complete. That time, combined with       the expected training time for an experienced new hire,       suggests that the IRS would begin to collect revenues 30       months after the new hire joined the agency. (The timing       would be longer when cases were more complex or when the       taxpayer did not agree to the assessment and appealed.)        What Is Incorporated Into CBO's Estimate. CBO's estimate of       the change in revenues is relative to the amount of revenues       collected under current law (which is reflected in CBO's       baseline budget projections). Under guidelines agreed to by       the legislative and executive branches, this change in       revenues typically would not be included in a cost estimate       for legislation that brought about the change, but it would       be reflected in CBO's baseline budget projections once the       legislation was enacted.        CBO's estimate reflects the assumption that the proposed       increase in funding would follow the proposed expansion of       information reporting. Expanded information reporting might       allow the IRS to better target potentially noncompliant       taxpayers; it might also prompt taxpayers to file more       accurate tax returns. It might have a positive effect on       revenues collected, but it might also reduce the ROIs from       enforcement activities, because if returns are more accurate,       there will be less noncompliance to audit. In CBO's and JCT's       judgment, those effects roughly offset each other, on net,       resulting in a small positive effect on ROIs.        CBO's estimate includes ``direct revenues'' and ``protected       revenues.'' Direct revenues are generated from the IRS's       auditing and collection efforts. Protected revenues result       when the IRS prevents a taxpayer from recouping previously       assessed and paid taxes-  [[Page H91]]       for example, when the IRS prevents fraudulent refunds or       disallows claims in taxpayers' amended returns.        The estimate reflects CBO's expectation that the increased       enforcement activities would change the voluntary compliance       rate--that is, the share of taxes owed that are paid       voluntarily and on time-only modestly. The magnitude of that       effect is highly uncertain, however, and the empirical       evidence about the effects of audits on taxpayers' behavior       is inconclusive. Research about such deterrence finds varying       responses, depending on the type of taxpayer. People       generally increase their reported income in the years       following an audit, but people with higher income generally       do not, and neither do corporations. (For more discussion,       see Box 1 in CBO's July 2020 report Trends in the Internal       Revenue Service's Funding and Enforcement.)        How the Current Analysis Differs From Previous Analyses. In       that July 2020 report, CBO estimated that a $40 billion       increase in enforcement funding would raise $103 billion (for       a net effect of $63 billion). The methods used for this       estimate differ in several ways from the methods used for       that one.        First, CBO used updated ROIs that incorporated the IRS's       most recent estimates of the return on enforcement       activities. CBO then adjusted the ROIs to reflect both direct       revenues and protected revenues, increasing the peak ROI from       6.4 to 7.1.        Second, CBO's current methods allow for positive       interaction between enforcement spending and other IRS       funding. That is, CBO accounts for ways in which increased       capabilities, such as more digitization of taxpayers'       information and greater visibility of income flows, can       increase the productivity of enforcement activities.        Third, this analysis reflects a longer time frame for       receiving enforcement revenues because of the complexity of       audits associated with high-wealth individuals, large       corporations, and partnerships. Taxpayers with greater       resources may be more likely to appeal assessments or to       litigate their disputes in the U.S. Tax Court, delaying the       receipt of assessed taxes. As a result, revenues from some       audits will not be received until later than CBO estimated in       its July 2020 analysis.        Sources of Uncertainty. The change in revenues resulting       from an increase in the IRS's funding could be different from       CBO's estimate. It depends on the IRS's ability to hire       experienced candidates, changes in voluntary compliance, and       the interaction of enforcement funding with the IRS's other       capabilities.        The IRS intends to hire mid- and senior-level people with       private sector experience who will not require a great deal       of training to become productive. But it might not be able to       hire its desired mix of candidates. If it hired less       experienced candidates, it would have to spend more resources       training them. Not only would they take longer to become       productive, but current staff members would have to devote       more time to training them. A related source of uncertainty       in CBO's estimate is attrition: If it proved higher than       expected, personnel would have fewer years at full       productivity.        An increase in the IRS's funding could signal that the       agency was more capable of detecting noncompliance, thus       increasing voluntary compliance and revenues. However, if       there were fewer noncompliant taxpayers to audit, the ROIs       from the IRS's enforcement activities would drop, and the       direct revenues from increased enforcement would be lower       than CBO estimated.        Finally, it is unclear how much the greater information       reporting or the increased IRS spending in areas other than       enforcement (such as technology) could improve examiners'       productivity. Greater nonenforcement spending might increase       overall revenues but decrease ROIs--for example, if improved       services for taxpayers enabled those taxpayers to more       accurately determine their tax liability, reducing the pool       of noncompliant taxpayers to audit.                             Effects on Taxpayers         The proposed increase in spending on the IRS's enforcement       activities would result in higher audit rates than those       underlying CBO's baseline budget projections. Between 2010       and 2018, the audit rate for higher-income taxpayers fell,       while the audit rate for lower-income taxpayers remained       fairly stable. In CBO's baseline projections, the overall       audit rate declines, resulting in lower audit rates for both       higher-income and lower-income taxpayers. The proposal, by       contrast, would return audit rates to the levels of about 10       years ago; the rate would rise for all taxpayers, but higher-      income taxpayers would face the largest increase. In       addition, the Administration's policies would focus       additional IRS resources on enforcement activity aimed at       high-wealth taxpayers, large corporations, and partnerships.       CBO estimates that if the proposals were enacted, tax       compliance would be improved, and more households would meet       their obligation under the law.        Higher audit rates would probably also result in some       audits of taxpayers who would later be determined not to owe       additional taxes. However, the Administration's proposal for       more information reporting, as well as additional spending on       IRS technology, might reduce the burden on compliant       taxpayers by allowing the IRS to better target noncom pliant       ones and to reduce the number of audits that resulted in no       change in tax assessment.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Malliotakis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. De La Cruz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Lawler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise with concern about some of these points that have  been raised. I think we have heard it from both sides that the IRS is  not answering the phone like they should, to actually serve the  taxpayers, taxpayers who want to do the right thing.   It is conceivable that there would be taxpayers overpaying as well  because of the complexity in the tax code, and yet the record shows  over the years that there have been innocent taxpayers, taxpayers who  already paid what they owed, who were still audited and were considered  guilty until they proved themselves innocent. To me, that is a huge  problem.   We just heard that there is concern about the debt, and yet the  answer is just more government employees, in fact, more than double of  what the current number of employees are. I have huge concerns about  that, and that is why I think we need to vote for this bill, get the  President and the Senate to agree to this, and work together to focus  on customer service issues that everyone knows are a concern at the  IRS.   I hope that, again, this use of technology can really lead the way  with a goal of customer service, rather than just hiring more full-time  equivalent employees. I don't think that will actually result in the  efficiencies that some are claiming would supposedly raise the revenue  that it would.   I just think we need to adopt this bill, get this passed, and come  together after that, realizing that we can and should expect the IRS to  do better.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the conversation that we have had here. I  think there is fundamental disagreement on what the real solutions need  to be; although, I think there is agreement that the current customer  service at the IRS is significantly underperforming.   Now, in 2019, in a bipartisan fashion, we passed the Taxpayer First  Act. In fact, our highly respected colleague, the late Representative  John Lewis, led the way on that, as well. This was about customer  service and reform at the IRS. Were there benefits from that? COVID got  in the way.   I think that does actually beg the question of what have been the  impacts of COVID on customer service at the IRS.   Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that when there are resources afforded  the IRS, they are just not used the way they can and should be,  especially as it relates to customer service and the honest taxpayers  that my colleague from Massachusetts references. We want to do  everything we can when the American people are doing the right thing,  for the right reasons, and abiding by the law. Yet they would still be  exposed to having to prove themselves again after they already did with  voluntary tax compliance. But here comes an audit. I vividly recall the  fact that in the 1990s, the IRS, as an agency, overstepped.   In fact, I believe it was President Clinton that even pulled back the  IRS somewhat because they were going after law-abiding, taxpaying  Americans who already did everything they were supposed to do.   That certainly establishes my concern about why we would see  legislation passed last year that would pretty randomly put forward  funding that I think will ultimately get in the way of these taxpaying  Americans who, like I said, already did everything they were supposed  to do, but yet they have to incur the expense.   Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill for good public policy,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
