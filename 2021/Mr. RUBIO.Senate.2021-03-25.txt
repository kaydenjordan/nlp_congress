 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1405 and ask  that it be reported by number.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S1796, March 25, 2021, first column, the following  appears:  Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1450  and ask that it be reported by number.      The online Record has been corrected to read:  Mr.  President, I call up my amendment No. 1405 and ask that it be  reported by number.    ========================= END NOTE =========================       Mr. President, the very reason we even have to do an  extension is that the new administration has unfairly and unnecessarily  restricted eligible businesses and nonprofits from applying. It has  created confusion.   People haven't been able to get in by the deadlines, and unless we  put in more guardrails, there is little assurance that this is not  going to continue. In particular, the one thing that would undermine  this popular, bipartisan program is if people came to the conclusion  that it was being used arbitrarily to give priority to politically  favored groups.   So all this amendment does is prohibit the Small Business  Administration from setting up any new set-asides beyond those that  this Congress, on a bipartisan basis, already created last year when we  passed this at the end of 2020.   What were those priorities? Smaller businesses, businesses in low- income areas, community financial institutions. All it says is, if you  want to change those priorities, Congress has to do it, not the Small  Business Administration.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
