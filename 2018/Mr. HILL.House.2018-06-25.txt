 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 5783) to provide a safe harbor for financial institutions that  maintain a customer account at the request of a Federal or State law  enforcement agency, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5783         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Cooperate with Law       Enforcement Agencies and Watch Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. SAFE HARBOR WITH RESPECT TO KEEP OPEN LETTERS.         (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 53 of title 31,       United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the       following:       ``Sec. 5333. Safe harbor with respect to keep open letters         ``(a) In General.--With respect to a customer account of a       financial institution, if a Federal, State, Tribal, or local       law enforcement agency requests, in writing, the financial       institution to keep such account open--        ``(1) the financial institution shall not be liable under       this subchapter for maintaining such account consistent with       the parameters of the request; and        ``(2) no Federal or State department or agency may take any       adverse supervisory action under this subchapter with respect       to  [[Page H5586]]       the financial institution for maintaining such account       consistent with the parameters of the request.        ``(b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be       construed--        ``(1) from preventing a Federal or State department or       agency from verifying the validity of a written request       described under subsection (a) with the Federal, State,       Tribal, or local law enforcement agency making the written       request; or        ``(2) to relieve a financial institution from complying       with any reporting requirements, including the reporting of       suspicious transactions under section 5318(g).        ``(c) Letter Termination Date.--For purposes of this       section, any written request described under subsection (a)       shall include a termination date after which such request       shall no longer apply.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents for chapter       53 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by inserting       after the item relating to section 5332 the following:  ``5333. Safe harbor with respect to keep open letters.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as a former community banker, I have dealt with the  conflict of wanting to help law enforcement agencies when receiving  what is called a keep open letter, while not being able to because of  the need also to comply with the requirements of my regulatory  responsibilities, the rules on setting out how banks have to open and  close a suspected account by a regulator.   Today, the overall purpose of this bill is to support law enforcement  and reduce money laundering and terrorist financing through our banking  system. That is why, along with my good friend from Illinois, Dr.  Foster, I was pleased to introduce this commonsense bill. It enables  partnerships without repercussions between law enforcement agencies and  local community financial institutions by allowing law enforcement to  monitor the cash flows associated with criminal investigations at a  financial institution.   Under the Bank Secrecy Act and the anti-money laundering regulations,  banks face strict rules for managing accounts so that they cannot  facilitate money laundering, terrorism financing, drug running, or  other illegal activities.   Sometimes banks receive notices from law enforcement agencies known  as keep open letters. That requests a bank to keep open an account so  that the law enforcement agency can track payments and better monitor  criminals.   Such requests might come from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement  Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S.  Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCEN, local  police, or any other law enforcement agency.   If banks help law enforcement comply with keep open letter requests,  they in turn, unfortunately, risk being penalized by regulators for  allowing an account to be open and continue to be open by someone who  is suspected of a crime.   This commonsense bill supports those efforts by law enforcement by  allowing the financial institutions to comply with the keep open  requests and maintain a suspicious account without being penalized by  regulators.   Financial institutions will no longer be liable for maintaining an  account for law enforcement investigative purposes.   Under this bill, no Federal department or agency may take an adverse  supervisory action with respect to that financial institution for  keeping open such an account.   This is a commonsense bill and I urge all my colleagues to support  it. It will give law enforcement the tools they need to prosecute bad  actors and, I think, be better and more fair in its treatment for our  financial institutions.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to just urge my colleagues to  recognize this as a strong group of bipartisan work by Dr. Foster and  it received solid support in the committee, that it balances the law  enforcement obligations to investigate criminals, but also treats, in  the regulatory system, our community financial institutions in a more  fair manner. I hope all my colleagues will support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 435) to amend the Fair Credit Reporting Act to clarify Federal  law with respect to reporting certain positive consumer credit  information to consumer reporting agencies, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 435         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``The Credit Access and       Inclusion Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. POSITIVE CREDIT REPORTING PERMITTED.         (a) In General.--Section 623 of the Fair Credit Reporting       Act (15 U.S.C. 1681s-2) is amended by adding at the end the       following new subsection:        ``(f) Full-File Credit Reporting.--        ``(1) In general.--Subject to the limitation in paragraph       (2) and notwithstanding any other provision of law, a person       or the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may furnish       to a consumer reporting agency information relating to the       performance of a consumer in making payments--        ``(A) under a lease agreement with respect to a dwelling,       including such a lease in which the Department of Housing and       Urban Development provides subsidized payments for occupancy       in a dwelling; or        ``(B) pursuant to a contract for a utility or       telecommunications service.        ``(2) Limitation.--Information about a consumer's usage of       any utility services provided by a utility or       telecommunication firm may be furnished to a consumer       reporting agency only to the extent that such information       relates to payment by the consumer for the services of such       utility or telecommunication service or other terms of the       provision of the services to the consumer, including any       deposit, discount, or conditions for interruption or       termination of the services.        ``(3) Payment plan.--An energy utility firm may not report       payment information to a consumer reporting agency with       respect to an outstanding balance of a consumer as late if--        ``(A) the energy utility firm and the consumer have entered       into a payment plan (including a deferred payment agreement,       an arrearage management program, or a debt forgiveness       program) with respect to such outstanding balance; and  [[Page H5587]]         ``(B) the consumer is meeting the obligations of the       payment plan, as determined by the energy utility firm.        ``(4) Definitions.--In this subsection, the following       definitions shall apply:        ``(A) Energy utility firm.--The term `energy utility firm'       means an entity that provides gas or electric utility       services to the public.        ``(B) Utility or telecommunication firm.--The term `utility       or telecommunication firm' means an entity that provides       utility services to the public through pipe, wire, landline,       wireless, cable, or other connected facilities, or radio,       electronic, or similar transmission (including the extension       of such facilities).''.        (b) Limitation on Liability.--Section 623(c) of the       Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1681s-2(c)) is       amended--        (1) in paragraph (2), by striking ``or'' at the end;        (2) by redesignating paragraph (3) as paragraph (4); and        (3) by inserting after paragraph (2) the following new       paragraph:        ``(3) subsection (f) of this section, including any       regulations issued thereunder; or''.        (c) GAO Study and Report.--Not later than 2 years after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of       the United States shall submit to Congress a report on the       impact of furnishing information pursuant to subsection (f)       of section 623 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C.       1681s-2) (as added by this Act) on consumers.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 435, introduced by my good friend from Minnesota,  Keith Ellison, The Credit Access and Inclusion Act of 2017, would amend  the Fair Credit Reporting Act to authorize the Department of Housing to  furnish consumer credit reports to include an individual's payment  history from rental payments for a dwelling, including HUD-subsidized  properties, and payment history for utility and telecommunications  contracts.   I want to thank my friend for this great piece of work on his part on  making credit more accessible, making it easier to get the data that  consumers need to build a credit record. It is not all just credit card  payments, Mr. Speaker, or payments to banks.   This kind of work that my friend from Minnesota has tackled improves  consumers' ability to build that very, very important thing in our  society, which is access to credit.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank my friend from  Minnesota. We have worked together on this bill during the year. I am  pleased to see it back on the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge bipartisan support for helping all American  consumers have a new and better way to help build their credit and get  access to credit to preserve the American Dream.   Mr. Speaker, we have no other speakers on this side, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 4294) to amend the Financial Stability Act of 2010 to provide a  criminal penalty for unauthorized disclosures of certain individually  identifiable information by officers or employees of a  [[Page H5588]]  Federal department or agency, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4294         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Prevention of Private       Information Dissemination Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. CRIMINAL PENALTY FOR UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURES.         Section 165 of the Financial Stability Act of 2010 (12       U.S.C. 5365) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(l) Criminal Penalty for Unauthorized Disclosures.--      Section 552a(i)(1) of title 5, United States Code, shall       apply to a determination made under subsection (d) or (i)       based on individually identifiable information submitted       pursuant to the requirements of this section to the same       extent as such section 552a(i)(1) applies to agency records       which contain individually identifiable information the       disclosure of which is prohibited by such section 552a or by       rules or regulations established thereunder.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an exchange of letters  between the committees of jurisdiction.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                      Washington, DC, June 22, 2018.      Hon. Jeb Hensarling,      Chairman, Committee on Financial Services,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Hensarling: I write with respect to H.R.       4294, the ``Prevention of Private Information Dissemination       Act.'' As a result of your having consulted with us on       provisions within H.R. 4294 that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary, I forego any       further consideration of this bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.        The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 4294 at       this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over subject       matter contained in this or similar legislation and that our       committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our       committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and asks       that you support any such request.        I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to H.R. 4294 and would ask       that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                      Washington, DC, June 25, 2018.      Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for your June 22, 2018       letter regarding H.R. 4294, the ``Prevention of Private       Information Dissemination Act of 2017''.        I am most appreciative of your decision to forego action on       H.R. 4294 so that it may move expeditiously to the House       floor. I acknowledge that although you are waiving action on       the bill, the Committee on the Judiciary is in no way waiving       its jurisdictional interest in this or similar legislation.       In addition, if a conference is necessary on this       legislation, I will support any request that your committee       be represented therein.        Finally, I shall be pleased to include your letter in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 4294.            Sincerely,                                                    Jeb Hensarling,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff), the author of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 6069) to require the Comptroller General of the United States to  carry out a study on how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are  used to buy, sell, or facilitate the financing of goods or services  associated with sex trafficking or drug trafficking, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6069         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Fight Illicit Networks and       Detect Trafficking Act'' or the ``FIND Trafficking Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) According to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)       2017 National Drug Threat Assessment, transnational criminal       organizations are increasingly using virtual currencies.        (2) The Treasury Department has recognized that: ``The       development of virtual currencies is an attempt to meet a       legitimate market demand. According to a Federal Reserve Bank       of Chicago economist, U.S. consumers want payment options       that are versatile and that provide immediate finality. No       U.S. payment method meets that description, although cash may       come closest. Virtual currencies can mimic cash's immediate       finality and anonymity and are more versatile than cash for       online and cross-border transactions, making virtual       currencies vulnerable for illicit transactions.''.        (3) Virtual currencies have become a prominent method to       pay for goods and services associated with illegal sex       trafficking and drug trafficking, which are two of the most       detrimental and troubling illegal activities facilitated by       online marketplaces.        (4) Online marketplaces, including the darkweb, have become       a prominent platform to buy, sell, and advertise for illicit       goods and services associated with sex trafficking and drug       trafficking.        (5) According to the International Labour Organization, in       2016, 4.8 million people in the world were victims of forced       sexual exploitation, and in 2014, the global profit from       commercial sexual exploitation was $99 billion.        (6) In 2016, within the United States, the Center for       Disease Control estimated that there were 64,000 deaths       related to drug overdose, and the most severe increase in       drug overdoses were those associated with fentanyl and       fentanyl analogs (synthetic opioids), which amounted to over       20,000 overdose deaths.        (7) According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury 2015       National Money Laundering Risk Assessment, an estimated $64       billion is generated annually from U.S. drug trafficking       sales.        (8) Illegal fentanyl in the United States originates       primarily from China, and it is readily available to purchase       through online marketplaces.       SEC. 3. GAO STUDY.         (a) Study Required.--The Comptroller General of the United       States shall conduct a study on how virtual currencies and       online marketplaces are used to facilitate sex and drug       trafficking. The study shall consider--        (1) how online marketplaces, including the darkweb, are       being used as platforms to buy, sell, or facilitate the       financing of goods or services associated with sex       trafficking or drug trafficking (specifically, opioids and       synthetic opioids, including fentanyl, fentanyl analogs, and       any precursor chemicals associated with manufacturing       fentanyl or fentanyl analogs) destined for, originating from,       or within the United States;        (2) how financial payment methods, including virtual       currencies and peer-to-peer mobile payment services, are       being utilized by online marketplaces to facilitate the       buying, selling, or financing of goods and services       associated with sex or drug trafficking destined for,       originating from, or within the United States;        (3) how virtual currencies are being used to facilitate the       buying, selling, or financing of goods and services       associated with sex or drug trafficking, destined for,       originating from, or within the United States, when an online       platform is not otherwise involved;        (4) how illicit funds that have been transmitted online and       through virtual currencies are repatriated into the formal       banking system of the United States through money laundering       or other means;        (5) the participants (state and non-state actors)       throughout the entire supply chain that participate in or       benefit from the buying, selling, or financing of goods and       services associated with sex or drug trafficking (either       through online marketplaces or virtual currencies) destined       for, originating from, or within the United States;        (6) Federal and State agency efforts to impede the buying,       selling, or financing of goods and services associated with       sex or drug trafficking destined for, originating from, or       within the United States, including efforts to prevent the       proceeds from sex or drug trafficking from entering the       United States banking system;        (7) how virtual currencies and their underlying       technologies can be used to detect and deter these illicit       activities; and        (8) to what extent can the immutable and traceable nature       of virtual currencies contribute to the tracking and       prosecution of illicit funding.        (b) Scope.--For the purposes of the study required under       subsection (a), the term ``sex trafficking'' means the       recruitment, harboring, transportation, provision, obtaining,       patronizing, or soliciting of a person for the purpose of a       commercial sex act that is induced by force, fraud, or       coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act       has not attained 18 years of age.        (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 1 year after the       date of enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the       United States shall submit to the Committee on Banking,       Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on       Financial Services of the House of Representatives a report       summarizing the results of the study required under       subsection (a), together with any recommendations for       legislative or regulatory action that would improve the       efforts of Federal agencies to impede the use of virtual       currencies and online marketplaces in facilitating sex and       drug trafficking.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend from California, Juan  Vargas, and my colleague from Pennsylvania, Keith Rothfus, for their  work together to cosponsor H.R. 6069, the Fight Illicit Networks and  Detect Trafficking Act.   This is extremely important, and it is in keeping with the work that  we have been doing in our subcommittee on terror finance, illicit  financing, and also the work we have done on this House floor about  stopping human trafficking that we see in this country and, also, the  intensive work in the last 2 weeks on opioid legislation in trying to  stop these kinds of drugs coming into our country.   This legislation would require the Government Accounting Office, the  GAO, to study and report to Congress on how online marketplaces,  including those on the dark web, are used as platforms to facilitate  the financing of goods associated with drug trafficking or sex  trafficking.   They would study payment methods, including virtual currencies and  peer-to-peer payment services, that are also being used in drug and sex  trafficking online; illicit funds that have been transmitted online and  how virtual currencies are reintegrated into the U.S. financial system;  and finally, Mr. Speaker, the study would have the participants of sex  trafficking or drug trafficking trade online that benefit from the  trade.   Although virtual currencies can be used for legal purchases, they  have become a common financial payment method for criminals.   Online marketplaces, including the dark web, have become a prominent  platform to buy, sell, and advertise for illicit goods and services  associated with sex trafficking and drug trafficking.   According to the International Labor Organization, in 2016, 4.8  million people in the world were victims of forced sexual exploitation,  and in 2014, the global profit from commercial sexual exploitation was  $99 billion.   According to the U.S. Treasury's 2015 National Money Laundering Risk  Assessment, an estimated $64 billion is  [[Page H5590]]  generated from U.S. drug trafficking operations.   Illegal fentanyl in the United States originates primarily from China  and is readily available to purchase through online marketplaces.  Certainly, all of my colleagues have heard extensively, over the last 2  weeks, the stunning horrors of how fentanyl has entered our  marketplace, with one estimate that, just last year alone, enough came  across our borders in this country to kill half the U.S. population.   According to the DEA, in 2017, the National Drug Threat Assessment,  transnational criminal organizations are increasingly using virtual  currencies. This bill will allow Congress to fully understand the  extent to which virtual currencies are being used to facilitate drug  and sex trafficking.   The bill will also study how virtual currencies can be used to detect  and deter illicit activities and propose legislative solutions to fight  these crimes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, for the bipartisan work on this bill, I want  to again thank Mr. Rothfus and my good friend Mr. Vargas. You can see  that he has the heart of a Jesuit and the mind of a Harvard lawyer.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
