 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the NDSU  Bison football team for winning the FCS National Championship.   On January 11, NDSU defeated James Madison University 28-20 in a  thrilling game that came down to the final seconds. Bison quarterback  Trey Lance racked up 166 yards on the ground during the game and  finished the season with 28 touchdowns and zero interceptions. He is  the first freshman ever to win the Walter Payton Player of the Year  Award and the Jerry Rice National Freshman of the Year Award.   Bison safety James Hendricks intercepted a pass on the goal line to  ice the game and ensure another Bison National Championship.   They finished the season 16-0, the first NCAA team to do so since  Yale in 1884. During this unprecedented run, NDSU has won eight  championships in 9 years and compiled a record of 128-8. They have lost  only eight games in 9 years, and they have defeated five FBS schools  along the way, two of which were ranked at the time they played NDSU.   Congratulations to the players, coaches, and fans of the most  dominant college football program in this country.   And a special happy birthday to Bison fan Jessica Unruh.
