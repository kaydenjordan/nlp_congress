 Mr. President, today I would like to raise concerns  about efforts to erode the effectiveness of the Countering America's  Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA. This law requires the  administration to impose a host of costs on the government of the  Russian Federation for its interference in democratic processes around  the world, its support for the brutal regime of Bashar Al-Assad, and  its active role in destabilizing Ukraine. Ninety-eight Senators voted  in favor of this legislation and should expect the administration to  fully implement it.   Of particular concern to me today is section 231, which requires the  imposition of sanctions on those who conduct significant transactions  with specific entities in the Russian defense and intelligence sectors.  We targeted those sectors because our intelligence community deemed  them responsible for the attack on our election in 2016. The law is  meant to cut financial income for these sectors.   Using the model implemented in the CISADA sanctions regime on Iran,  section 231 includes a provision to delay sanctions if the individual  in question can show that they are substantially reducing significant  transactions from these Russian entities. This model was extremely  effective in diminishing the volume of energy products that Iran was  able to sell to the rest of the world and ultimately helped to drive  them to the negotiating table. This model allows for some flexibility  while maintaining appropriate pressure to wind down business with these  sectors in Russia. It can work if we allow it to.   The State Department reports that the law is actually already having  an impact. Billions of dollars' worth of deals around the world with  the Russian defense sector have been turned off due to leverage created  by this law. That means billions of dollars less for Russia to  interfere in elections and sow discord in democratic societies,  billions of dollars less to support war crimes in Syria, billions of  dollars less to kill Ukrainians and violate the sovereignty of that  country. If the administration fully allows the law to work, the  Russian Government will have less money for all of these things.   The leverage CAATSA provides is critically necessary. In Turkey, this  leverage is vital in our efforts to ensure that the Erdogan government  does not purchase the Russian S400 air defense system. Such a purchase  would be a win for Putin in a strategically important part of the world  and could pose a security and intelligence threat to U.S. and NATO  personnel and equipment already in the country. CAATSA gives our  negotiators an important tool which we hope can leverage the right  policy decisions in Ankara.   Over the course of the debate on the NDAA, voices in the  administration want to weaken section 231 and have called for blanket  waiver authority. I opposed these efforts, not because I want sanctions  on our close friends who continue to do business with Russian defense  sector, but because such a move would gut CAATSA and render this key  provision of the law toothless. We need to remain true to the  principles laid out in in the law. Either we want to increasingly  maintain pressure on the Russian defense and intelligence sectors--or  we don't. Either we want to send a strong message to the Kremlin that  interfering in our elections and those of our allies is unacceptable-- or we don't. Either we want to defend our democracy--or we don't.   No one wants to impose sanctions on our close friends, especially as  defense relationships with those countries are improving. We should  continue building on the positive momentum around our defense  cooperation with several countries around the world. It is precisely  for this reason that countries should begin to make a choice. Either  they want a strong and growing defense partnership with the United  States--or they don't. Either they want access to the best defense  technology that the U.S. has to offer--or they don't. Either they  believe that standing up for democratic institutions matters--or they  don't.   The choice seems pretty clear to me.   We built flexibility into CAATSA that allows them to avoid sanctions  if they can show a substantial reduction in purchases over time.   I would also stress to my colleagues here: CAATSA is the only  significant bipartisan piece of foreign policy legislation passed since  Donald Trump came into office. We should be proud of this brief moment  of bipartisanship in support of our collective national security. Our  responsibility did not end with one vote. Stringent oversight matters  now more than ever. Will you stand by the law or buckle to attempts by  the administration to fundamentally weaken it?   A central challenge in the administration's implementation of section  231 is its refusal to make formal determinations that individuals have  in fact conducted significant transactions with specific Russian  Federation entities. Without such a baseline of information, it is  impossible to determine whether individuals are substantially reducing  significant transactions with the Russian defense and intelligence  sectors. I sought to remedy this shortcoming with an amendment to the  NDAA which would require the administration to regularly report on  whether such transactions have taken place. While the amendment did not  make it into the bill, I will continue to urge such reporting moving  forward and more transparency from the administration on how this law  is being implemented.   I want to acknowledge the work of those at the State and Treasury  Departments, especially the Office of Foreign Assets Control, who have  done the  [[Page S4339]]  hard work of preparing sanctions packages related to the executive  orders and the Magnitsky laws. More than 200 designations of Russian  entities and individuals have been made, constraining their ability to  carry out a Kremlin agenda of aggression around the globe. I want to  acknowledge the leadership of people like Assistant Secretary of State  Wess Mitchell in working to advance a realistic policy with respect to  President Putin's actions and intentions. There is no denying that our  government is populated with career civil servants and some political  appointees who are clear-eyed about the threat posed by the Kremlin and  are working every day to counter it. I just wish that our President had  their back.   Time and again, this President insists on making statements that  serve to hinder the good work done by our diplomats and civil servants.   He insisted that Russia rejoin the G7 though Moscow has done nothing  to remedy the reason for its suspension in the first place: the  invasion of Ukraine and illegal occupation of Crimea.   He insisted that most people in Crimea speak Russian so therefore  want to be part of Russia. This is wrong and an insult to thousands of  dead Ukrainians and their families.   He insisted on trashing our oldest allies while seeking to curry  favor with Putin.   Given the scale and nature of this threat, we need a fully aligned  policy apparatus where the President and bureaucracy are on the same  page. With this President, I am not sure that can be achieved, but it  is incumbent upon us, in this oversight body, Republican and Democrat,  to indeed insist that the President end his irrational affection for  the Kremlin. He must finally marshal all the resources of our  government to address this threat to our security and to our democracy.   It starts with the NATO summit next month. The President must be rock  solid in his commitment to article 5 of the alliance charter. He should  be firm about allies meeting their commitment of 2 percent of GDP to  defense, but not allow that issue to crowd out a real conversation and  coordination on addressing the threat posed by Russia. Our allies take  this threat seriously and want a President, in the tradition of Kennedy  and Reagan, who will show leadership and clarity of purpose at a NATO  summit. The President should use the summit to build common cause on  sanctions with those members of the EU present at the meeting.  Specifically, he should work with Europe to impose cyber sanctions on  Russian actors who threaten our democracies.   In closing, despite some progress in designating some key Russian  actors, I remain concerned that seven mandatory provisions of CAATSA  have not been implemented. This is simply unacceptable. Secretary  Pompeo committed during a recent Foreign Relations Committee hearing  that he would pursue the mandatory provisions under the law. To make  sure everyone is on the same page, let me run through the mandatory  provisions that have not been implemented under CAATSA authorities:  section 225, mandatory sanctions related to special Russian crude oil  products; section 226, mandatory sanctions with respect to Russian and  other foreign financial institutions; section 227, mandatory imposition  of sanctions with respect to significant corruption in the Russian  Federation; section 228, mandatory sanctions with respect to certain  transactions with foreign sanctions evaders and serious human rights  abusers in the Russian Federation; section 231, mandatory sanctions  with respect to persons engaging in transactions with the intelligence  and defense sectors of the Government of the Russian Federation;  section 233, mandatory sanctions with respect to investment in or  facilitation of privatization of state-owned assets by the Russian  Federation; and section 234, mandatory sanctions with respect to the  transfer of arms and related materiel to Syria.   I again implore the administration to follow the law and impose these  sanctions with urgency.   Let us recapture the bipartisan spirit we found to collectively  confront threats to our national security when this body passed CAATSA  nearly a year ago. I urge my colleagues to again join together and now  ensure implementation of this law. I urge my colleagues to stand firm  in support of our democracy against all forms of aggression, especially  from Moscow. There is still time before the 2018 election to make  crystal clear to the Kremlin that their days of unfettered cyber  hacking, bots, trolls, and lies are over.                            ____________________
