 Mr. Speaker, after testifying before the Rules Committee  last night on my amendment to this bill, H.R. 4, a worthy amendment  that, by the way, was not made in order and will not be debated or  voted on by this body, I felt compelled to speak about the broken  process that dominates this Congress.   The Speaker promised us an open and inclusive process but, in  reality, it has never been more closed. Members play very little role  in legislating today. Instead, the agenda is dictated and the process  is controlled by a failed leadership cabal.   Let me remind my colleagues on the other side of the aisle that  majorities can switch and, when they do, previous mistreatment,  unfairness, and disregard for the democratic process will be hard to  forget.   In the meantime, we can reverse this destructive trend and better  serve the American people by rejecting the rule before us, so I urge a  ``no'' vote on the rule.
