 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the provision  within this legislation that would authorize and appropriate $2.1  billion for the Veterans Choice Program.   Choice was created by Congress in 2014, following a nationwide  Department of Veterans Affairs access and accountability crisis. Make  no mistake about it: Choice has certainly not been without its faults  in the last 3 years; however, the program has also resulted in millions  of veterans receiving care they otherwise would have had to wait longer  or travel further for--or maybe not receive at all.   Absent passage of this provision, the Choice Program is expected to  run out of money in early 2018, which could jeopardize the care that  veterans across the country are receiving in their communities. This is  totally unacceptable.   The committee has been working diligently to create a permanent care  in the community program to replace and improve upon Choice. In fact, I  was proud to introduce H.R. 4242, the VA Care in the Community Act,  last month. That legislation was favorably reported out of my committee  just this week, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on  community care reform. In the meantime, we cannot allow the care our  veterans receive in the community through the Choice Program to be  jeopardized by lack of funding.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter Secretary Shulkin sent  me earlier this month.                              The Secretary of Veterans Affairs,                                  Washington, DC, December 12, 2017.      Hon. David P. Roe, M.D.,      Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to raise issues for your       consideration regarding the financial status of the Veterans       Choice Program (VCP), established by the Veterans Access,       Choice and Accountability Act of 2014, Public Law 113-146, as       amended (Choice Act). Current projections indicate that VCP       could be unable to create new referrals or authorizations       within several weeks. Without additional funding before the       end of the year, there will be a dramatic impact on the       ability of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide       care to Veterans.        As of December 7, 2017, VA has approximately $490 million       in VCP funds remaining, once December obligations of       approximately $300 million and reserve funding of       approximately $300 million are accounted for. The average       spend rate of VCP funds ranges from $200-$400 million per       month, with the possibility that unexpected obligations would       push this above and beyond the reserves. As a result, we       believe we have 3 to 5 weeks of funds left, which could       change based on Veteran utilization.        Nearly 1.9 million unique Veterans have sought care through       VCP since its implementation. VA has focused on improving VCP       through streamlined business processes, contract       modifications and implementation of statutory changes. Unless       additional funds are provided, Veterans utilizing the current       VCP will be less able to access timely health care as close       to their homes as possible. The Veteran Coordinated Access &       Rewarding Experiences (CARE) Act, proposed by VA to Congress,       would satisfy the funding requirements if passed.        The challenges of the transition from VCP to a new       Community Care program should not be underestimated, and VA       will need to take steps soon to responsibly prepare for the       termination date. If no action is taken by Congress in the       next 3 to 5 weeks, VA could have to discontinue authorizing       VCP care and transition Veterans to VA or other community       care programs. VA's other community care programs will not       have the capacity to handle all of the patients who will       transition from VCP, and the wait time for appointments at VA       facilities will rise if large numbers of Veterans return to       VA to seek care. Taking these actions would have a number of       negative consequences, including decreased access to care,       damaged community partnerships and interrupted care       continuity for Veterans.        Should you have any questions, please have a member of your       staff contact Mr. David Brant, Congressional Relations       Officer.            Sincerely,                                             David J. Shulkin, M.D.     In this letter, Secretary Shulkin explicitly  stated: ``Without additional funding before the end of the year, there  will be a dramatic impact on the ability of the Department of Veterans  Affairs to provide care to veterans.''   A vote against the continuing resolution is a vote against funding  medical care for our Nation's heroes. The Secretary's message is clear,  Mr. Speaker.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting an additional  $2.1 billion for the Choice Program.
