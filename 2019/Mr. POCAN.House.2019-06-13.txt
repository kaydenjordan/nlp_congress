 Madam Chairwoman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chairwoman, I rise today to offer an amendment that  ensures the Trump administration cannot block critical groundbreaking  research solely because it utilizes human fetal tissue.   I believe this new policy announced by HHS just last week is  shortsighted and that Congress should make its voice heard on the  issue. This amendment prohibits any funds in the bill being used to  establish a sham ethics advisory board with regard to research products  that use human fetal tissue.   The June 5, HHS announcement bars NIH scientists from conducting any  research using fetal tissue unless an additional ethics advisory board  review of NIH grant applications for fetal tissue research occurs. This  decision by President Trump is unnecessary since these grant  applications are already subject to rigorous ethical review  requirements.   Currently, any federally funded research that uses fetal tissue must  comply with oversight pursuant to the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993,  which was enacted on a bipartisan basis. This framework requires  informed consent and declarations pertaining to fetal tissue from all  donors, physicians, and researchers involved.                                time  1000    Let's be clear. The Trump administration's decision is not about  science or ethics. It is about politics.   Fetal tissue research is not new. It has been supported by the NIH  since the 1950s, and fetal tissue has been used to develop vaccines  that have saved and improved the lives of billions of people around the  world.   Vaccines for diseases such as measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox,  whooping cough, tetanus, hepatitis A, and rabies were all created using  fetal cell cultures. Researchers today are using fetal cells to develop  vaccines against diseases that include Ebola, HIV, and dengue fever.  Studies at UW-Madison in my district involving fetal tissue are trying  to develop treatments for conditions that include blindness, Zika,  developmental disorders, and diabetes.   This is exactly the type of research that the Federal Government  should be supporting, not defunding.   I encourage my colleagues to ensure that we all continue to fund  critical research on behalf of the American people and that we block  last week's decision that threatens Federal funding of fetal tissue  research.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Connecticut  (Ms. DeLauro), who is an amazing colleague.    Madam Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Apparently, Madam Chair, the other side of the aisle would  like to debate political science rather than medical science today. I  understand that. It is always great to make your base happy rather than  healthy. But there is a big difference when it comes to the issue of  fetal tissue.   We have had this debate before in committee. This isn't new. What is  new are the cures that are coming out of the use of fetal tissue not  just at UW-Madison but across the country.   The President's action shows how far removed not just the debate is  that we just heard, which is more about politics than science, but over  half the people who are on this new board don't even have to be  scientists, when we already have the proper oversight in place to make  sure that this is ethical research.   I get it. You have to make your base happy, especially in the era of  Donald Trump. But the bottom line is, you are hurting your constituents  by trying to place politics over medical science. That is just a really  bad idea.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Which I was doing, Madam Chair, and I appreciate that.   So, again, if you want to be a scientist who doesn't believe in  science, that is fine. That means you are a politician. I would like to  think that those of us who are going to deal with those  [[Page H4639]]  areas that involve science, even if we are politicians, focus on the  science aspects, and I am going to do just that. That is why this  amendment is important to make sure we have lifesaving research.   Madam Chair, I urge support, and I yield back the balance of my time.
