 Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that the United States  continues to lead in satellite communications technology and space  exploration to ensure our global competitiveness.   In today's world, indispensable spectrum resources know no borders or  boundaries, and they must be used to enhance space and satellite  operations, provide broadband access to our fellow Americans, and  enhance America's security capability.   As our private-sector partners continue to innovate, the Federal  Government can play a collaborative role through the modernization of  the launch spectrum licensing process.   This is why I joined my esteemed colleague from Florida (Mr. Soto) in  reintroducing the Launch Communications Act. This updates and  simplifies an outdated regulatory process so the U.S. can maintain our  competitiveness in space exploration.   Currently, commercial missions launching from the United States to  space must use government-owned spectrum to communicate with the  rockets during launch and reentry.   Additionally, these private companies must apply to the FCC who must  then coordinate with the NTIA to receive special temporary authority to  use such spectrum each time they launch.   The Launch Communications Act will lift the burden of obtaining many  authorizations and enable the private companies to temporarily use  certain spectrum bands for satellite launches when needed.   On multiple occasions this legislation requires the FCC to streamline  the launch authorization process for commercial launches, eliminating  the special temporary authority process, permitting multilaunch  authorizations, and automating the frequency review process.   This is consistent with Space Policy Directive-2 issued by President  Trump in May of 2018 to refine Federal spectrum regulations and  minimize regulatory burdens.                                time  1800
