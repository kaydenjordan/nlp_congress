 Madam Speaker, our work to lower healthcare costs for  working families could not be more urgent. Yesterday, we heard the  first arguments in the Texas v. United States case that will determine  whether we maintain critical protections for patients with preexisting  conditions.   We must work to improve the healthcare system that has now been in  place for almost a decade, not dismantle the progress that we have  achieved. If this lawsuit is successful, an additional 35,000 folks in  my district could become uninsured.   We cannot allow this to happen. To be sure, we need to fix and  improve the healthcare system today. What we should be here talking  about is how we can do that together.   We should be talking about ideas, such as the Medicare-X Choice Act  of 2019, which would add competition in the health insurance market. We  should be talking about how we reduce the high price of prescription  drugs. Medicare-X would create an affordable public option. The PRICED  Act would shorten market exclusivity.   It is time for solutions. Americans don't have time for anything  less.                            ____________________
