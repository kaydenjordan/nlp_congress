 Mr. Speaker, I recently traveled across New York's  beautiful and sprawling 24th District as part of my official 2023 farm  bill listening tour. Our district is among the largest agricultural and  dairy districts in the northeast and the largest apple growing district  outside of Washington State.   I hosted several open-door roundtables in every part of the district  to hear directly from farmers and producers about their concerns for  our region's agricultural community. Ahead of our consideration of the  farm bill later this year, feedback from farmers and producers is  vitally important.   The farm bill reauthorization is always critical for communities like  mine, but this year it is more important than ever. Our farmers are  struggling, and they need advocates in Congress who will stand with  them. In New York this is especially true, as a raft of new State laws  and regulations from Albany are imposing unprecedented and costly  burdens on rural communities.   Our farmers are counting on Congress to get this year's farm bill  done and get it done right.   First of all, based on what I gleaned from my listening sessions, the  following requests have been voiced:   Do not make any cuts to the farm bill programs that are pivotal to  the vitality of the northeast agricultural community;   Next, reform the national crop insurance program to cover a wider  range of items and better fit the needs of specialty crop farmers,  including maple syrup, which is unique to the Northeast;   Support funding for the specialty crop block grant program as well as  research and monitoring of invasive species that we have been  experiencing in New York; and   Raise the 5-million-pound dairy margin tier 1 limit to reflect the  consolidation that has occurred in the industry.   On a personal note, I plead and I beg of the farm bill appropriators  and drafters, please don't ban chocolate milk in schools. It was a  lifeline for me and my family. Even the one and only Elon Musk has  recognized the value in chocolate milk.   Mr. Speaker, these were the requests that were echoed by farmers  across the 24th District, and they are the priorities I am fighting for  in Congress. I thank Chairman G.T. Thompson for his continued  leadership as chair of the House Agriculture Committee and look forward  to working with him in advancing these priorities.   I will continue to advocate for solutions that support our  agricultural producers in New York and across the country. Members of  this body must realize, without productive farmers, we have no food and  we will not achieve prosperity. We must put aside partisan politics and  come together to make this year's farm bill a path to growth in all of  our agricultural economies.                            ____________________
