 Madam Speaker, this past  week, my colleagues and I traveled to different parts of the border to  see firsthand how children, mothers, and fathers are being terrorized  by the most anti-immigrant, xenophobic, and racist administration of my  lifetime.   We did this because we cannot stand by, cannot stand idly by, and  watch the most powerful country in the world tearing children from  their mothers and their fathers at their most vulnerable and desperate  moments. The stories of babies and toddlers being torn from the arms of  their mothers and fathers, the heartbreaking audio of children crying  and screaming for their parents, the account of a distraught father  taking his own life after his own child was wrestled from his arms, and  of a mother who was deported before she could recover her son from  detention, these are the atrocities perpetrated by President Trump, and  they must stop.                                time  0930    Families fleeing violence deserve and have a right to petition their  claim for asylum, for that is the law of the land.   I am here with two children today to call on this administration to  stop this cruel, inhumane practice that betrays who we are as a  country.   The President could make the decision to end this practice right now  and do the right thing. Failing that, Congress must act.   Madam Speaker, I yield to my distinguished colleague from Washington  (Ms. Jayapal).    Madam Speaker, I yield to  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez).
