 Madam Speaker, the National Labor Relations Board, NLRB,  under the Biden administration is so tightly wound around the little  finger of union bosses that the circulation has been cut off entirely.  Workers and employers are getting stiffed at every turn.   Under Republican administrations, the NLRB took practical measures to  protect the rights of workers and job creators. The times have indeed  changed.   The current NLRB's radical leftward lurch proves one solitary thing:  Democrats will always twist themselves into a legislative pretzel to  push the progressive policies of Big Labor.   We are seeing a concentrated effort by the NLRB to expand Big Labor's  power. For instance, the NLRB is exhuming policies from days gone by  like the Joy Silk doctrine, which would allow unions to organize a  workplace without ever receiving majority support in a secret ballot  election. By eviscerating the secret ballot, a hallmark of democratic  elections, card check makes workers more vulnerable to harassment from  union organizers.   Don't forget, a prominent union leader testified before the House  Education and Labor Committee that union workers need workers' personal  information to harass them at the grocery store or in their own homes  to pressure them into supporting the union. Their admission tells you  all you need to know about the political hackery of unions today.   The Biden-appointed NLRB general counsel has also challenged  longstanding precedent regarding employers' rights to educate their  employees about the downsides of union representation. General Counsel  Jennifer Abruzzo believes that such efforts are at odds with the  fundamental labor laws of this country.   Yet, this precedent was established in 1948, and no other general  counsel ever found reason to challenge such a significant precedent.  Coincidence? I think not.   With a union cheerleader as the NLRB general counsel, the current  NLRB is hell-bent on supporting the agenda of union bosses. Abruzzo is  a former union executive and is pushing radical pro-union policies.   Having former union employees serve in a union-regulating agency  creates a clear conflict of interest. But under the Biden  administration, this is the norm, not the exception.   Every level of the NLRB, and the Biden administration, is packed with  former union employees. Even his Labor Secretary was a former union  boss who still walks the picket lines.   But such actions are totally on brand for this administration.  President Biden swore to be the ``most pro-union President'' in  American history, and Big Labor is now the kingpin of this  administration. At this rate, President Biden might as well be a  stooge.    Republicans must work to rein in the NLRB union's zealotry. Its  heavy-handed actions infringe upon the freedoms of workers and  hamstring employers.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize a very soothing, informed,  and familiar voice in the High Country in North Carolina: Tom Lanier.   On July 23, Tom will be celebrating his 50th year on the air at WATA  in Boone--a monumental milestone.   In both Boone and surrounding areas, he is highly regarded as a true  staple as he continues his early morning radio program without fanfare.  With half a century of serving the High Country, you would be hard- pressed to find someone who does not know of Tom and his commitment to  keeping people informed.   Tom, the service you continue to provide to our community is  invaluable, and it is a testament to the caliber of person you are.   Congratulations, and here is to many more years on the air.                            ____________________
