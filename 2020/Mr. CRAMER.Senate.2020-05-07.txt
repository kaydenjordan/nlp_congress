 Mr. President, I would like to congratulate and  honor four North Dakota students who have been recognized for their  remarkable volunteer service by the Prudential Spirit of Community  Awards program.   This year's State honoress are Micah Schilittenhardt and Alexis  Thompson of Bismarck. Distinguished finalists are Teagen Nicholes of  Minot and Amorelle Upton of Fargo.   Micah, a student at Legacy High School, has spent more than 150 hours  raising awareness across North Dakota about the benefits of dance for  people with Parkinson's disease, while also raising funds for dance  lessons, support groups, and research. Alexis, who attends Horizon  Middle School, started an annual toy drive which has provided gifts for  more than 400 adolescent hospital patients, launched a campaign to  increase scoliosis awareness and screening, and organized a support  group for girls with curvature of the spine.   Teagen established a food pantry at Erik Ramstad Middle School, along  with contacting local businesses for financial support, spreading  awareness about food insecurity and organized schoolwide activities to  raise funds and donations. Amorelle, who attends Davies High School,  has raised money to benefit the Rape and Abuse Crisis Center, has  secured donations from local businesses, hosted several fundraising  events, and sent more than 300 letters soliciting support from her  local community.   The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards were created by Prudential  Financial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary  School Principals in 1995. Their purpose is to impress upon all youth  volunteers their contributions are critically important and highly  valued and to inspire other young people to follow their example. Over  the past 25 years, the program has become the Nation's largest youth  recognition effort based solely on community service. It has honored  more than 130,000 young volunteers at the local, State, and national  level.   These young volunteers inspire all of us and are among our brightest  hopes for a better tomorrow. I heartily applaud them for their  dedication to making their communities better places to live and for  the positive impact they have had on the lives of others. Their actions  show that young Americans can and do play important roles in their  communities and that America's community spirit continues to hold  tremendous promise for the future. Again, congratulations to Micah,  Alesis, Teagen, and Amorelle. I fully expect to hear much more from  each of them as they emerge as leaders of our next generation.                            ____________________
