 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the VA's PACT Act  Week of Action. Since 9/11, nearly 3.5 million Americans have been  exposed to burn pits and other dangerous substances during their time  in military service.   It is critically important that they receive the care that they need  before it is too late.   This week, we are raising awareness about the health benefits  available to them as a result of the PACT Act being signed into law.   Southern Illinois veterans and their families can attend an event  with the Marion VA tomorrow, Thursday, December 15, to learn about the  care and benefits available to them, including toxic exposure  screening, healthcare, enrollment benefits, and claims assistance. It  will be held from 5 to 8 p.m. Central Time, at John A. Logan College in  Carterville.   Similar events will be hosted all over the region and all over the  country, as well.   Now, the veterans need to know you can find out more information at  VA.gov/PACT or by calling 1-800-698-2411.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage any and all of our veterans who would be  eligible for this care to be proactive in getting the help that they  need.                         Recognizing Maria Tripplaar     Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to celebrate the service of  one of my staffers on the VA committee.   Mrs. Maria Tripplaar has been my staff director, counsel, and friend  for the last 5 years as we have worked to deliver on the promises that  we have made to our veterans.                                time  1015    Through her counsel and leadership, we have achieved landmark  legislative wins for veterans, their families, and their survivors,  particularly the Veterans Appeals Improvement and Modernization Act,  the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act, the Isakson and Roe Veterans  Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act, the PACT Act, and so many  other notable and worthwhile laws.   All the while, she was raising two young children and helping us do  all of that.   Maria, thank you for your dedication to America's veterans and the  success of our committee. We wish you well as you move to the next  chapter of your life.                            ____________________
