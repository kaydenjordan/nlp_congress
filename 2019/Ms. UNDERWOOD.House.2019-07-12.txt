 Madam Speaker, currently, 20 Republican-led States are  suing to overturn the Affordable Care Act and the protections that it  provides.   Rather than defend the law, the Trump administration is siding with  these States and arguing the entire law should be overturned. This is  an attack on every single American with a preexisting condition,  including 300,000 people in Illinois' 14th Congressional District.   If the ACA is overturned, insurers will, once again, have the power  to refuse coverage to people with preexisting conditions, like cancer,  asthma, heart conditions, and diabetes.   This is a fear for many of my constituents, including Mike DeBow of  Shorewood, Illinois, who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at a young  age. Mike wrote to me because he is ``deathly afraid''--his words--of  losing his insurance.   Under the ACA, Mike doesn't have to worry about being denied coverage  for his preexisting condition. He can even stay on his parents' plan  until he turns 26. But if the Republicans' lawsuit succeeds, 130  million Americans with preexisting conditions, including Mike, won't  have that peace of mind.   I am proud that my first vote in Congress was to protect the ACA by  defending it in court so that Americans like Mike can focus on leading  fulfilling lives, not whether their healthcare needs are covered.                            ____________________
