 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr.  Blumenthal, and I have come to a floor to offer a unanimous consent on  a bill called the Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act. We are in  consultation with our colleagues on the other side that have another  bill that they would also like to offer a unanimous consent request  for, and we are going to talk and continue the conversation during  these two upcoming votes to see if we can work out holds on their bill,  and we certainly would consider to do that.   But Senator Blumenthal and I do expect to offer a unanimous consent  on our bill which would lower out-of-pocket costs for prescription  drugs, which is something I thought we were all for. But working in  good faith with our colleagues to try to work through these two issues,  we are going to give it a little bit of time, as long as we can get  that done before we leave today.   I will just say there is no agreement to pair these. If they could  pass sequentially, I have no objection to that, but just to say that it  would be nice, at a time when we are so polarized here and have put the  ``dys'' back in ``dysfunction'' here in Washington, DC, that we could  actually show that we could work together in a bipartisan basis and  pass a bill that passed unanimously in the Judiciary Committee, of  which my friend from Illinois is a cosponsor.   I understand they want to use this opportunity to get their bill  passed. Again, I have no objection to that and do not intend to object,  but there are others who apparently have some concerns that we need to  check with.    Mr. President, I have 7 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
