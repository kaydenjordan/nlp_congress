 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my  statements before the nominee who is supposed to be voted on at 5:30 be  allowed to take place before the vote.    Madam President, I rise today to express my support for  the nomination of Uzra Zeya to be the next Under Secretary of State for  Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human Rights.   Ms. Zeya is immensely qualified to lead U.S. efforts to recenter our  most fundamental values in our foreign policy efforts and to strengthen  the Bureaus she will lead. Her experience and the more than 20 years as  a Foreign Service officer, including as the Acting Assistant Secretary  of State for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor in the State  Department, make her the perfect fit for this position.   The previous administration abdicated our global responsibility, but  we now have the opportunity to restore U.S. leadership in the fight for  democracy, human rights, and rule of law around the world. It is an  exciting prospect for us, but more importantly, it will give hope to  those still fighting for their rights, the millions of people  [[Page S4818]]  around the world who look to the United States for inspiration and  support in their own democratic struggles.   We see that in places like Cuba today. Looking around the globe, we  see China stripping away Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms at an  alarming pace. Military dictators are cementing their illegitimate rule  in places like Burma and Mali, eroding and eliminating the institutions  of democracy, while Russia and Belarus have imprisoned political  opponents without accountability.   At the same time, an unprecedented 80 million people have been  forcibly displaced from their homes, communities, and countries. We  must look no farther than our own southern border to see the  destruction, desperation, and displacement wrought by violence, climate  change, and lack of economic opportunity.   All of these developments negatively impact American national  security interests. Our Secretary of State and, indeed, our country  need senior human rights leadership of the caliber of Ms. Zeya.   The fact that the nomination of Ms. Zeya--a nominee so superbly  qualified and whose leadership is so essential to rebuilding the State  Department--has languished for 82 days is a travesty. I strongly urge  my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm her to the position of  Under Secretary of State for Civilian Security, Democracy, and Human  Rights, and I hope my Republican colleagues will stop blocking  qualified and critical nominees to the Nation's foreign policy and  national security mission from moving forward   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the 10th  anniversary of South Sudan's independence. July 9 is a bittersweet day  for the resilient people of South Sudan. For decades, South Sudanese  fought a brutal war with the government in Khartoum in which 2 million  people lost their lives. After decades of bloody struggle, the parties  to the conflict signed the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement, CPA,  which provided for self-determination for the South and paved the way  for South Sudan's independence in 2011, with the diplomatic support of  the United States and others in the international community.   Yet the promise of South Sudan's independence has turned into  tragedy. Deep fault lines that emerged during the country's long  struggle for independence, accentuated by rivalry and rent seeking  among the country's corrupt political elite, brought about catastrophe.  A little over 2 years after independence, 400,000 people were killed  and more than 4 million were displaced during the 5-year civil war  between forces loyal President Salva Kiir against those aligned with  Vice-President Riek Machar. Unspeakable atrocities were committed  against civilians during the conflict, including women and children. In  2017, the war induced a famine that brought hundreds of thousands more  to the brink of disaster.   The United States and its international partners have invested  heavily in diplomatic efforts to support and end to the conflict in  South Sudan. Despite failed cease-fire agreements and the intransigence  of the warring parties, in 2018 regional leaders working through the  InterGovernmental Authority on Development, IGAD, were finally able to  obtain agreement on what was called the Revitalized Agreement on the  Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan, R-ARCSS. Although far from  ideal, the agreement lays out a framework for a peaceful resolution of  the conflict, political reform, and democratic transition.   But implementation of the agreement remains slow, and South Sudan  sits at a very dangerous crossroad. Responsible parties have failed to  implement major provisions of the R-ARCSS, including those on power- sharing, constitutional development, security sector reform, economic  issues, and transitional justice, or have reneged on their commitments.  Nonsignatories to the R-ARCSS continue to wage an active insurgency,  particularly in Equatoria. Locally rooted communal violence is also  rampant, fueled by the invisible hand of rival national political  elites. Kiir's security apparatus continues to violate the human,  civil, and political rights of the South Sudanese people. Overlaying  all of these problems is an urgent humanitarian crisis--driven by  conflict induced food insecurity, displacement, and COVID-19--made all  the more worse by longstanding efforts by the Government of South Sudan  to undercut humanitarian access.   It is clear that South Sudan's stalled peace process needs a reboot.  The lack of progress on implementation of the R-ARCSS has created  significant concern about elections now slated for 2022--if they are  even held. And if they are held, without prior implementation of core  components of the agreement and other key actions, the polls could be a  flash point for conflict and violence.   In order to prevent this outcome, South Sudanese leadership, the  United States, and international partners must take urgent action.   Political leadership in Juba must immediately organize a process for  robust and inclusive negotiations over a new constitution in a process  that involves all South Sudanese stakeholders, including civil society  and holdout rebel groups. While I would not presume to dictate what the  South Sudanese people themselves might decide, it seems to me that  devolution of power from the national government to the states and  local administration, and genuine power-sharing at the national level  are necessary ingredients to avoid the winner-take-all calculus that  has served as an incentive to take and hold on to central power at any  cost.   Regional neighbors must act as well. Ongoing instability in East  Africa, including the war in Tigray, a fragile transition in Sudan, and  political turmoil in Somalia, has distracted regional actors who  traditionally engage  [[Page S4824]]  on South Sudan issues. This must change. Capitols in Africa, working  through the African Union, AU, and IGAD, must ensure that peace in  South Sudan is at the top of the agenda for policymakers. Working with  the Europeans and other partners, the United States should actively  support the efforts of the African stakeholders to rehabilitate South  Sudan's broken peace process.   The United States also has a prominent role to play. The relationship  between South Sudan and the United States runs deep. For decades the  United States has been the leading donor to South Sudan, including  major contributions from U.S. civil society. U.S. diplomacy has long  supported the South Sudanese cause and was critical to the signing of  the CPA. After independence, the United States remained firmly engaged  in supporting South Sudan, both through its bilateral engagement and  participation in the Troika. That tradition must continue and there is  no time to waste. I encourage the Biden administration to take four  steps:   First, appoint an experienced Ambassador to South Sudan, someone who  has served as an Ambassador in the region who is familiar with the  history of the relationship.   Second, the administration should pursue additional bilateral and  multilateral sanctions on South Sudanese political actors where needed,  including on those who obstruct the delivery of humanitarian aid. In  that same vein, it should support the continuation of the U.N. arms  embargo and regularly name parties that violate the embargo and hold  them accountable.   Third, the corruption that has long fueled South Sudan's political  crisis must be confronted head on. The United States and its partners  must demand full transparency from the Government of South Sudan on its  oil accounts: the international community must know what revenue is  coming in and what expenditures are being made. Kiir's foot-dragging on  public financial management has persisted for years; it is well past  time that Juba face consequences. The United States must use its voice  and vote at international financial institutions to oppose all budget  support to the Government of South Sudan and urge an end to all  programs that do not directly benefit the health and welfare of the  South Sudanese people until and unless the government is willing to  open its books to donors and, more importantly, the South Sudanese  people.   Finally, ending the cycle of conflict and despair in South Sudan will  require accountability for past crimes and atrocities. The lesson of 8  years of conflict in South Sudan is that progress is impossible in a  climate of impunity. Yet, despite support to the AU Hybrid Court for  South Sudan from the United States and other donors, the AU has failed  to fulfill its responsibilities, and the Hybrid Court remains in limbo.  Justice delayed is justice denied. With our allies in tow, the Biden  administration must make clear to relevant stakeholders at the AU and  in Juba that further delay on the issue of transitional justice is  unacceptable. If these parties do not act, the Biden administration  should work with allies to pursue alternative justice and  accountability mechanisms.   Mr. President, I congratulate the people of South Sudan on this  milestone. Their independence was hard won. I only wish their leaders  had treated them better. At this critical moment, the United States  must stand with all South Sudanese in their pursuit of justice,  democracy, and equitable development.                            ____________________
