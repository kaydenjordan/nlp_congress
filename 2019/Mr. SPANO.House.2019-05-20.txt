 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Zion  Lutheran Church in Groveland, Florida, for celebrating 100 years of  service to the community.   For the past 100 years, Zion has stood as a shining example to the  people of Groveland of what it means to be a Christian. Under Reverend  Werley's leadership, the congregation has actively shown God's love  through service.   The church regularly provides backpacks and school supplies to four  schools in the area, which are then given to students who need them  most.   Additionally, many women in the church also operate a knitting  ministry, where they knit prayer shawls and blankets for people who are  spending time in hospitals and nursing homes. Many of these gifts come  with a prayer so that the recipient knows that they are not alone in  their time of need.   Beyond these and many other acts of kindness, Zion has consistently  spread the good news to the people of Florida. The church has led by  example and shown what it means to live like Christ for generations of  Floridians.    You may be small in numbers, but you are, indeed, large in spirit.                            ____________________
