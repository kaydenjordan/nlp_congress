 Mr. President, I rise today to honor an outstanding  business leader from the great State of Idaho--Idaho Power CEO Darrel  Anderson.   There are many ways to define an effective leader: by their vision,  their passion, or their courage to do something bold. Mr. Anderson  possesses all the necessary qualifications and more. His impeccable  character, his authenticity, and his humility define his success not  only as CEO but also as an upstanding Idaho citizen, family man and  friend.   Mr. Anderson's tenure as president and CEO has been one for the  records. He led Idaho Power's parent company, IDACORP, to a historic 12  consecutive years of earnings growth--an unprecedented achievement  among investor-owned utilities in the United States. In 2019, the  company saw the best employee safety results ever recorded in its  history, something Mr. Anderson cares deeply about. Under his  leadership, Idaho Power also experienced the highest customer  satisfaction scores ever achieved.   Business results like these deserve recognition. But if you ask any  one of Idaho Power's nearly 2,000 employees, they will tell you Mr.  Anderson's legacy will not be the company's impressive numbers; it will  be that he knew their name, showed up for them in good times and bad  and encouraged them to make a commitment to one another every single  day. Mr. Anderson made employees feel valued and respected. He  acknowledged individual contributions and inspired employees to do the  same.   On June 1, after nearly 24 years with the company and serving at its  helm since 2014, Darrel Anderson is retiring. I send my sincerest  congratulations to my friend and wish him all the best on his well- deserved retirement. Idaho Power's reliable, affordable and clean  energy helps make our great State the ideal place to live, and I am  grateful for his exceptional leadership of this outstanding  company.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for myself and Mr. Crapo, I want to  recognize a very special nonprofit organization in our State that is  celebrating its 75th anniversary on May 20. Mission Aviation  Fellowship, or MAF, headquartered in Nampa, ID, was formed on May 20,  1945, by veteran pilots who returned from World War II with a vision  that airplanes could be used for peaceful means, bringing medicine,  education, and the gospel to isolated people around the world.   One of their founding members, Betty Greene, served as their first  pilot, becoming the first woman to fly over the Andes in South America  and the first female pilot in Sudan as she traveled the world on behalf  of MAF. Betty also received a Congressional Gold Medal for her wartime  service as a women Airforce service pilot, WASP. She piloted MAF's very  first flight from La Habra, CA, to Tuxpan, Mexico, and little did she  know at the time that Mission Aviation Fellowship would eventually  partner with over 500 organizations in 13 countries, delivering medical  services and vaccines, assisting with disaster response, and offering  physical help and spiritual hope for those living in the farthest  reaches of the world.   Their work among the most isolated people on our planet often goes  unnoticed, but in 1956, the world was captivated by the story of MAF  pilot Nate Saint and four other missionaries who were martyred on the  banks of the Curaray River in Ecuador at the hands of Waorani warriors.  Undeterred, MAF continued to expand its operations around the world,  and in 2006, they moved their headquarters to Nampa, ID, to provide  their pilots with quality backcountry flight training, favorable  weather, and lower cost of operations.   The Nampa headquarters hosts MAF's maintenance and training facility,  along with all of the back-office functions for its programs around the  world. The nearly 200 local employees and 300 volunteers support  another 400 staff members in foreign countries. MAF has a fleet of 47  airplanes that includes 13 Kodiaks that are made in Sandpoint, ID, and  are especially well-suited for the short, rugged mountain top and  jungle landing strips in the areas they serve.   Throughout their 75-year history, MAF has brought physical help and  spiritual hope to those living at the ends of the Earth--even in the  midst of wars, disease, and natural disasters. They look to serve those  that are forgotten by the rest of the world, and I congratulate them on  their 75 years of service and thank them for being there to provide  hope and deliver needed resources in some of the world's most  challenging places to reach.                            ____________________
