 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Warren County, Pennsylvania's recent bicentennial.   In March of 1819, the Pennsylvania General Assembly approved  legislation to establish Warren County. On October 1, later that year,  the legislation became official, and Warren County became a part of the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   This occasion was celebrated earlier this month at the Warren County  Courthouse, with local leaders and live entertainment, including the  Youngsville High School band. In addition to the remarks and  performances, a time capsule was buried on the grounds.   As an avid outdoorsman, I am proud to call Warren County a part of my  district, particularly for its beautiful natural landscapes. Home to a  portion of the Allegheny National Forest, Warren County has beautiful  outdoor spaces that rival much of the Commonwealth.   This bicentennial is an exciting occasion, and I would like to  congratulate Warren County on this milestone. I wish them continued  success in the next 200 years.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  October as National Farm to School Month.   The National Farm to School Network is an organization that strives  to strengthen the relationship our Nation's schools have with fresh,  healthy foods from local farms.   The farm to school movement focuses on agriculture education in our  schools and even encourages learning opportunities through school  gardens, cooking lessons, and farm field trips to better connect  students with where their food comes from. It also spurs market  opportunities for local farmers and ranchers.   Healthy and nutritious food is important in all stages of life, but  particularly for our Nation's young people. In some unfortunate cases,  the meals that students receive at school may be the only time they eat  during the day. It is important that we do what we can to ensure  schools have the resources they need to provide students with delicious  and nutritious options.                            ____________________
