 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in honor of the first woman to be  national commander of The American Legion. Her name is Denise Rohan.  She knows that this is a milestone. Therefore, she is very proud to  have been named to this position. She says: ``It is about time.''   From Ms. Rohan's perspective, women have always been leaders in the  Legion. I am sure most of us didn't even know that.   She says: ``If you look back, women were post commanders early on. We  have been in leadership positions. If we weren't leading from the  front, we were still there, helping the organization along.''   She says she doesn't think of herself as a female legionnaire. She  says: ``I want to be known as a great American Legion leader who  happens to be a woman. I have been working hard for the Legion for more  than 30 years and am humbled''--that the Legion--``chose me to be  national commander. It is an honor.''   She was elected at the Legion's 99th national convention in Reno,  Nevada, in August. She herself, of course, is an Army veteran and the  second national commander from Wisconsin. She and her husband, Mike,  belong to Mason Lindsay Post 385 in Verona. I am sure she would want  that known here on the floor. They have lived 30 years in Sun Prairie.    Members have supported Ms. Rohan for a long time and are excited to  see her at the top. She is regarded as very capable, outgoing,  friendly, and able to bring people to a consensus.   Her parents, Joe and Dorothy Hulbert, set a strong example for three  daughters. Both were volunteers and active in the local United Church  of Christ.   She first encountered the Legion as a girl at Memorial Day services  in a Catholic cemetery near her home. She waited patiently to receive a  spent brass shell casing from the honor guard to use as a whistle.   ``The town always had a parade that started at the cemetery, came  down the hill, went across the bridge and ended up at another cemetery  on the other side of the river,'' Ms. Rohan said. ``There was only one  parade I remember going the other way, when they brought home the body  of someone killed in Vietnam. It began at the high school and went up  the hill. That memory stayed with me.''   Still, the idea of serving in the military herself certainly didn't  occur to Ms. Rohan until a high school friend asked her and another  girl to accompany her to Des Moines for an Army physical. Her friend  failed, they passed, and Rohan had a choice. Unsure what she wanted to  do with her life and reluctant to ask her parents to put a third child  through college, she joined under the buddy system in 1974.   For a person who struggled with homesickness--that is what she called  it: homesickness--she got along just fine.   ``Somehow my mother lived through me sobbing on the phone every  single call for a couple of weeks,'' Ms. Rohan said. ``Then I started  realizing that I had another family: the women in basic training with  me. They had my back, they made sure I was taken care of, and we became  sisters.''   At Fort Lee, Virginia, she completed quartermaster school and was the  outstanding graduate of her class. Needing female instructors, the Army  sent Ms. Rohan to more training. That is where she met Mike, who was  working as a television production specialist.   ``I had to have some time in the studio,'' she said, teasing him.  ``My roommate at the time was a runner-up for Miss West Virginia the  year before she joined the Army, so here is this beautiful blonde who  probably did really good on camera because she was used to that kind of  stuff. He doesn't remember meeting me that day.''   By Mike's recollection, they met through a mutual friend a couple of  months later. He soon realized this girl had the qualities his mother  told him to seek in a woman--and more.   ``She never once told me to look for someone who could shoot an M-16,  or crawl under barbed wire with live fire going on, or run 2 miles with  a rucksack on her back, but that is what I found,'' he says. ``Denise  has all those abilities of a soldier but is also a loving wife and  mother.''   They started dating, fell in love, and Mike got orders to go to  Korea. About the same time, Rohan was up for reenlistment. Wanting to  stay together, they were married by a justice of the peace during one  of Rohan's morning breaks. Their reception was at McDonald's. ``That is  our romantic place we go every year, on May 21,'' she says.   Women are veterans, too. In the end, the Army couldn't guarantee  Rohan an assignment overseas, so she left the service and became an  Army wife. Of course, that would not be the case today.   Over the next few years, the couple lived in Korea, Texas, and,  finally, Wisconsin. Mike spent the first half of his career as  enlisted, then became a warrant officer in the National Guard.   Meanwhile, Rohan built her own career at the University of Wisconsin- Madison, starting as a program assistant in the student loan office.  She eventually rose to the position of assistant bursar, managing a  $120 million loan officer portfolio and helping to develop a  computerized system to manage it all. She retired in 2012, after 29  years. She is missed a lot, say those who worked with her and under  her.   Ms. Rohan's American Legion career has had a similar trajectory. She  joined in 1984, when the new commander of Post 333 in Sun Prairie, a  friend of Mike's, recruited her to join so she could serve as adjunct.   She laughs when she recalls an older veteran who was flustered by a  woman's presence at the meetings. He was saying something, swore, and  then he took his cap off and said: ``I am sorry, I didn't mean to be  disrespectful.'' Later, he did it again. He said: ``I just don't know  how I am going to do this.'' She told him: ``Hey, I was in the Army,  too. I have heard those words before.''   Ms. Rohan really found her spot in the Sun Prairie Post when she was  coordinating community blood drives: four a year, for two decades.  ``Each pint of blood can help three people, and we collected hundreds  at each drive,'' she says. ``The volunteers kept coming back, the  donors kept coming back. It makes you feel like you are making a  difference.''   From there, Ms. Rohan's reputation for hard work and willingness to  serve opened door after door: district adjutant and commander,  department historian--she is a four-time winner of the National  American Legion Historian contest--and department commander.   On the national level, she is a former chair of the Veterans  Employment and Education Commission, as well as the National Membership  and Post Activities Committee.   Along the way, she volunteered for dozens of smaller jobs that have  cemented the Legion's place in her community, like chartering a Boy  Scouts  [[Page H7456]]  troop, organizing children's Christmas parties, and assembling troop  care packages.   None of it would have happened if Ms. Rohan was the sort to hold  grudges, however. When the couple lived briefly in Marshall, Wisconsin,  a member of the local American Legion came by to recruit Mike.                                time  1645    Rohan identified herself as an eligible veteran, but the Legion  recruiter told her that women could join the auxiliary only.   Years later, the Marshall Post realized its mistake and hung a photo  of Ms. Rohan, then district commander, behind a sign that says:  ``Remember, women are veterans, too.''   Today, the Marshall Post is one of her biggest supporters. ``I  promised they would get one of my first national commander photos to  put in that frame,'' she says. ``We can do that,'' is what Rohan has  become known for. Her name is known in more than just Legion circles.   At the Wisconsin National Guard Armory in Madison, she and her  husband are Aunt Denise and Uncle Mike. Since 2006, they frequented  drill weekends so often that young servicemen sometimes assumed they  are part of their unit.   Facing a rough situation with a soldier fresh off deployment and  needing resources fast, Staff Sergeant Dan Killam was told to talk to  the Rohans at the Legion. That call led to an unbelievable amount of  care for troops and their families.   When soldiers needed satellite phone minutes to call home after a  battle, the Wisconsin Legion family raised $50,000. At a spur run for  the 105th Calvary, Legionnaires fed nearly 500 people.   I think after this lengthy--but I think much deserved--report on the  first woman to head The American Legion, we understand why the bill  that comes before us is much deserved.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 810. This bill authorizes  construction of a bridge on property acquired for open space under  section 404 of the Stafford Act.   Riverside Bridge in Christian County, Missouri, is a 100-year-old  one-lane bridge that currently frequently closes due to flooding. Local  transportation officials have agreed on a plan to replace the existing  one-lane bridge with a wider bridge that has a larger footprint.   However, expanding the bridge involves building on land that has  received FEMA disaster mitigation funds in the past.   After repeated flooding, FEMA provided funding to Christian County in  2009 to demolish a structure adjacent to the bridge, the Riverside Inn,  and to purchase the land. As a condition of providing the funding, FEMA  required that the land be maintained for open space, recreation, or  wetland management. Unless Congress removes the restriction on  construction on that site, the county cannot replace Riverside Bridge.   S. 810 provides that Christian County must ensure the bridge  replacement project does not result in flood damage and is liable for  any flood damage that occurs. No further disaster assistance from any  Federal source may be provided for the property or the structure.   This bill provides a narrow exemption from existing FEMA rules that  will allow Christian County, Missouri, to solve a transportation  problem. I am not aware of any opposition to this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
