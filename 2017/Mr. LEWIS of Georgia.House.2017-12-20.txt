 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, taxpayers stood up and  spoke out against Republicans lining the pockets of their donors by any  means necessary.   Did you hear their cries? Can you feel their pain?   You did not, Mr. Speaker. You chose to turn a deaf ear and a blind  eye to their hopes and their dreams.   This bill is a shame and a disgrace.   Mr. Speaker, I urge each of you to be on the side of the people, on  the side of history, and to vote against this bill.
