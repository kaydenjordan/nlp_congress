 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  passage of H.R. 2825, the Department of Homeland Security Authorization  Act of 2017, of which I am honored to be an original cosponsor.   The threats facing American families are real and rapidly evolving.  Since the original authorization 15 years ago, DHS has never been  reauthorized, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of congressional  oversight.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul and his staff for their work on  making the reauthorization package a reality. National security is an  issue that affects every man, woman, child, Republican, and Democrat in  our Nation. This bill will go a long way to ensuring that DHS remains  mission ready to continue protecting our homeland.   This legislation accomplishes several key things:   It creates efficiencies that protect the people's treasure and holds  programs accountable;   It offers congressional guidance for agencies within DHS such as  Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services to bolster our Nation's response to illegal  immigration; and    Supports the boots-on-the-ground and frontline defenders with much- needed resources.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.
