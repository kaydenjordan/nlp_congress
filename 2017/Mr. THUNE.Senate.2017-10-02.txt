 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to  complete my remarks prior to the vote.    Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for the  nomination of Ajit Pai to a second 5-year term as a Commissioner at the  Federal Communications Commission. Mr. Pai has served as a Commissioner  at the FCC since 2012, when he was first confirmed by a voice vote in  the Senate. He was designated as Chairman earlier this year.   A native of Kansas, Chairman Pai has focused on the expansion of  rural broadband and the acceleration of next-generation infrastructure  deployment. In recent weeks, he has worked tirelessly to help ensure  that communications services are restored to the communities that have  been affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. In just his 9  months since becoming Chairman, Mr. Pai has also made much needed  reforms to improve transparency at the FCC and to improve the agency's  processes.   I am particularly heartened by Chairman Pai's efforts to treat his  fellow Commissioners fairly by instituting the process of sharing  documents with other Commissioners before discussing them publicly.  Additionally, under Chairman Pai's leadership, the public is now able  to view the text of all agenda items in advance of Commission hearings.   With respect to the thorny issue of internet regulations, I am  pleased Chairman Pai has sought to hit the reset button on the 2015  title II order because, as I had previously said, the FCC should do  what is necessary to rebalance its regulatory posture under current  law. At the same time, I continue to believe the best way to provide  long-term protections for the internet is for Congress to pass  bipartisan legislation.   Rather than prolonging the back-and-forth debate on this issue, I,  once again, invite my colleagues to work with me to find a lasting  legislative solution that will resolve the dispute over net neutrality  once and for all.   As for the nomination before us, I can think of no better pick to  lead the FCC as it works to address a host of issues at the heart of  our interconnected economy. As I noted at the outset, Chairman Pai has  already made much needed reforms to improve the processes at the FCC  that empower fellow Commissioners. He has already shown a commitment to  ensuring transparency and openness at the Commission. That gives me  great confidence in the direction he will lead the agency.   Chairman Pai's approach, I believe, will lead to more long-lasting  and positive results at the FCC. That is why I believe the elevation of  Ajit Pai to be the Chairman of the Commission is a much needed breath  of fresh air and why I believe he should be confirmed promptly and  without further delay. I urge my colleagues to support his nomination.   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, today I recognize one of radio  broadcasting's longest running shows, ``I Love Life.'' Created by South  Dakota native, Jerry Dahmen, the show has hosted several of country  music's biggest stars and been featured on a number of local and  national television programs.   Since the program began airing on KXRB Radio in Sioux Falls, the show  has featured more than 1,600 guests who have shared inspirational  stories of what it takes to turn adversity into victory. ``I Love  Life'' has also given  [[Page S6260]]  back to the community by providing donations from book and CD sales.   I offer my congratulations to Jerry Dahmen and wish the show  continued success in the years to come.                            ____________________
