 Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. 2,  the Moving Forward Act, and thank my colleagues for their work on this  legislation.   Our Nation's transportation and infrastructure policies play a  critical role in building healthy and safe communities, but for far too  long, they have perpetuated many of our most entrenched inequities.   My amendment would require us to examine how our Nation's  transportation policies have impacted and targeted our most vulnerable.  It is critical that we understand how transportation policies are  criminalizing Black and Brown communities.   Specifically, we have seen violent enforcement of fare evasion  policies and the discriminatory placement of speed cameras and other  surveillance technology in our lowest income communities.   Mr. Speaker, this is a moment of reckoning. There is a multiracial,  multigenerational movement that, for the last month, has been affirming  that Black lives matter, demanding an end to racist systems and  policies that disproportionately criminalize our Black and Brown  neighbors.   We have a mandate to center justice in all of our policymaking. Our  transportation policies are no exception.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
