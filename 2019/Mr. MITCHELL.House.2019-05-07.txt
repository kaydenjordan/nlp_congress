 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor an outstanding  member of our community and our military on his retirement. For more  than 35 years, Brigadier General John ``Odie'' Slocum served our  country, most recently as the commander of the 127th Wing at Selfridge  Air National Guard Base in Michigan's 10th District, a post he held  from November 2014 until his retirement this past weekend.   General Slocum's career of more than 35 years and 4,100 flight hours  began in 1984 when he received his Air Force commission through East  Carolina University's ROTC program. After receiving his wings, Odie  served his 8 years of Active Duty as an F-4 Phantom and F-16 pilot and  then served as an instructor at bases in both Georgia and Arizona.   In 1992 he joined the Arizona Air National Guard where he served in a  variety of Operations Group and headquarters-staff positions, many  related to F-16 flight training, before taking over as Arizona Air  National Guard's 162nd Fighter Wing's chief of safety and squadron  commander. During his tenure in Arizona, he created a new Air National  Guard maintenance training curriculum, worked to increase mental health  and suicide prevention resources in the Air National Guard, initiated a  DOD-wide midair collision avoidance program, and more. Because of these  actions, in 2013, Odie was inducted into the Air Force Safety Hall of  Fame.   After 1 year as the Inspector General of the Air National Guard based  at Joint Base Andrews, in 2014 Slocum was promoted to brigadier general  and assumed command of the 127th Wing and Selfridge Air National Guard  Base, in my home district. It is home to 1,700 airmen operating both  the A-10 Warthog and KC-135 Stratotanker, as well as host to more than  45 tenant organizations from all branches of the military and numerous  DHS organizations. Nearly 4,500 Active Duty, Guard, Reserve, and  civilian personnel call Selfridge Air National Guard Base home.   Selfridge is unique, with diverse needs due to its many missions, and  General Slocum has been an exceptional leader of Selfridge and our  community. Under Slocum's leadership, the 127th Wing earned the Spaatz  Trophy, presented to the top flying wing in the Air National Guard;  earned an Air Force Meritorious Unit Award; and celebrated milestone  anniversaries of the base, 100 years, and the 127th Wing's two flying  units, the 107th Fighter Squadron, 100 years, and the 171st Air  Refueling Squadron. Further, last year, the 127th Wing was named Macomb  County Economic Development Partner of the Year, and Slocum was  inducted into the Macomb County Hall of Fame.   I have had the honor to work with General Slocum since before I  joined Congress, and I have greatly appreciated our professional  relationship, as well as the personal friendship that has grown the  last 5 years. In our nearly weekly phone calls, Odie has worked with me  to ensure I know what is going on at the base, I am aware of the base's  needs, and we work together to address the needs of the men and women  who serve in Selfridge.   It is extremely clear Odie cares deeply about Selfridge, the men and  women he commands, Michigan, and our Nation. We are all extremely  grateful for his decades of dedication to our Nation.   While I will miss having him commanding Selfridge, I know General  Slocum will continue to remain heavily involved in our community to  make our place a great place to live. On behalf of our community and  our Nation, I wish to extend him all the best in retirement, and I  thank him for his many years of exemplary service.                            ____________________
