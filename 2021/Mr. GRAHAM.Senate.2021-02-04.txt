 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, so as I understand it, some of the  Senators will come in after I speak. I will talk 10 or 15 minutes, and  then we will get on with the process of voting.   So, to the American people who may be watching, what is this all  about? This is an effort by my Democratic colleagues, supported by  President Biden, to pass $1.9 trillion in COVID relief through a budget  process that requires only 50 votes. It goes around the idea of  bipartisanship.   And I would say this: I think all of us would like unity. I think  President Biden said all the right things in his inauguration. The  question is, Are we going to do more than talk about unity?   I can understand having reconciliation used for ObamaCare or for  taxes. You all did that. We did that. There are big philosophical  differences. But this is the one area that there was bipartisanship up  until recently. This is the  [[Page S430]]  one area where the Congress has been able to work together across party  lines, and that is providing relief to the American people who have  been long-suffering under the COVID pandemic.   So I find it odd that if our goal is unity, we start with an issue  that has been unified up until now. That is what is a bit perplexing  because it is not like the Republican Party can't work with the  Democratic Party to help the American people when it comes to COVID  relief.   We had a Republican President, a Democratic-controlled House, and a  Republican Senate for the last year. We have appropriated $4 trillion  in COVID relief for the American people working together. So when there  was divided government--a Republican President, a Democratic-controlled  House, and a Republican-controlled Senate--we were able to achieve  bipartisanship in large measure, dealing with a lot of money, because  we saw the problem as something worthy of bipartisanship, necessary for  bipartisanship, and COVID was affecting everybody, regardless of  political persuasion.   Now we find ourselves early on in the Biden administration abandoning  that model and going forward on a partisan effort to spend $1.9  trillion with one party alone without, really, input from the other  party.   On March 5, 2020, we approved an $8 billion supplemental  appropriation 96 to 1. In March, we were just beginning to understand  the nature of the COVID problem. We shut the country down pretty much  in March, and as things became more clear to us, we acted, I think,  responsibly.   March 18, just a couple of weeks later, we approved, 98 to 8, a $355  billion package to help families that were affected by COVID. March 25,  just about a week later, we spent $1.9 trillion in a COVID-relief  package, which is a massive amount of money--one of the largest  expenditures in the history of the country since World War II--96 to  nothing.   So we are now talking about spending $1.9 trillion in February of  2021, and there seems to be no ability here to negotiate a package that  could get another 90-plus votes because my Democratic colleagues have  chosen the reconciliation route.   April 21, 2020, by voice vote, we spent $355 billion to add more  money to the Paycheck Protection Act that Senator Collins and the  Presiding Officer worked on to help businesses that had lost their  customer base. September 30, we had $8 billion, 84 to 10. December 21,  2020, we did an omnibus bill of $1.4 trillion funding the government,  and we had money for COVID in that package, about $900 billion. That  passed 92 to 6. That was Christmas.   Here is what I want you to understand. We have, up to now, been able  to work together to help the American people who have been suffering  from COVID. We have appropriated, as I have just described, over $4  trillion, and as of this moment, $2.7 trillion has actually been  allocated. So there is over $1.3 trillion that we haven't spent yet. Of  the $900 billion we authorized to be spent, appropriated in December,  only 20 percent of it has been spent.   So a lot of the money is yet to be spent, and now we are going to add  $1.9 trillion on top of what we have done before all the money has been  spent or most of it has been spent. We created a Federal Reserve  program for midsize and larger businesses that had a $5.7 trillion cap  on it, and we have done $2.6 trillion.   So I think people on our side really believe that we should learn  more about how the money we have already appropriated is being spent  and that a $15 minimum wage increase in a COVID package is a bad idea  during a COVID economy, and that is what is in this package.   Most small businesses in South Carolina and throughout the country  have been struggling to stay open due to lack of travel. And due to  mandates at the State and local levels reducing the ability to have 100  percent occupancy in restaurants, tourism has really been hurt. The  service sector has really been hurt. The food industry has really been  hurt   Can you imagine the combined effect of having the government reduce  your ability to earn money by restricting your business model and at  the same time adding a mandate to your business of maybe increasing  your wages by 50 percent, maybe 100 percent?   So this one-two punch will take out what is left of small businesses  in the tourism sector and the restaurant business because what we have  had to do--some people say we have done too much in restricting the  ability of small businesses to earn a living, and that is having an  effect on their ability to generate income. Now we are combining an  increase in cost of increasing wages for every business in the country  to $15 an hour over time. They can't absorb that.   A lot of us believe that is the wrong thing to do in a COVID economy.  Maybe one day we can talk about a minimum wage increase when business  can get back on its feet, but that is one of the reasons that you are  going to find pretty much unified opposition on our side.   So I just want the American people to know, it is one thing to talk  about unity, and it is another thing to seek it. And you picked the one  issue that we have been able to find common ground. Why you did this, I  don't know, but you have.   I appreciate President Biden sitting down with 10 Republicans who  wanted to find an alternative. A lot of people believe that in this  package the direct payments go to people who really are not going to  spend the money because they haven't lost their jobs and are making  over $150,000 or $200,000-plus as a couple and that we should target  direct stimulus checks to people in the lower income areas who have  suffered the most.   So there is a lot of concern about the nature of the $1.9 trillion  package. Details do matter. But I will just say this: I can understand  having a fight about healthcare and about taxes, but when it comes to  COVID relief, we have been able, in the last year, to find  bipartisanship for $4 trillion. And now we are abandoning that quest,  and we are going to try to create a process--my Democratic colleagues  are--to deal us all out on our side and pass a $1.9 trillion COVID  package that I think in many ways misses the mark.   So to say that I am disappointed is an understatement. You have the  right to do this. And during the campaign, we talked about what would  happen if one party got in charge of everything. We predicted, on the  Republican side, if you have a Democratic President, Democratic Senate,  and a Democratic House, the liberal wish list is going to come roaring  through the House and the Senate, trying to get on President Biden's  desk.   To President Biden's credit, I think he ran a campaign that was more  centrist, but now he has the chance, as President of the United States,  to stand down this process and continue to talk with the Republicans. I  think there are more than 10 who would like to find an alternative to a  $1.9 trillion package that we think misses the mark and is being  appropriated when we haven't spent most of the money we have already  appropriated.   So this is the choice you make. This is the debate we are going to  have. It is going to be a long day. It will go into the night. Let's  try to keep good cheer about it. I understand that we all love the  country, but these kinds of debates are important, and the choices you  make as a party--we will have to accept responsibility for the choices  that we all make.   And I would just urge my Democratic colleagues, this is one area  where I have been relatively proud of the Congress. We have spent an  enormous amount of money in a bipartisan fashion. Some of the most  conservative Members of the Senate have been voting on pretty large  amounts of money because, I think, generally speaking, it has been  necessary. But now the vaccine is being distributed. Anything we can do  to get it out faster to more people, great. Most of the money we have  appropriated hasn't been spent. I would just ask that we slow down a  bit.   Whatever we spend in the future needs to be more targeted. And the  last thing you want to do in a COVID economy is increase the cost of  doing business at a time when most businesses are barely hanging on in  certain sectors of the economy.   So I look forward to working with Senator Sanders, trying to work  through the amendments. This will be a long day, but, hopefully, it  will be a fruitful day for the American people as you understand more  about the differences that we have. And, eventually,  [[Page S431]]  maybe we can find something in common.   If you asked me before the election: What are the two areas that  bipartisanship would be easiest achieved, most likely to be achieved-- infrastructure, because we all have roads and bridges and ports, and  COVID. So I was wrong about the COVID part, and time will tell if it  matters at all.   With that, I will yield to my friend and colleague, the chairman of  the committee, Senator Sanders.    Do it by voice vote?    Mr. President, I call up my amendment, No. 687.    Mr. President, the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy was put in  place by the Trump administration after talks with Mexico about how to  stem the flow of migrants from Central America who were seeking to come  to the United States for economic reasons more times than not. Before  the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy was adopted, migrants from the Northern  Triangle countries traveled to the United States, seeking to turn  themselves in and claim asylum whether they had valid claims or not.  They would then be released into the United States and often did not  return for their court dates.   If we end the ``Remain in Mexico'' policy for asylum seekers, it will  lead to a run on our border and complicate efforts to reform the  immigration system. Over 50,000 asylum seekers have been waiting in  Mexico rather than in the United States, where they often disappear  while waiting in the 1 million-person asylum case backlog. This was an  important change that the Trump administration put in place, and it is  a serious mistake to reverse it.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of this  amendment, Senate amendment No. 687, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I know it is late, but this is important.  I have been to Iraq and Afghanistan 56 times. If you think this makes  us safe, cutting all assistance to all allies everywhere--people are  fighting and dying on behalf of this country. The least we can do, if  you are in the fight, make sure you can come home and not have to go  back. The best way to continue endless wars is to ignore the fact that  when we leave, bad things happen.                          Vote on Amendment No. 441
