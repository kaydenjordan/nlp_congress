 Madam President, the Senate is about to cast its vote--a  key vote--on passage of the first package of fiscal year 2024  appropriations bills. They include the Military Construction-VA bill,  the Agriculture and FDA legislation, and the Transportation and Housing  and Urban Development appropriations.   I want to thank everyone involved for their cooperation for getting  us to the point of passing this significant package.   First, let me thank Chair Murray for her strong, persistent, and  dedicated leadership.   The support of Leaders McConnell and Thune and Leader Schumer were  also absolutely essential.   I want to express my thanks to our hard-working staff, led by Betsy  McDonnell and Evan Schatz.   We have a great Republican team on the Appropriations Committee. And  I want to thank all of them for working with their Democratic  counterparts to bring about truly bipartisan bills. Particularly, I  want to thank on the Agriculture Subcommittee, the chairman, Senator  Heinrich, and the ranking member, Senator Hoeven.   I want to thank my Military Construction and Veterans Affairs  Committee, Senator Murray, for playing a double role there, as well as  Senator Boozman.   And on the Transportation-HUD Subcommittee--a subcommittee I chaired  for many years and was ranking member on--I want to thank Senator  Schatz and Senator Hyde-Smith. They all worked incredibly hard.   After working for weeks with our colleagues, we considered 40  amendments to these three bills. All three of these bills passed the  Appropriations Committee unanimously this past summer. And I appreciate  the hard work of every single one of our members.   Giving Senators a voice in funding decisions through a robust  committee and floor process was an early goal that Chair Murray and I  established. It guided our process as the committee approved all 12 of  the appropriations bills by the end of July for the first time in 5  years. It also has guided our process on the Senate floor. Well, it was  certainly not easy and certainly took far longer than either the chair  or I would have liked. The amendment process allowed for Senators of  both parties to fully debate these bills and be heard.   I look forward to working with Chair Murray and her colleagues to  build on this progress by continuing to process our committee-approved  appropriations bills on the Senate floor.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for this important  legislative package that honors and serves our Nation's veterans,  supports our farmers, ranchers, and rural communities, and improves  transportation infrastructure and housing opportunities all across our  great country.   I urge a yea vote on the bill.    Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Working  Waterfront Preservation Act, legislation to help preserve access by our  Nation's fishermen and maritime workers to the waterfronts in coastal  communities. I would like to thank my friend Senator Jack Reed from  Rhode Island, who joins me in introducing this legislation.   According to the most recent data from the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, commerical and recreational fisheries are  responsible for more than 1.7 million jobs in the  [[Page S5317]]  United States, $253 billion in sales, and $117 billion in value-added  impacts. In Maine, our fisheries are one of our State's most important  resources and are vital to our economy. A report of Maine's seafood  sector as a whole, which included downstream contributors, found that  in 2019, the sector contributed more than $3.2 billion to Maine's  economy. Although the fishing industry is a significant economic  contributor both nationwide and in Maine, it is losing access to the  working waterfronts that are vital to the industry's survival.   A working waterfront is defined as land that is used for or that  supports commercial fishing, aquaculture, boatbuilding, or the for-hire  recreational fishing industries. That may be a technical definition,  but these areas represent much more to coastal communities. A recent  study conducted by the Maine Coast Fishermen's Association sums it up  perfectly: ``Working waterfronts are more than just a place of business  for commercial fishermen; they are a hub of information, a collection  of salty characters, a safe haven, a meeting room, a space for support,  and they are well-deserving of both a place in Maine's history and its  future.'' The importance of these areas cannot be overstated.   In Maine our fishermen and women are losing access to waterfront  property up and down the coast. In some coastal Maine communities, once  thriving working waterfronts no longer exist. Recent interviews  conducted by the Island Institute in Maine uncover that ``for all  practical purposes, working waterfront access [in these towns] is  essentially gone.'' The reasons for this are complex. In some cases,  burdensome fishing regulations have led to a decrease in landings,  hindering the profitability of shoreside infrastructure. In other  cases, soaring land values and rising taxes have made the current use  of commercial land unprofitable. Property is being sold and quickly  converted into private spaces, which means that they are no longer  available to support our fisheries.   While this trend has been happening for decades--in 2006, Maine's  working waterfront only took up 20 miles of Maine's nearly 3,500 miles  of coastline--the recent demand for coastal properties has intensified  this problem in Maine. We can help preserve these areas for the next  generation of fishermen, boatbuilders, and maritime workers with  dedicated investments. Currently, the primary mechanism for preserving  Maine's waterfronts is through a State-run program called the Working  Waterfront Access Protection Program. Since 2008, that program has  helped preserve 34 waterfront properties. The legislation I am  introducing today would help scale up that model program so that more  communities can be assisted.   There is currently no targeted, Federal assistance program to help  the commercial fishing industry and other maritime sectors gain or  preserve access to working waterfront areas. The Working Waterfront  Preservation Act would create a $20 million program to help municipal  and State governments, nonprofit organizations, and participants in  maritime industries improve working waterfront property in our coastal  States. Grants would be administered by the Economic Development  Administration, and successful applicants would need to be endorsed by  State fisheries agencies, which have the local expertise to understand  the needs of each coastal State. In order to be eligible for a grant,  recipients would be required to permanently protect an area as working  waterfront, to ensure that it can be used for commercial purposes for  decades to come, and to invest in the cost themselves.   This legislation is crucial for the continued prosperity of coastal  communities across the country. I urge my colleagues to join Senator  Reed and me in supporting this important legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mr. Van Hollen, Mr. Sanders, Mr.          Cardin, Mrs. Murray, and Ms. Warren):   S. 3194. A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to achieve  parity between the cost-of-living adjustment with respect to an annuity  under the Federal Employees Retirement System and an annuity under the  Civil Service Retirement System, and for other purposes; to the  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
