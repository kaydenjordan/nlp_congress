 Mr. President. As the opioid epidemic continues to  challenge the Nation, the statistics on this public health crisis show  the toll it is taking on communities across the country. In Virginia in  2016, there were over 1,400 deaths from overdoses, a 38 percent  increase over 2015. Eighty percent of these deaths involved opioid use.  Opioid overdoses are now the leading cause of accidental death in  Virginia, surpassing car accidents and gun violence.   While we must focus on prevention and treatment to stem the tide of  addiction and overdose deaths, it is also critical that our efforts  include helping people recover from addiction and return to their  families, the workforce, and their lives. That includes improved access  and oversight Medication Assisted Treatment, wraparound services like  peer recovery supports, and ensuring that ``recovery residences'' are  safe.   After treatment, many people in the early recovery stages choose to  enter recovery residences. These facilities give people a stable and  sober environment as they transition back into society. While these  residences are growing in number due to the epidemic, we are learning  that these facilities often lack oversight or regulation. There have  been deaths at recovery residences due to the lack of trained  professionals and standards.   Currently, no national standards or guidelines are in place to ensure  that recovery homes are providing a safe environment. This situation  leaves families and victims in the dark about whether the facility that  is looking after their loved one is qualified. The bill I am  introducing today would authorize the Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration (SAMHSA) to develop best practices for recovery  living facilities. It would also authorize SAMHSA to provide technical  assistance and support to States willing to adopt best practices.  Additionally, the bill would require States that use SAMHSA grants for  recovery residences to meet established best practices, direct SAMHSA  to provide best practice information directly to patients and ensure  that SAMHSA consults with other relevant Federal agencies on drafting  guidelines.   I would like to thank Senator Warren and our other cosponsors for  working on this legislation, and Congresswoman Chu for championing  legislation on this topic in the House.                            ____________________     Mr. President.
