 Mr. Speaker, I was not present for one rollcall vote. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``no'' on rollcall vote 705, H.J. Res.  88--Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5,  United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of  Education relating to ``Improving Income Driven Repayment for the  William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program and the Federal Family  Education Loan (FFEL) Program.                            ____________________
