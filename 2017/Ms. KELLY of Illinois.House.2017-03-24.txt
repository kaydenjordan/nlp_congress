 Mr. Speaker: ``Of all the forms of inequality,  injustice in healthcare is the most shocking and inhumane.''   Dr. King spoke these words because the health of our fellow Americans  is a moral imperative. What we have before us today is a morally  corrupt bill: morally corrupt because it claws away health insurance  from 24 million Americans, morally corrupt because it leaves nearly 1  million of my fellow Illinoisans without health insurance, morally  corrupt because 240,000 Illinois kids will no longer have the safety  and security of their current coverage.   When you cast your vote today, know that you own its aftermath here,  forward. Will you cast your vote for party or will you cast your vote  to do what is best in the lives of the people you represent?   Think of the last senior whose hand you shook at a townhall. Think of  the last child you hugged at a school visit. Does this bill do right by  them? Will they be better off?   If you have any doubt, vote ``no.'' Vote ``no,'' and kill this bad  bill.
