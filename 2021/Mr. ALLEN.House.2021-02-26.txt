 Mr. Speaker, here we go again. I am disappointed to say  that my Democrat colleagues refuse to negotiate on legislation to  provide targeted, temporary COVID-19 relief to the American people.   Let's be clear. Only 9 percent of this $1.9 trillion package being  advanced goes toward pandemic-related expenses, and it is riddled with  partisan priorities unrelated to the pandemic, including a $15 minimum  wage requirement that will destroy 1.4 million starting jobs; $350  billion in blue State bailouts while leaving behind States like  Georgia; funding for a Silicon Valley underground tunnel; and much  more.   Throughout this whole process, my Democrat colleagues have rejected  prioritizing reopening our schools, despite the CDC stating that  schools can safely reopen with proper precautions. Some of our students  haven't seen the inside of a classroom in a year. But partisan  priorities are apparently more important.   Let's not forget that nearly $1 trillion remains unspent from  previous relief packages. So let's stop calling it COVID relief when  this package is clearly just a payout to Progressive priorities.   It is time to end this nonsense because the American people are no  longer fooled.                            ____________________
