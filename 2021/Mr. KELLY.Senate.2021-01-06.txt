 Mr. President. In America, we have fair elections and  peaceful transitions of power. In America, democracy prevails over  chaos. And in America, those who commit violent acts against our  government are held accountable. These are the values that I served to  defend in the U.S. Navy and that I have sworn an oath to uphold in the  Senate, and they have not failed us.   Our democracy was tested today--first, by a baseless objection to  Arizona's electoral votes, despite the fact that Arizona's elections  were fairly administered and certified by a Republican Governor, a  Democratic Secretary of state, and public servants at every level of  government and representing both political parties; and then again when  individuals, spurred on by the President, stormed the Capitol in an  unpatriotic attempt to overturn our election. They will fail. Tonight  we will count Arizona's electoral votes and those of every other State.   For centuries, our democracy has thrived because after elections we  have come together to find common ground and solve our challenges, and  that is the work we begin tonight. My focus will continue to be on  representing Arizonans by working with Republicans and Democrats and  the incoming administration to beat this virus and rebuild our economy.
