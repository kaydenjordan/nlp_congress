 Madam Speaker, I have written remarks here, but after  what I just heard, I have got to change what I was going to share.   The idea that you could oppose this bill under the ruse that it helps  children and mothers is absolutely preposterous. The reason that we  need this bill is because, yes, we did pass legislation in 2002 saying  that a baby, if they are born during an abortion procedure, deserves  life, but the problem is it is not being followed.   You can go out in the hall and visit with some nurses who have come  here who have experienced the traumatic trauma of witnessing a baby  born and then being put in a plastic bag and suffocated to death.   You can visit with the nurses that I have met who found a baby in a  soiled closet who was born alive and was put there to die.   You can visit with a young mother named Angelee who unexpectedly gave  birth to a baby boy in the restroom of an abortion clinic, and once she  saw that baby, Angelee changed her mind. She wanted it to live. It was  there. And her friend called the paramedics, but the clinic staff  turned the medical team away, denying lifesaving care for Angelee's  baby. The little baby died in the mother's arms as she rocked it and  comforted it, showering it with love.   The reason this bill is needed is because it puts penalties on those  healthcare officials who refuse to provide medical care, refuse to  follow the law that you state you support. And so if you truly support  life, if you support these babies, if you support the mother, then put  some teeth in this legislation and make sure it is followed.   Madam Speaker, I urge everyone here to support it.
