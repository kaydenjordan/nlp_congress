 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the  historic first class of medical students to graduate from the Kirk  Kerkorian School of Medicine at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.   Four years ago, the 50 students of this inaugural class donned their  white coats, pledged their formal oaths, and began their lifelong  medical journeys.   But for southern Nevada, this was more than your average first day of  school. Nevada has consistently ranked among the lowest rates in  doctors per capita; and before this class, Las Vegas was the largest  metro area in the Nation without a medical school capable of bestowing  M.D. degrees.   These graduates are pioneers in providing for the health of our  community, and their dedication to home is clear. Ninety-seven percent  of this class hails from the Battle Born State, and well over one-third  of the graduates will stay right here to continue their education.   We cannot thank them enough for their dedication to the health of our  community, especially in the midst of this pandemic.   Congratulations to the UNLV Medical graduates.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Congresswoman  Demings for her leadership and for leading this tribute to all of our  police officers across this country during National Police Week.   I would like to take this moment to recognize our Nevada officers who  have fallen. In particular, I want to honor two officers who we lost in  this past year alone.   We remember Lieutenant Erik Lloyd, a 30-year veteran of the Las Vegas  Metropolitan Police Department.   Every day during this pandemic, our men and women have stepped up to  serve in the line of duty, no matter the danger. We honor their  commitment in a time of uncertainty.   And we mourn the loss of Lieutenant Lloyd, who contracted COVID-19  while on the job. Lieutenant Lloyd was the definition of selfless. He  went to work every single day to protect his community. And on top of  that, he went above and beyond, becoming the president of the Injured  Police Officers Fund. In that role, Lloyd raised funds for the care of  countless officers, including Metro Officer Shay Mikalonis, who was  left paralyzed after being shot this summer during a demonstration on  the Las Vegas Strip.   We also take this time to recognize Sergeant Benjamin Michael  Jenkins, a military veteran, firefighter, and EMT officer with the  Nevada Highway Patrol. Sergeant Jenkins was dedicated to reducing  impaired driving and fatal crashes. In 2011, he was honored with the  Department of Public Safety's highest honor, the Gold Medal of Valor,  after he came under fire during a domestic-related shooting in Wells,  Nevada.  [[Page H2252]]    His life, unfortunately, was cut short when he was shot and killed  while checking on a driver pulled over on a remote stretch of U.S.  Highway 93, just north of Ely.   Their service to Nevada is incomparable.   To their friends, families, and fellow officers, I extend my deepest  sympathies and prayers. Nevada stands with you. I express my extreme  gratitude for the safety and dedication to service that Lieutenant  Lloyd and Sergeant Jenkins, along with all other officers, have brought  to our communities.
