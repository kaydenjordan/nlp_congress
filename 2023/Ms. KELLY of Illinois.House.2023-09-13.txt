 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hoyer for his  leadership, and I am a very proud member of the Regional Leadership  Council, Region 4.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge one of the largest public  health threats facing our Nation. Our Nation's children are returning  to school and all they should be worried about is acing their next  test. Instead, too many children live in fear of the constant threat of  gun violence.    Gun violence does not need to occur inside a  school to harm our children. The stress from living in a community  impacted by gun violence has been proven to lower test scores and  increase mental health conditions like anxiety and PTSD.   Just last week, I was in a place called Danville in the central  Illinois part of my district with 25 young people. The stories I heard  were devastating. One young man talked about how two brothers and his  father were killed because of gun violence.   Just last week alone, there were 42 shootings in Chicago--a 15-year- old was shot in a park, a 14-year-old was shot while he was riding in a  car, and an 8-year-old--think about that, 8 years old--was shot just  walking on a sidewalk.   I am so happy that Congress has begun to make progress to combat this  public health crisis. We got the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act done,  the first time in 30 years that Congress took meaningful action on gun  violence.   On August 31, Attorney General Merrick Garland directed the ATF to  comply with the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act's licensing  requirements for gun sellers. We have made progress, but there is so  much more to do.   Democrats are prepared to take these next steps. The American people,  young people, are asking us to deliver. We put people over politics  when we passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. We can and must do  more. We cannot afford to wait.
