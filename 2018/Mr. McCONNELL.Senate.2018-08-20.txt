 Mr. President, last week the Senate turned to a  critically important pair of appropriations bills--those which  encompass the Departments of Defense, Labor, Health and Human Services,  and Education. And we proceeded to this legislation by unanimous  consent. That may seem like a small detail in the scheme of things, but  it underscores a fact that should be a real source of pride for this  Senate: Bill by bill, we are rebuilding a regular process for  responsibly appropriating taxpayers' money. We are achieving what we  set out to do, and we are doing it together.   Because of the leadership of Chairman Shelby, Senator Leahy, and our  subcommittee chairs and ranking members, all 12 appropriations bills  for this fiscal year were reported out prior to the July 4th recess.  The process was so bipartisan that, cumulatively across all 12 bills,  the committee votes were 363 to 9.   Here on the floor, we have already approved--with bipartisan  support--measures to fund Energy and Water Development, Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, Transportation, Housing and Urban  Development, Interior, Environment, Agriculture, and other priorities.   We have had a normal committee process. We have had amendment votes  here on the floor of the Senate. We have considered these bills  thoroughly but efficiently and then passed each of them with bipartisan  majorities. That is exactly the momentum we need to keep up right now.   The legislation now before us will be a major milestone. It addresses  vital priorities: a pay raise for our troops, plus funding for their  missions and work to restore combat readiness, training programs for  American workers, and new tools for combating the opioid epidemic.  These bills will bring billions of dollars and resources and relief to  the families and communities that are fighting every day against the  crisis of drug abuse and addiction that has inflicted so much pain on  our country. I will have more to say this week  [[Page S5706]]  on the important things this legislation will accomplish, but first I  want to pause and take stock of our progress.   When we finish and pass the legislation before us, we will have  approved 9 of the 12 bills to appropriate money for the government.  Together, they will account for more than 87 percent of the  discretionary spending for next year, and it will be the first time in  15 years that the Senate will have passed the Labor-HHS-Education  appropriations bill before the start of the fiscal year.   I am glad we will be voting on a pair of amendments later this  afternoon, and I hope that, with consent, we will be able to vote on  more amendments this week. Then I will look forward to passing this  legislation for our servicemembers and for middle-class families across  our country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on another matter, if I sound like  a broken record discussing the pro-growth, pro-worker trend in our  Nation's economy, it is because the headlines continue to roll in  faster than I can relate them.   Here is one headline from last week: ``Small-business confidence hits  another record high.'' And one industry survey reports more optimism  among small business owners this month than at any time in the past 35  years.   Another headline: ``U.S. jobless claims fall for a second straight  week.'' That one comes not long after the number of Americans filing  for unemployment benefits hit a 49-year low last month.   And another: ``U.S. retail sales increase strongly in July.'' In  fact, they are up 6.4 percent over 1 year ago.   An economy that is expanding, bringing more people into the  workforce, and encouraging investment at all levels--reports like these  are exactly what Republicans had in mind when we began implementing our  pro-growth, pro-opportunity agenda last year.   But while we worked to pass the historic tax reform and regulatory  reforms that are helping create these conditions, our Democratic  colleagues offered up a different set of predictions. They shared our  belief that 2018 would be a headline-making year for the U.S. economy,  but they insisted the headlines would be catastrophic. The House  Democratic leader talked about ``Armageddon.'' My friend, the Senate  Democratic leader, proclaimed that ``nothing''--nothing--in tax reform  was ``suited to the needs of the American worker.''   I don't think I have heard my friends revisit those arguments  recently.   I haven't heard too many Democrats eager to remind middle-class  American families and small business owners that every single Democrat  in the House and in the Senate tried to kill their tax cuts with  completely partisan opposition.   But Republicans were undeterred. We pressed on and got tax reform and  so many other pro-growth policies accomplished for the American people.   And now, unlike our friends across the aisle, we are talking about  these victories practically every day. American enterprise, American  ingenuity, and the talent and work ethic of our people are what made  these headlines happen. Republicans are just proud we could play a part  by getting Washington's foot off the brake and leaving them more free  to build their lives and pursue their happiness.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following amendments be called up en bloc and reported by number:  Nelson No. 3773, Kennedy No. 3703. I further ask consent that at 12:10  p.m. on Tuesday, August 21, the Senate vote in relation to the  amendments in the order listed and that there be no second-degree  amendments in order to the amendments prior to the votes.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session for the consideration of Calendar Nos.  1033 through 1038; that the nominations be confirmed, the motions to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order; that  any statements related to the nominations be printed in the Record;  that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and  the Senate then resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, the Commonwealth of Kentucky recently  lost a remarkable man and a longtime public servant, Earl Fields. At  the age of 96, Earl passed away earlier this month. My friend and  fellow Kentuckian, Congressman Hal Rogers, called Earl, ``one of our  region's greatest treasures.'' I couldn't agree more, and today it is  my privilege to honor his memory.   A member of the Greatest Generation, Earl left his position as a  school teacher in 1942 to join the U.S. Navy. During his 4 years of  service aboard the U.S.S. Nicholson, Earl served in 10 major conflicts  and engaged both German and Japanese enemy forces. As a Navy radioman,  he was tasked with copying incoming coded messages. Among his many  experiences during his service, Earl remembered receiving the fateful  news of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's death in 1945.   After the war, Earl returned home and married Gloria, the love of his  life. Together, they raised six children and built a life together in  eastern Kentucky. In subsequent years, Earl once again felt called to  public service, and he ran to become the Leslie County clerk. He won  his race and served his community in the role for 24 years.   When Earl left the clerk's office, he moved to Laurel County to enjoy  his retirement. That doesn't mean he slowed down, however. Earl kept a  number of hobbies, including hunting, fishing, and beekeeping,  throughout the rest of his life.   Elaine and I would like to extend our condolences to Earl's wonderful  family and his many devoted friends. His life impacted our country and  so many communities in eastern Kentucky, and he will surely be missed.  I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in remembering the life of a  great man, Earl Fields.  [[Page S5714]]                                ____________________     Mr. President, for two decades, Representative Marie  Rader from Mckee was a powerful voice for her constituents in  Kentucky's House of Representatives. It is my privilege today to pay  tribute to a dedicated public servant and a dear friend who retired  from her legislative career at the end of last year.   A graduate of Berea College in Madison County, Marie was a passionate  advocate for the causes important to Kentuckians, and she spent her  career helping guide the public policies of our State. As the chair of  house transportation committee, she proved her leadership for Kentucky  and was a strong supporter of our Commonwealth's infrastructure, Her  work to encourage economic development provided a wonderful service to  Marie's constituents and to families throughout our State.   Even after her retirement from the general assembly last year, Marie  has continued to remain active in the Jackson County community. She  serves as the executive director of the public housing authority and  employs her many talents with the Jackson County Development  Association and the Jackson County Industrial Authority. Earlier this  year, she helped organize a Memorial Day event to honor the service and  sacrifice of local Vietnam veterans. The community gathered to  celebrate more than 100 brave Kentuckians, and Marie was crucial to  making the event a success. Her selfless work for the residents of  Jackson County and the Commonwealth continues to inspire others.   When the Kentucky State House came into session at the beginning of  this year, its members recognized the absence of their former colleague  with gratitude and respect. Representative Robert Goforth, Marie's  successor, sponsored a resolution honoring her lasting impact in that  body and throughout Kentucky. It is my privilege today to join with the  members of the Kentucky State House in sharing those sentiments and  wishing her a wonderful retirement. I urge each of my Senate colleagues  to help me honor Marie Rader, a remarkable individual and my friend.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as we continue to discuss the farm  bill, I would like to take a moment to congratulate a prominent member  of the agricultural community in northeastern Kentucky. Hinton Mills in  Fleming County is a family-owned and operated business celebrating 100  years of serving farm communities in our State.   Founded in 1918 by Frank L. Hinton in Goddard, KY, Hinton Mills began  as a small general store for the rural community and was the first  retailer in the area to recognize the need for a one-stop, full-service  farm supply store. Since its doors opened, it has grown and transformed  into a major feed supplier in the area. Under the family's constant  care, Hinton Mills continued to expand and today has five locations in  three counties. They also make deliveries to farm families in Kentucky  and Ohio, providing important services to communities throughout the  region.   Today, the family business is led by Bud Hinton of the third  generation. As the president and CEO, Bud has reaffirmed Hinton Mills'  commitment to the many small towns and rural communities it serves.   Continuing the tradition in the family, Bud's three sons joined the  business and are currently vice presidents. Representing the fourth  generation, Matt, Adam, and Nathan were all raised in Fleming County,  and each of them brings unique skills and experiences to Hinton Mills.  They are helping Frank Hinton's business and legacy  [[Page S5715]]  continue to thrive. For example, Matt brings a manufacturing background  and has received his MBA. In 2015, Adam became Kentucky's first  graduate of the American Farm Bureau Federation's Partners in  Agricultural Leadership program, which is a national training program  for advocates of agriculture. Nathan joined the family business  directly out of college, earning a wealth of institutional knowledge.  Their new perspectives help Hinton Mills embrace innovation as a way to  better serve its customers, but they also maintain the bedrock  traditions on which the company was built.   During its centennial celebration, Hinton Mills will showcase both  its history and its potential for the future. Hosting 2 days of events,  the family has invited members of the community to join them at their  Plummers Landing location to visit exhibitions commemorating their  company's history, while enjoying kids' games and even a cane pole  fishing tournament. On the second day, they will host a tractor parade  and a 1918-themed fair to reflect on how far they have come and to  signal hope for their future. To top it off, the night will conclude  with a fireworks spectacle. I think these festivities are a perfect way  to mark 100 years of serving Kentucky farm communities.   I am honored to call the Hinton family my friends, and I admire their  remarkable success in Kentucky. Our home State has a rich heritage of  agriculture, and family-owned businesses like Hinton Mills are a great  example of that tradition. It is my pleasure to congratulate the Hinton  family on their many successes and to express my gratitude for all they  do for Kentucky's farm communities. As they celebrate their centennial,  I would like to wish them all the best, and I urge my Senate colleagues  to join me.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  August 21; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed, and that following leader remarks,  the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 6157; further, that the Senate  recess, following disposition of the Kennedy amendment, until 2:15 to  allow for the weekly caucus meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:34 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, August 21, 2018, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
