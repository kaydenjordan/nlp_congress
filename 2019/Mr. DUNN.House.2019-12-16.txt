 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. James Horace  Montgomery of Lake City, Florida, who I am sad to say recently passed  away at the age of 86.   Mr. Montgomery, affectionately known as ``Mr. Mont,'' graduated from  Columbia High School in 1951 and would later teach at several schools  in Lake City, including the high school he graduated from and Florida  Gateway College. He dedicated 60 years in all to educating our youth  and was a role model to every student with whom he crossed paths.   Mr. Montgomery also devoted much of his life to the First  Presbyterian Church, singing in the choir for over 50 years. He was an  Eagle Scout, served as a county commissioner for 28 years, and was on  the North Florida Regional Council for 27 years.   Mr. Mont will be missed by his entire community, but his legacy and  the impact that he made will never be forgotten.   Madam Speaker, please join me in recognizing and honoring the life of  Mr. Montgomery.                            ____________________
