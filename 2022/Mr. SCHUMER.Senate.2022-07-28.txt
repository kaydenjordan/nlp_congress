 I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Leahy), and the Senator from West  Virginia (Mr. Manchin) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination:  Calendar No. 1063, David Pressman, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and  Plenipotentiary of the United States of America to Hungary; that the  Senate vote on the nomination at 1:45 p.m. today, without any  intervening action or debate; that, if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that any  statements related to the nomination be printed in the Record; that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action; further, that  the July 19, 2022, order with respect to the Milstein nomination remain  in effect.    I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Ms.  Duckworth), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin), the Senator from  Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Manchin), and  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 1068.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Finally, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory  quorum call for the cloture motion filed today, July 28, be waived.    I yield the floor.    Madam President, it has been a momentous 24 hours here  in the Congress.   A legislative one-two punch that the American people rarely see. A  little while ago, the House voted to approve the largest investment in  decades to lower costs, increase manufacturing, invest in science, and  help fix the semiconductor crisis. The CHIPS and Science bill now goes  to the President's desk after 3 long years.   And, last night, Senator Manchin and I announced an agreement on the  Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, a bill that will take historic steps  to lower costs, fight climate change, and make healthcare more  affordable in this country.   Again, the past 24 hours have been a legislative one-two punch that  Americans rarely ever see and which will benefit them immensely: first,  a bill that will supercharge the American industry and now a bill that  will fight inflation and mark a turning point in our fight against  climate change.   This morning, I met with my Democratic colleagues to review the big  wins contained in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and we discussed  our plan for passing it through reconciliation next week.   With the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, this Senate majority will  finally take on Big Pharma and lower prescription drug prices.   This Senate Democratic majority will tackle the climate crisis with  the largest package on the climate ever. This Senate majority will  ensure we close tax loopholes and make the wealthy corporations and  individuals pay their fair share, and this Senate Democratic majority  will fight inflation and reduce the deficit.   The Inflation Reduction Act is common sense; it is bold; and it is  very much needed. For decades, many in Washington have promised to  address these challenges. But where previous efforts have fallen short,  Senate Democrats in this majority will move swiftly to deliver to the  American people.   Now, there is so much to like in the Inflation Reduction Act. By a  wide margin, this legislation will be the largest action on climate  change ever passed by the Congress.   Like the creation of the EPA and the passage of the Clean Air Act  half a century ago, this legislation will mark a turning point in our  Nation's commitment to protect our planet for our children and our  grandchildren.   Through this bill, we will at last put the United States on a path to  roughly 40 percent emission reductions by 2030. And it will help us  achieve climate justice for communities long left behind, especially  communities of color. But that is not all, for many years, people in  Washington--including President Trump, including the Republican  Senate--promised to lower the cost of prescription drugs, but they  failed to follow through.   Under this Senate Democratic majority, that is changing. Our proposal  will finally lower the cost of prescription drugs by empowering  Medicare--for the first time ever--to negotiate the prices of certain  drugs in Part B and Part D.   We will prevent healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for millions of  Americans in the coming months. And through it all, we will ensure that  no small business or family making under $400,000 a year will see their  taxes go up.   Republicans go on and on and on about how this is a tax on the  American people. No, Republicans, you try to hide the truth. The truth  is this bill will close tax loopholes exploited by the wealthiest  Americans and largest corporations and will not touch Americans who  make below $400,000 a year. Why don't you say that? Because you know  your tax policies are so unpopular with the American people, which we  proved in 2017. You tried the same shibboleth then. Oh, we are cutting  taxes for the American people. We Democrats make clear to the American  people, no, no, no, they were cutting taxes on the very wealthy. And by  the time the 2018 campaigns rolled around, they didn't even mention it.  We are going to do the same thing now. We are going to tell the truth.    Yes, we are raising taxes on very wealthy people and big corporations  that pay no money, not on average Americans, and you are afraid to do  that.   The American people want these tax reforms. They support making sure  the ultrarich and big corporations play by the rules and pay their fair  share. It is common sense. The American people know that.   So when Republicans fret and panic about taxes, the truth is what  they really hate is the idea of increasing taxes on Big Business and  those at the very top.   And they are afraid to admit to the American people that they know  they are on the wrong side of the issue. As I said, Republicans should  have learned their lesson in 2018 when the American people rejected  their tax cuts for rich Americans.   We all saw what the results are, what happens when Republicans cut  taxes for the ultrarich and corporations: It  [[Page S3773]]  fuels hundreds of billions in corporate stock buybacks, and since then,  stock buybacks have only increased.   According to S&P, buybacks are forecast to reach a trillion dollars  this year. The American people don't want a tax code that is skewed to  the top 1 percent, which is what happened under Republicans, under  President Trump when they had the majority.   Republicans really know that, so they, in fear--they distract and  distort and ignore the fact that under our plan, small business and  middle-class families making under 400,000 won't see their taxes go up  at all.   It is the same thing for the deficit. For years, Republicans have  howled at the Moon about lowering the Federal deficit, but when they  were in the majority, they blew a $2 trillion hole in our deficit in  order to pay for their gargantuan tax cuts to big corporations and the  ultrarich.   The Democrats' proposal will actually lower the deficit  significantly, which will go a long way to easing inflation.   If Republicans really care about fighting inflation, if they really  care about lowering the deficit as they claimed, they should support  our proposal, which would lower the deficit by hundreds of billions of  dollars.   Now, at the end of the day, the American people want us to do a few  commonsense things: Lower the cost of their daily expenses like  healthcare, protect our planet for future generations, make sure  everyone plays by the same rules and has a fair shot at achieving the  American dream, and that is what the Inflation Reduction Act will do.   These are not easy matters, but we didn't come here to do easy  things. To be sure, the work is not done. There is a lot we have to do  in the coming days, but I am proud that right now we have a strong,  bold package to move on, one that will lower inflation, fight the  climate crisis, and help preserve America's place as a nation of  immense opportunity into the 21st century.   Let us get to work and pass the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
