 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of H.R. 23  which rescinds the additional funding for the already inflated IRS. I  think we can all agree that the last thing Americans need right now is  a government who is actively working against them.   One of the most outrageous provisions in the Democrats' so-called  Inflation Reduction Act was giving the IRS 72 billion taxpayer dollars  to hire 87,000 additional agents whose job would be to stalk  transactions of everyday Americans and attack small businesses.   Middle-class Americans and the small businesses that fuel our economy  have been unable to catch a break over the last 2 years. That ends  today. There is simply no reasonable rationale to make the IRS larger  than the Pentagon, State Department, FBI, and Border Control together.   If we are adding an additional 87,000 agents, why don't we send them  to the southern border to help our border agents who are already  overwhelmed and understaffed?   I stand with my colleagues today in support of H.R. 23 to block the  intrusive and unnecessary 87,000 new IRS agents. Americans deserve a  government that will work for them, and stopping this funding is a  first step in the right direction.
