 Mr. President, the month of May is nationally  designated Military Appreciation Month, so named because, in the month  of May, we also observe Memorial Day, Military Spouse Appreciation Day,  and Armed Forces Day. Last week, my friend from the State of Oklahoma,  Mr. Inhofe, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services  Committee, organized a floor event around National Military  Appreciation Month. I would like to take a moment to lend my voice to  this significant commemoration.   In the State of Alaska we like to think of military appreciation  month as every month, military appreciation day as every day. Alaska is  proud to host more than 19,000 Active-Duty servicemembers, more than  4,600 members of the Reserve Component, and about 5,000 appropriated  funds civilians across all of the services. That number will grow  significantly as the Air Force begins the beddown of the F-35A Joint  Strike Fighter, at Eielson Air Force Base, its first F-35 operating  base in the Pacific Area of Responsibility.   At first blush, Alaska is a difficult place to serve. It is dark in  the winter, light all night in the summer, prone to temperature  extremes, and geographically distant from family. Some military  families who receive orders to Alaska are apprehensive at first, but  when they speak with other military families that have served in  Alaska, they come to understand that Alaskans treat our military  families like no other people, and the opportunity to live in Alaska,  while serving, is a once in a lifetime wonderful experience.   I could offer many examples of the ways in which Alaskans make life  wonderful for those who serve here. The one that is freshest is my mind  is the annual Military Appreciation Banquet in Fairbanks. It is one of  two that Alaskans put on each year. The Fairbanks banquet tends to  occur in May; the other major banquet is Salute to the Military in  Anchorage each February. Both attract senior military leaders as  keynote speakers. During each, the services honor outstanding members  from within their ranks and thank the community for its extraordinary  support.   I would like to speak to the history of the Fairbanks banquet for a  moment. It began 51 years ago--1968 to be exact--when Jim and Rosemary  Messer started small dinner in the home parties for friends in the  military; 1968 was a pretty controversial year in the Nation's history  with the country torn over our participation in the Vietnam conflict,  but the Messers were determined to show those who came from around the  country to serve in Alaska some love and home-cooking.   The idea quickly outgrew the confines of the Messer home, and the  Fairbanks Military Appreciation Banquet is its successor. The banquet  is held in the Carlson Center, which is the convention center for  Fairbanks. Capacity is about 600 people, and the banquet sells out  every year. Following in the Messer legacy, each community member buys  two tickets, one for themselves and another for a servicemember to host  at their table.   In addition to recognizing exemplary servicemembers, the Fairbanks  community recognizes one local individual each year who has done the  most to promote civilian-military relations with an award. That award  is named the Messer Award, in honor of the couple that inspired the  annual banquet.   This year, the keynote speaker was VADM Michael J. Dumont, U.S. Navy,  Deputy Commander of U.S. Northern Command. I am told he was a big hit.  Last year, for the 50th anniversary, we had Gen. Joseph Lengyel, U.S.  Air Force, Chief of the National Guard Bureau. We are grateful that our  senior leaders travel a great distance to celebrate the military  presence in Alaska's Interior, and I know that the participants are as  well.   This is an example of what we view as the golden contract between the  community and the military. Each year, Alaskans go out of their way in  big ways and small ones to make life for our servicemembers and their  families extremely comfortable. Each year, in the presence of a  distinguished senior leader, we break bread together to renew these  bonds.   I am proud of those who serve in Alaska and the Alaskans who serve  them, and I am proud that we observe military appreciation month every  month of the year.                            ____________________
