 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate one of my favorite  times of the year, county fair season in Kansas. This summer, all 63  counties in the big First District will host at least one county fair,  featuring FFA and 4-H livestock shows, rodeos, demolition derbies,  science demonstrations, fair food, and most importantly, people coming  together to celebrate their communities.   County fairs are special because each one is unique to that county.  Some county fairs rally volunteers to build barns for farmers in need,  some hold premium livestock auctions for 4-H and FFA members, driving  economic opportunity for those students and their futures.   Other fairs serve the world's most famous root beer floats or host  family fun nights where young and old participate in sack races and  play horseshoes. County fairs teach hard work, respect, and humility.  They are emblematic of conservative values, and it is certainly where I  learned them as a child.   Growing up in Quinter, Kansas, I attended the Gove County Fair every  year with my family. I still remember the excitement we all had when  our hard work culminated and my siblings and I entered our 4-H projects  for review. Those summers taught us lessons we still use today. Last  weekend, I found myself reliving the childhood excitement with my son,  Austin, at the Riley and Wabaunsee County Fairs.   At the Riley County Fair, 4-H members Peyton and Genayla, showed us  their market steers and purple ribbon show pigs. The joy and  satisfaction of accomplishment on their faces was proof that county  fairs serve a critical role in the lives of our youth.   At the Wabaunsee County Fair, I met with Alex Gnadt and the county  fair board. We toured their brand new livestock facility, constructed  by volunteers with donations from county agriculture businesses.  Communities rally to support county fairs because they know the  substantial impact they have on the entire community.   I plan to visit several more county fairs this summer, and I am  grateful for communities who prioritize these time-honored traditions.  If you attend a Big First county fair, you will see Kansas conservative  values on full display: hard work, responsibility, generous giving, and  positive attitudes.   You will see strong communities, strong leaders, and you will see a  bright future. I am proud to be a product of the county fair, and I  look forward to celebrating them for years to come.                            Bloatedbus Legislation     Madam Speaker, I rise today to address the partisan  appropriations bill House Democrats are forcing through Congress this  week.   With a 50/50 split in the Senate, and a margin of just a few votes  separating Democrats and Republicans in the House, American voters  clearly want Congress to work together to produce a bipartisan spending  plan. In response, Democrats have ignored the American people and  produced one of the most partisan budgets in history. Their bloatedbus  contains nearly $600 billion, a funding increase of more than 21  percent from the last fiscal year.   This bill is a progressive wish list. It boosts funding for the White  House by nearly 40 percent and the Vice President's office by 22  percent. It rewards the most liberal agencies like the EPA and IRS,  with massive budget increases, only furthering their presence in our  lives. It contains more than 1,500 earmarks, returning us to the  corrupt practice of pork barrel spending.   It contains harmful regulations to Kansas farmers and ranchers by no  longer exempting producers from greenhouse gas reporting requirements  and reverting to old regulations that decrease meat processing  capacity, further suppressing the price of live cattle.   The worst part of H.R. 4502, however, is the absence of the Hyde  amendment, a traditionally bipartisan provision protecting taxpayers  from forced financial complicity in elective abortions. In the  bloatedbus, Democrats purposely omitted the Hyde amendment, and instead  took the opportunity to voice their support for radical abortion  policies.   I cannot support legislation that mortgages the future of our  children and grandchildren. I oppose H.R. 4502, and I urge my  colleagues to do the same.                         Recognizing Katherine Thomas     Madam Speaker, lastly, I rise today to recognize and thank  Katherine Thomas for her tireless and selfless work for all Kansans.   In the last 8 years, Katherine has championed Kansas farmers and  ranchers in the Halls of Congress, working on food and agricultural  issues for several Members of the Kansas congressional delegation.   In 2018, Katherine helped usher the farm bill to completion under the  direction of Senator Pat Roberts, then Chairman of the Senate  Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee. Most recently, knowing  how important agriculture was to me, Katherine helped establish my new  congressional office and prioritize farmers and ranchers in the big  First Congressional District.   I am proud to have had Katherine on my team, and I wish her the best  of luck in her next adventure back in the Senate. Thank you, Katherine.                            ____________________
