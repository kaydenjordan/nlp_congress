 Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator from  Maryland leaves the floor, I want to thank him for his powerful  advocacy on behalf of his citizens. And I would only say ``amen'' as he  was speaking because there is so much at stake for the moms and dads  and kids and grandpas and grandmas in Michigan and Maryland. And that  is why we are on the floor speaking out so strongly and fighting so  hard to defeat a very bad proposal.   Let me start by indicating that what is being debated right now in  the House, the TrumpCare proposal, is not what President Trump  promised. It is just not what he promised. He said it would be great.  He said that people would get as good healthcare or better healthcare  and that it would cost less. We know that is simply not true.   According to a FOX News report on the increase of people who would no  longer have healthcare, be able to get medical care, be able to go to a  doctor under the new TrumpCare plan, 14 million people would lose their  healthcare, be unable to take their children to a doctor, just in the  next year, by next year. People will have to go to the emergency room  rather than a family doctor. Rather than being able to take care of a  cold or something minor for their children, chances are that it would  become something very serious before they would be able to be in a  position to take them to a doctor or, more likely, an emergency room.   We know that in the next 10 years, we are talking about 24 million  Americans--moms, dads, grandpas, grandmas, kids who would no longer be  able to see a doctor and no longer have health insurance.   TrumpCare would also cost 7 million people who have an employer right  now who is providing them health insurance so that they can get to the  doctor and care for their family--7 million people would lose the  insurance they have through their employer right now. That is not  making things better. There would be 7 million people in that  situation.   This is really a triple-whammy for middle-class families across our  country and certainly for people in Michigan. There would be higher  costs, less coverage, and more taxes.   I believe we need to join with AARP and our doctors, hospitals,  nurses, people who treat cancer, Alzheimer's, breast cancer, juvenile  diabetes, and all of the other people who care for and advocate on  behalf of loved ones or themselves, people who need to be able to see a  doctor and get healthcare coverage. We need to say no to the TrumpCare  plan that is being proposed in the House.   One thing that is really outrageous in this proposal is a senior tax  that allows insurance companies to hike up rates on older Americans. It  is right in the budget report. This is in the budget report we have now  received. They are saying that in 2026--in 10 years--a single woman or  man 64 years of age making $26,500 a year who currently pays $1,700 for  their health insurance would suddenly get a bill for $14,600. So under  this plan, that 64-year-old is going to go from $1,700 out-of-pocket to  see a doctor to get their treatments, to be able to get the care they  need, to $14,600. If you compare that to somebody who is 64 and makes  $3.7 million a year, the good news for them is that they are going to  get a $200,000 tax cut. Unbelievable. Unbelievable.   Most people in Michigan work hard every single day, get up and go to  work, maybe take a shower after work, maybe take a shower before work,  but most of the people I represent don't make $200,000 a year. Yet we  are talking about a $200,000 tax cut for multimillionaires, which is in  this proposal.   That is why the AARP, a nonpartisan organization representing  millions of people across the country, is actively working to defeat  this.   We also know that this creates what I call a voucher under Medicaid,  meaning that instead of paying for whatever nursing home care is  needed--if your mom or dad has Alzheimer's, Parkinson's disease, or  they are simply in a nursing home for a variety of reasons, right now  they get whatever care they need. There is not a cap on the amount of  care. There is not a limit on the amount of care. Under this proposal,  there would be X amount of dollars put aside for your mom or dad or  grandpa or grandma, and if the care they needed because of their  Alzheimer's disease was more than that, you would pay for it or your  elderly parent in some way would have to figure out how to pay for it.  This is outrageous.    Medicaid for families and for seniors in nursing homes has been a  critical part of making sure people can get the medical care they need.  I, frankly, celebrate today the fact that under the Medicaid expansion,  under the Affordable Care Act, 97 percent of the children in Michigan  can see a doctor. Imagine that. Ninety-seven percent of the children,  almost all of our children, can go to a family doctor. Their moms and  dads know that they are going to be able to take them to the doctor  when they get sick. I don't want to roll that back, but that is what  the TrumpCare proposal does.   We also know--because this was reported on FOX News as well--that the  new plan would add a 15- to 20-percent premium increase for individuals  starting next year--a 15- to 20-percent premium increase for  individuals starting next year at the same time as big tax cuts for  multimillionaires.   I have to say, as somebody who worked very, very hard on the women's  healthcare provisions and authored the maternity care provisions, I  find it outrageous that the TrumpCare proposal would mean that  maternity care is not covered as part of basic healthcare for women.   Prior to the Affordable Care Act being passed, only 12 percent of the  plans in Michigan--12 plans out of 100--offered maternity care. If you  tried to buy maternity care as part of the basic coverage, you would  have to get a rider. You would have to pay more.   Let's say maybe you gambled. Well, you weren't planning on getting  pregnant and you weren't sure what was going to happen, so you didn't  pay extra. Then you get pregnant. Guess what. You had a preexisting  condition, and you couldn't get insurance. We don't want to go back to  the time where being a woman was, in fact, a preexisting condition. And  speaking of preexisting conditions, this plan puts them back in the  hands of the insurance companies and creates penalties for people.   The truth is, under the Affordable Care Act, we made sure that when  you purchase insurance, it is a real plan. It is not a junk plan. You  can't get dropped when you get sick. If you have a preexisting  condition, they can't block you. If you are a woman, you don't have to  pay more. If you have a mental illness rather than a physical illness,  you don't have to pay more. If you need cancer treatments, the  insurance company can't tell your doctor how many treatments you are  going to get or how much they will pay for your treatments. Everybody  has benefited from that. Everybody who has insurance in this country  has benefited from that.   One of the most important provisions relates to preexisting  conditions, and that, in fact, is not continued, as it should be for  American families.   Finally, let me just say that while we are talking about people  paying more, getting less coverage, middle-class families paying more  in taxes, guess what. Wealthy people do not. So if you are a  multimillionaire, you are going to get big tax cuts in this provision,  and the middle-class family, the working family, is going to pay for  it. They are going to pay for it in higher premiums. They are going to  pay for it in less healthcare for their family. That is absolutely  unacceptable.   In addition to that, there is a tax break for insurance company CEOs  so that they can, in fact, get a raise up to $1 million. So in this  proposal, very wealthy people--insurance and drug companies' CEOs--are  taken care of. Vast amounts of money are put back in their pockets,  while money is taken out of yours. Absolutely unacceptable.   That is why we, as Democrats, are fighting so hard to make sure this  does not happen, is not passed, and that, in fact, we will work  together to strengthen our healthcare system.   We know there are areas where premiums are too high, copays are too  high, and we need to work together on a bipartisan basis to fix that.  But unraveling our entire system, ripping it apart, creating chaos,  more cost, less  [[Page S1792]]  ability to go to the doctor, and less medical care for people is  absolutely unacceptable.   The bottom line is that TrumpCare means more money out of your pocket  and less healthcare for you and your family. That is just wrong in the  greatest country in the world.
