 Madam Speaker, today I rise to remember the life  of a beloved member of the Davis County community. Last Wednesday, Hall  of Fame Davis County coach Dennis Anderson passed away after a battle  struggling with stage IV terminal cancer.   Dennis Anderson began his career in Davis County athletics in 1968  when he started as a physical education teacher and varsity track  coach. Under his 50 years of leadership, Mr. Anderson coached 22 State  champions and was named Regional Coach of the Year in 1979, 1980, and  1992 before being hired as the school's athletic director.   After his retirement from Davis County Schools in 2000, Mr. Anderson  spent 7 years as a zone chief at Iowa State track meets and was named  Southeast Director of the Iowa Track Officials Association.   Thank you, Dennis, for your longtime service to the Davis County  community and for making Iowa a better place through being a mentor and  role model for Iowa men and women.                            ____________________
