 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  a fellow Georgian, Charles T. Carmical, Sr.   An avid basketball player, Charles was the Georgia Player of the Year  in high school before being recruited by South Georgia College to play  basketball with them.   He continued his love of the sport through adulthood, playing for the  Golden Boys and winning the Georgia State title 12 times.   As the owner and operator of Dalton Auction Furniture Company,  Charles loved working with people and connecting them to treasures. He  was a Scoutmaster in the Boy Scouts, where he mentored hundreds of  young minds and supported 31 Scouts in reaching Eagle Scout status.   In his personal life, Charles was also an active teacher in his  church, where he served as a ruling elder, deacon, and member for over  five decades.   His friends and family described him as a gentle giant with endless  patience and a true family man, always there for those who needed him  most. He will be missed dearly.                            ____________________
