 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz  for their bipartisan work on this issue on behalf of our veterans and  our country. It is very refreshing to see bipartisanship here in this  body.   Mr. Speaker, veterans have made the incredible sacrifice for our  country. The Department of Veterans Affairs has the obligation to  ensure that they have access to high-quality and affordable health  care.   I support the aim of S. 544 to make key improvements to the Choice  Program as Congress continues to work on longer term solutions.   While I am hopeful that this bill will help eliminate the problems  and delays that veterans have experienced with the Choice Program, this  program should be the option of last resort for veterans.   In Ely, Nevada, a rural community in my district, the VA is  considering not renewing its contract with the Ely Community Clinic,  forcing veterans to rely solely on the Choice Program for access to  care. Just this week, hundreds of veterans turned out at a forum in Ely  to voice their opposition to using the Choice Program.   Closing the VA clinic in Ely will be burdensome for many veterans in  northern Nevada and central Nevada and could force them to travel  hundreds of miles to get healthcare services that they rely on. These  veterans have already fought for their country. They shouldn't have to  fight to keep their VA clinic in Ely open.   Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, but it is not enough. We owe it to  our veterans not to use the Choice Program as a crutch, but to make the  proper investments in the health care our veterans deserve.
