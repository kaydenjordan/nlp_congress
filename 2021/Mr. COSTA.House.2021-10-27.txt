 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Aristides de Sousa  Mendes, a Portuguese diplomat and hero who singlehandedly saved tens of  thousands of lives of people fleeing the Nazi persecution in 1940.   On October 19, 2021, Sousa Mendes was laid to rest in the National  Pantheon in Lisbon, Portugal.   He was proudly Portuguese and had a deep love of country, family, and  the arts. He served as the Portuguese consulate general in Bordeaux,  France, in 1940.   When Hitler launched his invasion of France on May 10, 1940, millions  of people suddenly found themselves in imminent danger from Nazi  attack.   Thousands sought visas in the consulate in Bordeaux trying to escape.  In June of 1940, Sousa Mendes issued an estimated 30,000 visas,  including to roughly 10,000 Jews fleeing for their lives with their  families, despite the Salazar regime having forbidden their diplomats  in Portugal from issuing such visas to refugees.   The Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer cited Sousa Mendes' actions as  perhaps the largest rescue action by a single individual during the  Holocaust.   As a punishment for disobeying the mandates of his country's Salazar  regime, Sousa Mendes was stripped of his job, denied a pension, and  pushed into poverty. His home was repossessed, and he suffered two  strokes before passing away in 1954.   ``I may have erred,'' he wrote, ``but if so, I did it  unintentionally, having followed the voice of my conscience, which . .  . never failed to guide me in the fulfillment of my duties, in full  awareness of my responsibilities.''   After years without recognition for his heroism, I commend the  decision to lay Sousa Mendes to rest in the National Pantheon,  celebrating his courage.   Please join me in honoring Aristides de Sousa Mendes.                            ____________________
