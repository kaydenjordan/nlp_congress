 Mr. Speaker, the failure of some Members  of the House of Representatives to condemn the global Boycott,  Divestment and Sanctions, BDS, movement that seeks to sabotage and  undermine the State of Israel is appalling to me.   Instead of empowering a movement that seeks to isolate Israel, we  should be supporting our greatest ally in the Middle East.   I have seen firsthand that BDS efforts violate the core goals of  universities, which thrive--or should thrive--on open exchange and  debate. And I reject the rationale of some Members  [[Page H7382]]  who voted against the resolution under the guise of free speech.   H. Res. 246, voted on this week, echoes many resolutions that I have  broadly supported. In February, House Republicans put forth one such  measure to reject anti-Semitism in all forms.   Astonishingly, some House Members expressed dissent during the voice  vote on this motion. However, once a recorded vote was called, the  motion passed 424-0.   This week, the majority leadership took the path of least resistance  from its far-left Members by putting on the floor another resolution to  condemn anti-Semitism but refusing to debate legislation with the teeth  necessary to push back against the hateful BDS movement.    Support of Israel has long enjoyed bipartisan consensus, and real  action against the BDS movement must be taken. I and 195 other  Republicans signed onto a discharge petition for H.R. 336, the  Strengthening America's Security in the Middle East Act, to bring this  legislation before the full House for an up-or-down vote.   H.R. 336 imposes direct and concrete penalties on the BDS movement by  allowing State and local governments to adopt laws to divest public  funds from groups or organizations that boycott Israel.   S. 1, the Senate companion to H.R. 336, passed with strong bipartisan  support, 77-23. By passing H.R. 336, this House would send a clear  message that the BDS movement's anti-Semitic messages and actions will  be met with firm consequences in the United States.   It is important that we stand in opposition to the BDS movement and  stand with our strongest ally in the Middle East.   We must reject the BDS movement with the full force of law and  continue to support Israel as the major strategic partner that this  body has long enshrined in our laws, our policy priorities, and our  hearts and minds.                            ____________________
