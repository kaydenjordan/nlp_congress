 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support impeachment.   I do so with a heavy heart and a lasting and searing memory of being  in this gallery, the people's House, right up there, fearing for my  life. And why? Because the President of the United States incited  others to be violent--a mob of insurgents in this House.       It is unacceptable. It led to the killing of five Americans. Blood is  on this House. We must do something about it.   I ask that we move from ``stopping the steal'' to healing. But  healing requires accountability, and everyone must be accountable.   I will be voting to impeach, and I urge others to vote for  impeachment.
