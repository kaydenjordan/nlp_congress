 Mr. Speaker, I rise vehemently opposed to the Democrats'  latest move in their war on American energy independence.   Today's misguided resolution calling for additional onerous  regulations from the Obama administration era to be reimposed on the  fossil fuel industry will only lead to a lack of energy security.    Just 2 years ago, the United States became the number one producer of  oil and natural gas in the world, thanks to President Trump's  administration's deregulation that allowed private energy innovators  and entrepreneurs to flourish.   I represent the Permian Basin, and let me just state for the record  that Texas does have methane regulations, a completely false accusation  that I have heard three times in this debate. Energy security is  national security. And now we risk losing our competitive edge on the  world stage with needless regulations that will hurt small and  independent producers and crush innovation; the same private innovation  that has allowed the United States to lead the way in reducing methane  emissions to a 20-year low.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation relies on affordable, reliable energy; the  same affordable, reliable energy that has raised a billion people out  of poverty in the last 10 years--a billion people out of poverty.   Today, global demand is going to continue to increase. We cannot  allow foreign adversaries, like China and Russia and others, to profit  off of our overly regulated State. Let me say again, energy security is  national security.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this  resolution and standing up for American energy independence.                                time  1015
