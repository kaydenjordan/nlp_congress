 Madam President, first, I want to thank and  congratulate our colleagues who have been working hard to secure a  bipartisan, bicameral solution to complete the appropriations process  and fund the government. It had been clear to everyone that in order to  reach an agreement, our Democratic colleagues would have to walk away  from two extreme positions that had been dictated to them presumably by  the far left--the notion that Congress shouldn't spend more than ``one  dollar'' on new border barriers and the idea that we should impose a  hard, statutory cap on ICE detainees in the interior of our country,  which would require the release of criminals into the United States.   Fortunately, our Democratic colleagues did abandon those unreasonable  positions, and the negotiations were able to move forward productively.  Last night, Chairman Shelby, Senator Leahy, and their counterparts in  the House announced they have reached an agreement in principle, which  is certainly good news. It provides new funds for miles of new border  barriers, and it completes all seven outstanding appropriations bills,  so Congress can complete a funding process for all the outstanding  parts of the Federal Government with predictability and with certainty.   I know I speak for Members on both sides of the aisle when I say that  we are grateful to our colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for  their leadership. We are eager to see them complete this work. As we  speak, our colleagues are working hard to produce legislative text. I  look forward to reviewing the full text as soon as possible and hope  the Senate can act on this legislation in short order.                            ____________________     Madam President, yesterday the Senate advanced S. 47,  the Natural Resources Management Act, and later today we will vote to  pass it. The lands bill is the product of over 100 pieces of  legislation addressing the management and preservation of some of our  Nation's most precious natural areas. It touches every State, features  the input of a wide coalition of our colleagues, and has earned the  support of a broad, diverse coalition of many advocates for public  lands, economic development, and conservation.   I am especially proud that the bill will take action on key  priorities for my own State, from protecting national monuments, to  preserving the legacy of historically Black colleges and universities,  to helping local communities fight invasive species.   The fact that we are about to push this comprehensive package across  the finish line is a credit to the dedicated efforts of Chairman  Murkowski and Ranking Member Manchin. From the outset, S. 47 has  benefitted from good-faith, bipartisan efforts at the committee level  and here on the floor. I look forward to voting to pass the bill later  this afternoon. I am going to do so enthusiastically for the people of  Kentucky and for communities across the Nation.                            ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter, last week the  House began the hearing process on Speaker Pelosi's signature bill,  H.R. 1, the Democrat Politician Protection Act. I have already touched  on several of its outlandish and problematic provisions. What I want to  do today is focus on one corner of the craziness. It is the wild idea  that what American politics today is really missing is a big taxpayer  bailout of political campaigns, attack-ad makers, and campaign  consultants.   For everyone who is now convinced they must have misheard what I just  said, let me say five of those words again: taxpayer bailout for  political campaigns.   It is really something. Democrats have spent months, if not years,  crafting this sprawling, 500-plus page Federal takeover of our  political speech and our elections. They had all the time in the world  to carefully choose each provision and tailor their political strategy,  but even after all that, my colleagues in the House Democratic  conference are so Washington-centric in their thinking and so  [[Page S1176]]  happy to tax and spend other people's money that it never occurred to  anyone that maybe the American people wouldn't love the idea of their  own tax dollars being redistributed to political campaign consultants.  It never occurred to them that the American people might not like to  have their tax money redistributed to political consultants. This is  how out of touch with taxpayers the modern Democratic Party has become.   They saw all these proposals to take the American people's tax  dollars and funnel them into more attack ads, yard signs, and telephone  calls, and thought, what a great idea. We will put that in. The  Democrat Political Protection Act would do this in several different  ways. There would be a new Washington, DC-run voucher program so that  would-be political donors could simply ask for chunks of taxpayer money  and then hand it out to the campaigns they favor. There would also be a  brandnew, sixfold matching program for certain donations. The Federal  Government would literally come in--sort of the way some businesses  match their workers' charitable contributions--and use the American  people's money to match certain campaign contributions sixfold. In  other words, millions of dollars would be available for each candidate  who comes along asking for his or her share of the taxpayer loot.   Keep in mind--this would put each taxpayer on the hook for financing  the candidates and campaigns they personally disagree with. They will  take our money and give it to people we are not for. If Democrats have  their way, citizens won't just have to sit through television  commercials railing against the candidate they plan to vote for; now  they would also have the pleasure of bankrolling the ads. You can sit  there in front of the TV screen and watch your tax dollars at work  supporting a person you are going to vote against. People are going to  love that.   When you ask Democrats why exactly they would propose something as  absolutely ludicrous as a massive, new, taxpayer-funded bailout of the  permanent political class, sometimes they make vague claims that  problems in American politics would go away if only we took more power  out of the people's hands and shipped it here to the Nation's Capital.  The evidence suggests they are dead wrong on this. Research suggests  that jurisdictions--and there are a few of them--that have matching- fund systems in many cases also have rampant corruption,  misappropriation, and waste. There are numerous examples that there is  still plenty of corruption and wrongdoing in those systems--not exactly  a surprise outcome when you centralize more money and power through  government channels.   Public financing doesn't appear to change the playing field between  challengers and incumbents in any way either. Here is how one  University of Wisconsin political scientist summed it up: ``The people  who propose these systems often oversell them.''   There are no apparent benefits, significant new costs, and they want  to stick taxpayers with the bill. This is just another one of the  Democrat Politician Protection Act's greatest hits. I will have more in  the future.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I thank the Senator from Rhode Island.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to  speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, Kentucky's rich history brings many  causes of reflection and celebration. For 200 years, Centre College has  been a premier setting for liberal arts education in Kentucky, earning  nationwide acclaim and respect. So today I would like to commemorate  the bicentennial of one of the Commonwealth's most treasured  institutions.   In 1819, the Kentucky Legislature formally established the school in  Danville, giving it a name inspired by its central geographic location.  Overseeing the school was a board of trustees filled with notable  Kentuckians, including our first Governor, Isaac Shelby, as its  chairman and Ephraim McDowell, the famed frontier surgeon who performed  the first successful ovariotomy. Construction began shortly after on  the school's first building, which was completed the next year and  stands to this day with the name ``Old Centre.'' Classes began that  fall with two professors and five pupils. With a commitment to  classical liberal arts education, the curriculum focused on topics such  as Latin, Greek, rhetoric, and logic.   Encountering financial difficulties in subsequent years, Kentucky  ceded administration of Centre to a Presbyterian denomination but the  legislature ensured that the school would remain accessible to students  and faculty of all faiths. In 1830, a new president took the reins of  the school. Twenty-seven-year-old John C. Young, a minister, teacher,  and administrator, expanded the college and helped advance it toward  distinction. At the end of his 27 years of leadership, the school  boasted a 200-plus student body, secured an endowment of more than  $100,000, and employed a renowned faculty.   Through the following decades, the school continued to grow in  excellence and impact. Although the Civil War caused a temporary drop  in the number of graduates--and the successive occupations of Old  Centre by Confederate and Union forces--Centre's commitment to its  liberal arts mission never wavered. The school had gained such great  national distinction that the president of Princeton University, also  the future President of the United States Woodrow Wilson, is said to  have remarked in 1903 that, ``There is a little college down in  Kentucky which, in her sixty years, has graduated more men who have  acquired prominence and fame than has Princeton in her 150 years.''   Centre's reputation for excellence has reached beyond the classroom.  In what the New York Times would later call ``Football's Upset of the  Century,'' the Praying Colonels scored an unlikely victory over the  top-ranked Harvard University football team in 1921. Not long after,  Centre officially became coeducational in 1926. The following decades  saw the integration of the school, the expansion of the campus to  include new buildings, and the establishment of a chapter of the  prestigious Phi Beta Kappa honor society.   One of the greatest measures of a college are the alumni it has  produced. Centre graduates can be found in a wide range of  distinguished fields, including the highest levels of the U.S.  Government. Vice Presidents John C. Breckinridge and Adlai Stevenson  both held diplomas from the school, as did Supreme Court Chief Justice  Fred Vinson and Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan. More than a  dozen U.S. Senators, scores of Congressmen, and 11 Governors have also  graduated from the school, as have leaders in business, medicine, law,  and journalism. Perhaps it was the school's history of producing Vice  Presidents and other prominent figures that led to its hosting of not  one, but two Vice Presidential debates, in 2000 and 2012.   For such an impressive milestone, Centre has planned a year of  celebratory events to mark its history and to herald its potential for  the future. With President John Roush, the faculty, staff, students,  and one of the most engaged alumni bases in the country, I am proud to  mark Centre College's bicentennial. They all deserve the Senate's  congratulations and best wishes for the future of liberal arts  education in Kentucky.
