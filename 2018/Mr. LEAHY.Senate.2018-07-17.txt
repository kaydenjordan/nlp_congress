 Mr. President, as vice chairman of the Appropriations  Committee, I want to draw the Senate's attention to the plight of civil  society leaders in Niger, where political and civil rights have been  deteriorating over the last several years. This disturbing trend  threatens the U.S.-Niger partnership and should concern each of us.   Mahamadou Issoufou was elected President of Niger in 2011 and, in the  following years, worked cooperatively with Niger's international  partners, including the United States, to make progress toward the  restoration of democratic governance in that country. Our countries  have partnered together on health, development, and humanitarian  assistance programs, and as we all know, we have suffered tragic losses  together in the fight against terrorism.   Progress toward democratic governance has been significantly eroded.  Since the run up to President Issoufou's reelection in 2016, the  government has increasingly persecuted opposition politicians,  journalists, peaceful protesters, and civil society leaders in a manner  that has undermined progress and stability in the country.   This trend has not gone unnoticed. The State Department noted in its  most recent Human Rights Report that Niger's significant human rights  issues include harsh and life-threatening prison and detention center  conditions, detention of opposition politicians, and restrictions on  freedom of assembly. In November 2017, Niger withdrew from the global  Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative after being suspended for  failing to meet good governance standards, including for its repression  of civil society.   An example of this disturbing trend involves the arrest of several  dozen civil society leaders between March and April of this year, in  connection with demonstrations against the country's new finance law.  Many of these individuals, like Ali Idrissa, the coordinator for the  Network of Organizations for Budgetary Transparency and Analysis, are  affiliated with Publish What You Pay and are advocates for transparency  and accountability of Niger's revenues in order to combat corruption.  That effort should be a shared goal in Niger. Peaceful public assembly  and calls for accountability should not result in imprisonment.   I urge the Trump administration, other donor governments, including  the EU, and the international financial institutions to hold the  government of Niger accountable for respecting its citizens' right to  freedom of expression and assembly and to join me in calling on  President Issoufou to release the detainees and to dismiss the charges  against these individuals. This is now a matter of urgency, as four  civil society leaders reportedly face jail sentences at a judgment  hearing on July 24.   Doing so would be a positive step by the government of Niger toward  proving that it is serious about upholding the values that underscore  our partnership, including to maintain its eligibility under the  recently initiated Millennium Challenge Corporation Compact. That  Compact is now subject to heightened scrutiny by the Appropriations  Committee, which provides the funding for it.  [[Page S5001]]                                ____________________
