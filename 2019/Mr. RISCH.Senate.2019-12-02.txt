 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.      Hon. James E. Risch,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.

(ii) Sec 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 13-40; Date: July       9, 2013; Military Department: Air Force.        (iii) Description: On July 9, 2013, Congress was notified       by Congressional certification transmittal number 13-40 of       the possible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export       Control Act of 16 MQ-9 Reaper Remotely Piloted Aircraft; 8       Mobile Ground Control Stations; 48 Honeywell TPE331-10T       Turboprop Engines (16 installed and 32 Spares); 24 Satellite       Earth Terminal Substations; 40 Ku Band Link-Airborne       Communication Systems; 40 General Atomics Lynx (exportable)       Synthetic Aperture Radar/Ground Moving Target Indicator (SAR/      GMTI) Systems; 40 AN/DAS-1 Multi-Spectral Targeting System       (MTS)-B; 40 Ground Data Terminals; 40 ARC-210 Radio Systems;       40 Embedded Global Positioning System/Inertial Navigation       Systems; and 48 AN/APX-119 and KIV-119 Identify Friend or Foe       (IFF) Systems. Also provided are spare and repair parts,       communication, test, and support equipment, publications and       technical documentation, airworthiness and maintenance       support, site surveys and bed down planning, personnel       training and training equipment, operational flight test,       U.S. Government and contractor technical and logistics       personnel services, and other related elements of logistics       support. The estimated total cost was $ 1.5 billion. Major       Defense Equipment (MOE) constituted $765 million of this       total.        On July 26, 2018, Congress was notified by Congressional       certification transmittal number 18-0B of the retrofit of MQ-      9s to become weapons capable, and the inclusion of 100 GBU-49       Enhanced Paveway dual mode GPS and laser guided bomb kits       comprised of MXU-650 Air Foil Group (AFG) and MAU-210       Enhanced Computer Control Group (ECCG); 200 FMU-152 fuzes;       650 AGM-114R Hellfire missiles, with active warheads; 45 AGM-      114R Hellfire training missiles, without active warhead; and       6 Hellfire Captive Air Training Missiles. The retrofit and       inclusion of MDE not enumerated in the original notification       resulted in an increase in the cost of MDE by $210 million.       The new MDE cost was $975 million. The total case value       increased to $1.71 billion.        This transmittal reports the:        1) retrofit of four (4) MQ-9A Block 1 to MQ-9A Block 5;        2) addition of four (4) MQ-9A Block 5; and        3) addition of fourteen (14) Embedded GPS/INS (EGI) with       GPS Security Devices.        The MDE cost of these items is $80 million, resulting in a       new MDE cost of $1.055 billion. The total case value will       remain $1.71 billion.        (iv) Significance: This notification is being provided as       the retrofit of the MQ-9A systems and the inclusion of MDE       items not originally notified represent an increase in       capability over what was originally notified. This equipment       will provide France's MQ-9 program with the equipment       necessary to support the capability requested.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security of the United States by       helping to improve the security of a NATO ally which       continues to be an important force for political stability       and economic progress in Western Europe.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The MQ-9A is a long-      endurance, medium altitude Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA)       that can be used for surveillance, military reconnaissance,       and targeting missions. MQ-9A is capable of performing real-      time flown under the control of a pilot in a Ground Control       Station (GCS). A data link is maintained that uplink commands       and downlink video with telemetry data. The data link can be       a Line-of-Sight (LOS) CB and communication or Beyond Line-of-      Sight (BLOS) Ku-Band Satellite Communication (SATCOM).       Aircraft can be handed off to other strategically placed       ground control stations. The MQ-9A is designed to carry 800       pounds of internal payload with maximum fuel and can carry       multiple mission payload aloft such as kinetics, Electro-      Optical/Infrared (EO/IR), Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), and       other laser target designators. Block 5 includes a redesigned       forward avionics bay, NSA Type 1 encrypted data links,       enhanced power, dual wing-tip ARC-210 radios, payload control       computer, enhanced HMI and payload control in GCS.        (vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: November 22, 2019.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today I am pleased to honor R & H Machine, Inc., located in Caldwell,  as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for December 2019.   R & H Machine's story began on a wheat farm in Washington State in  the 1950s. In an effort to supplement their income, wheat farmers Ray  and Arline Stueckle began welding and selling replacement farm  equipment made of chrome alloy, a durable material that greatly  expanded the lifecycle of farm equipment. After several decades of  growth, the family business moved its operations to Caldwell in 1978 to  better serve its clientele across the Pacific Northwest.   Today, R & H Machine is owned and operated by the Stueckles' daughter  and son-in-law, Kathy and Dave Organ. The business manufactures and  sells a product line of about 1,500 parts made from chrome alloy and  distributes thousands of farm tools across the U.S. R & H Machine  equipment is estimated to last about 15 years longer than the life of  standard equipment and three to five times longer than the life of  hard-faced equipment. Dave Organ is constantly designing and developing  new parts at the request of his customers. The Organ family prides  itself on upholding the founder's commitment to providing the farmer  the best deal possible and a superior product.   Congratulations to Dave and Kathy Organ and all of the employees at R  & H Machine, Inc., for being selected as the Idaho Small Business of  the Month for December 2019. You make our great State proud, and I look  forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
