 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 5345) to designate the Marshall Space Flight Center  of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to provide  leadership for the U.S. rocket propulsion industrial base, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5345         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``American Leadership in Space       Technology and Advanced Rocketry Act'' or the ``ALSTAR Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Non-military rocket propulsion is an enabling       technology for our Nation's future prosperous way of life.        (2) Non-military rocket propulsion technologies are       critical to national security, intelligence gathering,       communications, weather forecasting, navigation,       communications, entertainment, land use, Earth observation,       and scientific exploration.        (3) The non-military rocket propulsion industry is a source       of high-quality jobs.        (4) Multiple Federal agencies and companies are involved in       non-military rocket propulsion research, development, and       manufacturing.        (5) Integration, coordination, and cooperation would       strengthen the United States non-military rocket propulsion       industrial base.        (6) Erosion of the non-military rocket propulsion       industrial base would seriously impact national security,       space exploration potential, and economic growth.        (7) The Marshall Space Flight Center has decades of       experience working with other Government agencies and       industry partners to study and coordinate these capabilities.        (8) The Marshall Space Flight Center has made historic and       unique contributions--        (A) by bringing stakeholders together to work on non-      military rocket propulsion industrial base sustainment;        (B) of technical expertise to key studies and review       boards; and        (C) by consistently participating in interagency working       groups to address non-military rocket propulsion issues.       SEC. 3. NON-MILITARY ROCKET PROPULSION LEADERSHIP.         (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that       the Marshall Space Flight Center is the National Aeronautics       and Space Administration's lead center for non-military       rocket propulsion and is essential to sustaining and       promoting U.S. leadership in non-military rocket propulsion       and developing the next generation of non-military rocket       propulsion capabilities.        (b) Leadership in Non-military Rocket Propulsion.--The       Marshall Space Flight Center shall provide national       leadership in NASA in non-military rocket propulsion by--        (1) contributing to interagency coordination for the       preservation of critical national non-military rocket       propulsion capabilities;        (2) collaborating with industry, academia, and professional       organizations to most effectively use national capabilities       and resources;        (3) monitoring public- and private-sector non-military       rocket propulsion activities to develop and promote a strong,       healthy non-military rocket propulsion industrial base;        (4) facilitating technical solutions for existing and       emerging non-military rocket propulsion challenges;        (5) supporting the development and refinement of non-      military rocket propulsion for small satellites;        (6) evaluating and recommending, as appropriate, new non-      military rocket propulsion technologies for further       development; and        (7) providing information required by national       decisionmakers so that policies and other instruments of the       Government support the development and strengthening of the       Nation's non-military rocket propulsion capabilities       throughout the 21st century.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on H.R. 5345, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, as the Congressman for the Tennessee Valley of the State  of Alabama, I am uniquely situated to appreciate the valuable  contribution the Marshall Space Flight Center has made and continues to  make to America's rocket propulsion capabilities.   As a child growing up in Huntsville, Alabama, I well remember the  1960s as nearby Saturn V rocket engine tests shook the ground and  rattled the windows. I also remember the great pride in America I felt  the moment Neil Armstrong stepped on the Moon after leaving the Earth  on one of our Saturn V rockets.   No doubt about it, developing and improving rocket propulsion is  essential to America's leadership in space exploration and national  security.   It has been the Marshall Space Flight Center that has provided and  continues to provide the cutting-edge expertise America needs in both  solid and liquid rocket propulsion.                                time  1415    Over the last several years, Americans have witnessed a resurgence in  the rocket propulsion industry. As traditional and emerging actors move  forward, it is important that the Federal Government minimize expensive  duplication and support healthy cooperation and communication between  the private sector and the Federal Government to promote America's  robust rocket propulsion industry.   With President Trump's establishment of Space Force as an independent  branch of the military, rocket propulsion is recognized as even more  important to securing America's future than ever before because  America's military relies heavily on its space assets--global  positioning satellites being but one example--to protect our national  security.   As Congress guides America's national space policy, we must promote  the robust rocket propulsion industrial base that is essential to our  space presence.   My bill, H.R. 5345, the American Leadership in Space Technology and  Advanced Rocketry Act of 2018, commonly known as the ALSTAR Act, helps  ensure the long-term stability of the rocket propulsion industry  through better coordination and collaboration between all relevant  stakeholders, public and private.   Specifically, the ALSTAR Act formally designates Marshall Space  Flight Center as NASA's current and future lead center for rocket  propulsion.   In addition, the ALSTAR Act directs Marshall to explore, develop, and  mature new rocket propulsion technology in cooperation with partners  across and outside of government. This new emphasis, while building on  a strong foundation, helps to ensure that America remains at the  forefront of space exploration.   Mr. Speaker, in the 1940s and 1950s, voyages to the Moon were thought  impossible, but America rose to the challenge and overcame the  impossible. Today, America must, once again, challenge itself to reach  far beyond its limits.   Through our increased attention, focus, and support of utilization of  space and the exploration of deep space, we too can overcome the  impossible and help inspire the next generation of Americans to look to  the stars and go where no one has gone before.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for  time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
