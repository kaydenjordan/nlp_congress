 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  career and accomplishments of David Blom, retiring CEO of OhioHealth.   David began his career with OhioHealth in 1983. Working through  various roles in the health care system, he was named CEO of OhioHealth  in 2002.   In his first year as CEO, after several tough years with losses,  David led OhioHealth to report a $23 million profit. Over the last 17  years at the helm, he has presided over expansion in and beyond central  Ohio. OhioHealth has nearly tripled system revenue and has grown its  central Ohio market share while working to unite the culture of  multiple hospitals, outpatient sites, and physician practices.   Today, OhioHealth is a $4 billion system of 12 hospitals and more  than 200 outpatient sites. The organization has 29,000 associates,  3,600 physicians, and 3,000 volunteers across 48 counties in Ohio.   Under David's leadership, OhioHealth has become a major central Ohio  employer and economic driver.   David also cares deeply about the central Ohio community that he has  called home for so many years. He has served on the boards of the  Columbus Partnership, the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation,  and the Columbus Foundation. He was also instrumental in creating  Columbus 2020, the economic development arm for central Ohio.   Under David's leadership, OhioHealth has had a substantial positive  impact in Ohio, and I want to thank him for his service and leadership.   I wish David the best in the next chapter of his life.                            ____________________
