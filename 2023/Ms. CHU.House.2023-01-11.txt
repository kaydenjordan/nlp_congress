 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the bill before us  today.   While I strongly condemn violence and vandalism in any form, the bill  before us neglects to address the real crisis facing Americans today,  which is the loss of reproductive rights for millions of Americans in  the blink of an eye since the Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade  last summer.   Madam Speaker, 8 in 10 Americans support the legal right to abortion,  something that has been seen over and over again in poll after poll, in  election after election. This resolution is an attempt to muddy the  waters and distract the public from the fact that those on the other  side of the aisle support a national abortion ban, regardless of which  State you live in.    In fact, it was abortion providers who faced significant increases in  stalking, invasions, and assault and battery as a result of the Dobbs  decision.   I cannot support this resolution, which conveniently leaves out the  majority of the victims of this type of political violence. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``no.''    Madam Speaker, H.R. 26 would rob families of the ability to  make difficult and complicated medical decisions in some of the most  heartbreaking circumstances imaginable. It is a mean-spirited solution  in search of a problem.   If the majority is interested in caring for newborns, I invite them  to support Democrats' efforts to provide paid family leave to every new  parent. Republicans are welcome to join our efforts to expand the child  tax credit to families struggling with paying the bills. And we would  be thrilled to have bipartisan support in this Chamber to make  childcare affordable everywhere.   Alternatively, House Republicans have brought up a bill designed to  intimidate doctors and perpetuate disinformation about how abortion  care actually works.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and instead  vote ``yes'' on the motion to recommit which would bring up my bill,  the Women's Health Protection Act, legislation that would create a  Federal right to abortion care free from medically unnecessary  restrictions in all 50 States.                                time  1430
