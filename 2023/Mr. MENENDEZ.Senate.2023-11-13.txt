 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, throughout my more than 30 years in  Congress, I have pushed our Nation to stand up for human rights around  the world. Why?   Because to me it is an essential component of our foreign policy, a  hallmark of both Democratic and Republican administrations, and a  cornerstone of American leadership on the international stage.   Now, some may ask why I do this in the face of pressing global  challenges. Why speak out for what is right even when it is not  popular? It is simple. When we guard against genocide, when we prevent  ethnic cleansing, when we speak out against atrocities, we uphold  America's standing as a global force for good.   And we recognize that countries that observe the human rights of its  people are less likely to create conflict with other countries.  However, when the United States fails to carry out this responsibility,  when we turn a blind eye in order to suit other interests, then we do  irreversible damage to our moral authority and our ability to stand up  for human rights worldwide.   Moreover, we allow malign actors like China and Russia, Turkey and  Iran to fill the void and expand their influence. What I am describing  isn't some hypothetical scenario--no. In fact, it is happening right  now.   As I speak on the Senate floor, the ancient Armenian community of  Nagorno-Karabakh has been hollowed out by a brutal Azerbaijani regime,  one that is hell-bent on erasing them off of the map. For months, we  have seen this humanitarian crisis unfold in slow motion. First, it was  the Azeri blockade of the Lachin corridor, a blatant violation of the  2020 ceasefire agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan. As the only  road in and out of the Karabakh Mountains, Azerbaijan's blockade of  Lachin corridor effectively cut off the flow of people, food, medicine,  and basic supplies.   It went on for months, even as Russian peacekeeping forces-- supposedly there to enforce the ceasefire--stood idly by. In this way,  Azerbaijan's Government carried out an intention campaign of suffering  and starvation in Nagorno-Karabakh.   With the corridor blocked, shelves cleared out. Fuel shortages  prevented ambulances from responding to emergencies. Rolling blackouts  kept hospitals from performing basic procedures, and studies found out  that 1 out of every 3 deaths in the region was from malnutrition alone,  with children waiting in line for bread in order to feed family members  who were too weak to leave the house.   By July, the Azeri Government was denying even the Red Cross from  access to the region. And in blatant violation of the Geneva  Conventions, Azerbaijan began detaining medical patients who were being  transported through the corridor for treatment. Make no mistake, the  10-month Lachin corridor blockade was part of a diabolic plot to force  the Armenian enclave to submit. That isn't just my firm belief. It is  also the conclusion of the former chief prosecutor of the International  Criminal Court, Luis Moreno Ocampo.   In a report calling on the global community to recognize the blockade  as a genocide, he said:         There are no crematories and no machete attacks. Starvation       is the invisible genocide weapon. Without immediate dramatic       change, this group of Armenians will be destroyed in a few       weeks.   [[Page S5471]]     He wrote those words on August 8, over 3 months ago. What we have  seen since then has been nothing short of barbaric. On September 19,  Azerbaijan launched a full-scale invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh. The next  day, President Aliyev delivered a televised address from Baku stating  and speaking of his ``iron fist'' and declaring that ``Karabakh is  Azerbaijan.''   It was a harbinger of things to come. After quickly overwhelming  Armenian forces, the Azeri army seized control of the region and forced  the local government to capitulate at gunpoint. Azerbaijan pledged to  respect the rights of ethnic Armenians, but after decades of violence,  repression, and broken promises, those in harm's way knew better.   Of the estimated 120,000 residents in the region, which we call  Artsakh, more than 100,000 fled their ancestral homes. On-the-ground  reports of this forced exodus are brutal. Buses were packed to the rim  with refugees clinging to the very few items they could carry. Journeys  as long as 40 hours were documented on the only mountain road leading  into Armenia.   And among the exhausted and suffering Armenian refugees, nearly all  were deprived of food and medicine as they hurriedly fled their homes.  The Armenian Health Minister announced that some people, including  elderly patients, died on the journey, and it is no surprise really  when you consider the eyewitness account of a health clinic director in  the Armenian border city of Goris.   According to him, most of the patients that they treated at a health  clinic on the border were ``cases of malnourishment, dehydration,  people who'd been unable to take prescriptions because they simply  didn't have access after being on the road for two or three days.''   The clinic treated these patients as well as others suffering from  bullet wounds and broken limbs, bruises consistent with beatings, and  hundreds of cases of shrapnel injuries, some of which required  amputation.   If this is not evidence of human rights abuses, then what is? Make no  mistake, this year alone, the Armenian people have suffered through a  10-month siege, a lightning military campaign that killed hundreds of  civilians, and the forced departure of tens of thousands of residents  from their homes.   These refugees need our help, and they need it now. With temperatures  poised to drop during the brutal winter months in the mountainous  region, these newly displaced refugees will need food, shelter, warm  clothes, and essential services like healthcare.   They will need assistance as they try to pick up the pieces that were  shattered in the frantic rush to flee. And they will need long-term  support in the midst of a chronic housing crisis in Yerevan that prices  many families out of the capital city.   The United States can--and it should--fill this need with clothing  and blankets, energy assistance, and other humanitarian aid.   To those who point to the acute suffering currently going on around  the world, particularly in the Middle East, I ask you this: Should we  be in the business of picking and choosing which humanitarian crises we  respond to?   Whether it is Palestinians being used as human shields by Hamas or  Armenians forced to leave the only homes they have ever known, should  we ever ignore the human suffering of those crying out for help?    To me, it is a false choice to support aid for refugees in some  circumstances but not others. America has to continue to show up for  displaced individuals everywhere they are found, especially as we  defend human rights wherever they are violated.   Above all, we must continue to press for accountability when it comes  to those who violate human rights. Wherever assaults are launched  without warning or provocation, whether it is Russia's unprovoked war  in Ukraine, Azerbaijan's invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh, or Hamas's  barbaric terrorist attack on Israel, we have to stand with our allies  as they seek justice for victims in a way that upholds human rights and  follows the laws of war.   The eyes of the world are watching as the United States responds to  these conflicts. And as we have done so many times before, we must  leverage our position as a moral authority for good in order to deliver  necessary aid to the affected regions.   As I have said, human rights are a central tenet of our foreign  policy. We cannot afford to lose sight of that in this moment, which is  why we must continue to raise the plight of Nagorno-Karabakh in the  Halls of Congress. This cannot be a forgotten genocide as so many  others have been throughout history. We cannot lose sight of the task  at hand, which is to stand in the breach and address the Azeri threat  before it presses its advantage and seeks to seize more territory. That  is right, more territory.   President Aliyev has openly stated he would like to ``unite'' his  country with its exclave in Nakhchivan by cutting through sovereign  Armenian territory.   The potential catastrophe that that could set off cannot be  overstated. The last thing we need in this region is further conflict  between two states that share their borders with Iran and Turkey.   Therefore, I submit to my colleagues that our top priority must be to  stand in the breach and address the threats that Armenia continues to  face before tensions, again, spiral out of control. We must invoke the  language of what has happened here in terms of genocide, vowing to  never forget the horrific actions that Azerbaijan carried out in its  ruthless campaign.   I, for one, will not stop or rest until a full accounting of Azeri  atrocities is completed. I will continue to oppose any and all military  aid to Azerbaijan in light of their horrific human rights record. And  the Biden administration should not be using the waiver authority it  has to give Azerbaijan U.S. military assistance.   And I will make sure that what happened in Nagorno-Karabakh is never  forgotten by the powers that be.   Many of my colleagues will recall a previous instance when the moral  line between right and wrong was so clear. It was during our successful  effort to recognize the Armenian genocide after more than 100 years of  equivocation and denials. That resolution did not come about in a  single day. It did not come about in just one Congress. When I was a  Member of the House of Representatives, I helped introduce these  resolutions every single Congress, and when I came to the Senate, I  introduced them every single year as well until it finally passed with  overwhelming bipartisan support in December of 2019.   That victory, that long-awaited moment, was the result of years--if  not decades--of dogged advocacy until justice was finally achieved.   I will never forget then, and I will never forget now. And in this  same spirit, we cannot let this crisis fade from the memory.   In the same way that we remember the millions of Armenians who were  ruthlessly slaughtered by the Ottoman Empire, so, too, must we remember  the lives lost in Nagorno-Karabakh and the tens of thousands of  refugees who have been forced from their homes. We have to stand in  solidarity with them today, tomorrow, and every day going forward. We  must end our support for the Azeri Government that perpetuated this  assault, and we must sanction all those responsible for carrying out  these despicable crimes against humanity.   That, I believe, is the task before us in the Senate. It is a goal we  must commit to if we are to shine as a beacon of hope for oppressed  peoples around the world, to be that moral voice of clarity as it  relates to human rights.   You can't pick and choose, and so this is a moment to make sure that  we stand up for those who have had their human rights ultimately denied  as a result of the Azeri Government, who were forced out of their  historic homes and now face the challenges of a bitter winter.   We can make that bitter winter better.   I yield the floor.
