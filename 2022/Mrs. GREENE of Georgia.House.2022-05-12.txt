 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  and legacy of Road Patrol Corporal Christopher Dye.   Christopher dedicated his life to the people of Walker County and our  Nation, making the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. Christopher  worked at the Hays State Prison and the Walker County Sheriff's Office  until the tragic events of 9/11 struck our country.   In October 2001, Christopher joined the Army and dedicated the next  12 years to serving our country. Christopher was a member of the 118th  Airborne Infantry, performing tours in  [[Page H4876]]  Iraq and Afghanistan. Even after developing lymphoma, he never gave up  his post.   Christopher was highly decorated for his valiant service and returned  to the Walker County Sheriff's Office to work alongside his family.   In November 2020, Corporal Dye encountered fentanyl on a drug arrest.  This exposure caused him to suffer a massive heart attack, and he  passed away that evening. Corporal Dye was awarded the Walker County  Sheriff's Office Employee of the Year award later that year.   He is survived by his wife Kelly Jo and their five children.   Today, I am introducing a resolution honoring Corporal Dye for his  selfless sacrifice to the people of Walker County, northwest Georgia,  and the Nation.                            ____________________
