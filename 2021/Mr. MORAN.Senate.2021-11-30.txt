 Mr. President, for nearly 50 years, Roe v. Wade has been a  disaster for our country and its citizens. Sixty million unborn lives  have been lost to abortion, and our politics have been distorted by a  ruling that deprives the American citizen--the voter--of the right to  determine questions on which there is constitutional ambiguity.   The Senate confirms individuals to the judicial branch to be judges.  They are to judge, not to legislate. Listening to those whom we  represent and proposing legislation on their behalf is our job here in  the Capitol and the job of our representatives in State legislatures  throughout all 50 States. The separation of these powers is crucial to  how our democracy functions.   Yet previous iterations of the Supreme Court have seen fit to usurp  this legislative power, particularly as it relates to abortion.   In doing so, a majority of these unelected judges and Justices have  relied upon specious jurisprudence to eviscerate State laws that  protect the unborn.   You don't need to take the word of a conservative Republican from  Kansas. Writing when she was a circuit court judge, the late Ruth Bader  Ginsburg explained:         Roe v. Wade . . . invited no dialogue with legislators.       Instead, it seemed entirely to remove the ball from the       legislators' court.    One more liberal law professor acknowledged that ``Roe short- circuited the democratic deliberation that is the most reliable method  of deciding questions of competing values.''   These assessments are exactly right. The fallout of Roe, and affirmed  by Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, is obvious. A vacancy to the  Supreme Court has become a cage match--a fight here in the U.S. Senate.  Someone as eminently qualified as Amy Coney Barrett should have been  confirmed unanimously.   Today, many of my Democratic colleagues support packing the Supreme  Court with more Justices because they believe the Court will block  their agenda, which is ironic because for nearly a half century,  virtually every State ever to provide protection to unborn babies has  been foiled by the judicial branch. Something terribly wrong has  happened to our democracy when so much energy is focused on the Court.   Again, quoting then-Justice Ginsburg on Roe's attempt to put the  issue of abortion to bed, she said in 1985, the Court's ``heavy-handed  judicial intervention was difficult to justify and appears to have  provoked, not resolved, conflict'' and in 1993 declared that the ruling  ``prolonged divisiveness and deferred stable settlement of the issue.''   Given these examples of our polluted discourse, no one can reasonably  say that the politics of abortion have improved since then. In fact, it  has only gotten much worse.   What has improved, however, is our understanding of the science of  embryology. Regrettably, it is not enough to say a unique human life  begins at the moment of conception for it to receive protection. But we  know when unborn babies feel pain; we know when they can survive  outside the womb; and a remarkable 4D ultrasound reveals what we  already knew: These unborn babies are fully human and deserve the right  to life, and yet our legal regime denies them that right.   Because of Roe, a child in America can be terminated for any reason-- any reason--up to the moment of its birth. That places the United  States in the company of China and North Korea. Surely, a democracy  founded on the belief that all people ``are endowed by their Creator  with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty,  and the pursuit of Happiness'' has a greater respect for human life  than these brutal communist regimes.   Tomorrow's Mississippi case will test that proposition. However,  there is no doubt that the reversal of Roe will not end the practice of  legal abortion. Several States have already enacted permissive abortion  laws that would remain even on Roe's demise.   The point here is that my effort and the effort of my colleagues and  millions of other Americans to defend life will continue regardless of  how the Supreme Court rules in the coming months, including in my State  of Kansas. These efforts will depend on civil persuasion of our  neighbors and responsive State and Federal legislators. We will need  legislation that protects the unborn and assists new families in caring  for their child.   Tomorrow, the Supreme Court will hear the most significant abortion  case in the last 30 years. Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health  Organization. This case provides the Court the opportunity to  relinquish the legislative power it has assumed and return it to the  people and their representatives. The Court will be better for it, and  so will our politics. And most importantly of all, millions of future  voices will get to have their say in the process too.   I now yield the floor to my colleague, the Senator from Nebraska,  Senator Fischer.
