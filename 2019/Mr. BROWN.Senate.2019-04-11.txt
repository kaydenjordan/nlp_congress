 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the career of Diana  Milete. Diana has spent her life in public service and has made a  difference in the lives of tens of thousands of Ohioans.   Diana came to my congressional office when I was very first elected  to the House and has been with us ever since, through all my time in  the House and my entire 12 years in the Senate. When she retires at the  end of this month, she will have spent more than three decades in  Federal service.   Helping Ohioans is one of the most important things our office does,  and as the head of our constituent services program, her work has  touched the lives of more than 59,000 Ohioans. These were seniors  trying to navigate Federal Agencies to get the Medicare and Social  Security benefits they earned over a lifetime of work. They were  veterans and their families trying to secure medals and VA benefits.  They were Ohio workers trying to claim the tax credits they earned.   Diana went above and beyond the call of duty for so many Ohioans.   I remember 2\1/2\ years ago, right before the Fourth of July, our  office received a request for assistance from a  [[Page S2431]]  man in Cleveland named Danny Salazar, who was trying to arrange visas  for his family to visit him from the Dominican Republic. You may  recognize the name Danny Salazar--he was the Cleveland Indians' star  pitcher, and the reason he wanted his family to come visit was because  he had been selected to play in the MLB All-Star Game in San Diego.  Diana got right on the case, and, working with other members of our  team, she was able to make sure Danny's family got visa appointments in  time for the game. Danny's mother got to come watch the game with her  son, and he sent our office a picture of him and his family at Petco  Park--a picture that hung on Diana's wall.   Of course Diana's efforts weren't restricted to Major League Baseball  players. Our office helps any Ohioan who needs it, and we have received  piles of letters over the years from Ohioans writing to thank Diana for  all her hard work for them.   After Diana helped her with her Social Security claim, a woman from  Elyria wrote: ``Diana, you are an angel in disguise. You literally  saved my life and ended my despair.'' Another woman from Avon wrote to  Diana, ``Many thanks for doing the near impossible!''   Diana didn't stop with helping individual Ohioans. Over the years she  worked on several cases related to ALS patients, who faced a mandatory  waiting period of two years before they could receive disability  benefits. Tragically, ALS is a fast-progressing disease, and many  patients pass away before the 2-year waiting period is over. Diana  brought the issue to our office's attention, and our legislative staff  went to work. I joined my colleagues in the House and Senate to  introduce legislation to fix this, and we eventually got it done. We  reduced the 2-year waiting period to 5 months. This year, as Diana's  time with our office comes to a close, I have joined a bipartisan group  of colleagues to introduce legislation to eliminate the waiting period  for ALS patients all together. That is how our office works best--we  talk to Ohioans, dedicated workers in Ohio like Diana listen to their  stories and bring their issues to the attention of our office, and our  legislative staff works on a solution.   We are all going to miss Diana when she retires at the end of this  month, but she has earned a long and happy retirement spent with her  family in Lorain. Diana's impact on this office will be felt long after  she is gone. She has built one of the best casework operations in the  country, and I know her team is going to carry on Diana's legacy,  serving Ohioans with compassion and dedication for years to come.   Diana, thank you for your service to the people of Ohio.                            ____________________
