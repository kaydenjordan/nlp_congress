 Madam Speaker, I was elected to fight for the  people of my district, to challenge the way things are done here in  Washington, and make sure our government starts working for the people.  But it can't work for the people when it is not working at all.   It is not working for Christy, a hardworking air traffic controller,  veteran, and single mother of two who is terrified. When she doesn't  get her paycheck tomorrow, she won't be able to feed her kids. She  works a good job. She shouldn't be afraid of meeting her kids' basic  needs, and now she is looking for a job at night as a bartender.   It is not working for Eric, a 17-year career employee at the Federal  Aviation Agency. He wrote to me, ``As an integral part of the Nation's  air traffic control system, my focus has always been, and will always  be, on safety.''   That is true for so many of the law enforcement officials, aviation  specialists, and firefighters who are affected by this shutdown. They  are focusing on our safety, and in return, they are not receiving pay  for their work. Every day, that safety becomes more and more  compromised.   It is not working for Diane, who works for the Angeles National  Forest and lives paycheck to paycheck as almost 80 percent of this  country does. She is gearing up for the economic turmoil of not getting  a second paycheck tomorrow.   It is not working for John, who protects us, as a Federal prison  guard, from terrorists, who is now driving Uber after his shifts in  order to pay the bills.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues, the President, and our fellow  Senators to open the government right now.                            ____________________
