 DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, for the last 7\1/ 2\ years, Republicans have promised Americans something better than the  ACA. Instead, today, they are giving us something much worse.   Twenty-four million people lose their insurance? Stripping away  guaranteed benefits? Putting maternity, mental health, and pediatric  care at risk? Shame on you.   Pitting the elderly against children, the disabled, and the mentally  ill in the Medicaid program? Placing a tax penalty on veterans?  Charging a crushing age tax on 50- to 64-year-olds, forcing them to pay  five times more than what others pay? Shame on you.   This isn't a healthcare bill. This is a tax cut bill masquerading as  a healthcare bill. This bill does nothing to lower premiums, copays, or  deductibles.   You cut taxes by almost $1 trillion for corporations and the rich,  while ransacking Medicaid and the Medicare trust fund. That is  shameful.   Americans will not forget who did this to them today.
