 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4028. This is  legislation that I was proud to originally cosponsor with my good  friend, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Long).   Madam Speaker, my colleagues on this side of the aisle are leading to  secure our communications technology and supply chains with proposals  like this, which would create a whole-of-government strategy. We need  to make sure information technology supply chains are secure, and we  need to know how dependent U.S. information and communications  technology companies are on foreign countries like China.   To accomplish this goal, we must secure our communications supply  chain by enhancing communication between the government and private  sector on cybersecurity literacy and educating the public on cyber  hygiene practices.  [[Page H5661]]    We know that investment in innovation and preparation for the  security challenges of tomorrow's technologies are critical. Our Nation  has, unfortunately, seen firsthand the disruption caused by attacks on  American supply chains, critical infrastructure, and government  computer systems in recent years.   That is why H.R. 4028 is so important. This legislation would direct  the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to not  just conduct a study but would require it to come up with a real  solution to securing this critical supply chain.   This legislation would not only identify the risk but also develop a  strategy to secure supply chains for information and communications  technology. We must take our communications and technology supply chain  seriously, and this legislation would do just that.   Madam Speaker, I urge swift passage of H.R. 4028.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Jacob Davis, Jr., of Pierce County, Georgia, for his 100th birthday on  October 6.   A lifelong resident of Georgia's First Congressional District, Jacob  has devoted his life to his community and his country.   He was drafted into the United States Navy in 1943 and was stationed  in Great Lakes, Illinois. He served as a fireman on an aircraft carrier  that performed test flights for the military.   After being discharged from the military in December 1945, Jacob  returned to his family farm and married the love of his life, Jenny  Henderson.   Over Jacob's lifetime of farming, he has accumulated over 1,000 acres  of farmland. To this day, he continues his work on his pecan orchard.  If the Sun is shining, Jacob can be found outside working.   Although he has worked hard his entire life, Jacob was, and continues  to be, a devoted and loving father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.   I am proud to rise today to recognize Jacob's birthday and his  lifetime of service and leadership to Georgia's First Congressional  District.                            ____________________
