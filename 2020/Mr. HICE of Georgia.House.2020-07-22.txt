 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Walker), my good friend, for yielding to me.   There is no question that all of us who have served with John Lewis  mourn the passing of this towering figure who devoted his life to  fighting for freedom and equality.                                time  1945    An interesting perspective of his life, as a son of Alabama  sharecroppers, John Lewis demonstrated that, in America, a single  individual, even one  [[Page H3680]]  coming from the most humble of backgrounds, can have an enormous impact  in this country.   We all know that he rose to be a powerful leader in the civil rights  movement; worked very closely with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and so  many other great heroes who sacrificed their lives to ensure that  Americans of all races live in liberty in this country. But he did so  peacefully.   He once wrote this, and this has a great, powerful meaning. He said:  ``Release the need to hate, to harbor division, and the enticement of  revenge. Release all bitterness. Hold only love, only peace in your  heart, knowing that the battle of good to overcome evil is already  won.''   John Lewis knew that it was necessary to fight the sins of this  country; but he understood also to fight those in a nonviolent way.   I just have the deepest respect for John Lewis, and I am honored to  have considered him a dear friend.   I just want to thank all my colleagues this evening for joining in  this time to honor such a great man and an icon, obviously,  particularly in the civil rights movement.   My wife, Dee Dee, and I continue to pray for the Lewis family. Again,  I thank all my colleagues for joining tonight.
