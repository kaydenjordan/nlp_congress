 Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans will start  work today not knowing if they will earn enough for food, rent, or  medical bills.   Why? Because they are tipped workers who are guaranteed an hourly  minimum wage of only $2.13 plus whatever tips come their way.   Yes, $2.13 per hour. That is not a typo. Even the most frugal find it  impossible to live on $2.13 an hour plus the luck of a tip jar.   Chicago recently approved the One Fair Wage Act to address this  inequity,  [[Page H6119]]  and I commend Mayor Johnson, SEIU, and the good folks at One Fair Wage  for their leadership on this issue.   I urge my colleagues to pass the Raise the Wage Act so that every  American can earn a living wage.                            ____________________
