 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 1176 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows                                H. Res. 1176         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider the conference report to accompany the       bill (H.R. 2) to provide for the reform and continuation of       agricultural and other programs of the Department of       Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and for other purposes.       All points of order against the conference report and against       its consideration are waived. The conference report shall be       considered as read. The previous question shall be considered       as ordered on the conference report to its adoption without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate; and (2)       one motion to recommit if applicable.        Sec. 2.  The provisions of section 7 of the War Powers       Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1546) shall not apply during the       remainder of the One Hundred Fifteenth Congress to a       concurrent resolution introduced pursuant to section 5 of the       War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1544) with respect to the       Republic of Yemen.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I may  consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 1176, providing for further  consideration of a very important piece of legislation for America's  farmers and ranchers: the conference report to accompany H.R. 2, the  Agriculture and Nutrition Act, commonly referred to as the farm bill.  This rule provides that the conference report shall be considered as  read.   Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, as the House considered its version  of the farm bill, I spoke in this Chamber about a farm bill listening  tour I conducted in my own district, traveling to every county that I  represent to hear from and listen to input and the concerns from  farmers, ranchers, and producers across the State of Washington.   In the days since the House passed that bill earlier this summer,  there has been growing concern that the job would not get done and that  the 2014 farm bill would expire and our Nation's farm country would be  left without the crucial tools this legislation provides to strengthen  the farm safety net and provide certainty and flexibility to America's  farmers and ranchers.   Fortunately, with the legislation before us today, we can report that  this is not the case. After months of painstaking negotiations between  the House and the Senate conferees, we have an agreement before us.  This agreement, while not including several provisions I would have  liked to have seen, sets us on a better path for our farmers and  ranchers, for our rural communities, for small businesses, and for  consumers across the country at the grocery store and at kitchen  tables.   With this conference agreement to the farm bill, I can now go back to  my district and confidently report to my constituents that we have  provided a strong foundation to help our farmers survive a 50 percent  drop in net farm income over the past 4 years. I can go back to  Okanogan County and tell my constituents in Pateros that we have  [[Page H10116]]  strengthened market access programs and provided strong resources to  open new sources for exporting across the globe.   I can tell farmers in Grant County that we have protected crop  insurance and made several key improvements, including for whole farm  revenue coverage for specialty crop producers. I can tell dairy  producers in Yakima County that we have improved the dairy safety net  for large, mid-sized, and small dairies. I can report back to producers  in Prosser, in Benton County, who stressed the importance of  agriculture research, that we have provided an increase in funding for  research, extension, and education projects.   With the bill before us, I can let key agriculture partners in our  community like Washington State University know that we will keep  American agriculture at the forefront of innovation and productivity.  Farmers from East Wenatchee will hear from me that this farm bill  invests in critical cost-share and incentive-based programs to help  farm families improve our soil, water, and other natural resources. I  can tell farmers in Othello, in Adams County, concerned with the  regulatory burdens on their shoulders, that this legislation protects  our producers from costly, additional, and unnecessary red tape.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise today as a third-generation farmer to  say that this farm bill takes strong steps to address challenges facing  America's agricultural community. The rule we bring before the House  provides for further consideration of the conference report to H.R. 2,  the Agriculture and Nutrition Act, legislation that is critically  important to my district in central Washington, and to rural districts  across this great country.   This legislation maintains and strengthens important policies like  Price Loss Coverage, Agricultural Risk Coverage, commodity loans, Dairy  Margin Coverage, livestock disaster programs, and crop insurance. It  enhances and permanently funds the Foreign Market Development Program  and Technical Assistance for Specialty Crops, which are so vital for  export-driven agricultural economies like those in my State of  Washington.   It increases funding for land-grant universities, research, and  education, as well as special research initiatives, including for  specialty crops and organic research.   This legislation makes strides to expand quality broadband to all of  rural America by including forward-looking standards to ensure we are  meeting next-generation rural broadband needs. It also improves the  tools available to reduce forest fuel loads that increase the size and  force of catastrophic wildfires. By renewing key categorical exclusion  and expanding its purpose to allow for expedited reduction of hazardous  fuels in our forests, we can continue to reduce the threat these  wildfires pose on rural communities.   Mr. Speaker, with support from the 2014 farm bill, American farmers  have been able to combat depressed prices and severe drops in farm  income, but they would not have been able to do so without a robust  safety net in place. The conference report before us will build upon  this effort and ensure a steady food supply will be on the shelves and  in our markets for years to come.   As I mentioned, it doesn't include everything I would have liked to  have seen in this bill, but, in reality, no piece of legislation is  perfect, particularly comprehensive bills that have been negotiated for  months But the fact of the matter is, this farm bill includes important  and significant wins for American farmers and ranchers. It is now our  responsibility to get the job done.    Mr. Speaker, the people's House has more than 20 farmers, ranchers,  and producers serving in this body. Among us are a dairyman from  central California; a blueberry farmer from Maine; a rancher from South  Dakota; two rice farmers, one from California and another from  Minnesota; a cattleman from Kentucky; an almond farmer from California;  and, yes, a proud hops farmer from the Yakima Valley of Washington  State.   This is the first farm bill that I have had the opportunity to engage  in since coming to Congress, Mr. Speaker. I have spent my whole life on  the farm, and my life in public service, including serving as  Washington State's Director of the Department of Agriculture, has been  spent working on behalf of American farmers, ranchers, rural  communities, and families.   It is an honor today to bring this rule forward for the conference  report to accompany the farm bill, H.R. 2, the Agriculture and  Nutrition Act. I humbly urge my colleagues to support the rule, support  the bill, and strengthen the future for America's farmers and all those  who depend on them.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), who will expound on the importance of this  bill and how it does respond to the plights in which farmers find  themselves today and actually does give certainty to family farmers  around the country.    Mr. Speaker, we all look forward to the classified  briefing that we will be a part of tomorrow with the Department of  Defense and others to talk about the situation in Yemen. It seems  premature to make decisions regarding that issue at this present time,  but tomorrow will give us much enlightenment on the issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  Walden) to get back to the issue at hand, the farm bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Marshall).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, just let me say: Are the atrocities that are taking  place in Yemen a serious matter? Absolutely, they are.   Do they deserve to be debated and discussed to find solutions on what  we  [[Page H10121]]  can provide? Absolutely. And after tomorrow morning's briefing, if  there is something that we feel that we need to do, we can respond with  quickness, with nimbleness, and we can provide those solutions if we  think there is a necessary solution to be had.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Montana (Mr.  Gianforte).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would just like to say that my farmers and ranchers in the State of  Washington, as well as we have heard earlier from the State of Oregon,  do support the strengthening of the provisions in this bill to make  sure that the farm economy can continue on in as strong a manner as  possible, so there is widespread support in agricultural country around  the Nation for this farm bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the great State  of Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Our military is not involved in hostilities surrounding the Yemeni  civil war. As I said, tomorrow we are having a briefing that if we  learn things, we can respond with urgency and nimbleness.   To speak on this issue further, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Sessions), the chairman of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 10 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the good gentleman from  Massachusetts.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr.  King).    Mr. Speaker, I have a couple more speakers, yes.    Mr. Speaker, we have a lot of interest in this issue,  as you can tell.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Crawford).    Mr. Speaker, there is no objection from this side of  the aisle.    Mr. Speaker, I can't tell you how much gratitude I feel  to the gentleman from Massachusetts for leading in a bipartisan manner.  I appreciate that very much.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Washington  (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers), my good colleague   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, the American farmer is the  greatest antipoverty program that the world has ever seen. Certainly in  my district, agriculture is a way of life. It is our number one  industry, and getting this farm bill done this year is a top priority  for eastern Washington.   I am proud that this legislation includes important priorities around  crop insurance, expanding the Market Access Program, and ensuring  agriculture research for cutting-edge products that is done at  Washington State University and many others.   As I talk with farmers all around eastern Washington, they often  stress the importance of these priorities.   I was grateful to have the Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue,  visit and talk with the farmers of eastern Washington, as well as the  chairman of the committee, Michael Conaway, come to eastern Washington.   This legislation also includes important provisions for forestry:  better forest management on forests like the Colville National Forest,  which is in my district; expanding the Good Neighbor Authority; fixing  fire borrowing. This is all so important to healthy forests.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the farm bill  conference report.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman very much for being  gracious with his time, but, no, I have no more speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Again, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for his yielding extra  time to us to allow many of our Members to speak on this important  issue. I look forward to reciprocating at some point in the future.   Mr. Speaker, as you heard, there are a lot of wins in this bill for  rural America, especially in these extremely difficult economic times  in farm country around the United States. The 2018 farm bill will help  provide certainty for the American farmer and for the rural communities  that they support.   Families who work every day to put food on our tables deserve our  support.   Before I yield back, Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter  that was led by the American Farm Bureau that has no fewer than 489  organizations around the country, every State in the union, supporting  H.R. 2.                                                  December 12, 2018.      The Honorable,      U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: The undersigned organizations would       like to express our support for H.R. 2, the Agriculture       Improvement Act of 2018, and urge its adoption.        This farm bill supports farmers and ranchers, protects crop       insurance and conservation programs, invests in efforts to       expand foreign markets, protects animal health and       prioritizes agricultural research and rural development. This       bill is critical to providing all stakeholders, including       farmers, ranchers and consumers, with consistent policy for       the next five years as well as the sectors and industries       that rely on them.        American rural economies are struggling in the face of       successive years of declining prices, high and rising foreign       tariffs and subsidies, and the unpredictability of Mother       Nature. This farm bill helps address these and countless       other issues to ensure farmers, ranchers, and rural America       can survive these difficult times.        Your support is key to enacting this important piece of       legislation. We respectfully urge you to vote ``yes'' on H.R.       2.

Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support the  rule and the conference report to accompany H.R. 2, the Agriculture and  Nutrition Act   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 1176 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule VIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       7264) making further additional continuing appropriations for       fiscal year 2019, and for other purposes. The first reading       of the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order       against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate       shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour       equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking       minority member of the Committee on Appropriations. After       general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment       under the five-minute rule. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall       rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as       may have been adopted. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions. If the Committee of       the Whole rises and reports that it has come to no resolution       on the bill, then on the next legislative day the House       shall, immediately after the third daily order of business       under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the       Whole for further consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Cause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 7264.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule  [[Page H10127]]       [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens       the resolution to amendment and further debate.'' (Chapter       21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ``Upon rejection of       the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported       from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member       leading the opposition to the previous question, who may       offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time       for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
