SEC. 8. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.             The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, for the second time in 2 years, this House has arrived  at a turning point in the journey to adjust VA compensation policy and  finally recognize U.S. Navy sailors who were exposed to toxic  herbicides during the Vietnam war.   Congress has failed our blue water Navy veterans, plain and simple.  Those who have advocated for and participated in the process to bring  this legislation to the House floor know this history is deeply tragic.  By not granting the benefits these veterans earned more than 40 years  ago, these veterans and their survivors continue to experience  immeasurable pain, death, and grief caused by the spraying of 12.1  million gallons of highly toxic Agent Orange during the Vietnam war. It  was unjust then, and it is unjust now. But today, we have an  opportunity to right this wrong.   For Members of Congress, this fraught history comes with a  responsibility to provide compensation and care for the injury Agent  Orange exposure has caused. Though the exposures occurred primarily in  the 1960s, Congress didn't find the resolve to act until 1991, and it  left out key groups of veterans exposed to Agent Orange, effectively  denying their suffering that was a direct result of their military  service.   Today, we will right this wrong by including three additional  categories of veterans injured by Agent Orange: the blue water Navy  Vietnam veterans; the veterans who served in the Korean DMZ; and  children with spina bifida born to parents exposed during their service  in Thailand.   The Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019 is the quickest and  surest way to deliver benefits to these veterans. It is the direct  result of bipartisan efforts by Ranking Member Phil Roe and myself to  bring this to the House floor for consideration.   The 2019 version of H.R. 299 is an updated version of the act this  House passed unanimously last Congress. It follows the Federal circuit  court decision in Procopio. That case reversed VA's 1997 decision to  deny the presumption of Agent Orange exposure to veterans that served  off the shores of Vietnam.   The Procopio decision was a huge step forward, but we need more. We  need to ensure blue water Navy veterans are protected in the event  Procopio is appealed to the Supreme Court and overturned.   That is why we have worked together with veteran service  organizations to establish, without doubt, that blue water Navy  veterans are entitled to this presumption.   Our current proposal is very similar to the bill passed in the last  Congress. It includes crucial geo-coordinates that require VA to  recognize service off the shore of Vietnam when deciding claims for  disability compensation for herbicide-related diseases.   Let me repeat: This proposal is the quickest and clearest route to  delivering benefits to those deserving veterans. They have waited long  enough.   H.R. 299 has the full support of the American Legion, the Veterans of  Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, the Vietnam Veterans of  America, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and many other veteran  service organizations.   I have two letters signed by 25 of these organizations, and I  included them in the Record.                                                      May 13, 2019.      Hon. Mark Takano,      Chairman, House Veterans' Affairs Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Phil Roe,      Ranking Member, House Veterans' Affairs Committee,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Dr. Roe: As leaders       of major veterans' organizations, and on behalf of our more       than 5 million combined members, we write to offer our       strongest support for H.R. 299, the Blue Water Navy Vietnam       Veterans  [[Page H3747]]       Act and to encourage all Members of Congress to vote to       approve this legislation.        As you know, during the 115th Congress, Blue Water Navy       legislation passed the House by a vote of 382 to 0; however,       the bill was not successful in the Senate. We thank you both       for reintroducing Blue Water Navy veteran legislation in the       116th Congress and we are grateful that with your leadership       H.R. 299 was unanimously reported out of the House Veterans'       Affairs Committee on May 8, 2019.        When VA implemented the Agent Orange Act of 1991, it       determined that veterans who received the Vietnam Service       Medal, to include those who served in the waters offshore,       were exposed to Agent Orange. In 1993, a VA General Counsel       opinion held that veterans with service in the waters       offshore were exposed to Agent Orange. However, in 1997, VA       General Counsel opined that the 1996 Veterans Benefits       Improvements Act determined only veterans who physically       served in Vietnam were exposed to Agent Orange, although that       was not stated in the law.        To clarify, from 1991 to 1997 veterans with service in the       waters offshore of Vietnam were considered to have been       exposed to Agent Orange, as Congress intended. The 1997       decision to exclude Blue Water Navy veterans was not based on       medical or scientific evidence, law, or Congressional intent;       it was based on a misinterpretation.        On January 29th, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal       Circuit in Procopio v. Wilkie, overruled VA's previous       misinterpretations and determined that service in the       Republic of Vietnam includes the territorial waters within 12       nautical miles of the baseline.        H.R. 299 would fully protect Procopio's holdings that       service in the Republic of Vietnam includes the territorial       waters. The bill would use the same grid coordinates in the       legislation approved by the House last year, which would       extend beyond 12 nautical miles in some locations,       particularly the Mekong Delta.        H.R. 299 will also expand benefits for Korean DMZ veterans       who suffer from diseases and illnesses directly linked to       Agent Orange. The bill would provide an earlier date of       exposure for Vietnam Era veterans who served on the DMZ.        This legislation would also expand coverage for those       children suffering from spina bifida because of their       parents' exposure to Agent Orange while serving in Thailand       during the Vietnam War. This change would provide these       children benefits on par with those received by children of       Vietnam veterans.        For decades, tens of thousands of veterans, their families,       and survivors have been denied their earned benefits. While       it is long past due, it is time that we correct the injustice       done to Blue Water Navy veterans and provide protection of       the Procopio decision by passing H.R. 299.        We thank you for your unwavering commitment and dedication       to Blue Water Navy Vietnam veterans. We look forward to the       day when we will finally pay a long overdue debt to tens of       thousands of Blue Water Navy Vietnam veterans, their families       and survivors.

Hon. Mark Takano,      Chairman, House Veterans Affairs Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Phil Roe,      Ranking Member, House Veterans Affairs Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Roe: The National       Military and Veterans Alliance (NMVA), a non-partisan       advocacy group comprised of the undersigned military and       veteran service organizations, is pleased to offer our       support for H.R. 299. H.R. 299--The Blue Water Navy Vietnam       Veterans Act. H.R. 299 recognizes and brings relief to       veterans who, during active military, naval, or air service,       served offshore of the Republic of Vietnam during the period       beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975 by       amending Title 38 to recognize the presumption that these       veterans have been exposed to the herbicide Agent Orange,       notwithstanding that there is no record of evidence of such       disease during the period of such service.        Our organizations are all familiar with the history of       Agent Orange and its use in Vietnam. The United States spread       over 20,000,000 gallons of the potent chemical-laced       herbicide over southern Vietnam throughout the 1960's and       first part of the 1970's. These areas included coastal       regions and the areas around rivers and streams that emptied       into the South China Sea where our Blue Water Navy service       members operated.        U.S. Government-initiated studies have proven that Agent       Orange causes cancer and birth defects and there are now       numerous documented ways that ``Blue Water'' sailors, like       their ``Brown Water'' shipmates, were exposed to Agent Orange       while serving aboard ships in these contaminated areas.        One of the benefits of military service, whether in peace       or in a time of war, is the peace of mind that comes with       knowing that veterans and their families will be cared for.       Politics should, under no circumstances, ever interfere with       that peace of mind. The enactment of H.R. 299 will ensure       that the veterans and their families who have suffered from       the use of Agent Orange by the United States in Vietnam will       finally receive the care and relief they need.        NMVA is also pleased that H.R. 299 solves another inequity       by finally extending the VA Home Loan funding fee waiver to       active duty Purple Heart recipients. Currently, this waiver       is granted only to veterans with VA service-connected       disabilities, and we see absolutely no reason why combat-      wounded service members, the vast majority of whom will       almost certainly qualify for VA disability compensation upon       discharge, should be denied this significant benefit, simply       because they continue to serve in uniform.        NMVA thanks you for your leadership on these issues and       your commitment to service members, veterans, retirees and       their families. We look forward to working with you to ensure       the passage of this important legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I also want to mention the efforts we made  to pay for this bill, so it can pass the Senate this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the Congressional Budget Office  scores.                                        Congressional Budget Office,                                                   U.S. Congress,                                       Washington, DC, May 13, 2019.      Hon. Mark Takano,      Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has       prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 299, the Blue       Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we wil1 be       pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Logan       Smith.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall.        Enclosure.                    [By fiscal year, millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                             2019    2019-2024  2019-2029 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Direct Spending (Outlays)..............          0        135        -75 Revenues...............................          0          0          0 Deficit Effect.........................          0        135        -75 Spending Subject to Appropriation                0         70        191  (Outlays)............................. ------------------------------------------------------------------------         Pay-as-you-go procedures apply? Yes.        Increases on-budget deficits in any of the four consecutive       10-year periods beginning in 2030? $5 billion.        Mandate Effects:        Contains intergovernmental mandate? No.        Contains private-sector mandate? No.        The bill would:        Modify home loan programs administered by the Department of       Veterans Affairs (VA).        Increase disability compensation and expand health care for       more veterans who  [[Page H3748]]       served in the seas near Vietnam during the Vietnam War.        Provide disability compensation to certain veterans who       served near the Korea Demilitarized Zone.        Provide payments, vocational training, rehabilitation       services, and health care to the biological children of       certain veterans who served in Thailand during the Vietnam       War if those children have been diagnosed with Spina Bifida.        Estimated budgetary effects would primarily stem from:        Changes to VA's home loan programs.        Increased disability compensation and health care benefits       for certain veterans.        Areas of significant uncertainty include:        The number of veterans affected by the bill and the change       in their disability ratings.    Mr. Speaker, the decision in Procopio removed much of the  cost issues both Chambers struggled with in the last Congress. Because  we are covering more veterans than the Procopio decision, the ranking  member and I included a mechanism in the bill to cover both the  mandatory and discretionary costs. As was the case with the bill that  passed last Congress, the pay-for results from raising the current rate  of the filing fee veterans pay when applying for a home loan under the  VA mortgage guarantee program.   We are running out of time to do what is right for the blue water  Navy veterans and the survivors of those veterans we have already lost.  It is time for Congress to make our intention clear. The evidence  supports granting this presumption in favor of these veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Luria). She is my good friend and the chairwoman of the  Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee and also a  cosponsor of H.R. 299.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  say that my good friend, Congressman Courtney from Connecticut, is,  unfortunately, unable to join us to speak in support of the Blue Water  Navy Vietnam Veterans Act due to an illness. The gentleman from  Connecticut has been a steadfast advocate for the blue water Navy  veterans and the veterans in his district, and I want to express my  gratitude to him for pushing the Veterans' Affairs Committee and the  House to right this wrong and ensure veterans receive the benefits they  are owed.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  pay tribute to the late Congressman Walter B. Jones, Jr., from North  Carolina, who cosponsored H.R. 299 at the very beginning of this  Congress. It saddens me that we weren't able to pass this bipartisan  bill into law before his passing. As a former member of the North  Carolina National Guard, he would be proud to know that this bill was  being considered on the House floor today and that we will continue to  push to get this legislation passed into law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to take a moment on this historic day to recognize the effort  of former Veterans' Affairs Committee Ranking Member Tim Walz. He was a  primary mover of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act for 12 years  while he was in Congress, and I know this effort was very important to  him.   He said many times that compensating and providing care for toxic  exposures is one of the greatest challenges the Veterans' Affairs  Committee faces but that no veteran should ever have to wait more than  40 years again.   When he left, he challenged us to make sure that this pattern of  denying benefits does not continue. As chairman of this committee, I  will do what I can to meet Tim Walz's challenge.   Mr. Speaker, I know that Tim has a big smile on his face in the  Governor's mansion back in Minnesota, and I just want him to know that  he has had a big part in today's victory.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, passage of this legislation is a once-in-a-generation  opportunity to right an injustice. I urge all my colleagues to champion  this legislation, H.R. 299, as amended, so we can finally pass it into  law and get justice for these veterans.   I associate myself with the challenge that the ranking member has  made to the Senate. I would have rather they got it done by the end of  the week, but I would be perfectly happy if we get the Blue Water Navy  bill done by Memorial Day.                                time  1530    I, too, want to congratulate the hard work of my staff and your  staff, for their working together. The solidarity that our staffs had  in getting this bill to the floor, done, and tied with a ribbon and bow  was really important. I appreciate the bipartisan spirit that not only  exists between me and the gentleman, and the members of our committee,  but also the spirit of cooperation that exists with our respective  staffs.   Mr. Speaker, the Veterans' Affairs Committee is that corner of  Congress that still works. It is with great pride today that I close  out these remarks and urge my colleagues to support H.R. 299, as  amended.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
