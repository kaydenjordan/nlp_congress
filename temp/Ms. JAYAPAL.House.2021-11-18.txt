 Madam Speaker, this is an incredible day. The House will  pass the Build Back Better Act, President Biden's popular and necessary  agenda, and say to Americans everywhere: We have got your back.   Today, we say to families everywhere that we will cut your childcare  costs in half and provide universal pre-K to 3- and 4-year-olds.   Today, we are finally going to take on Big Pharma, cut the cost of  prescription drugs, and make sure that people can afford the cost of  insulin.   This bill makes the biggest Federal investment in housing in our  history and allows America to truly lead on taking on climate change,  with half a trillion dollars of investment and 40 percent of those  funds going to communities that are most disproportionately burdened by  the effects of climate change.   For the first time in 35 years, we say to immigrants: You are truly  essential, not expendable. We will protect Dreamers, TPS holders,  essential workers, and farmworkers.   I thank President Biden for his leadership. We will provide  transformative change for people across America and invest in our  competitiveness; our thriving, not surviving; and our humanity.
