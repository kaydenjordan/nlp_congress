 Mr. President, there is no question that 2020 has been a  year of challenges, difficulty, and concern. It is in these more  challenging times that it is especially important to shine a light on  those individuals and institutions that are doing good work, work that  inspires the next generation of leaders to think bigger and create a  brighter future. It is no surprise that Georgetown Law, where I earned  my law degree, is doing precisely that, living up to its timeless  motto: ``Law is but the means, justice is the end.''   This fall, Georgetown Law has offered a unique course entitled  ``Lawyers as Leaders'' for the first time. Far from a staid black  letter law class, this course is styled as a series of candid,  introspective conversations between Georgetown Law Dean William M.  Treanor and faculty members who have been prominent leaders in the law  and public service. These conversations seek to confront law students  with the pressing issues of the day--the COVID-19 pandemic, racial  injustices, the fragility of our democracy's norms, to name a few--and  give them a sense for what, as future attorneys, they can do to address  them.   In a time of unprecedented uncertainty, the course is a reminder, as  one enrolled student put it, ``that there is hope.'' Lawyers as Leaders  centers students in the values that inspired them to study the law and  reminds them of their own agency to make measurable change. It is no  wonder that over 300 students have enrolled in this course, the largest  class enrollment in Georgetown Law's 150-year history. I hope this  course is offered for many semesters to come.   I have often highlighted the achievements of Georgetown Law both on  and off the Senate floor. The education I received there was central to  my decision to dedicate my career to public service. It is exactly  courses like Lawyers as Leaders that will help encourage this and  future classes of Georgetown Law students to pursue their passions as  attorneys. Georgetown Law should be commended for offering this course  and reminding students that the law is most exciting and transformative  when it is viewed not just as a career, but as a calling.   I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Washington Post,  published on November 6, 2020, titled ``Most popular course ever at  Georgetown Law? How to fight for justice,'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the Washington Post, Nov. 6, 2020]    Most Popular Course Ever at Georgetown Law? How To Fight for Justice                             (By Susan Svrluga)         In her third year of law school, Maxine Walters expected to       have everything in place: Her job locked in, her career path       mapped out.        Then the pandemic hit, and economic uncertainty, and       protests erupted over racial justice and tensions flared over       the presidential election and transition. Her summer job with       a firm evaporated, and with it the hoped-for offer of a       permanent position by the time classes resumed for the fall.        But her school year began with an unusual class--one       created to mark Georgetown University Law Center's 150th       anniversary and shaped by the realities of 2020--that has,       for many students, upended their ideas about rigid timelines       for success, their expectations and even their aspirations.        Instead of a traditional course focused on an area of law       such as contracts or torts, the school's leaders crafted a       more personal, broad-ranging look at leadership. It was a       recognition that the tumultuous times are forcing a       reckoning, and leaving many students yearning to have an       impact.        Clearly, they touched a nerve: More than 300 upper-level       students signed up for ``Lawyers as Leaders,'' the largest       enrollment for a course in the history of Georgetown Law.        ``This is definitely a time where the ground is moving,''       said Max Lesser, a 28-year-old student from New Jersey.       ``Everyone realizes that the old paradigms of politics and       justice are kind of breaking. . . . Lawyers have a real role       to play in what path we take.''        For the online course, students submit questions about       assigned readings and then listen to a conversation between       Georgetown Law Dean William M. Treanor and a faculty member.       He asks them to talk about how to move forward to confront       ``the great issues of this terrible time.''        ``This is a time when we're all grappling with so many       crises'' and profound challenges and losses, he said.        The conversations held each Sunday--now available to all on       the school's anniversary website--have been topical, even       urgent. Students have heard from Lawrence Gostin about       health-care policy during the pandemic, such as vaccine       distribution and whether the government should mandate mask-      wearing and social distancing.        Neal Katyal, who has argued more than 40 cases before the       Supreme Court, spoke about the contested 2000 election, in       which he was co-counsel to Democratic candidate Al Gore, and       about electoral integrity this year. Randy Barnett, a       libertarian and self-described contrarian, talked about the       constitutionality of health policy, recent Supreme Court       nominees and the importance of seeking out opposing       viewpoints. And Rosa Brooks talked about her work examining       whether norms will hold fast in the aftermath of this       contentious election, or whether the country could face a       constitutional crisis.        The conversations have been challenging, insightful,       sometimes funny and surprisingly vulnerable. Gostin spoke of       his difficult childhood, and how that had helped shape the       optimistic outlook he's known for. He shared his tips for the       best way to make popcorn.        Katyal told students to do something that was uncomfortable       for them, especially early in their careers. He said he had       recently taken rap improv classes to improve his ability to       think on his feet, and found it terrifying.        Katyal also shared how his father faced discrimination and       was unfairly fired, but had his dignity restored by a civil       case, inspiring Katyal to go to law school. He told how he       always asked his children's advice the night before a Supreme       Court case, and shared some of their tips on how to stay calm       when facing the justices. (Once: ``Think of a cute pig.'')        This is a time when shared challenges make people more       comfortable talking about vulnerabilities, Treanor said. ``I       don't think we would have these same conversations if we had       this class two years ago.''        Hillary Sale, an associate dean and professor who helped       design the class, agreed. The stress of the times is making       people introspective and reflective, she said, ``in ways that       are probably really good, and probably wouldn't happen       without that outside pressure.''        Paul Butler, a former federal prosecutor, challenged       students to rethink the justice system, which he argues is       not weakened by a few racist bad-apple police officers, but       is ``broke on purpose'' and working the way it was designed       to work.        Butler told of his searing experience decades ago when he       was arrested while he was a prosecutor on a case accusing a       U.S. senator of corruption. As he wrote in his book ``Let's       Get Free,'' Butler was charged with simple assault after a       neighbor falsely accused him of pushing her after a dispute       over a parking space. Police officers cursed at him. At the       courthouse, he was led, handcuffed, through the inmates'       entrance--when, as a prosecutor, he normally could breeze       through the main entrance without needing to go through a       metal detector.        At his trial, he said, he listened to a police officer lie       on the stand. After he was acquitted, he felt the weight of       how easily the false  [[Page S7071]]       accusation could have destroyed him, if not for the skill of       his attorney.        A Yale- and Harvard-educated prosecutor, Butler had once       felt different from the Black men he prosecuted, he told The       Washington Post. But, he said, ``I certainly wasn't different       in the way police responded to me.''        He wanted students to think about the inevitable setbacks       and traumatic experiences they would face, and how they would       confront those with integrity. ``The main thing I wanted       students to think about,'' Butler said, ``is justice.''        For Walters, a 23-year-old Black student from Mobile, Ala.,       the leadership class initially sounded like a welcome break       from typical law classes--in which professors grill students       with tough questions--during a busy fall when she is also       applying for jobs. But Walters, who is president of the       Georgetown Law Black Law Students Association, has been       struck by a number of the conversations, including       Butler's.        ``It has been inspiring to have this class,'' Walters said.        As faculty reflect in the class on their own life choices,       the odd zigs and zags of their careers, the abject failures       that turned out to be gifts and the pinnacles that       unexpectedly fell flat, the stories resonated with other       students confronting their own imminent decisions.        People are definitely more stressed about careers this       fall, said Luke Bunting, a student from Indiana who has       worked for Republican members of Congress and is now in his       second year at Georgetown Law. He hopes to work for a firm       and make an impact, and hearing from people with such       different backgrounds and approaches made him more confident       that was possible, he said.        Kristin Ewing, a student from Nebraska by way of a musical-      theater career in New York, gained an interest in health-care       policy when she saw how performers were affected by their       lack of insurance. She said it was reassuring to hear       professors talk about career pivots.        Rujuta Nandgaonkar, also interested in health policy--an       inclination cemented by the pandemic, she said--was struck by       Barnett's advice to surround yourself with people who       disagree with you, and an idea several people shared about       getting past the inevitable bumps in the road. ``Those are       important lessons for these times,'' she said.        ``This is not the greatest time--but there is hope,''       Nandgaonkar said. ``That's the string that runs through it.''        Lesser, a high school teacher for four years before law       school, isn't sure what he wants to do after he graduates.       But he is considering options that tie into his interests in       democracy and criminal justice reform, such as working in a       prosecutor's office, judiciary committees in Congress or for       the military.        After hearing Brooks talk, Lesser said, ``her lecture       reinforced that having a functional modern democracy is a       precious thing, and it can get lost easily if people aren't       willing to perfect it.''        The class has been grounding, Lesser said.        ``It reminds you of why you're doing this. That's       important, especially when our country is being tested, our       field is being tested. You have to reconnect to the values''       that brought people to study the law, he said.        Walters had gravitated during law school to apply to firms       because she was worried about paying off student loans. But       after a summer of protests following George Floyd's killing       in police custody, she witnessed people paint messages about       defunding the police near the White House, and was struck by       the role public defenders were playing in the community.        The new economic uncertainty and the idealism reinforced by       the class reaffirmed her original commitment to go back to       the South--where she grew up not seeing Black lawyers, she       said--and work as a public defender.        ``I'm kind of grateful to be able to do what I'm passionate       about,'' Walters said. ``I think it would be great to go back       there and try to make it the best place it could be.''                            ____________________
