 Mr. President, I rise to address two separate topics.  Let me begin with National Seersucker Day.   Senator Wicker started and I spoke a little bit earlier about  celebrating National Seersucker Day. It is a bipartisan tradition to  celebrate an American tradition that started in New Orleans. Anyone who  has been in New Orleans in July and August can understand why you would  like a lightweight summer suit.  [[Page S3284]]    I was asked today by a reporter: Why would you continue the  seersucker tradition?   I was thinking, wait a second. Why wouldn't you wear a lightweight  suit on a summer's day as opposed to a wool suit? It just makes such  sense. But sometimes such sense is in short supply here in Washington,  DC.   On the other hand, it is something in which both parties, folks from  all regions of our country, participate. It started in New Orleans when  Joseph Haspel developed seersucker. It is a lightweight suit. It is, if  you will, a lighthearted tradition, but it is one that celebrates an  aspect of our country and how something in one part of our country can  be adopted by folks elsewhere to the benefit of all.   Once again, I say happy Seersucker Day to everyone, and if you wish  to join my office in wearing seersucker every day throughout the  summer, you can similarly be comfortable on a hot summer's day here in  Washington, DC.                                  Healthcare    Mr. President, let me now address something that is on the topmost of  Americans' minds, and that is the high cost of healthcare. It is  important for our country, for our States, and it is important for  families sitting around their kitchen tables. We have to lower  healthcare costs. We have to do something about the high price of  medicine.   Just some examples of the importance of this issue: Medicare  actuaries just this week issued a report that the Medicare trust fund-- that trust fund which pays the benefits for the senior citizen on  Medicare going to see her physician, going to the hospital. It pays the  hospital. That trust fund will effectively be exhausted in 8 years. In  8 years, the Medicare trust fund we have all been paying into will be  exhausted. In part, that is related to the high cost of medicine, the  high cost of drugs. We must do something about that.   It is not just those on Medicare; it is also those in the individual  market. In Louisiana, if you are 60 years old with a family and you are  not getting a subsidy through ObamaCare and you want to go into the  individual market, your policy, plus deductible and copay, can be up to  $50,000 a year, after-tax dollars.   Think about this: You are making $150,000, but your after-tax expense  for your insurance, deductible, copay, pharmaceutical costs, et cetera,  is about $50,000 before your insurance kicks in.   The Washington Post thought I was exaggerating. They went down and  interviewed somebody in Louisiana. They said: He is right--it really  would cost you about $50,000.   The high cost of healthcare and the high cost of drugs impact the  Medicare trust fund. It impacts individuals. It also impacts States.   If you look at State budget after State budget that is struggling to  make ends meet, inevitably a major expense, which has grown over time,  is Medicaid. States do all sorts of machinations in order to decrease  their State's cost of maintaining their Medicaid Program, but despite  all those little tricks they do--which, by the way, cost the Federal  taxpayers more--still, Medicaid gobbles up more and more of a State's  budget. Consequently, one of the reasons college tuition has risen so  much--and along with it, the amount of money college students have to  borrow to get through even State universities--is that the amount of  State general fund dollars going for State university support has  declined as Medicaid expenditures have risen.   So whether it is Medicare, Medicaid, or the individual family, rising  healthcare costs are significant.   One more thing I should say about families. From 2007 to 2014, the  amount middle-income families have had to spend on healthcare has risen  by 25 percent even though the amount they have had to spend on other  things has fallen. So we have to decrease the cost of drugs and the  cost of healthcare.   We did have a bill earlier this year that had been negotiated between  Senator Alexander, Senator Murray, Senator Collins, and Senator  Nelson--two Democrats, two Republicans--that would have lowered  premiums for those in the individual market and done many other things.  For example, there was a Federal reinsurance program that could have  lowered premiums by as much as 40 percent, I am told, in terms of this  year. If you are getting sticker shock--in a few months or right now-- as regards what your next insurance premiums are going to be, this  would have lowered that increase dramatically. For those getting short- term, limited-duration policies, it would have put guardrails on those  policies to make sure they were good policies. It would have helped  young people get back into an insurance market they had been priced out  of. It would have given States flexibility on how to implement various  programs--again, with the goal to lower insurance costs. It was a  bipartisan bill.   By the way, whenever I hear one of my Democratic colleagues stand up  and say ``We have to do something about healthcare,'' I then ask ``Why  did you object and oppose a bipartisan bill you helped negotiate that  would have lowered premiums?'' You can see it. It is not me saying it;  it is actually the Democratic Party that stood up and said, on the  procedural motion to proceed--can we move to a vote on this bill?--that  got up and said: No. No, we do not want this bill that will lower  premiums for the American people.   What I am saying is not opinion; it can be found on YouTube, on C- SPAN. It was a bipartisan bill which they helped negotiate and which  they subsequently objected to, preferring that the American people pay  higher premiums, I suppose, so that they would have a campaign issue to  talk about.   So whenever one of my Democratic colleagues gets up and talks about  the high cost of healthcare, it begs the question: Why did you oppose  the bipartisan bill that would have lowered premiums this year? It is a  question the American people should be asking.   On the other hand--I am personally working on this--we just put out  an 8-page white paper on what we as a nation can do to lower healthcare  costs and to decrease the cost of medications. There are several things  in there.   One is to adopt the bipartisan legislation which we thought we had  agreement on but which was subsequently opposed by those who had  negotiated the bipartisan agreement on the Democratic side.   Second is price transparency. Can you imagine this: If you go and get  an x ray that your doctor orders or you go to buy medicine, you would  actually know the price of that medicine or the price of that x ray  before you go in, and if the price is too high, you would be able to  comparatively shop and go someplace where it is less expensive. We do  it for jeans. We do it for cell phones. We do it for cars. We should be  able to do it for healthcare.   By the way, you probably know I am a gastroenterologist, a physician.  I spent 30 years in the healthcare system. This can happen, and it does  happen. I am told by a GI friend of mine that in North Carolina, Blue  Cross of North Carolina will publish the cost of a colonoscopy. He is a  lower cost, higher quality provider, and he gets folks coming from as  far as 50 miles away for their colonoscopy, to his facility, because  folks look online and see that it is a lower cost and that the quality  is great. It can work.   One more thing on how this works. We ask that you ban gag clauses.  Right now, some pharmacy benefit managers will tell a pharmacist that  she or he cannot tell the patient that it is cheaper to pay cash for  their prescription than to pay their insurance copay. The pharmacist  could tell them, but the pharmacist is not allowed to because if the  pharmacist tells them they would save money by paying cash instead of  going through their insurance, the pharmacist would lose that contract  with that pharmacy benefit manager. That is wrong. The patient should  have the power. If the patient has the power, we lower drug costs, and  we lower healthcare costs.   We have many other ideas in this paper, and we invite people to go to  the website Cassidy.senate.gov to see this. We would like feedback. We  hope that eventually it will be bipartisan. In the meantime, we will  continue to work, as will my Republican colleagues, on how we can lower  costs on medicine, lower the cost of drugs, and make it easier for  those families sitting around the kitchen tables to meet their bills.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
