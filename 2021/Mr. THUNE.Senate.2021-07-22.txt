 Mr. President, inflation is on the rise. Inflation in June  was at its highest level in 13 years. Consumers are facing the effects:  higher prices.   Americans are facing increases in rent, in their restaurant bills, in  their grocery bills, gas prices, and the list goes on.   Want to buy a used car?   Expect to pay a lot more money than you would a year ago.   Inflation happens when the amount of money out there exceeds the  supply of products. When that happens, when demand outstrips supply,  prices increase. And that is what we are seeing now. It is being  aggravated by Democrats' decision this spring to flood the country with  unnecessary money.   During times of crisis, there is a place for increased government  spending. The money the government invested in COVID vaccines, for  example; the forgivable loans provided to small businesses to help them  weather the pandemic; and the increased assistance to hospitals and  healthcare providers as the crisis escalated.   But crisis spending is for just that, a crisis, or at least it should  be. Unfortunately, Democrats have never met a temporary government  dollar that they didn't want to keep spending. ``Temporary'' government  programs aren't really a thing for my friends across the aisle.   And so as the crisis was waning and our economy was rebounding,  Democrats doubled down on the crisis spending and passed a massive  COVID relief bill filled with unnecessary handouts; hundreds of  billions of dollars for State governments, the majority of whom were  doing just fine without it. In fact, many running surpluses. Tens of  billions more for schools who had barely made a dent in the billions of  dollars they had already been given.   Republicans and at least one liberal economist warned that Democrats'  massive spending plan could overstimulate the economy, but Democrats  didn't listen. So it is no surprise that the flood of unnecessary  government dollars is currently helping to boost inflation.   Here is the kicker, Mr. President. After flooding the economy with  unnecessary money, Democrats are now preparing to double down on that  strategy. That is right. Despite passing a largely unnecessary $1.9  trillion bill just 4 months ago, Democrats now want to spend an  additional $3.5 trillion--$3.5 trillion.   The truth is that number is likely to be even higher, a lot higher.  One estimate suggests that the $3.5 trillion is likely to be more like  $5 trillion or $5.5 trillion. That is from an independent analysis by  the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, where President Biden's  own Treasury Secretary used to serve on the board. That is an  inconceivably large amount of money.   To put that number in perspective, the entire Federal budget for 2019  was less than $4.5 trillion--the entire Federal budget. So Democrats  are just casually tossing out a new spending bill that might very well  exceed the entire Federal budget in 2019.   I can assure Americans that that much money would fuel increased  inflation. Consumers would continue to be squeezed by rising prices and  watch the value of their salaries decrease.   But the damage would not be just limited to the effects of inflation.  Americans would also suffer as a result of the massive tax hikes  Democrats are envisioning. Democrats plan to pay for all or some of  their spending by raising taxes left and right on small businesses,  large businesses, investment, well-off Americans. All of them and more  will see tax increases under Democrats' plans.   The President, of course, likes to repeat his mantra that he won't  raise taxes on those making under $400,000. In fact, that isn't really  true, as the President's plans for a second death tax will undoubtedly  hit middle-class Americans.   While it is true that the President won't be raising income taxes on  Americans making less than $400,000 a year, middle-class Americans will  unquestionably bear a substantial part of the burden of his tax hikes  because raising taxes, any taxes, has consequences for everyone.   Democrats like to pretend that raising taxes is a consequence-free  enterprise, but that isn't even close to being the truth. It doesn't  take an economics degree to recognize that. It is common sense. Raise  taxes enough on anyone or any business and that individual's behavior  or that business's behavior is going to change. A business facing a  substantial tax hike may raise prices; it may freeze salaries; or it  may not hire as many new workers, and all of those decisions will be  felt by ordinary Americans.    Think about it. If a business raises prices to deal with the impact  of a tax hike, who is going to feel it the most? Ordinary Americans on  a budget.   What is more, most Americans, if they are not self-employed or  working for government, are employed by businesses, and if the business  they work for isn't doing well, their prospects are going to be  significantly affected. If businesses hold down wages to deal with the  impact of tax hikes, for example, ordinary Americans' long-term earning  potential will be diminished. These effects may not sound as concrete  as being handed a tax bill, but they have just as real of an impact on  Americans' incomes and Americans' lives.   Studies suggest that 50 to 70 percent or more of the burden of  corporate tax hikes is borne by workers in the form of things like  lower wages. Combine Democrats' proposed business tax hikes with their  massive proposed increase in the capital gains tax, which would chill  the investment that helps drive job creation, and you have a recipe for  permanently diminished economic growth and a permanent reduction in  opportunity for American workers.   If Democrats received any mandate in the last election, it was a  mandate for moderation, for compromise, for bipartisan cooperation. Yet  Democrats are behaving as if they had received a mandate for a partisan  revolution. They are busy driving the country down the road to  socialism with a massive and permanent expansion in the size of  government, and their reckless tax-and-spending spree will hurt the  very Americans they claim to want to help.   I hope some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will put  the brakes on their party before the Democrats' massive spending spree  ends in economic disaster for the American people.
