 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  Build Back Better bill. I thank Chairman Yarmuth and the Speaker, as  well as the committee chairs who worked to craft this transformative  legislation. It makes bold investments in our people, reduces  inflation, and will deliver real improvements in their lives.   It will address the acute housing crisis in my community and  throughout the country. It also includes wildfire prevention, drought  relief, conservation efforts, and climate change research to curb the  climate crisis.   It includes the child tax credit, paid family leave, child nutrition  programs, expanding access to childcare for working and low-income  families, and home care for elders. All of these investments and more  will help reduce poverty and allow women to get back into the paid  workforce.   It will also help build rewarding careers, create jobs through  workforce development funding for underserved populations, including  returning citizens.   Passing this bill is a moral imperative, especially for children,  women, seniors, and people of color that have been disproportionately  impacted by this pandemic and continue to be sidelined due to systemic  racial and economic inequality. I urge a ``yes'' vote.
