 Mr. Speaker, this resolution is a critical tool that we  can use to provide relief to millions of Americans by passing President  Biden's American Rescue Plan.   COVID-19 has impacted every corner of our Nation, taken loved ones  from us, sickened millions more, shuttered small businesses, and pushed  hardworking families into dire straits.   As we look at the toll this pandemic has taken, we must pass an  aggressive, large-scale response. We cannot continue in piecemeal  relief that falls short of addressing the needs of communities in every  congressional district.   By setting a reconciliation framework across numerous House  committees, we can craft a plan that will expand testing and  vaccination efforts; extend critical lifelines for those who have lost  their job; support schools, local small businesses, and first  responders; and send direct aid to those who are struggling.   The burdens that our Nation has endured over the last year are far  too high for continued inaction, and I hope that my colleagues will  join me in supporting this resolution.
