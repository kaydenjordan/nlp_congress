 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   My amendment directs the State Department to use $10 million from the  NADR account to fund a major science facility in Jordan called SESAME,  or the Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Application in  the Middle East. SESAME is a cooperative venture by scientists and  governments throughout the region, including Israel, Iran, and everyone  in between.   Science is a universal language that can cross barriers, and SESAME  has the potential to be that bridge in an area where very few exist.  The U.S. support would strengthen collaboration and provide  encouragement for all of the countries in the region.   I urge my colleagues to join me and vote ``yes'' on this en bloc  package.
