 Mr. President, a two-ship block buy would increase  predictability and stability for our suppliers, including the many  shipbuilders and shipyard workers in the Hampton Roads region. It would  also generate significant costs savings for U.S. taxpayers. It is  critical that the Navy has access to the next-generation of warships  for the world's challenges, while also being responsible in how it  procures and budgets. For some time, I have been encouraging the Navy  to move forward with a block buy of two aircraft carriers, as it makes  strategic sense. Estimates have found that it would be an opportunity  to save over $2 billion in the Defense Department's budget through this  block buy.
