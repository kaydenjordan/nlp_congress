 Mr. President, I want to take a moment to  recognize and thank COL Katherine ``Kat'' Miller for her years of  service to the people of Nevada. She leaves behind a powerful legacy of  public service and dedication to our military and Nevada's veterans.   Kat Miller grew up in Reno, NV, and after graduating from Reno High  School embarked on a 34-year career in the Army and Nevada National  Guard. Among her many contributions to our Nation's Armed Forces are  her service on four continents and deployments to Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq  and Afghanistan. Kat was something of a trailblazer serving in multiple  leadership positions and commanding thousands of staff as a military  police brigade commander in the U.S. and Afghanistan and as the  commander of the Department of Defense's largest correctional  organization. After retirement from the Army, she taught at the  University of Maryland and the University of Nevada, Reno before  becoming the director of the Nevada Department of Veterans Services-- NDVS--in 2013.   Nevada has benefited immensely from Kat's directorship of the NDVS.  Under her watch, the NDVS made huge strides for our State's veterans.  Notably, NDVS assisted the Governor and Nevada mayors in their efforts  to reduce suicide among veterans and their families, created nine  programs to support unique or at-risk veteran populations, trained  hundreds of healthcare providers in understanding how dementia and the  aging process affect the care of veterans, and created a program to  help employers recruit and retain veterans.   Kat also successfully led the NDVS in applying for over $70 million  in Federal grants for veterans' programs, including for nursing home  creation and improvements, cemetery expansions, disabled veterans  sports programs, rural transportation initiatives, and telehealth  equipment. Under Kat's directorship, the NDVS received five national  awards for these innovative veterans support programs: the Nevada  Veterans Advocate Program, the Nevada Veterans Legislative Program, the  ``Ask a VSO'' Program, Operation Mission Ready, and the Patriot  Employer Program. Furthermore, last year, Kat was appointed to the  Department of Veterans Affairs Veterans Rural Health Advisory Committee  to help identify barriers to access to healthcare in rural areas and  recommend solutions to the Veterans Affairs secretary.   The list of Kat's achievements and contributions to the State of  Nevada and the U.S. Army goes on and on. I have no doubt that Kat's  legacy of service will continue to leave a powerful impact on the lives  of many veterans in Nevada for years to come. She has my deep  thanks.                            ____________________
