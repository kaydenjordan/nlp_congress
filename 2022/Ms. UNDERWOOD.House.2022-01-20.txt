 Mr. Speaker, today marks one year of Democrats in  Congress working alongside the Biden-Harris administration on behalf of  American families.   I am proud of what we have accomplished so far, including the once- in-a-generation investment in our roads and bridges made by the  bipartisan infrastructure law. With nearly 2,500 bridges in poor  condition, Illinois ranks third among States with crumbling bridge  infrastructure. Thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law, Illinois  will receive $1.4 billion to repair and rebuild these bridges, like the  Blackberry Creek and Mendota railroad bridges in my district.   These upgrades will save Illinoisans money on costly car repairs and  time on their daily commutes. This long-overdue investment will also  connect our communities and support our supply chain, while creating  good-paying jobs and spurring economic development.   With the partnership of the Biden-Harris administration, we have  spent the last 365 days delivering for the American people. Our work is  far from finished.
