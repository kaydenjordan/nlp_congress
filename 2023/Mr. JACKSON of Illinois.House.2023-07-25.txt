 Madam Speaker, I yield to the honorable  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick).                                General Leave    Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of this  Special Order hour.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Nevada (Mr. Horsford).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick).   Mrs. CHERFILUS-McCORMICK. Madam Speaker, I rise today as a voice for  Floridians whose lives have been tragically cut short by the gun  violence epidemic that is ravaging our communities.   In 2020, an alarming statistic emerged. Guns became the leading cause  of death among children and teenagers in the United States, claiming  more lives than car accidents, cancer, or drug overdoses.   This year alone, the United States has experienced over 400 mass  shootings. My home State of Florida accounts for at least 20 of these.  South Florida is no stranger to gun violence. Over what should have  been a peaceful Memorial Day weekend this year, a total of nine people  were shot on the Hollywood boardwalk. Four of them were kids.   Yet, in the face of these incidents, we have witnessed a persistent  denial among Republicans. In Florida, the extreme GOP State legislature  is making it easier, not harder, for individuals to purchase guns.   It is maddening to watch as lives are needlessly taken and families  are torn apart. How have we let this become our new normal? How have we  not curbed this epidemic? How have we not acted?   We have a collective responsibility to build upon the landmark  Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and implement commonsense measures to  keep weapons out of the hands of those who pose a danger to others. The  bipartisan law is essential in curbing the gun violence epidemic and  safeguarding our loved ones, but we cannot stop there.   Now is the time for us to unite across party lines and work  collectively to find real solutions. We must prioritize the safety of  our communities by implementing responsible gun control measures,  providing mental health resources, and dismantling the cycle of  violence.   Let us seize the opportunity to create a safe America where all  families can thrive without the looming shadow of gun violence. I ask  all members of this caucus and all Members of the Florida delegation to  stand with us to make sure that we can end this gun violence epidemic.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Payne).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman  from Georgia (Mrs. McBath).    Madam Speaker, I thank the Honorable  Congresswoman McBath from the great State of Georgia for her comments.   It is now my privilege to yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Carter).    Madam Speaker, I thank the Honorable  Congressman Carter from the great State of Louisiana for those remarks.   Madam Speaker, today I stand in solidarity with my colleagues in this  Chamber and with citizens across this Nation in condemning the  pervasive violence that has taken root in America.   The scourge of violence has become an epidemic. Regrettably, the  depth of its impact and its implications for our society's fabric  remain inadequately grasped.   We must recognize that violence is not solely defined as the act of  wielding a gun. The violence that engulfs our Nation goes beyond the  confines of weaponry.   By the time hands are raised in aggression, the cultural and judicial  strains have already transformed fellow citizens into adversaries. The  staggering reality of 400 million guns in a Nation with 300 million  citizens underscores a deep-seated issue.   It is hardly shocking then, in such an environment, that individuals  increasingly view one another as foes rather than fellow countrymen.  The prevailing political and cultural mood of our Nation is manipulated  by the insidious use of fear.   Some of the most profound acts of violence in this country have been  executed not just by those with firearms but by those exploiting fear  to amplify their privilege and magnify their influence.   Is it not an act of violence to belittle 400 years of African- American resilience? A battle we should never have had to fight, a  battle no one should be forced to endure.   Yet, in a single afternoon, the Supreme Court chose to undercut what  took 400 years for the Black community to establish, comprehensive  policies that recognize and affirm our place against practices that  they aimed to dismiss. Isn't this violence too?   How can it not be considered violence when Harvard University is told  it cannot use race as a criterion for admission, but it sees no  restriction placed on legacy or wealth?   The Supreme Court seems to suggest that being Black doesn't  inherently carry merit, but being affluent certainly does.   Perhaps a fellow Member here can enlighten me. When have the wealthy  ever been disadvantaged in this Nation, that they needed further  benefits because of their wealth? Can anyone refer me to such a time in  history?    The Supreme Court seemed to believe that in a mere 50 years, we have  surpassed the need to factor in race, yet overlooked the fact that  privilege has played a larger role in Ivy League admissions than race  ever has.   Where in the majority decision did the Court address the inherent  advantages of unearned privilege?   Where is the dedication to meritocracy in such a stance?   Yet, it is revealing that many champion the cause of equality if it  does not level the playing field much in favor of true equality.   In this Nation, uniquely certain demographics perceive true equality  as an affront to their status.   For countless Black and Brown individuals witnessing the impact of  this flawed ruling, the past fortnight has felt like a period of  systemic aggression.   When discussing violence in America, our focus shouldn't solely be on  the acts committed by those who misuse firearms. Florida's Governor  didn't need a firearm to ban books and dismiss the educational value of  African-American history.   The Florida Board of Education didn't wield a gun when they sidelined  African-American studies in their advanced placement curriculum.  Recently, we were dismayed to learn that Florida's newly approved  middle school syllabus had the audacity to suggest that slavery was  somehow advantageous for Black individuals.   In 2023, it is disheartening to note that in Florida, an educational  curriculum was sanctioned by those brazen enough to insinuate that  slavery could be deemed beneficial in any manner. There has been  silence by so many in this body. This silence is tantamount to  violence.   Those who sanctioned this content attempted to defend their stance,  asserting that slavery taught Black individuals skills like  agriculture, painting, carpentry, blacksmithing, tailoring, and  transportation.   This emphasizes the importance of lawmakers fully understanding the  laws they create. Had they read some of the very literature they  hastily sought to ban, they would have recognized the sheer absurdity  of such claims.   Black civilizations were the architects behind the pyramids. The  Fertile Crescent of the Nile Valley stands testament to their prowess  in civil engineering and agricultural innovation.   Timbuktu houses one of the world's earliest and most renowned  universities.   A full two millennia before Hippocrates, Imhotep was already  pioneering medical practices and documenting them.   African civilizations were the crucible for philosophy, science,  poetry, and monotheistic religions.   How could a cadre of ill-informed, unenlightened, narrow-minded, and  archaic policymakers in Florida presume to suggest that Black  individuals required the shackles of slavery to grasp shoemaking?   How deeply misguided must one be to suggest that absent slavery,  Black artistry would be nonexistent, when Picasso drew inspiration from  modernist art from African masks?   To audaciously claim that Black individuals learned about  transportation through slavery, ignoring the fact that they navigated  the Congo's waters well before Europeans even embarked on their maiden  voyages, is pure folly.   Slavery served to starkly remind Black individuals how America often  fell short of its proclaimed values. It underscored the bitter truth  that one could be despised without the slightest effort to understand  their history or heritage.   To anyone who cannot see the inherent harm in teaching young Black  students that slavery was somehow a boon, you are sorely mistaken about  the essence of institutional and educational violence. What Governor  DeSantis did was educational violence.   To shed light on some historical facts, according to records,  Governor Ron DeSantis' great-grandmother landed on American shores in  February 1917. She arrived in New York, eager to embrace her new  identity as an Italian American, and she was fully entitled to.   Regardless of her great-grandson's current disposition, she  undoubtedly contributed to this Nation, and her contribution was as  pivotal as anyone else's.   But let me also remind you that the first Africans came to America in  1619, landing in Jamestown, Virginia--298 years separate 1619 from  1917, 298 years.   Yet, we have a Governor in Florida, a descendent of those who arrived  nearly 3 centuries after my ancestors, presuming to dictate my  understanding of the African-American experience in this country.   How dare you, Governor DeSantis. You are absolutely a disgrace. No  Ron-DeSantis-come-lately will tell Black people the value of our  contributions to America.   That is why all of us on this side of the aisle are elated to see  Madam Vice President of the United States take the fight for Black  history directly to Florida.   Thank you, Madam Vice President Kamala Harris for speaking out  against ridiculous claims being made by the Florida Board of Education.   Across this Nation, individuals with a sense of justice commend Vice  President Harris for her unwavering stand for truth and righteousness.   Yet, this is adversity we face. Firearms merely represent the latest  form of hostility directed at Black and Brown communities. Over 400  mass shootings have occurred in 2023, and this year isn't over yet.   Discussing the glaring imbalance of having 100 million more firearms  than we have citizens, while not addressing 25 million American school- age children who can't read is an incomplete picture. The link is  apparent. Children lacking literacy skills may become adults more prone  to resort to crime, potentially involving guns.   If we are going to have a serious debate about violence in America,  then we must be willing to talk about this issue at every level.  [[Page H3944]]    When the Supreme Court said it was legal for a website designer to  deny LGBTQ people services, what kind of violence did that do to the  LGBTQ community? What kind of psychological, emotional, if not  spiritual violence did that decision bring to bear in the lives of  Black and Brown people?                                time  2030    I firmly stand with those who say that we need a national solution to  solve a national problem of gun violence, but I challenge all of us not  to view this issue so narrowly.   Gun violence stands at the intersection of race, poverty, and class,  and needs to be understood in this way.   We cannot become so enamored with the effects of the bullet that we  forget the economics of the gun. The root of the violence isn't merely  in the act of pulling the trigger, but in the lived experiences of  those who resort to such extremes.   The Biden-Harris administration's success in enacting the first  substantial gun laws in nearly three decades is commendable. With  executive orders, President Biden has significantly addressed the gun  crisis.   Yet, even in a scenario where guns are scarce, the ramifications of  America's inherent violence will persist as it stems from prejudice and  intolerance. This kind of violence, Madam Speaker, of which I speak, is  the progeny of fear. It is the direct and lamentable offspring of what  happens when people use revenge to play games with the resentment of  White, working-class people. This kind of violence cannot be arrested  and merely thrown in jail.   Regrettably, it cannot be legislated out of the hearts and minds of  people who use it to make a name for themselves. Once you allow your  politics to become sufficiently murderous, the kind of social evil it  produces can never be truly contained.   What is today a conversation about the inequities associated with  race will tomorrow become the first line of a sad eulogy written about  the American Dream. This is what we have tried to get America to see.   The willingness to mistreat Black history means that there are people  living among us who are more than willing to mishandle American history  as a whole.   So let us ultimately deal with every form of violence in America.  Systemic cruelty, like the violence in the streets, destroys the lives  and tears families apart.   Judicial roughness is no less a threat to Black children than the  specter of gang violence and all illegal guns being used to destroy  Black bodies without justification or remorse.   Donald Trump openly taught us what political brutality can do to the  moral fiber of a Nation that has slowly begun to forget its  constitutional ideals. While it is altogether fitting to talk about  gang violence in Chicago, murders in Memphis, and mass shootings in  Texas, don't forget to talk about the kind of economic violence being  visited upon Black families this country sees every day. The members of  the Congressional Black Caucus will always mention it.   We will always talk about it because our country's future depends  upon an honest assessment of who we are and what it is that we owe to  one another. To truly end violence in our Nation, it is not enough to  just regulate guns; we must also address and rectify America's deep- rooted issues with privilege, power, and hatred.   Addressing one issue without the other is tackling an issue that will  not be secure. We must render our efforts as effective so that we will  be a blessed Nation.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
