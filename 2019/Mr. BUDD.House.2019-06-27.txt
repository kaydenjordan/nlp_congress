 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Representative  Rena Turner for her years of service to North Carolina and in honor of  her retirement from the North Carolina General Assembly.   Since 2013, Representative Turner has been a tireless and effective  advocate for Iredell County in the State legislature.   Rena has been effective as vice chair of the Appropriations Committee  and also served on the Agriculture, Education, and Judiciary  Committees.   In my view, she has been a champion for many economic sectors of our  State but, in particular, agriculture, which she cared so much about.   Her constituents and I hate to see her go, but we take comfort in  knowing that her family will get to spend some more time with her.   Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Rena Turner for her many years  of service to Iredell County and to our State, and I wish her nothing  but the best in her retirement.                            ____________________
