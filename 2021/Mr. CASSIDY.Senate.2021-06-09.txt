 Madam President, I rise today to honor the life of a  young man who was not only an intern in my congressional office but  also a friend. Earl Michael Willis was born on May 29, 1993, in Baton  Rouge and was the beloved son of Earl and Cristal Willis. He grew up in  Brusly, LA, and attended Holy Family School and Catholic High School in  Baton Rouge. Michael developed a strong connection to God during his  formative years, especially through close friendship with Father  Michael Allelo, and his Christian faith and values were an important  aspect of his daily life. When Michael was in middle school, his sister  Rachael Lynn passed away from cancer. From that point on, Michael's  life was dedicated to his sister's memory, and he and his family  participated in many Light the Night events. More recently, Michael and  his wife Megan established a nonprofit foundation named ``Running for  Rachael'' in honor of his sister.   Ever since working at River Road Day Care in Port Allen in high  school, Michael was passionate about advocacy. At age 20, he became a  legislative assistant to Cindy Bishop of Checkmate Strategies and went  on to become the director of business development for the firm after  finishing college. Michael graduated from Louisiana State University in  May 2015 in political science. While at LSU, he was an active member of  the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and vice president of policy for The  Center for Development and Learning, where he led the center's  ``Literacy and Economic Development'' summit and led a highly  successful ``Literacy Day at the Capitol.'' Michael married the love of  his life, Megan Voda, on April 17, 2020. He possessed an incomparable  measure of love and devotion for his wife, his parents, and all of his  family. Sharing quality time with them was always atop his list of  priorities.   Michael is survived by his wife Megan, parents Earl and Cristal  Willis, brother Nicholas Boudreaux, nephews Noah and Nicholas  Boudreaux, mother- and father-in-law Cris and Tim Voda, sister-in-law  Katie Voda, his honorary nephews Beau Seymour and Harrison Danna, his  honorary nieces Lilly Seymour and Caroline Danna, and a host of aunts,  uncles, extended family, and friends. Michael Willis was a truly loving  and inspiring individual who always ensured that those around him felt  loved, valued, and appreciated. He will be deeply missed, but his  memory will live on forever in the hearts of those who knew and loved  him.                            ____________________
