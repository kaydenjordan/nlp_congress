 Mr. President, I am so honored to join my colleague       Senator Warnock to speak on the urgent need to pass this legislation,       the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act.        No one speaks better to this than Reverend Warnock. I have often told       the story that we were out on the steps of the Supreme Court after a       number of voter suppression laws had been introduced and passed around       the country. I gave what I thought was an excellent speech, and then he       came in and just said a few words, and they were these: ``Some people       don't want some people to vote.'' And I thought, all those words I       said, it really just comes down to that.        Our country has always believed in the freedom to vote. For years,       this has been a bipartisan issue with voting rights acts, with George       Bush doing            [[Page S9720]]            press conferences declaring his support for the Voting Rights Act.              So the reauthorization of the John Lewis bill and the changes made to       that bill are necessary, but so is the Freedom to Vote Act because it       sets the stage so that every person in America, regardless of their ZIP       Code, has the ability to drop off a ballot in a ballot box or send in       their ballot by mail or do it without having to have a notary sign for       their ballot.        All of this for many of us is about the reason we came here, which is       to uphold our democracy.        I want to thank Senator Warnock for hosting the Rules Committee in       Atlanta for the first field hearing in 20 years. I will end with a       story I heard that day. Jose Segarra, a veteran living in Central       Georgia, told us how he took his older neighbors to vote early--this       was in the last election--but they gave up because there was a line       wrapped around the block and then went back to vote, and he waited for       hours in the hot Sun.        He is a veteran. He served in the Air Force during Operation Desert       Storm. I asked him whether, when he signed up to serve, there was a       waiting line, and he said: No, ma'am. But when I came home and I had to       vote and I wanted to exercise my freedom that I fought for on the       battlefield, I had to wait in line for hours.        It is not just about, as Reverend Warnock has pointed out, making it       impossible for people to vote; sometimes it is just making it really       hard for them to vote, and that is what we are fighting against with       this bill. I thank him.        I look forward to working with Senator Fischer. She was a strong       supporter of the Electoral Count Act. She is the new incoming ranking       member of the Rules Committee, and I know we will do great work       together. But I stand in support of Reverend Warnock's unanimous       consent motion.        I yield the floor.         Madam. President, I rise today in support of the No       Trafficking Zones (NTZ) Act, which I have introduced with Senator       Cornyn and which is led by Representatives Sheila Jackson Lee, Jerry       Nadler, and  Mike McCaul in the House of Representatives. This       important bill represents a crucial effort to address child trafficking       on school campuses across the United States.        As a prosecutor, I saw firsthand the horrors of human trafficking,       and I know that human trafficking is not just something that happens       abroad; it happens far too often here at home. The National Center for       Missing and Exploited Children has received reports of child sex       trafficking in all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto       Rico, and in 2021, it received more than 17,200 reports of possible       child sex trafficking. This is a serious issue that requires our       immediate action.        I have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to       protect victims of human trafficking, strengthen key programs to       support human trafficking survivors, and to hold traffickers       accountable for their crimes. But I remain concerned that too many       victims of trafficking today are students. Schools should be a safe       haven for students, but too often, traffickers target children near       schools and afterschool activities.        The No Trafficking Zones Act allows judges to increase a trafficking       sentence when the trafficking occurs in a school zone or near a school-      sponsored activity. This commonsense legislation represents a necessary       step to not only deter child traffickers from targeting vulnerable       children at schools, but also to hold them accountable for crimes that       have reverberating consequences for victims and communities across the       country.         Mr. President, I have come to the floor this evening       with Senator Moran of Kansas to take a moment, as I did last night and       as our colleagues Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Coons did earlier       this evening, to emphasize the importance of including the Afghan       Adjustment Act in either the end-of-the-year spending bill or to pass       it on its own but to get it done as soon as possible.        Why? Well, more than 70,000 Afghans who sought refuge in our country       are currently in limbo, including so many who risked their own lives       and their own family's safety to protect our servicemembers.        Why do we know this? Because nearly half of them have been vouched       for by our own military. Because they come up to us at events with       members of the U.S. military. And I know every Member here has had this       experience where our own veterans--and I am so pleased that Senator       Moran, who is the ranking member on the Veterans' Affairs Committee,       has joined us on this bill after making some very important changes to       the bill to make sure the vetting process was as thorough as possible.       We are also joined on this vote, by the way, by Senator Wicker, the       incoming ranking member of the Armed Services Committee; by Senator       Graham, who is the lead Republican with me--who is the lead Republican       on this bill, a longtime member of the military himself; by Senator       Coons, who has been such a leader in Foreign Relations; by Senator       Blumenthal, who also has a long history of working on veterans issues;       by Senator Murkowski, who was an earlier supporter of this bill; by       Senator Blunt; by Senator Shaheen, who has long led efforts on these       issues in the Foreign Relations Committee; and by Senator Leahy. There       are many other Senators who are waiting to get on as cosponsors of this       bill, and there are many more than that who would vote to support it.        Why? Well, after their sacrifice and after helping them to relocate       in the United States, it is our responsibility to provide these Afghan       refugees with the assurance that they can stay here and rebuild their       lives. My colleagues, they are already here. They are living in towns       and cities across this country, and they simply need to know their       status. They are in limbo. It makes it very difficult to start lives in       this country.        Why am I involved in this issue? Well, one, like everyone else, I met       some of these brave refugees who had stood with our military. One was       an interpreter, and another worked on many other intelligence issues       with them. Also, in my home State, they are the second biggest       population among refugees from way back after the Vietnam war.        Vietnamese Hmong came to this country and started a new life. Now       they are doctors. Their kids and their grandkids and their great-      grandkids are police officers. And with their sacrifice, they rebuilt       their lives in the United States of America.        This bill is about showing that our country is committed to standing       with people who stood with us. That is why today we filed an amendment       with Senators Graham, Coons, Moran, Blumenthal, supported by many       others whom I have mentioned, to include this important legislation in       the end-of-the-year spending bill, and I urge my colleagues to support       it.        To be clear, this legislation doesn't just make this process make       sense; it also makes it more thorough. Our bill requires applicants to       go through vetting that is just as rigorous as the vetting they would       have gone through if they came to the United States during a regular       refugee process--a standard that eight former Trump and George W. Bush       administration national security officials called the ``gold standard''       of vetting.        The other cosponsors and I have worked with our Republican       colleagues, including Senator Moran, who is here on the floor today, to       respond to every issue identified by the Department of Defense and       Department of Homeland Security in their inspectors general reports,       which were very helpful for us in crafting this bill.        Our updated bill requires the Departments of Homeland Security and       Defense to consult with Congress before setting the vetting       requirements. It also directs the Department of State and other Federal       Agencies to work together to come up with a strategy for future       evacuations to make sure that we have plans in place to vet and       relocate those allies who serve alongside our troops.        This bill is supported by more than 40 organizations, including the       VFW. The Veterans of Foreign Wars support this bill. They have their       members on the Hill in their own humble ways lobbying for this bill.       They are not paid lobbyists; they are veteran civilian lobbyists out       there trying to help us.        The American Legion supports this bill. Admirals Mike Mullen, William       McRaven, James Stavridis, and Generals Richard Myers, Joseph Dunford,       and Stan McChrystal support this bill.        I am very, very focused on this bill because I think about people in       other countries that stand with our soldiers. It happens all the time.       If this is what we do when they come to our country and we don't have       their backs, what            [[Page S9753]]            message are we sending to people in the rest of the world who stand       with our soldiers, who protect them, who provide security for their       families, who are there to translate and to interpret for them, who       become their friends and close confidants? What message do we send if       we just allow them to be in this country in limbo with no certain       status ahead? We know what they will become when they stay here and       when they get their green card and they can work. They have shown their       work ethic, and they will have kids and grandkids who will go on, just       as the Hmong and Vietnamese did, to become those teachers and police       officers and farmers and bakers and nurses and doctors and builders and       inventors. We know what they will do but not if we don't give them that       chance, not if we don't have their backs like they had ours.        I am so proud to be joined by Senator Moran here on the floor and of       his work on behalf of our veterans, his work with Senator Tester and       the Veterans' Affairs Committee.        I yield the floor.
