Mr. President, today I would like to remember the  remarkable life and lasting impact of Robin Dale Holbrook, of Banner,  KY, who passed away last month in a tragic accident. Robin, who was  widely admired for his selfless compassion and unshakable integrity,  dedicated his life to improving the health of his Floyd County  community for nearly three decades.   Robin was the clinic director at the Eula Hall Healthcare Center in  Mud Creek, where he made a difference in the lives of so many. I have  had the privilege to visit this important center, in this rural  Appalachian community, which provides comprehensive services to many  Kentuckians who may not have access to other care. As both a  physician's assistant and an administrator, Robin's coworkers  remembered he didn't approach his work as a job, but rather a passion.  Caring for the members of his community was a calling for Robin and a  way to live out his Christian ministry.   The staff at the Eula Hall center intend to show respect for his  memory by delivering the same level of care Robin gave to patients  every single day.   On July 3, Robin's family, friends, and colleagues will celebrate his  life at the clinic where he served his community. I would like to join  them as they honor this impressive man and his decades of kindness and  service to Floyd County. Elaine and I extend our condolences to Robin's  wife, Angela, his family, and his many friends.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  June 25; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, morning business be closed, and the Senate resume consideration of  S. 1790; finally, that the Senate recess from 12:30 until 2:15 to allow  for the weekly conference meetings.
