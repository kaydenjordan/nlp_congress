 Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk  that is due for a second reading.    Mr. President, in order to place the bill on the calendar,  under the provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further  proceedings.    Mr. President, I have another matter to speak of, and  before I do, I wish to commend my colleague and neighbor from New  England, the distinguished Presiding Officer. As President pro tempore,  I am always delighted to see somebody step into that position, but I  wish to commend him for his tireless and, at times, what must be  frustrating negotiations on a matter that is of extreme importance to  our country.   In my prior profession, I went to many murder scenes. It seemed  always at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning people died of gunshots, and I  can remember each one of them as though it was yesterday.   Since then, what we have seen has been far, far worse. And I commend  the Senator and his leadership and those in both parties who have  worked with him and have tried to at least take some steps to curtail  that in this country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on June 20, yesterday, we commemorated  World Refugee Day. It is an important reminder that we have to  rededicate ourselves to a cornerstone of our Nation's founding:  providing refuge to the persecuted and oppressed.   Since the days of the earliest European settlers, America has  provided safe harbor to waves of refugees throughout our history. Many  Americans today can trace their ancestry back to refugees who fled  their homelands seeking freedom and security. Welcoming refugees is not  just something America does; it is who we always have been.   Americans have put this long tradition of welcoming refugees on full  display in recent months. After the withdrawal from Afghanistan,  Americans across the political spectrum opened their hearts, homes, and  wallets to Afghans fleeing the Taliban's ruthless rule. To date,  American families have helped to welcome nearly 80,000 vulnerable  Afghans into the United States, giving them a fresh start. As a  Vermonter, I am proud that our small State joined this cause and  volunteered to welcome and resettle 100 refugees--100 Afghan refugees.   Now, when Russia shocked the world and invaded Ukraine, Americans of  all walks of life yet again stepped up to assist Ukrainians fleeing  violence and destruction. Already, tens of thousands of Americans have  volunteered to serve as private sponsors for arriving Ukrainian  refugees. In fact, a Gallup poll from April confirmed that nearly 80  percent of Americans support resettling 100,000 Ukrainian refugees in  the United States. That happens to be a central goal of the Biden  administration, the Uniting for Ukraine initiative.   The deep and broad support for refugees among the American people  has, for many years, been reflected in the Halls of Congress. I  strongly supported  [[Page S3018]]  the 1980 Refugee Act, the landmark law creating our modern U.S. Refugee  Admissions Program and asylum system. That legislation was passed  overwhelmingly in the House and here in the Senate unanimously. In the  decades since, both parties have worked together to provide refuge to  exiled Cubans, displaced Haitians, dissident Chinese, and many other  refugee populations feeling persecution and tyranny.   Most recently, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I worked  again with Members of both parties to pass multibillion-dollar aid  packages to fund our government's efforts to aid Afghan and Ukrainian  refugees.   So it should come as no surprise that both parties have more often  than not worked together to support refugees seeking to begin anew in  the United States. The over 3 million refugees who have resettled in  the United States over the past several decades have enriched our  country economically and culturally. Refugees are entrepreneurs and job  creators. They are active and committed. They are members of our  communities. They are our neighbors and friends. Our Nation's history  has been defined by refugees, from Albert Einstein, to Madeleine  Albright. Their stories and the stories of the millions of other  refugees who come to our shores are the American way.   Now, the Trump administration gave rise to a dark turn toward  nativism and xenophobia, a jarring retreat from what has made America  great. The hateful policies of the Trump administration, espoused first  by the former President himself, aimed to demonize refugees and asylum  seekers, to shut our doors to the persecuted and oppressed. These  policies were shameful. They should be repudiated--repudiated  forcefully by every Member of the Senate.   Now, there is much more to be done to rebuild our Nation's capacity  and welcome and resettle refugees. I will continue fighting to defend  and support refugees in my remaining months in the Senate, just as I  have throughout my Senate career.   Today, though, I am hopeful. I see Vermonters coming together in aid  of native Afghan and Ukrainian refugees over the past several months,  and I am confident that America's highest ideals have not seen their  last days. We, the American people, have not lost sight of our roots.  We are still here, an imperfect but compassionate beacon of hope for  the hopeless. We are still here, our torch held high.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
