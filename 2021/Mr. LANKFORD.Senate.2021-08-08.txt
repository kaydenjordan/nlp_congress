 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that myself,  Senator Sinema, and Senator Carper be allowed to finish our remarks  before the vote begins.    Mr. President, I want to set some context of where we  are financially at this point.   Everyone knows last year the difficulties of COVID-19 and what  happened and the extraordinary measures that were taken to be able to  offset the economic damage that was significant. CBO, as of July 21 of  this year, estimates the Federal deficit for 2021 will be $3 trillion,  much of that based on what was done last year during an emergency time  period. It is 13.5 percent GDP. That deficit, in 2021, will be the  second largest since World War II, since 1945.   Now, this year, in the year that we are finally working our way out  of COVID-19, though still taking it seriously--this year, there is $2  trillion in additional spending in March of this year. There is a $1  trillion infrastructure plan that is in front of us now and a $3.5  trillion tax-and-spend bill that, apparently, we start in 2 days.   Listen, I have been told over and over again throughout the course of  this debate that the infrastructure package would be paid for, and  then, later, I was told, well, mostly paid for, and then CBO came out a  couple of days ago and said a quarter trillion dollars of it is not  paid for--a quarter trillion dollars according to CBO's estimates.   To make matters worse, part of the rest of it that CBO does estimate  is still areas where I would look at and go: That is pretty shaky  estimation--for instance, the unused unemployment benefits from earlier  this year. That is an area that I look at and I think, OK, if you are  taking unemployment benefits that were borrowed with debt money, then  not spending them, and then, later, going back and grabbing them and  saying now we are spending them, and they are ``paid for,'' that would  be the equivalent of me taking out a $20,000 car loan but, yet, buying  only a $15,000 car--so using the extra $5,000 to buy cat food and  donuts after that and say it was paid for. It is not paid for. The  extra $5,000 would go to debt reduction. In this case, it is $53  billion, not $5,000. That area is total debt spending as well. Though  CBO may score it, it is really not there.   One of my favorite areas of scoring in this I find fascinating in the  course of this conversation. This bill mandates the sale of over 87  million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Almost the  identical amount is assumed to be collected from the sale of 87 million  barrels of oil to be able to pay for the electric car charging  stations. So, literally, this bill sells oil to then pay for the  electric car charging stations. This bill also delays to get a score  for this--it delays a Medicare Part D regulation that had already been  delayed already.   My concern is this: We are not paying attention to the most basic  element. This is a quarter trillion dollars unpaid for, according to  CBO, and many other areas are pretty shaky pay-fors in this.   My simple suggestion is this: Let's do infrastructure, but let's do  the infrastructure we can afford. If we can't afford an extra quarter  trillion of this  [[Page S6057]]  trillion-dollar bill, then let's back it up to $750 billion. That  should be pretty straightforward. If we can't pay for that extra  amount, we shouldn't do that extra amount.                                Point of Order    So, saying that, Mr. President, in the pending measure, Senate  amendment No. 2137 to H.R. 3684 contains a matter within the  jurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget that was not reported or  discharged from the Committee on the Budget. Therefore, I raise a point  of order against division J, title IX, section 905 of the amendment,  pursuant to section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
