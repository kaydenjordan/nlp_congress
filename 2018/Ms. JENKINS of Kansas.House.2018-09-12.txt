Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3635, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R. 3635, the Local  Coverage Determination Clarification Act. I introduced this legislation  along with Congressman Kind, which will help ensure the Medicare  coverage decisions are made by qualified health experts through a  transparent process that is based on sound medical evidence.   Medicare administrative contractors, or MACs, play a critical role in  ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have access to needed care.  However, the less-than-transparent process used by MACs to make  coverage decisions can limit or deny patients' access to necessary  care.   Specifically, the science that guides some of these decisions can be  flawed, mischaracterized, or misapplied. The deliberations and  decisions of the MACs, which should be based on medical science, are  often conducted behind closed doors, with little opportunity for  interested stakeholders to raise issues or offer alternatives. These  decisions affect millions of Medicare beneficiaries and impact crucial  access to innovative technologies and services.   The establishment of a clear process informed by health experts will  make the local coverage determination, or LCD, process and the  decisions developed by that process more sound, more transparent, and  ensure accountability among MACs. These requirements are necessary to  ensure that our Nation's seniors receive quality healthcare treatment.   Specifically, H.R. 3635 would improve the LCD process by requiring  that carrier advisory committee meetings of the MAC are open, public,  and on the record, with minutes taken and posted to the MAC's website  for public inspection. The gravity of limiting or precluding coverage  for both beneficiaries and practitioners heightens the need for  transparency, especially when such meetings are currently closed off.   MACs would be required to include, at the outset of the coverage  determination process, a description of the evidence a MAC considered  when drafting a local coverage determination as well as the rationale  it relies on to deny coverage.   Additionally, under current rules, local coverage determinations are  essentially unreviewable once they become final. This legislation would  create a process for stakeholders to request additional review of a  MAC's local coverage decision from the Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services.   It would also require the Secretary to submit a report to Congress  regarding the number of requests filed with fiscal intermediaries and  carriers and the number of appeals filed with the Secretary, as well as  the actions in response. Additionally, the report would recommend ways  to improve the usefulness and efficiency of the process as well as the  communication with Medicare beneficiaries and providers.   While I am pleased that the legislation we have here today takes  steps to improve the process and bring transparency to protect access  for Medicare patients, we must continue to work to ensure that MACs  independently evaluate the evidence of other MACs' coverage decisions.  Local coverage determinations should be thoroughly evaluated by experts  in each local jurisdiction.   Currently, loopholes in the process allow contractors to adopt  another MAC's coverage determination without the necessary scientific  rigor and meaningful engagement with stakeholders that is vital in  forming the most appropriate policy. Due to regional, geographic, and  population-based deficiencies, these carbon-copied LCDs may not reflect  the specific geographic region they are intended to serve. Local  coverage determinations should be just that--local.   Put simply, what works best for one location does not always work  best for another location. Applying local coverage determinations  across jurisdictions has the practical effect of establishing national  coverage policies without having followed the more rigorous national  coverage determination process. As such, I look forward to working with  my colleagues on this issue, moving forward.   Medicare beneficiaries deserve transparency and accountability for  these decisions that directly impact their access to care. These  reforms are necessary to ensure that local coverage determinations do  not impede a physician's medical judgment and deny patients access to  medically necessary care. By changing the LCD process, Congress can  ensure that medical and scientific evidence is not used selectively to  deny appropriate coverage to seniors.   I want to thank Mr. Kind, who joined me in introducing this  legislation.   I want to ask my colleagues for their bipartisan support of this bill  as we work to improve access and care for every American.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I am proud to stand here today in support of  this commonsense legislation that creates transparency and  accountability to the local coverage determinations process and will  help ensure that Medicare patients receive the medical care they need.   Mr. Speaker, I hope everyone will join me in voting for this  legislation on the House floor today as we work to improve access and  care for every American, and I yield back the balance of my time.
