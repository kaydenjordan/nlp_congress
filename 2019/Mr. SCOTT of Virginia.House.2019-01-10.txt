 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Bishop for his  distinguished leadership, and I thank the gentleman for the opportunity  to mention several of the issues relevant to the jurisdiction of the  Education and Labor Committee.   Madam Speaker, this legislation funds critical nutrition assistance  programs that serve children and families. Nutrition programs are among  the most important and cost-effective investments in the Federal  budget.   Study after study demonstrates that freedom from hunger is the  foundation that children and families need to lift themselves out of  poverty. Beyond the tragedy of any child going to school on an empty  stomach, we cannot expect hungry children to reach their full potential  at school or to grow up into healthy adults unless they have proper  nutrition.   This reckless shutdown has left our constituents with uncertainty and  anxiety about their access to programs they rely on, such as WIC, SNAP,  or school meals. Now, while these programs are still available and USDA  is temporarily paying benefits, it is imperative that we secure funding  for these vital programs to ensure that children and families are not  left behind.   This should not be a controversial bill. But the shutdown has created  a crisis, so we are not going to go back and forth over the details. We  are going to pass a bill.   The Republican Senate passed this exact language with overwhelming  support last year, and we have to pass something. Some have said we  shouldn't pass this bill, but they have not said we should pass  anything. We have to pass a bill to reopen the government.   Madam Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.
