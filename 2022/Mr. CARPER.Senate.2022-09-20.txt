 Mr. President, while he is still here on the floor, I  just want to express to Senator Menendez, my thanks, our thanks, to him  and others on the Foreign Relations Committee for his leadership and  for setting us up for great success--American businesses up for  extraordinary success here today. The path is clear. We need to use  some common sense and work together, and I think we will benefit from  that and so will the men and women who have sent us here to serve them  and to represent them.   Mr. President, I rise today in support of ratification of the Kigali  Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.   I have worn many hats throughout my life of public service, including  naval flight officer, State Treasurer, Congressman, Governor, and a  U.S. Senator. Today, I rise to speak from my heart as a recovering  Governor, if you will.   During my 8 years as Governor of Delaware, I realized quickly that my  job was not to create jobs. That is not why they elected me. Rather, it  was to help provide a nurturing environment for job creation--to help  create a nurturing environment for job creation. More jobs were created  in the 8 years that I was Governor of Delaware, I am told, than any  other 8-year period in the history of the State of Delaware. I didn't  create one of them, but we did work very hard with the legislature and  with the business community and others to create a nurturing  environment that made possible extraordinary job creation.   The most successful economic development policies were the policies  that provided business with long-term certainty and predictability. As  it turns out, that is not unique to Delaware or to New Jersey or to  Connecticut or any other State represented here. It is something that  we still hear from businesses across the country in all 50 States, and  I am sure my other colleagues hear that message, too, on a regular  basis.   That is why I am so passionate about working with our friend and  colleague Senator John Neely Kennedy to ratify the Kigali Amendment to  the Montreal Protocol.   During the Trump administration, we successfully enacted the American  Innovation and Manufacturing Act, known as the AIM Act, which phases  down HFCs in accordance with the Kigali Amendment.   Ratification of the Kigali Amendment, along with implementation of  the AIM Act, will provide businesses with certainty and with the  predictability that they need for future investments.   Ratification will unleash billions of dollars in U.S. economic  benefits--billions of dollars in U.S. economic benefits--and create  some 150,000 American jobs by 2027.   I am going to repeat that. Ratification will unleash billions of  dollars in U.S. economic benefits and create some 150,000 American jobs  by 2027. These jobs are jobs in my State. These are jobs in every other  State throughout our country. Why would we ever pass up this  opportunity?   Let me be clear to my colleagues. I am not the one telling industry  that ratification of the Kigali Amendment is good for business and  economic growth. No, I am not telling them that. Industry leaders are  telling us that Kigali is good for their businesses. Everyone from the  U.S. Chamber of Commerce to the American Chemistry Council, to the Air- Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, to the Alliance for  Responsible Atmospheric Policy support ratification for Kigali. In  fact, it is hard to find anyone in the business community who is  opposed to ratification.   I would like to share with my colleagues today one statement that I  think is particularly noteworthy from the National Association of  Manufacturers. Here is what they have to say on this score:         Kigali ratification will protect American workers, grow the       economy, and improve our trade balance all while encouraging       further innovation to strengthen America's technology       leadership. If we work together--if we rise above politics       and partisanship and focus on solving problems--we can make       our vision of a brighter tomorrow into reality.    But for my colleagues who are still hesitant to support the Kigali  ratification and worried that ratification may hurt, not help, global  competitiveness, here are a few points I would like for you to think  about before tomorrow's vote.   First, I have heard concerns that ratification might benefit China  and hurt the United States. Nothing could be further from the truth.  While the United States contributes roughly $40 million annually to the  Montreal Protocol's financial assistance programs, which facilitate the  transition to next-generation technologies, it is not true that this  assistance goes solely to China.   In fact, China only receives a very small fraction of these funds.  According to the U.S. heating, ventilation, air-conditioning, and  refrigeration industry, financial assistance to China under the  Montreal Protocol supports less than 2 percent of China's $37 billion  refrigerant market--less than 2 percent of China's $37 billion  refrigerant market. Moreover, China's share of these funds is  decreasing, not increasing. In fact, funding to China under the  Montreal Protocol has decreased--has decreased--by nearly 70 percent in  recent years.   Mr. President, the truth is, the small amount we pay every year under  the Montreal Protocol is worth the investment and then some. Through  Kigali  [[Page S4841]]  ratification, American businesses are set to gain nearly $40 billion-- $40 billion--in economic benefits by 2027, according to a 2018 study by  the University of Maryland. Ratifying Kigali will guarantee that  American businesses continue to have access to international markets  for refrigerants long into the future.   However, without ratification, American companies could lose full  access to international markets for refrigerants after 2033, closing  the door to billions in future economic opportunities for U.S.  companies. Why would we want to allow that to happen?   Ratification also protects U.S. business investments. While China has  doubled down on HFCs and the production of HFCs, a dumping of HFCs--and  to this day illegally dumping HFCs into this country--the United States  leads the world, I am proud to say--it leads the world in HFC  alternatives. Ratification would protect against the illegal HFC  dumping and smuggling. These are protections that U.S. businesses have  sought.   I have also heard fears that ratifying the Kigali Amendment will  somehow raise consumer costs. That is just not true. We are already  transitioning away from HFCs similar to the way we transitioned away  from ozone-depleting substances through the 1987 Montreal Protocol  under President Reagan's leadership.   With the transition away from HFCs, we expect consumer costs to fall.  Now, why is that? New refrigerants and related products run more  efficiently. According to the EPA, use of HFC alternatives will save  consumers and businesses billions of dollars in costs. Again,  ratification means lower costs for consumers and for businesses while  enhancing U.S. competition.   In closing, I hope our colleagues will join Senator Kennedy and me in  supporting the ratification of the Kigali Amendment. This is a treaty  that fosters job creation--a lot of jobs. This is a treaty that  promotes economic growth. This is a treaty that strengthens American  leadership. This is a treaty of ``Made in America,'' not ``Made in  China.''   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I have six requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
