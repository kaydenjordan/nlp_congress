 Mr. Speaker, I am standing here as a  Member of Congress because my grandfather, Abe, was able to flee Europe  as the Nazis took over.   Then on October 7, it happened again. Hamas' barbaric attack on  Israel was the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust. Make no  mistake, Hamas are terrorists out to kill all Jews and destroy Israel,  and other enemies in the region are on the same mission.   Reaffirming Israel's right to exist, Golda Meir said: ``Jews have  nowhere else to go.''   Mr. Speaker, the United States has a moral duty and national security  urgency to aid Israel in defending herself. We must send an  unmistakable message to the world that we stand with Israel. I hope  that as this process moves forward, we will all come together to do  just that.
