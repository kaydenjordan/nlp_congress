 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.  [[Page H2336]]    Mr. Speaker, while the Paycheck Protection Program has provided a  lifeline to small businesses, fundamental changes must be made to meet  the ongoing needs of our Main Street economy.   I am thankful to have heard from hundreds of local business leaders  in my district who have helped identify critical shortcomings in the  PPP.   RoseAnn in Laconia tells us her restaurant's sales are down 90  percent, and she needs more time than 8 weeks to ramp up safely.   David from Portsmouth says his overhead costs are much higher than  the payroll at his new business, and he needs more flexibility in how  he can spend down the loan.   Hillary from Goffstown won't begin to make up for lost sales in her  wedding business until next year. A longer term will give her a more  stable financial footing.   There are millions of stories like these across the country.   I want to thank my colleagues for coming together on a bipartisan  basis to understand the need that is out there and helping to meet it  with this comprehensive bill that is going to provide a lifeline to our  local businesses. The fixes in this Paycheck Protection Flexibility Act  will allow our small businesses and their dedicated employees to  continue to survive. Let's pass this bipartisan bill today for our  workers, for our small businesses, and certainly for our future.
