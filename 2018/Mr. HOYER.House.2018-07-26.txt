 Mr. Speaker, 28 years ago, President George H.W. Bush  signed the Americans with Disabilities Act. I was proud to be a lead  sponsor of that legislation and to be on hand for the bill signing on  this day 28 years ago, together with former Democratic Whip Tony  Coelho; Representatives Steve Bartlett and Jim Sensenbrenner; and  Senators Tom Harkin, Ted Kennedy, Bob Dole, Orrin Hatch, and Lowell  Weicker. Other individuals present were:   President George H.W. Bush; Dave Capozzi; Justin Dart; Yoshiko Dart;  Chai Feldblum; Lex Frieden; Boyden Gray (Counsel to President Bush);  Anthony Imparato; Arlene Mayerson; Paul Marchand; Ed Markey; John  McCain; Normal Mineta; Ralph Neas; Katie Neas; Carolyn Ocelinik; Becky  Ogle; Lee Page; Liz Savage; Bobby Silverstein (Hatch); Melissa  Schulman; Cheryl Sensenbrenner; Bob Williams; John Wodatch, Esq.; and  Pat Wright.   We worked hard to shepherd that legislation to passage with strong  bipartisan support. The ADA has reshaped the landscape of our country  for millions of people living with disabilities, and, indeed, for many  millions throughout the world. It has done more than build ramps or  widen doorways.   It has changed perceptions and brought greater understanding, not  only to the abilities of those who were previously excluded, but also  to the challenges of living with a disability.   I am glad we have been able to come together to strengthen the ADA  over the years in the same spirit of bipartisanship that we had at its  inception.   Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate this anniversary each year, we  rededicate ourselves to the project of protecting the civil rights of  Americans with disabilities and expanding opportunity, equality, and  access for all of our people.                            ____________________
