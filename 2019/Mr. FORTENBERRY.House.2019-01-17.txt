 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Smith, not only  for his tireless leadership, but his compassionate, passionate voice on  behalf of women, saying loudly and clearly, consistently, over the time  he has been in Congress, that women deserve better.   Madam Speaker, we live in an age of contradiction. We say that we  want peace. We say that we want joy. We say that we want happiness,  that we ought to be living in a good and authentic, committed  community, and that we ought to uphold the noble ideal of human  dignity. But we have to ask some difficult questions. We have to ask  why.   Why, in this age of material plenty, is life expectancy in America  declining?   Why, in this age of vast and accelerating scientific discovery and  technological innovation, is the world still screaming for meaning?  Why?   Could it be that we have to be brave enough, that we have to be bold  enough, to look and confront our own contradictions?   We say we want community, but do we really care?   We say we want justice, but with certain exceptions.   We say we want liberty for all but, really, only for our own  perspective.   Madam Speaker, the reality is, life is hard. Life can be brutal. Life  can sometimes be very unfair.                                time  1430    The reality is we have to face this together.   This is why the demands of community, the demands of justice, the  demands of compassion, the demands of liberty say to the woman, no  matter how hard the circumstances, what a gift you are and what a gift  the unborn  [[Page H706]]  life is within you. What a gift. What a gift.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.
