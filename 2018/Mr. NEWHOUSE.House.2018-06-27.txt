 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, proud to share a snapshot of  rising wages, more jobs, and increasing opportunity in the Fourth  Congressional District of Washington, which I have the distinct  pleasure of representing.   In the city of Yakima, unemployment is at 5.5 percent, as reported in  April by the Washington Employment Security Department. That number is  reportedly the lowest it has been for that month since electronic  reporting began in 1990. Yakima County is the most populous county in  central Washington and had a May unemployment rate at 6.0 percent,  which is the lowest rate in decades.   In another major population center in Washington, the Tri-Cities,  unemployment was at 5.2 percent in May. Wages in the Tri-Cities area  are up 3.8 percent over 2017 and are among the fastest growing in the  State.   The latest jobs report showed decreasing unemployment rates across my  district in every single county, with Okanogan at 6.3 percent; Grant,  6.1; Franklin, 5.5; Douglas at 5.2; Benton at 5.1; Adams at 4.8; and  Walla Walla at 4.3.   New jobs in construction, food manufacturing, and professional  business services are largely driving the regional growth in the labor  force. These numbers are more than just statistics, Mr. Speaker.  Increasing employment opportunities mean families can provide a more  secure future for their children. Graduating students are able to  choose from more options after graduation.   My constituents deserve a Federal Government whose policies foster  this kind of growth through lower taxes and smarter regulation. We  should encourage entrepreneurs by helping, not hurting, growth.   Since tax reform was made law, local businesses in my district, such  as Irwin Research & Development and Abbott's Printing in Yakima, have  expressed optimism at the prospect of increasing investment and giving  earnings to workers rather than the Federal Government.   The ability of businesses to write off the full value of equipment  and other assets will help Buhrmaster Baking Company in Yakima plan for  equipment upgrades. Chukar Cherries in Prosser has announced a $1.8  million, 12,000-square-foot expansion, in large part due to tax reform.   Cacchiotti Orthodontics announced hourly raises for their Moses Lake  employees thanks to tax reform. Pacific Power, which serves Yakima  County, announced that it will pass tax reform savings on to its  ratepayers. Washington Federal, with branches in Moses Lake and Quincy,  announced 5 percent merit-based increases in wages for all employees  earning less than $100,000, as well as an investment in employee  training programs.    Pacific Northwest companies such as Alaska Airlines, Costco, Boeing,  Premera Blue Cross, and Starbucks have announced millions in increased  benefits, raises, employee education, and nonprofit donations.   To sum it all up, central Washington's economy is experiencing  growth, and that is good news for workers and for their families. I  will continue to work on behalf of my constituents to promote economic  opportunity, and I am proud that this tax reform is working as it was  promised to work.                            ____________________
