 Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate my constituent  Helen Witty on being named the national president of Mothers Against  Drunk Driving, also known as MADD.   Helen, along with her husband, John, experienced the ultimate tragedy  when their 16-year-old daughter, Helen Marie Witty, shown in this photo  with her brother John was killed by a young drunk and drugged driver  while she was rollerblading on a bike path near her home in Pinecrest  in June of 2000.   It was not long after that nightmare that Helen joined this  magnificent organization where she was able to channel her unbearable  loss into a forward-looking outlet where she could be a champion for  her daughter's legacy, while also making an effective and positive  impact on society.   Although 18 years have passed, it seems like just yesterday that we  lost our bright, beautiful Palmetto Senior High School honors student  who became a beloved treasure in our hometown and who is still widely  talked about and referenced throughout our community today.   Helen, congratulations on this incredible achievement, and this  opportunity is rightfully deserved to spread your message that it is a  crime to drive drunk and drugged.  [[Page H10340]]    South Florida is fortunate to have Helen, and I am confident that  Helen Marie is looking down from Heaven and could not be any more proud  of you.   Thank you, amiga.                            ____________________
