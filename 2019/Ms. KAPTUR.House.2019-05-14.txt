 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my grave concerns  surrounding the new NAFTA whose new rebranding as the USMCA masks its  real content.   The original NAFTA devastated the industrial Midwest and communities  from coast to coast. Manufacturing communities were hollowed out.  Factories closed. Jobs were outsourced to  [[Page H3774]]  Mexico for cheap labor. Mexico's peasants were uprooted. Plant shutdown  after plant shutdown saw U.S. wages and benefits plummet.   President Trump hit a nerve with these communities with his lofty  promises, promises of which we should all remain skeptical, especially  in the trade arena.   We heard these hollow promises 25 years ago to pass the original  NAFTA. Now NAFTA 2.0 stands to make many of the same mistakes based on  false promises of returning quality jobs with life-sustaining wages.   This won't happen without true labor enforcement, but the current  text of NAFTA 2.0 falls far short of that target. That is why I plan to  introduce legislation to set the mark on labor enforcement on this  continent under NAFTA 2.0 and any future agreement. The workers of this  continent deserve no less. We respect their dignity.                            ____________________
