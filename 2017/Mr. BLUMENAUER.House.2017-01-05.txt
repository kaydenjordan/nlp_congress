 ``. . . but the Congress may by law vest the  appointment of such inferior officers, as they think proper, in the  President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of  departments.''    Mr. Speaker, Israel is a special place in a troubled  and storied landscape, sacred ground for three of the world's major  regions.   Israel's security is important to me and the people I represent. The  Jewish homeland is the only democracy in this broader region of  continuing conflict. I abhor the terrorist acts. Israel's security  merits our support, which is why the Obama administration, with  Congress' approval, just awarded an unprecedented amount of military  aid over the next 10 years.   But, unfortunately, Israel's future is being threatened by its own  actions as well as by its adversaries. For years, reckless settlement  expansion has been opposed by the United States and the rest of the  world. They are confiscating Palestinian land in a way that is not just  contrary to longstanding American policy, but is often illegal under  Israeli law.   It looks like the incoming Trump administration is reconsidering 50  years of bipartisan policy, urged on by the extremist views of his  proposed Ambassador whose position on settlement expansion is on the  fringe of even Israeli politics.   H. Res. 11 sends the wrong signal to the incoming President, to  Israeli politicians, and especially to the Israeli people. It drives a  wedge between Israel and the majority of Americans, including the  majority of Jewish Americans. It weakens that special relationship and  furthers the isolation of Israel, in evidence as the resolution was  approved unanimously by the other 14 countries. Israel will become more  vulnerable and, candidly, it will likely embolden forces that are  hostile to the Jewish state.   Instead of this resolution, we should reject the rule and support the  resolution I cosponsored with Mr. Price that reaffirms our commitment  to the longstanding American policy in support of a two-state solution  and to help secure Israel's future as a stable, democratic, peaceful  state.                                time  1330    Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. McClintock).   Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I support the REINS Act and the rule that brings it to  us, but I want to underscore the point made earlier by Mr. Barr.   The REINS Act says that any regulation--that is, an act with the  force of law--adopted by the executive branch and costs more than $100  million must then be approved by Congress to take effect.   As necessary as this bill is in the current environment, I am afraid  it has got it completely backwards. Under the Constitution read on this  floor today, it is not the role of the executive branch to make law and  for the legislative branch then to approve or veto it. Quite the  contrary, making law is the singular prerogative of the legislative  branch; the executive then approves or vetoes that law.   The REINS Act is necessary solely because for years Congress has  improperly ceded its lawmaking powers to the executive, and it is time  we restored the proper role of the legislative branch to make law and  for the executive branch to faithfully execute it.   Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly).
