 Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member  Brady for yielding. I am so used to calling him chairman, but I look  across the aisle to my great friend Richard Neal, who is chairman right  now, and I thank him so much for bringing this up today.   Madam Speaker, I enter into the Record a letter in support of the  SECURE Act from AARP.                                                           AARP,                                                       May 22, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our nearly 38 million       members and all older Americans, AARP supports the Setting       Every Community Up for Retirement Act of 2019 (SECURE Act).        The SECURE Act contains a number of provisions that will       improve both access and levels of coverage in employer-      sponsored retirement savings plans. The legislation would       enhance tax credits for employers that offer retirement plans       with automatic enrollment and encourage more adequate       deferral amounts. The legislation would also make it easier       for small businesses to offer employees an automatic savings       option through a multiple employer pension plan--a single       plan in which a pooled provider assumes the primary fiduciary       duties, making it easier for smaller employers to join       together to offer a retirement plan to their workers.        Another important component of the SECURE Act is the       expansion of access to retirement savings plans for part-time       workers. There are more than 27 million part-time workers in       the U.S., including more  [[Page H4138]]       than seven million Americans age 55 and older. According to       AARP research, 38 percent of those age 25 to 49 and 26       percent of those age 50 to 64 who work part-time do so       because of caregiving responsibilities--either for children       or an adult loved one. Helping these workers save for       retirement through a workplace savings plan would be       important for their long-term financial security. The bill       would be especially helpful to both caregivers and older       workers who shift from full-time to part time status.        The bill would also give workers more information to       prepare for retirement as well as protections to safeguard       their hard-earned savings. It would require that workers'       benefit statements add a lifetime income disclosure so that       the statements show not just a lump sum, but the monthly       value of their savings at retirement. Seniors would also be       able to delay the required draw down of retirement savings       until age 72, giving them more time to accumulate savings.       The bill would also clarify rules on how employers and plans       may select appropriate lifetime income payments. It is       important to retain strong fiduciary law protections that       ensure all retirement plan decisions, including for pooled       plans and annuity selections, are made solely in the interest       of participants and beneficiaries.        We urge you to vote YES on the SECURE Act, and look forward       to working with you to enact legislation to enhance the       ability of American workers to save for a secure retirement.       If you have any questions, please feel free to call me, or       have your staff contact Michele Varnhagen on our Government       Affairs staff.            Sincerely,                                               Nancy A. LeaMond,                                        Executive Vice President and                             Chief Advocacy and Engagement Officer.     Madam Speaker, this is an unusual day. In  many cases, it is providential, as we look on the eve of the time that  we take to honor our fallen war dead.   Some people confuse it with the beginning of summer or the opening of  our swimming pools. It has nothing to do with that.   But the fact that we can talk today about the SECURE Act--and when  you talk about ``secure,'' what does ``secure'' mean? It means giving  you certainty, making you assured, and making something reliable,  something dependable, something that is fixed, something that is  established, and something that is solid and sound.   What we are doing today is acting in the best interests of the  American people. We are doing it in the people's House at a time when  the rest of the Nation looks at us and asks, ``Isn't there anything  they can do together to help the American people?''   When I go home, I say, yes, there is. I have a great friend from  Wisconsin, Ron Kind, and we feel the same way. I talked with Mr. Brady  about it, and we feel the same way. I have talked with Mr. Neal about  it, and we feel the same way.   Today's effort is adding security in retirement years for every  American, the opportunity to go into those golden years with a little  gold in their pockets so that they can get through it, giving them  peace of mind in being able to lay their heads on the pillows at night  feeling safe and secure, knowing that they have prepared for their  retirements.   There are many other pieces to this bill. We have talked about the  provisions to the Gold Star program. So if something was wrong, we made  it right.   The 529 programs give people the opportunity to actually save and  allocate money for the education of their children.                                time  0930    It may not be in a 4-year college. Maybe it is a vocational  opportunity. But it is there. It is their money, and they should be  able to use it the way they want to use it.   I just said earlier about it being providential, and I mean that  sincerely. There will be a few times today that the American people  will look at us and say: They really have our best interests at heart.  They really go to work every day thinking that they are not  representing themselves but representing us, the American people.   When I look at this piece of legislation, I know how hard we worked  with the chairman to get it through in the past sessions. We almost got  it there but didn't quite get it there.   Madam Speaker, I say to Chairman Neal, we are getting there. We are  getting there. And I say to Mr. Kind, we are getting there.   I just think that it is such a fantastic opportunity to show the  American people who we really are and what we really do and where our  hearts really lie.   There are so many people who worked on this. Also, the staff. I thank  Kara for doing the work that she has done. I always call her my girl  Friday. In our office, Lori Prater. They all work so closely together.  I wish the American people could see the camaraderie, could see how  well we work together, and could understand that our concerns and their  concerns are the same.   I am saying today that the SECURE Act gives us that opportunity. The  time for the American people and retired people is just beginning, and  we have blue skies and strong winds on our backs.   Madam Speaker, I wish everybody the best Memorial Day ever, and let's  not forget our fallen heroes.
