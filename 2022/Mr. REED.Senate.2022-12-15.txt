 Mr. President, I stand in opposition to the proposed  amendment.   On August 24, 2021, the Secretary of Defense issued a legal order  directive that all personnel in the U.S. forces should be vaccinated  against COVID-19. At that point, it was an approved FDA pharmaceutical.  It is a legally binding order.   We need a healthy and ready force to defend the United States, and I  think we've forgotten where we were before the vaccine. For example,  the USS Theodore Roosevelt, one of the most important aircraft carriers  in our fleet, and particularly in the Pacific, was effectively put out  of commission when 27 percent of her crew were infected with COVID.  Hundreds were hospitalized. The carrier had to dock in Guam for 2  months. For 2 months, we did not have the striking power of an American  aircraft carrier in the Pacific.   Since Secretary Austin's mandate, we have had no repeat incidents  where a naval vessel had to be, essentially, taken out of service, nor  in the other services have we seen anything like that.   Mandatory vaccination is not a new issue for military personnel.  Servicemembers are commonly required to get  [[Page S7234]]  17 different vaccinations when they enter the military or when they  deploy to serve overseas areas, including measles, mumps, diphtheria,  hepatitis, smallpox, and flu.   In fact, the first mandatory vaccination was ordered by General  George Washington for the smallpox during the American Revolution.   The Department of Defense issued the COVID-19 vaccine mandate. It was  a lawful order. The department made its expectations very clear, a  personnel could take the vaccine or they could request an exemption,  but if their exemption was denied and they still refused the shot, they  would be discharged.   In the U.S. military, a lawful order is not a suggestion; it is a  command. And for those of us who have the privilege of commanding  American military personnel, that is the essence of order and  discipline in the U.S. military, which distinguishes us from many other  services throughout the world.   Ninety percent of our troops are vaccinated because they are putting  their Nation, their fellow soldiers, and their families ahead of their  personal opinions or personal desires. That is the function of the  military, this unswerving dedication to Nation and to following and to  protecting their fellow personnel.   What message do we send if we pass this bill? It is a very dangerous  one. What we are telling soldiers is: If you disagree, don't follow the  order. And then just lobby Congress. And they will come along, and they  will restore your rank. They will restore your benefits. They will  restore everything. So orders are just sort of a suggestion. They are  not.   Let me conclude by this: This is a critical line in the U.S. oath of  enlistment.         I will obey the orders of the President of the United       States and the orders of the officers appointed over me.    That is what we are talking about tonight. We must reject this  amendment to reaffirm that oath, that commitment, that pillar of  American military discipline and order.    Mr. President, I have a much longer statement, but I want  to briefly rise to express my support for the Fiscal Year 2023 National  Defense Authorization Act. I am pleased that we are about to pass it.   First, let me acknowledge Ranking Member Inhofe, whose leadership on  the Armed Services Committee and in this Chamber has been monumental.   For more than 20 years I have had the privilege of serving with him  on the committee. In turn, we have been chairman and ranking member.  And I am honored that this year's bill will be named the James M.  Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act.   (Applause, Senators rising.)   Mr. President, I would also like to add my congratulations and thanks  to the House Armed Services Chairman,  [[Page S7235]]  Adam Smith, and Ranking Member   Mike Rogers. Their partnership was  absolutely invaluable to make this moment possible.    Mr. President, I yield back all time.                           Vote on Motion to Concur     Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the fiscal  year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act. I am pleased that we have  just voted on a wide, bipartisan basis to approve this bill.   First, I would like to acknowledge Ranking Member Inhofe, whose  leadership on the Armed Services Committee and in this Chamber has been  monumental. For more than 20 years, I have had the privilege to serve  with him on the Armed Services Committee, in turn each of us serving as  chairman and ranking member. In honor of his well-earned retirement, I  am pleased that the committee voted to name this year's bill the James  M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act.   I would also thank my colleagues from the House Armed Services  Committee, Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Rogers. Their partnership  made this bill possible.   As we enact the NDAA, we must keep in mind that the United States is  engaged in a long-term strategic competition with China. Beijing poses  a serious potential threat to our national security, as the only  country in the world capable of mounting a sustained challenge to our  interests.   In addition, Russia has demonstrated its willingness to inflict  violence and undermine the global order while states like Iran and  North Korea continue to push the boundaries of military brinkmanship.  Threats like terrorism, climate change, and pandemics remain  persistent.   The interconnected nature of these problems must drive how we  transform our tools of national power. The passage of the FY23 NDAA  will be a critical step toward meeting these complex challenges.   Turning to the specifics of this year's defense bill. The NDAA  authorizes $817 billion for the Department of Defense and $29 billion  for national security programs within the Department of Energy. This  includes a $45 billion boost to address inflation, accelerate the  production of certain munitions, and increase procurement of aircraft,  ships, submarines, armored vehicles, long-range artillery, and other  resources needed by the services and combatant commands.   The bill contains a number of important provisions that I would like  to briefly highlight.   To begin, we have to ensure the United States can out-compete, deter,  and prevail against our near-peer rivals. This NDAA confronts China and  Russia by increasing our investments in the Pacific Deterrence  Initiative, the European Deterrence Initiative, and the Ukraine  Security Assistance Initiative. It also authorizes the Taiwan Enhanced  Resilience Act of 2022, which is designed to increase our security  cooperation with Taiwan.   Importantly, this year's NDAA provides a 4.6-percent pay raise for  both military servicemembers and the Department of Defense civilian  workforce. It also authorizes funding to ease the impacts of inflation  on the force and increases the resources available to support military  families.   The bill includes new support for our industrial base to produce the  munitions needed to backfill our stocks, while also keeping supplies  flowing to Ukraine and other European allies. Moreover, the bill  authorizes $1 billion for the National Defense Stockpile to acquire  rare earths and critical minerals needed to help meet the defense,  industrial, and civilian needs of the United States.  [[Page S7237]]    America's capacity for technological innovation has long given us the  strongest economy and military on earth, but this advantage is not a  given; it must be nurtured and maintained. To that end, this year's  NDAA authorizes significant funding increases for cutting-edge  technologies like microelectronics, hypersonic weapons, and low-cost  unmanned aircraft. Similarly, it increases funding to support U.S.  Cyber Command's Hunt Forward Operations and artificial intelligence  capabilities.   And, as we navigate threats of nuclear escalation from Russia and  increasing capabilities from China, the NDAA enhances our deterrence  strategy by helping to modernize the U.S. nuclear triad. It makes  progress toward ensuring the security of our nuclear stockpile,  delivery systems, and infrastructure; increasing capacity in missile  defense; and strengthening nonproliferation programs.   This bill was originally crafted by the Armed Services Committee  after a series of thoughtful hearings, discussions, and debates on both  sides of the aisle. Through the committee markup process, we considered  more than 443 amendments and ultimately adopted 233 of them. Senator  Inhofe and I introduced this bill to the full Senate with the intent of  adding more amendments on the floor. Although we were not able to come  to hold debate on the floor, we were ultimately able to adopt  amendments from Senators on both sides of the aisle in the final  legislation, including several major authorization bills from other  committees.   Over the past several weeks, the Senate and House Armed Services  Committees have worked around the clock to come to an agreement on this  final version. I am proud of the improvements we made throughout this  process, and I was pleased to see the House vote last week in an  overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion, 350-80, to pass the bill. We have  produced a strong NDAA that both parties, both Chambers, and the  President will be able to sign.   I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the phenomenal  staff who made this bill possible. There are dozens of staff across the  committees and floor who worked tirelessly to bring us to this point,  and we are all immensely grateful for their dedication. I will submit  each of their names for the record. I want to specifically recognize  the director for the Armed Services Democratic staff, Elizabeth King,  and the director for the Republican staff, John Wason. They have led  their staffs admirably and collaborated with bipartisanship, diligence,  and skill.   I would also like to thank members of the Armed Services Committee  staff: Jody Bennett, Carolyn Chuhta, Jon Clark, Jenny Davis, Jonathan  Epstein, Jorie Feldman, Kevin Gates, Creighton Greene, Gary Leeling,  Kirk McConnell, Maggie McNamara Cooper, Bill Monahan, Mike Noblet, John  Quirk, Andy Scott, Cole Stevens, Brittany Amador, Patrick Shilo, Alison  Warner, Leah Brewer, Megan Lustig, Joe Gallo, Chad Johnson, Jessica  Lewis, Griffin Cannon, Brandon Kasprick, Sofia Kamali, Vannary Kong,  and, once again, staff director Elizabeth King.   Let me conclude by once again thanking Ranking Member Inhofe,  Chairman Smith, and Ranking Member Rogers for working thoughtfully and  on a bipartisan basis to develop this important piece of legislation.   Finally, I thank my colleagues for voting in favor of this excellent  bill.
