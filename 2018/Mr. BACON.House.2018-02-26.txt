 Mr. Speaker, in honor of Women's History Month, I rise to  recognize a woman dedicated to journalistic integrity, who made history  as Omaha's first female TV news director. Rose Ann Shannon recently  retired after 45 years in TV news and was a mentor to many local and  national reporters.   When Rose Ann started her career at KMTV in 1973, she was one of only  three women in Omaha TV news. After KMTV, Rose Ann worked as a  communications director for Omaha's mayor, then returned to TV news at  KETV. She was then promoted to news director, the first female TV news  director in Omaha. KETV's general manager said Rose Ann exemplified  ``integrity-first journalism at its core.''   Rose Ann is a trailblazer who shattered a glass ceiling. She served  as a mentor to men and women in the industry, ensuring reporters  connected to the public through ``integrity-first reporting and  truth.''                            ____________________
