 Mr. Speaker, I was absent during rollcall vote Nos.  403 through 406 due to my spouse's health situation in California. Had  I been present, I would have voted ``no'' on H.R. 2825--DHS  Authorization Act of 2017, ``yea'' on the Tsongas Amendment, ``yea'' on  the Grijalva Amendment, and ``no'' on final passage of H.R. 218--King  Cove Road Land Exchange Act.                            ____________________
