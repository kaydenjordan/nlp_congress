 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I think the interesting part of our conversation tonight  is what we are talking about. We are talking about the Born-Alive  Abortion Survivors Protection Act; the born-alive abortion survivors.  This is such a commonsense bill, it just protects our children.   I wonder what people think about this: in the case of an abortion or  an attempted abortion that results in a child being born alive, any  healthcare practitioner present must exercise professional care to  preserve the life of the child. The child must be immediately  transported and admitted to a hospital.  [[Page H465]]    This bill is needed to protect our children. Americans have seen the  horrifying videos of Planned Parenthood, and the Judiciary Committee  has heard testimony from women who have survived and whose children  have survived abortion.   But I think what is more chilling than anything, in the United States  of America--the biggest defender of life, and liberty, and freedom in  the world, that is our history--we have to pass a law that protects  children who survive an attempted abortion. These are children that are  born alive. It is incredible that we have to even have that discussion  in the people's House, especially the United States of America.   Where have we become this depraved of what our moral constitution  needs to be?   It is unbelievable that we have to come to this House and on this  floor and defend those lives.   Now, it has been said oftentimes that 90 percent of life is showing  up, because when you show up, people know you care. On Friday, hundreds  of thousands of Americans from all over our country will come to  Washington, D.C., in the March for Life. They have done this for 45  years. For 45 years, their passion has never diminished. For 45 years,  they have made the trip to Washington, D.C., so that our country's  leaders, political leaders, understand the sanctity of life. It is  incredible that we have to go through this process.                                time  1930    The United States is only one of seven countries in the world that  allows abortion after 5 months. I wish we would quit using the term 20  weeks--5 months. Who is included in that group? North Korea, Vietnam,  and China. What a wonderful group to be part of.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman because he has fought this fight  for so long. I ask Mr. Smith to just think of the last 45 years, the  number of people who have come here, the number of people who have  marched for life, and we talk about what it is that we are trying to  get to.   Now, we know there has been 60 million abortions--60 million little  boys and little girls who never got to live the full potential of their  life. But through the efforts of the pro-life movement, what we can  count are the numbers of expectant mothers who were going to have an  abortion, but, through the efforts of people like Chris Smith, stopped  and thought for a minute about what it was they were actually going to  do, and that was end a life. We don't have those numbers, but I have to  tell you, they have to be off the charts.   Another thing I think is so important, for those folks who did go  through an abortion, it is time for them to know that there is  forgiveness and there is mercy. There is always room in our hearts to  embrace them and get them through that difficult period.   Mr. Speaker, I can't tell you how important this piece of legislation  is. It is just so chilling. I am going to repeat it again: a law that  allows children who are born alive in an attempted abortion have got to  be protected by the people's House. Where in our hearts, as human  beings, do we not understand the basic moral obligations and rights  that we have?   It is just so hard to come here year after year to do this. But for  45 years--for 45 years--they have shown up in droves, millions and  millions of Americans, talking about life and protecting life. We have  another chance this Friday for all of us to show up and for all of us  to be there. I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, 90 percent of life is  showing up because people know you care.   I thank Mr. Smith of New Jersey so much for showing up for 45 years.  We do know the gentleman cares, and we do know his compassion and his  dedication to life.
