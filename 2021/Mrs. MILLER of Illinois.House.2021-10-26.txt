 Madam Speaker, we face an unprecedented  assault on the American way of life by the radical left.   Under President Biden's leadership, the left has weaponized the  Federal Government to go after the American people.   President Biden is building an IRS army of 85,000 new IRS agents to  investigate middle-class Americans and ruin their lives. The Biden IRS  wants the power to spy on private citizens' bank accounts and monitor  their transactions.   Biden's Treasury Secretary said her next goal is to create a new tax  on the value of farmland in America. This will destroy the American  family farm and eliminate independent food production.   The Biden-Harris administration is also weaponizing OSHA to fire  Americans who live paycheck to paycheck if they don't make a healthcare  decision about vaccines that leftwing politicians don't like.   Madam Speaker, I note this hypocrisy from pro-abortion liberals who  use the ``my body my choice'' slogan. We watched last week as Biden's  Attorney General tried to defend the use of the FBI agents who  intimidated, harassed, and want to spy on parents who show up to school  board meetings to speak in opposition to the Biden agenda.   Middle-class parents are rightfully outraged that President Biden and  leftwing school boards want to turn their children against each other  with racist curriculum or indoctrinate their young children with  perverted sexual content.   Americans used to be protected by the First Amendment. They were  allowed to speak freely in our society. Our Constitution and Bill of  Rights limit the power of the Federal Government because our Nation is  a place where people should be free to start independent small  businesses and raise their own children.                                time  1045    The Biden administration and the radical left have a far different  agenda. They want to use the FBI to intimidate and harass Americans;  they want to use the IRS to spy on Americans; and they want to use OSHA  to fire Americans.   The Federal Government is now a tool, a weapon that they want to use  to make Americans obey. My constituents and the American people will  not be intimidated by the Biden administration or the radical left,  Madam Speaker. We are born free and our rights come from God.   Our response to a weaponized Federal Government is loud and clear. In  the spirit of freedom, we say: Let's go, Brandon.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I cannot in good conscience  support legislation that opens the door to Federal dollars being used  to harm our most vulnerable--the unborn.   Current law prohibits Federal funding from being used to pay for  reimbursements for medical services while still allowing domestic  violence victims to obtain referrals to have their healthcare needs  met. This prohibition, coupled with the longstanding Hyde amendment  included in annual appropriations, has long been supported by  Democrats, including President Biden.   This precedent ensures that tax dollars under this law do not pay for  abortion services either directly or indirectly.   Sadly, committee Democrats are proposing to strike this prohibition  from the law. Along with their public intentions to strike the Hyde  amendment, I am concerned that this bill could lead to taxpayer dollars  being used to fund abortions instead.   My amendment would have maintained current law and made clear that  [[Page H5899]]  FVPSA funds cannot be used for abortion services or abortion referrals.  This will ensure that even as Democrats make an extreme push to repeal  Hyde, these funds will not be used for such services.   A Marist Poll from earlier this year indicated that 58 percent of  Americans opposed taxpayer funding of abortion--or we could say  inducement for women to have abortions. We should not force taxpayers  to fund services that violate their strongly held beliefs. This  amendment ensures that this does not occur.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this  amendment.
