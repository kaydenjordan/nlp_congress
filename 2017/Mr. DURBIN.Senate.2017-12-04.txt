Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Madam President, we had a press conference in Chicago  this afternoon, and several young people were there. One is named Zarna  Patel. Zarna is a student at the Loyola University Stritch School of  Medicine. She is from a family that came to the United States from  India. They brought her here when she was 3 years old.   When she was growing up, she didn't realize that she was  undocumented. She thought she was just like everybody else in her  classroom, standing up, pledging allegiance to that flag, and singing  the national anthem. It was the only national anthem she knew. But then  came high school, and she came to realize that she was different. She  wasn't documented. She wasn't ``legally in America.''   Well, she soldiered on with her life and did quite well. She  graduated from college with a degree in science. She prayed and hoped  the day would come when she could go to medical school. Loyola  University in Chicago offered her--and others like her, who were  protected by President Obama's Executive order known as DACA--an  opportunity to apply for medical school. They didn't get quotas. It  wasn't any kind of affirmative action program. It just said you can  compete with all the other students. The word got out around America to  those who were protected by President Obama's order that there was a  medical school that would accept you if you were protected. The net  result of that was over 30 were admitted. They are so extraordinary,  some of the best. They were admitted to medical school, and she is one  of them. It is a great story, really.   She is realizing her dream to become a doctor, but there is a  problem. The problem is that on September 5, President Trump decided to  abolish DACA, the program that protects Zarna Patel, and in abolishing  it--announcing that he would on March 5 of next year--it meant that she  would then lose the protection she had under the previous Executive  order.   What difference does it make? Well, it means that she is then subject  to deportation, but equally important in her life, she loses the right  to legally work in America. You say that she is a student and maybe she  doesn't need to work. Well, as a student, she doesn't qualify for any  Federal assistance because she is undocumented, and as a student in a  medical school, to further your education, you need a residency. We  know a residency means an awful lot of hours of working in a hospital  that is teaching you how to be a doctor and develop your specialty. So  you can't have a residency if you can't legally work in America. That  means that, after all of these years of work, it is over; she can't  apply for a residency.   The senior Senator from Texas came to the floor and said: Let's not  have a hurry-up approach to this issue. Let's slow it down a little  bit. The President announced on September 5 that he was going to  abolish protection for Zarna Patel and for 780,000 others just like  her. Here we are, 3 months later, having done nothing.   Many of us feel a sense of urgency because these young people have  their lives on hold. They are living with the anxiety and stress of not  knowing whether they will be deported tomorrow or can work. It is a  simple thing to many of us as we read about it. It is life and death in  the future for these young people.   So when we say to the Senator from Texas that we need to get this  done, it isn't like the Senate is overwhelmed with work. I didn't have  to come down here and beg for an opportunity to speak on the floor. You  can see it is empty, and it has been empty most of the year. We have  done precious little this year. I can point to three or four things the  Senate has accomplished. We had plenty of time to address this and  still do, but it takes a will on the part of the majority to get this  done.   I want to thank several Republican Senators who have stepped up to  try to help me get this done, especially Lindsey Graham, a Republican  of South Carolina and my cosponsor of the Dream Act, and other Senators  who are sponsoring it and trying to move this forward. Senator Jeff  Flake, last week, announced that his vote on the tax plan was  contingent on a conversation he had with the White House about this  issue of DACA and the Dream Act.   The senior Senator from Texas comes to the floor and says I haven't  really reached out to him or spoken to him about this. He must have  forgotten that I handed him this sheet of paper last week. This was our  proposal on border security in the hopes that, by being serious about  border security, we could get Republican Senators to join us when it  came to protecting those who qualified for DACA in the Dream Act. I  gave this to Senator Cornyn. He knows it. I like him. He is my friend.  But we have to reach the point where we realize that there is a sense  of urgency here. I hear the Senator from Texas say: Well, maybe next  year we will get around to it. As of March 5, this program ends, and as  of March 5, 1,000 young people will lose their protection every single  day for 2 years.   What it means for Zarna Patel and others is the end of a dream, the  end of an opportunity to pursue an education. She is not the only one.  She is 1 of 30 or 32 at the Loyola Stritch School of Medicine. There  are 900 of these young people who currently have volunteered to serve  in the U.S. military under the MAVNI Program. If we don't renew this  program, they are gone. Think of that. They are technically  undocumented and illegal in this country. They volunteered to risk  their lives for America in service to our country. Now the Senator from  Texas says: Well, we are in no hurry to tell them whether they can  continue to serve in our military.   As we look across America, we have 20,000 teachers. I met one of  those last Friday in Chicago. She is 24 years old, teaching in an  inner-city school, and protected by DACA. The minute DACA ends on March  5 of next year, she can no longer legally work in the Chicago Public  Schools system. She is finished. Pack up, clean out your desk, and go  home.  [[Page S7814]]    Is that what we want to see happen across America? We know what these  young people are doing. They are going to school. They are working  while going to school. They are teachers. They are nurses. They are  involved as first responders and law enforcement. They are in medical  school.   The Senator from Texas questions why I am in such a hurry to get this  done? I am in a hurry to get this done, and he should join me in  understanding that there is a sense of urgency here. There are a lot of  rumors flying around here. I am not going to honor any of them as to  what might occur, other than to say, when we get Senators who are  willing to sit down and accept the principle of the Dream Act, that the  principle is that those who were brought here as children, who have  grown up in the United States, who have no serious criminal charges in  their records, and who have completed school have a chance to become  legal and become citizens--that is the fundamental of the Dream Act.   It is a bill I introduced 16 years ago. I am still trying to pass it.  There are bills that are not identical but are very similar that accept  that premise and have been offered twice by Republicans as well.   So if the Senator from Texas will start with the Dream Act, we can  then engage in additional conversations about border security. He can  take the draft I gave him last week, which includes, incidentally, 12  provisions from his own bill. The Senator from Texas had a bill drafted  on border security. We read it. We picked up 12 of the major provisions  and included them in our offer to try to get this done in an expedited  way.   I will just tell you this. If any Senators want to come to the floor  and say it is not that important, it isn't timely, we need not hurry  about this, we can get around to it later, I would like them to come  home with me. Maybe they should even go home to their own States and  meet with these young people and realize that their lives are on hold  because we have put this issue on hold.   For goodness' sake, let us face our responsibilities as Senators.  Let's do what we are supposed to do--legislate solutions to problems.  The President challenged us. He said: I am going to abolish this  program; now Congress, you pass a law to create it. He challenged us.  Let us accept the challenge and do it in a bipartisan professional way.  That is all I have ever asked for and all I continue to ask for.   Yes, I want it done this calendar year. I don't want excuses about  maybe next January or maybe next February, because we know that on  March 5, when the deadline hits, it will be a disaster for 1,000 of  these young people every single day. Yes, there is a sense of urgency.  Yes, there is a need for us to work together. I am going to continue to  meet with Republican Senators and Democrats to find a solution, to find  a way through this, and to get it done this month in December. How can  we, in good conscience, pass a spending bill giving authority and  resources to this administration to go out and arrest and deport these  young people and not address the underlying issue of their legality and  their future in the United States? That, to me, is obvious.   I hope my colleagues, those of good will and good faith, will join me  in making sure that we don't go home for the holidays until we get this  job done.    I announce that the Senator from Minnesota (Ms.  Klobuchar), the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Merkley), the Senator from  Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are  necessarily absent.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lankford). Are there any other Senators in  the Chamber desiring to vote?
