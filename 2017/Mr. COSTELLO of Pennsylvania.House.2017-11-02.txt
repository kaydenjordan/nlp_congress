 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of H.R. 849, the Protecting Seniors' Access to Medicare Act.   Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legislation would bring an end to the  Independent Payment Advisory Board, also known as the IPAB. Since its  creation as part of the ACA, the IPAB has threatened to put an  unelected panel of 15 Washington bureaucrats at the center of the  healthcare delivery model.   Not only would the IPAB shift healthcare decisionmaking away from  patients and physicians, it would also empower this panel with the  unilateral ability to make arbitrary cuts to Medicare without proper  oversight and with zero accountability to the very seniors and  beneficiaries whose healthcare access they would affect.   Mr. Speaker, it is time to end this unrealistic, unreasonable, and  unpopular one-size-fits-all approach to healthcare delivery. It was the  wrong approach from the start, and today's vote will help bring an end  to this dangerous power grab once and for all.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all those involved, and I encourage my  colleagues to support this important bipartisan effort.  [[Page H8419]]
