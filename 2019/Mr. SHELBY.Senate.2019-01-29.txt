 Madam President, today I wish to call attention to  the special significance of the year 2019 in our great State of  Alabama. This year we celebrate the 200th anniversary of our State and  my hometown, the city of Tuscaloosa.   Tuscaloosa was incorporated on December 13, 1819, which was one day  before the State of Alabama was admitted to the Union. Beginning in  1826 and extending for more than two decades, Tuscaloosa was the State  capital of Alabama. This period marked the historic opening of the  University of Alabama, the construction of a stately capitol building,  and the city's transformation as a center for education, healthcare,  and industry. Strategically situated on the banks of the Black Warrior  River, Tuscaloosa became a thriving hub for foundries, cotton mills,  forestry, and marine commerce.   Founded in Tuscaloosa in 1831, the University of Alabama, which is  the beloved alma mater of my family along with countless others, has  become one of America's premier public research universities. The  Capstone of education, the University serves the citizens of Alabama as  well as students, faculty, and staff who come from throughout the  United States and around the globe to pursue a world-class education at  both the undergraduate and graduate levels. The university proudly  partners with Stillman College and Shelton State Community College, as  well as an abundant community of K-12 schools, to hold stature as a  major center for educational excellence.   Today Tuscaloosa is recognized as one of the region's most  economically prosperous cities. International corporations join  homegrown industries and businesses to provide a robust climate for job  creation, industrial expansion, and a quality of life that is envied  and admired by one and all. Recreational amenities, cultural gems, and  championship athletic teams are legendary.   On December 13, 2018, the Tuscaloosa Bicentennial Commission  dedicated Bicentennial Square in Government Plaza, located in the heart  of the city's burgeoning downtown district. Over the next 12 months,  citizens will join together in a diverse calendar of events and  programs that will educate, celebrate, and feature 2019 as a year to  remember.   I share in the Record a schedule of events for ``Tuscaloosa 200,''  together with the names of the bicentennial commission members who,  along with dozens of other volunteers, have devoted countless hours to  planning and organizing the bicentennial commemoration, as well as the  companies whose generosity made possible the extensive, yearlong  celebration: dedication of Bicentennial Square at Government Plaza,  December 13, 2018; ringing in Tuscaloosa 200 bicentennial fireworks,  December 31, 2018, at the Tuscaloosa Amphitheatre; Tuscaloosa 200  bicentennial launch ceremony, January 31, 2019, at the Tuscaloosa  RiverMarket; the Bicentennial Bash Family Activities and Music  Saturday, March 30, 2019, at the Tuscaloosa Amphitheatre; ``Tuscaloosa  Through Time'' history expo, April 24-27, 2019, at the Bryant  Conference Center; ``Welcome Back to T-Town Celebration'' in  conjunction with the Druid City Music Festival, Friday and Saturday,  August 23-24, 2019; community book experience, ``the History of  Tuscaloosa,'' by Dr. Guy Hubbs, September 22, 2019, Federal courthouse;  and Tuscaloosa 200 birthday party and holiday parade, Friday, December  13, 2019, preceded by ``200 Voices for Tuscaloosa,'' December 12, 2019,  Moody Concert Hall.
