 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay special recognition to  Ms. Iris Bartley from my hometown of Tompkinsville, Kentucky, who  recently celebrated her 100th birthday.   While many may begin slowing down when they reach this incredible  milestone, that is not who Iris is. A mother of 4, grandmother of 14,  great-grandmother of 30, and great-great-grandmother of 7, Iris can  still be found weed-eating at her home and teaching Sunday school at my  church, First Baptist in Tompkinsville, Kentucky.   An accomplished musician, she is also known for her famous singing  and guitar playing.   After opening a beauty shop in her own home in the mid-1940s, Iris  was a hairstylist in Tompkinsville until retiring at the young age of  92.   Born and raised on a farm, she never forgot the values of hard work,  faith, and family. She has always lived out those values while also  instilling them in her children and their families.   While I know she still has many good years left, I, nonetheless,  wanted to take this time to honor Iris for reaching the century mark. I  am honored to represent someone as respected as Iris, along with the  rest of my constituents in the First Congressional District.                            ____________________
