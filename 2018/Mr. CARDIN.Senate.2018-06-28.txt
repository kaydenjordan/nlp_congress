 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with  my colleague from Maryland, Senator Ben Cardin, which would increase  access to preventive bone density screenings and improve osteoporosis  diagnosis and treatment in the process. We are pleased to have Senators  Wicker, King, and Stabenow as cosponsors.   The public health risk of osteoporosis cannot be understated. Today,  approximately 54 million Americans either have osteoporosis or low bone  mass, which places them at increased risk for osteoporosis. Women are  disproportionally affected, accounting for 71 percent of osteoporotic  fractures and 75 percent of costs. Osteoporosis is often called ``the  silent disease'' because bone loss usually occurs gradually over the  years without symptoms.   As the NIH Osteoporosis and Related Bone Disease National Resource  Center observes, falls are especially dangerous for people who are  unaware that they have low bone density. If the patient and the doctor  fail to connect the broken bone to osteoporosis, the chance to make a  diagnosis with a bone density test and begin a prevention or treatment  program is lost.   Early diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis are proven to  dramatically reduce fracture rates, and appropriate reimbursement for  tests that measure bone mass and predict fracture risk are necessary to  maintain patient access to care, particularly in rural or underserved  areas. Our legislation, the Increasing Access to Osteoporosis Testing  for Medicare Beneficiaries Act of 2018, tackles a proven barrier to  proper screening by creating a floor reimbursement rate under Medicare  for the dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) test, the ``gold  standard'' for osteoporosis diagnosis.   Congress has twice recognized the importance of reversing Medicare  cuts to DXA reimbursement in order to maintain patient access, yet the  Medicare reimbursement rate for DXA tests administered in a doctor's  office has declined from $140 in 2006 to only $42 in 2018--a dramatic  70 percent decline. The National Osteoporosis Foundation has found that  declining reimbursement rates have created a 26 percent decline in  physicians performing DXA tests since 2008, resulting in a  corresponding 22 percent decline in diagnoses since 2009.   Regrettably, as a result of reduced screenings due to declining  reimbursements, it is estimated that more than 40,000 additional hip  fractures occur each year, resulting in nearly 10,000 additional hip  fracture-related deaths. As osteoporosis is already under-diagnosed in  the Medicare population, it is clear that we must change this  trajectory.   This legislation is endorsed by the American Association of Clinical  Endocrinologists, the National Osteoporosis Foundation, and more than  forty additional national medical societies and patient advocate  organizations. I thank Senator Cardin for joining me in this effort to  increase patient access to osteoporosis screening and diagnosis, while  lowering costs and consequences resulting from a lack of diagnosis. I  encourage my colleagues to support its adoption.                                  ______                                         By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mrs. Murray):   S. 3162. A bill to provide oversight of the border zone in which  Federal agents may conduct vehicle checkpoints and stops and enter  private land  [[Page S4738]]  without a warrant, and to make technical corrections; to the Committee  on the Judiciary.

I  encourage my colleagues to support its adoption.                                  ______    Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is passing a  resolution I introduced along with Senators Collins, Wyden, Gardner,  and Bennet to commemorate the American Homebrewers Association's (AHA)  40th ``birthday''. Since its founding in 1978, the AHA--whose mission  is to promote the community of homebrewers and empower homebrewers to  make the best beer in the world--has had a tremendous impact on  America, both within and well beyond the scope of beer. After then- President Jimmy Carter signed the momentous legislation (Public Law 95- 458) to legalize homebrewing at the federal level, the AHA worked  ceaselessly and successfully to extend that legalization to all 50  States and the District of Columbia.   Today, the AHA has over 46,000 dues-paying members and works on  behalf of more than 1.1 million homebrewers in our Nation. While the  AHA was established in 1978, homebrewing has been an important part of  our Nation's life from its inception. The Pilgrims landed at Plymouth  Rock because they were running out of beer, which was safer to drink  than water (each adult on board had a ration of one gallon of beer per  day). Presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison  were all homebrewers who enjoyed crafting their own libations. In 2011,  President Obama introduced a honey ale which became the first beer  known to have been brewed in the White House.   Homebrewing isn't just a wonderfully delicious hobby; however. Home- brewing has an important economic impact, creating thousands of jobs  and adding hundreds of millions of dollars to the economy. There are  more than 700 homebrew shops nationwide, and scores of small businesses  that fabricate the brewing, fermenting, and packaging equipment  homebrewers use. Homebrewers also support American agriculture, with  their demand for domestic malts, hops, yeast, and other ingredients. In  the aggregate, American homebrewers produce 1.4 million barrels of beer  each year. That production level puts homebrewers between the Boston  Beer Company and the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company, which are the  second and third largest craft brewing companies in America,  respectively.   Homebrewing is collaborative and social. The AHA hosts major events  that bring thousands of people together, including the National  Homebrewers Conference, the National Homebrew Competition, the Big Brew  for National Homebrew Day, Learn to Homebrew Day, and the Hill Staff  Homebrew Competition, which encourages bipartisan participation in  celebrating home-brewing and its rich history in the United States.  Thirty years ago, Congress designated May 7th as National Homebrew Day  and the AHA celebrates that anniversary each year with the Big Brew for  National Homebrew Day on the first Saturday each May. The AHA initiated  Learn to Homebrew Day, which is held in November, in 1999 to encourage  homebrewers to introduce their non-brewing family members and  [[Page S4747]]  friends to the hobby. Nearly 4,800 people from 45 States and 11 other  countries participated in Learn to Homebrew Day last November.   The ``big daddy'' of the AHA-hosted events is the National Homebrew  Conference, which attracts as many as 3,400 participants. In 2016,  ``Homebrew Con,'' as it is affectionately known, was held in Baltimore  and I enjoyed speaking to the group and sampling some of the best beer  in America. This year, the 40th Homebrew Con will be held in Portland,  Oregon--also known as Beervana--starting this Thursday. Homebrew Con  also features the final round of the National Homebrew Competition each  year, the largest beer competition in the world. Over 143,000 homebrews  have been entered and judged in this competition since the first one  was held in Boulder, Colorado, where the AHA is headquartered, in 1979.   Since its inception, the AHA has successfully created community,  camaraderie, competition, and, of course, great beer. Today, the hobby  of homebrewing unites Americans from coast to coast of all backgrounds,  life experiences, and political beliefs. Just as important, the AHA and  its diverse members have played a key part in the rise of the craft  brewing industry, which is larger today than it has ever been in the  country's history. The United States is now home to over 6,000 small  and independent craft breweries, most of which were started by  homebrewers. Craft beer now accounts for $26 billion in sales and 23  percent of the U.S. beer market. More than 80 percent of Americans age  21 and up live within 10 miles of a brewery, and these breweries are  reinvigorating local economies and creating good local jobs that won't  go overseas. Collectively, they are adding $68 billion to the economy  and donating over $70 million to charitable causes. Beer isn't just  good to drink; it's good for the economy.   I would be seriously remiss if I were to fail to mention the one  individual most responsible for the creation of the AHA, the growth of  homebrewing as a hobby, and the reemergence of American craft beer:  Charlie Papazian. Charlie, along with Charlie Matzen, founded the AHA  in 1978 in Boulder. Charlie Papazian is rightfully known as ``the  godfather of homebrewing''. As for the AHA's successes and the growth  of the domestic craft beer industry, we can credit Charlie and his  passion, enthusiasm, creativity, and commitment.   In 1972, Charlie graduated from the University of Virginia with a  degree in Nuclear Engineering. After working as a kindergarten teacher,  his passion for beer--and for the art and science of its creation--led  him to swap hydrogen for hops. In 1978, he founded the AHA and  published the first issue of Zymurgy magazine, announcing the new  organization, publicizing the federal legalization of homebrewing, and  calling for entries in the AHA's first National Homebrew Competition.  In 1984, he published The Complete Joy of Homebrewing, which to this  day remains one of the definitive guides to creating quality beer at  home. Charlie's reassuring motto--``Relax. Don't worry. Have a  homebrew.''--spawned an American movement that is now spreading abroad.   In 1983, Charlie founded the Association of Brewers, which included  the AHA under its umbrella as well as the new Institute for  Fermentation and Brewing Studies, which served the needs of the small,  but growing, microbrewing industry. The Association of Brewers later  merged with the Brewers Association of America to become today's  Brewers Association (BA). I was honored to work with the BA and its  members as the lead sponsor of the Small Brewer Reinvestment &  Expanding Workforce (Small BREW) Act, which intended to cut the federal  excise small, independent, domestic craft brewers pay. That bill was  incorporated in the Craft Beverage Modernization & Tax Reform Act,  which Congress passed last year.   Charlie launched a number of popular events, including the World Beer  Cup and the Great American Beer Festival, which today gathers over  60,000 attendees annually. Beyond beer, Charlie also founded National  Pie Day--which takes place each year on his own birthday, January  23rd--as an annual celebration of America's favorite dessert.   Charlie is a true trailblazer, pioneer, and entrepreneur. His  irrepressible enthusiasm, sense of humor, and joie de vivre have  endeared him to millions of people. The original wooden spoon he used  to stir his mashes now resides at the Smithsonian Institution's  National Museum of American History. Charlie purchased the spoon for $1  in a hardware store. ``I was walking down an aisle in the store,'' he  recalls, ``and that spoon spoke to me. It said, `Give me a try, I'm  special.' That was the start of our affair.'' He used the spoon when he  started teaching homebrewing in 1973 out of a series of houses he  rented in Boulder. From 1973 to 1982, he taught five semesters per  year, five classes per semester, with 20 people per class. According to  Charlie, ``Students had to get their hand on the spoon. They gave it a  turn and got the ingredients going in the pot. It was an important part  of the class and a lot of people touched that spoon.'' As Charlie puts  it, ``It makes for a stirring tale, doesn't it? The spoon has been a  witness to the evolution--and the revolution--of homebrewing and craft  beer. When you hold it in your hand now, it kind of vibrates a little  bit. It's got so much mojo in it.''   Come January 23, 2019, on his 70th birthday, Charlie will be exiting  the AHA and its parent organization, the Brewers Association, where he  served as president from 1978 to 2016. He is currently spending his  time completing an array of projects, including a craft brewing history  archive. This week, he will deliver the keynote address at Homebrew Con  in Portland. He is often asked, ``Charlie, did you ever imagine that  beer would become all of this?'' His answer is always yes.   At St. Paul's Cathedral in London, Sir Christopher Wren's epitaph  reads, Si monumentum requiris, circum-spice--``If you seek (his)  monuments, look around you.'' Charlie Papazian's monuments are all  around us--from homebrewers making a chocolate stout in their kitchens  or garages to the craft brewery down the street. From President Obama's  ``beer summit'' to the neighborhood bar, beer is the beverage that  refreshes us and brings us together. We can thank Charlie Papazian for  being able to choose from the best beers brewed in the history of  civilization to quench our thirst and warm our hearts. I would ask all  of my colleagues to join me in celebrating the 40th anniversary of the  American Homebrewers Association, and thanking Charlie Papazian for his  seminal and lasting contributions to homebrewing and the craft beer  renaissance and wishing him all the best as he completes his final year  at the AHA and begins the next chapter in a life that serves as an  inspiration to all of us.                            ____________________
