 Madam Speaker, I came to Congress to vote on legislation  and basically go to work. What have we done for the last couple of  weeks? Nothing.   Instead of concentrating on things that matter to this country, their  intent is to reverse the election in 2016 of President Donald Trump.   In America, when you commit a crime, you get the evidence and then  you have a verdict. What the Democrats, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff,  are doing now, they have got the verdict. They are trying to get  evidence, and then they are going to try to fish for a crime.   Madam Speaker, the public deserves better than this. We are better  than this. And this sham process, as has been done in the Soviet Union,  should not be done in the Halls of Congress.                            ____________________
