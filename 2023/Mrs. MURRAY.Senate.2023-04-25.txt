 Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to  urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm Joshua Jacobs  to serve as Under Secretary for Benefits at the U.S. Department of  Veterans Affairs.   Mr. Jacobs is an exceptionally qualified pick to fill this role, who  will work day in and day out to make sure our Nation lives up to its  obligation to take care of its veterans. I should know because that is  exactly what he did when he worked in my office.   Joshua came to work every day focused on Washington State veterans  and their families and helped to prepare the VA for an influx of  veterans, to expand clinics and facilities, and to ensure veterans had  the services they needed to transition to civilian life, especially  when it comes to employment. That track record is why I was thrilled to  have him return to work for me as deputy staff director on the Veterans  Affairs Committee later, when I became chair, and why I was so excited  to join my colleagues on the committee earlier this year to advance  this nomination in a bipartisan way.   When I was chair, Mr. Jacobs helped lead the efforts to get veterans  more mental health services, expand and support services for women  veterans, and ensure veterans had a seamless transition from the DOD to  the VA, where too often our servicemembers and veterans faced too much  redtape and the VA faced too little accountability.   Given his drive back then, it is no surprise to me that the work he  has done since shows his deep commitment to serving those who served  our Nation and why he is such a strong fit and trusted choice for this  role.   When Mr. Jacobs was a Senior Advisor to the Office of the VA  Secretary under President Obama, he was awarded the Secretary's  Meritorious Service Award. When President Biden was elected, he was  chosen to serve on the incoming administration's VA transition team.  After Mr. Jacobs returned to the Department as a Senior Advisor in  2021, he improved its decision-making process by establishing and  leading the new Evidence-based Policy Council and developing a new  interagency policy development process to coordinate and implement more  than 50 interagency policy efforts.   As a Senior Advisor for Policy who carried out the responsibilities  of the Under Secretary for Benefits, Mr. Jacobs has taken on the  enormous task of coordinating a team of 25,000 people and 56 regional  offices, processing centers, and headquarters as they worked to manage  over $100 billion in benefits and to make good on our promise to  millions of veterans and their families.   He knows full well how important a smoothly functioning VA is to the  Americans who are relying on the benefits our Nation promised them. I  have no doubt he will go to work every day determined to make sure our  Nation lives up to those promises.   I know Mr. Jacobs, who is a Washington State native and graduate of  the University of Washington, will do great work for America's veterans  as Under Secretary for benefits.   I am proud to support his nomination. I look forward to working with  him once he is confirmed.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S1322]]         Mr. President, I rise today to honor and congratulate  Mrs. Jeanne Kohl-Welles on her retirement following 30 years of work in  elected office. Jeanne retires from Washington's King County Council,  where she has served as vice chair of the council and chair of the  committee of the whole and been an extraordinary asset to our State and  the greater Seattle-King County region for the last 30 years.   Under Jeanne's leadership, King County Council was able to address  countless issues facing King County and its communities. From  supporting our communities through the COVID pandemic by leveraging the  13 budgets she passed as budget chair, to leading the creation of the  King County Regional Homeless Authority, Jeanne has been dauntless in  facing down tough challenges, tackling complex problems head on to make  meaningful progress for King County and its communities.   Jeanne's devotion to King County and the State of Washington as a  whole started long before her tenure on the county council. Jeanne  spent over two decades in the Washington State Legislature, first in  the house and then in the senate. For many of her 20 years in the  Washington State Senate, Jeanne chaired the senate higher education and  labor and commerce committees and led legislative efforts to legalize  medical marijuana and same-sex marriage, tackle income and gender  inequality, and address human trafficking and child sexual abuse.  Before that, she was an early advocate for addressing hate crimes and  homelessness in Seattle.   A constant theme in Jeanne's work has been her tireless dedication to  truly representing her constituents. Jeanne has organized many Women's  History Month panels; expanded access to ballot drop boxes; implemented  crucial investments in youth education; and worked with constituents  countless times to introduce legislation that matters to them, like  when she worked with middle-schoolers on legislation to regulate puppy- mills. Jeanne has shown a truly exceptional ability to champion what is  important to those she represents. Whether it was pushing for the  construction of the current stadium for our Seattle Seahawks,  sponsoring legislation to make transit safe and available to all, or  securing funding for the preservation of Washington State history--from  Pike Place Market to the National Historic Landmark vessel S.S.  Virginia--time and again, Jeanne has fought for the rights, needs, and  histories of Washington State and King County communities.   Being a woman in politics isn't always easy; when I first got to the  Senate, there wasn't even a women's bathroom off the Senate floor.  Every day, we are having to fight for our most basic rights, even as we  advocate for all of our constituents. But every day, women like Jeanne  are setting an example for young girls that with hard work, they can  follow their dreams and make a real difference. Jeanne's retirement  won't be a quiet one; she has plans to not only spend more time with  her a family and travel, but also to pursue other passions.   It has been a great privilege to work with Jeanne, a true  trailblazer, over the last three decades. And it is my honor to thank  her for her lifetime of dedicated service to people in King County, the  State of Washington, and the entire country. I wish her the very best  during her well-earned retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor and congratulate  Mr. Joe McDermott on his retirement following 22 years of public  service. Joe retires from Washington's King County Council, where he  has represented King County's eighth district and been an extraordinary  asset to our State and the greater Seattle-King County region for his  many years in both the Washington State Senate and House of  Representatives.   Upon joining the State legislature in 2001, Joe marked the first time  more than one openly gay legislator would serve in it. During his time,  he contributed to unprecedented progress for the LGBTQ+ community  through the addition of sexual orientation and gender identity to our  State's antidiscrimination statutes and protections for transgender  persons to our hate crime statutes, as well as recognition to domestic  partnerships for same-sex couples. Joe's contributions have forever  broadened the civil rights bill and paved the way to marriage equality.   Joe has also been a pivotal leader in safeguarding public safety. As  a councilmember, Joe responded to the public health crisis of gun  violence by recognizing the necessity of responsible firearm policy  with the 2018 King County Gun Safety Action Plan. As  [[Page S1337]]  chair of the King County Board of Health, Joe established the first  producer-paid Secure Medicine Return Program in Washington State and  second in the Nation, addressing the opiate crisis and ensuring the  safe disposal of unused medicines throughout King County. In just 5  years before the program became statewide and thanks to Joe's drive and  commitment, 198 drop boxes were provided across the county, and over  115 tons of drugs destroyed.   As a sponsor of the original and 2021 renewal of Executive Dow  Constantine's Best Starts for Kids Levy, Joe has played a momentous  role in serving more than half a million King County children, youth,  young adults, and families in partnership with 500 community-based  organizations. He understands, as I do, that our young people are the  future and our early investments in their lives will have growing  returns for years to come.   The host of community-based proposals and progress throughout his  career reflect Joe's extraordinary skills in developing compromise and  recognizing individualized needs, even in the most difficult of  circumstances. As a champion of the Health through Housing initiative  to house 1,600 of the most challenged people facing homelessness and  leader for support on long range hotel motel tax revenue allocation for  affordable housing and public infrastructure, Joe has never wavered  from the deep responsibility and value he holds for King County's low- income people.   Joe's work has been all-encompassing. From the expansion of the light  rail service and the guarantee of its equitable fare enforcement, to  the addition of new water taxis to meet higher passenger capacities, to  the review and approval of King County's public participation in an  arena proposal for NBA basketball and NHL hockey, the lengths to which  Joe will provide for our communities seem endless.   It has been a great privilege to learn and collaborate with Joe over  the last two decades, and it is my honor to thank him for his dedicated  service to the people of King County, the State of Washington, and  across the entire country. I wish him the very best during his well- earned retirement.                            ____________________
