The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Walorski) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Neal)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2847.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Indiana?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2847.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Indiana?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to support the Improving Services for Older  Youth in Foster Care Act.   In fiscal year 2015, almost 21,000 youth aged out of foster care,  meaning they left foster care without a permanent family connection.  Many of them are often poorly prepared for adulthood and lack some of  the basic skills they need to be successful adults.   Last year, the House passed the Family First Prevention Services Act,  a bill that would improve the lives of children and families by making  sure more children can stay safely at home and not enter foster care in  the first place, helping to make sure fewer children age out of care.  The bill also updated the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence  Program to allow States to assist older former foster youth up to the  age of 23, including providing education and training vouchers, to help  those young people who do age out to have a better future.  Unfortunately, it did not pass the Senate, so it never became law.   I am glad my good friend, Mr. Faso, introduced the Improving Services  for Older Youth in Foster Care Act to highlight the needs of these  older youth, and I know many will benefit from the changes made by his  bill.   Specifically, this bill would support older youth leaving foster care  by allowing existing funds used for financial housing, counseling, and  employment support to support older youth leaving care. It would also  allow HHS to redistribute unspent funds if a State has money remaining  at the end of the fiscal year so more youth can be helped with existing  resources. And through this bill, we will also be able to learn more  about youth leaving foster care and their outcomes, which will help us  develop better policies in the years ahead.   I am grateful for the opportunity we have today to support this bill.  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Faso), the sponsor of this bill.    I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Faso).    I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Faso).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Franks), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, having no other speakers, I reserve the  balance of my time.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu).   Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of  H.R. 2847, the bill offered by my friend  [[Page H4954]]  and colleague, Karen Bass, a tireless leader on foster youth and child  welfare.   I recently hosted an amazing young woman named Ruth during Foster  Youth Shadow Day here on the Hill. The message Ruth wanted lawmakers to  hear is that the obstacles she faces every day as a 19-year-old have  not suddenly stopped now that she has aged out of foster care. Ruth has  a resilient spirit and unstoppable determination, but she should not be  left out in the cold as she pursues her education and her goal of  helping other foster youth in the future.    The Improving Services for Older Youth in Foster Care Act will help  people like Ruth by making vital changes to the Chafee Foster Care  Independence Program, an important source of funding for foster youth.   Currently, foster youth are only eligible for Chafee services if they  are between the ages of 16 and 21. This bill expands access to the  services provided by the program to include youth between the ages of  14 and 23. This is such a crucial change to the program since foster  youth like Ruth face so many daunting challenges during the period of  young adulthood as they transition toward independence and self- sufficiency.   Providing essential services such as access to older mentors and role  models, connections to employment opportunities, and education vouchers  for foster youth after they reach the age of 18 are key sources of  support for foster youth. This bill helps ensure that foster youth have  the resources needed to become healthy, thriving adults.   Thanks again to Representative Bass for her work on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  requests for time, and I yield myself the balance of my time.   H.R. 2847 would provide important assistance for youth aging out of  foster care.   In my State of Illinois, 22 percent of the more than 16,000 children  placed in foster care in 2015 are aging out. Illinois is widely  regarded as a leader among States when it comes to foster youth aging  out of care; therefore, it is, indeed, one of the first jurisdictions  in which young people who are in foster care on their 18th birthday  were able to remain in beyond the age of 18.   Research conducted by the University of Chicago found that allowing  foster youth to remain in care beyond the age of 18 is associated with  an increase in child well-being, including postsecondary educational  attainment. Specifically, former foster youth from Illinois are twice  as likely to have ever attended college, and more than twice as likely  to have completed at least 1 year of college by age 21, compared with  foster youth in other States that have not been given the option to  stay in care beyond 18 years of age.                                time  1600    Due to school mobility issues experienced in high school, only 58  percent of foster youth graduate from high school by age 19, which  makes it unlikely that they would be graduated from college by age 21.   Extending access to Chafee Independence Act programs to age 23 rather  than cutting these young people off at age 21 would ensure these youth  are able to be supported beyond their first year of college. We know  that when students lose access to critical financial aid resources such  as the education training voucher in the middle of their college  journey, it forces them to drop out of college in search of employment.   Last Saturday, I spent 2 hours with a group of young people who had  been organized by a young fellow, Kenneth Bennett's son. His name is  Taylor Bennett. Taylor is the younger brother of Chance the Rapper. He  is 21 years of age and had organized young people who were transgender,  who were homeless, who were out of school, who were in need of  assistance and help, and they were pleased to know that we were going  to be considering this legislation today, which I strongly support.  [[Page H4955]]    I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to thank Mr. Faso and Mr. Reed from New York and Ms. Bass from  California for introducing this important bill, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2847.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2742) to amend title IV of the Social Security Act to  require States to adopt an electronic system to help expedite the  placement of children in foster care or guardianship, or for adoption,  across State lines, and to provide funding to aid States in developing  such a system, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2742         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Modernizing the Interstate       Placement of Children in Foster Care Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds that--        (1) when a child in foster care cannot return safely home,       the child deserves to be placed in a setting that is best for       that child, regardless of whether it is in the child's State       or another State;        (2) the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children       (ICPC) was established in 1960 to provide a uniform legal       framework for the placement of children across State lines in       foster and adoptive homes;        (3) frequently, children waiting to be placed with an       adoptive family, relative, or foster parent in another State       spend more time waiting for this to occur than children who       are placed with an adoptive, family, relative, or foster       parent in the same State, because of the outdated,       administratively burdensome ICPC process;        (4) no child should have to wait longer to be placed in a       loving home simply because the child must cross a State line;        (5) the National Electronic Interstate Compact Enterprise       (NEICE) was launched in August 2014 in Indiana, Nevada,       Florida, South Carolina, Wisconsin, and the District of       Columbia, has since expanded into Illinois, Virginia, Rhode       Island, California, Alaska, Nebraska, and Georgia, and is       expected to be expanded into additional States to improve the       administrative process by which children are placed with       families across State lines;        (6) States using this electronic interstate case-processing       system have reduced administrative costs and the amount of       staff time required to process these cases, and caseworkers       can spend more time helping children instead of copying and       mailing paperwork between States;        (7) since NEICE was launched, placement time has decreased       by 30 percent for interstate foster care placements; and        (8) on average, States using this electronic interstate       case-processing system have been able to reduce from 24       business days to 13 business days the time it takes to       identify a family for a child and prepare the paperwork       required to start the ICPC process.       SEC. 3. STATE PLAN REQUIREMENT.         (a) In General.--Section 471(a)(25) of the Social Security       Act (42 U.S.C. 671(a)(25)) is amended--        (1) by striking ``provide'' and insert ``provides''; and        (2) by inserting ``, which in the case of a State other       than the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States       Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, not later than       October 1, 2027, shall include the use of an electronic       interstate case-processing system'' before the 1st semicolon.        (b) Exemption of Indian Tribes.--Section 479B(c) of such       Act (42 U.S.C. 679c(c)) is amended by adding at the end the       following:        ``(4) Inapplicability of state plan requirement to have in       effect procedures providing for the use an electronic       interstate case-processing system.--The requirement in       section 471(a)(25) that a State plan provide that the State       shall have in effect procedures providing for the use of an       electronic interstate case-processing system shall not apply       to an Indian tribe, tribal organization, or tribal consortium       that elects to operate a program under this part.''.        (c) Effective Date.--        (1) In general.--The amendments made by subsection (a)       shall take effect on the 1st day of the 1st calendar quarter       beginning on or after the date of the enactment of this Act,       and shall apply to payments under part E of title IV of the       Social Security Act for calendar quarters beginning on or       after such date.        (2) Delay permitted if state legislation required.--If the       Secretary of Health and Human Services determines that State       legislation (other than legislation appropriating funds) is       required in order for a State plan developed pursuant to part       E of title IV of the Social Security Act to meet the       additional requirement imposed by the amendments made by       subsection (a), the plan shall not be regarded as failing to       meet any of the additional requirements before the 1st day of       the 1st calendar quarter beginning after the first regular       session of the State legislature that begins after the date       of the enactment of this Act. For purposes of the preceding       sentence, if the State has a 2-year legislative session, each       year of the session is deemed to be a separate regular       session of the State legislature.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2742, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Indiana?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2742, currently under  consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentlewoman from Indiana?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 2742,  Modernizing the Interstate Placement of Children in Foster Care Act,  which I introduced along with the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K.  Davis), my friend.   We know full well the importance of a stable home environment for a  child's development and success later in life. Unfortunately, we don't  live in an ideal world. We have seen too many instances when abuse,  neglect, physical or mental illness, addiction, incarceration, or death  necessitates removing a child from their home.   Right now, in my State of Indiana, there are more than 10,000  children in the foster care system than there were 18 months ago. This  is due in large part to the opioid epidemic that has swept across our  country. Our child welfare system is under unprecedented strain.   Yet, in spite of this great need for foster care and adoption, if a  child needs to be placed in another State, caseworkers from both States  must literally print and fill out hundreds of pages of paperwork and  mail them back and forth. This cumbersome process takes months, and  just one missing page can set it back even further. These are precious  months that an at-risk child is stuck in limbo, waiting for the  certainty of a more permanent home. It is time to bring this process  into the 21st century.   Luckily, there is an effort underway already to do just that. In  November 2013, five States, including my home State of Indiana, and the  District of Columbia, launched the National Electronic Interstate  Compact Enterprise, or NEICE. This is a cloud-based electronic system  that allows for the electronic exchange of data between States. It  started as a pilot project, but the results have been crystal clear:  placement wait times dropped by a month and a half, States spent less  time and money on copying and mailing, and caseworkers saved valuable  time.   NEICE is now effective in 16 States, including Mr. Davis' home State  of Illinois, but we can't stop at 16. As it stands today, if a child in  my district in South Bend, Indiana, needed to be placed with their  grandparents just 11 miles away in Niles, Michigan, the two States  would have to undertake that arduous paperwork process because Michigan  is not a part of NEICE yet. All States need to be a part of this system  in order to realize its full benefits.   That is where the bill before us comes in. H.R. 2742 represents a  very important investment in the future of at-risk youth. It requires  States to join the NEICE system by October 1, 2027, and sets aside $5  million in existing Federal funds to facilitate States in joining or  expanding their services under NEICE.   That money doesn't come without strings. States must apply for the  funds and submit detailed plans. The Secretary of Health and Human  Services will have to submit periodic reports to Congress so that we  can monitor progress as States join and ensure that this program  continues to cut wait times for children and administrative costs for  States.   In the 114th Congress, this legislation passed the House of  Representatives, but, unfortunately, did not come up for a vote in the  Senate. It is our hope that we can cross the finish line this year and  help at-risk youth find their forever home more quickly.   I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis) for  being a great partner in introducing this legislation. I would like to  thank Senators Young, Grassley, and Gillibrand for introducing  companion legislation in the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, finally, I enter into the Record a list of 17  organizations that wrote in support of H.R. 2742.        1. American Academy of Adoption Attorneys/American Academy       of Assisted Reproductive Technology Attorneys        2. American Academy of Pediatrics        3. American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists        4. American Public Human Services Association        5. California County Welfare Directors Association        6. Child Advocates, Indianapolis, IN        7. Child Welfare League of America        8. Children's Home Society of America        9. First Focus        10. Generations United        11. Indiana Department of Child Services        12. March of Dimes        13. National Association of Counties        14. National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners        15. Partnership for Strong Families        16. The Villages of Indiana        17. Voice for Adoption     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  this important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I strongly support H.R. 2742, the Modernizing the Interstate  Placement of Children in Foster Care Act.   Cross-State placement of youth in foster care is particularly salient  to children living with kinship caregivers. Given that my congressional  district has one of the highest percentages of grandparent caregivers  in the Nation, I am pleased to join with Congresswoman Walorski in  leading this important legislation.   This bill helps reduce the barriers and delays that continue to exist  when the best new home for a child is in a different State than the  unsafe home the child had to leave. Removing barriers that delay or  prevent interstate child placement is a longtime bipartisan goal within  Congress.   This bill addresses an important factor in those delays: the ability  of State computer systems to link up to process the paperwork. The  current paper-based system is antiquated and slow.   As part of an HHS pilot project, seven States, and the District of  Columbia, currently participate in the National Electronic Interstate  Compact Enterprise, or NEICE, an online tool that allows State office  systems to talk to each other and process interstate placements more  quickly. I am, indeed, proud that Illinois is one of those States.   An early evaluation found that this system reduced waiting times for  affected children by about one-third. Ten of the States have already  announced plans to join the exchange over the next 2 years. H.R. 2742  would accelerate the number of participating States in the short run  and ensure that all States participate in the long run. The more States  that join, the more it speeds up the process for everyone.   The director of the Illinois Department of Children and Family  Services  [[Page H4965]]  often emphasizes that we need to operate in ``kid time'' and not  ``adult time,'' meaning that we need to recognize the urgency of  restoring permanency for children in child welfare rather than allowing  adult bureaucracy to impede permanency.   Modernizing the technology to increase efficiencies and quicken  placements is common sense and respects the urgency of finding  permanent, loving homes for children.   This is a good bill, and I thank Congresswoman Walorski and her staff  for their excellent work. Our States are joined together, so we join  with this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the bill, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett), an outstanding legislator.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to close with the words from someone on the  ground living this every day. Sharon Pierce is the president and CEO of  The Villages of Indiana, the largest not-for-profit child and family  services provider in my State and a supporter of H.R. 2742: ``The NEICE  system is going to be invaluable in helping both the public and private  sector child welfare agencies reduce considerably the length of time  [[Page H4966]]  a child needs to wait for a forever family.''   This isn't just a good government bill, Mr. Speaker. Sure, we are  reducing costs and paperwork and we can attach all sorts of numbers and  dollar figures to that, but the most important thing we are doing here  is we are giving at-risk youth a more permanent home sooner. We are  giving them hope sooner. We are giving them a chance to actually thrive  sooner.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''   I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski) that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2742.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
