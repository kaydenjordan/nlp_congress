 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Flau'jae Johnson, a Savannah native and member of the LSU women's  basketball team.   Flau'jae was recently named the SEC Freshman of the Year and was also  selected to the 2023 SEC All-Freshman Team. She is the fourth LSU  player to earn SEC Freshman of the Year honors, the first since 2009.   Flau'jae came to LSU as a highly talented freshman ranked as the No.  26 player in the Nation. She made an immediate impact in Baton Rouge,  scoring 11.6 points per game and bringing down 5.9 rebounds per game.  She was named SEC Freshman of the Week three times.   In her collegiate debut, she scored 14 points and grabbed 8 rebounds.  She also recorded two assists, two blocks, and one steal. Through her  first week of college basketball, Flau'jae scored in double figures all  three games.   I congratulate Flau'jae on all of her success so far. We are excited  to see everything that she will achieve.                            Recognizing Nat Legree     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Nat  Legree for his retirement from Wesley Monumental United Methodist  Church.   For the last 42 years, Nat has been a fixture at Wesley Monumental  for his constant service to the church. Most of his work was behind the  scenes but certainly did not go unnoticed as he helped prepare Wesley  for worship, study, and fellowship week after week for many decades.   Nat oversaw the grounds and in recent years was responsible for  maintaining the beautiful garden at Oliver Hall. Nat's dedication to  his church community is admirable and has helped create a wonderful,  welcoming environment for many. Wesley Monumental Church will never be  the same without Nat.   On behalf of the Wesley Monumental United Methodist Church family, we  are grateful to Nat for all that he has given to our church.                            Recognizing Bart Davis     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bart  Davis, who was named the 2023 Georgia Farmer of the Year at this year's  Georgia Ag Forecast.   Bart began farming 41 years ago in Doerun, Georgia, following the  loss of his mother and father during his senior year of high school.  Since then, he has grown the then 500-acre operation to encompass 5,000  acres. Today, he focuses on cotton, peanuts, and corn, while also  managing a cattle operation.   Bart has made impressive strides in using precision agriculture  technology to ensure the efficiency of his farm, including the use of  soil moisture sensors and irrigation in the majority of his fields.   In addition to the work on his own farm, he has given back in various  industry leadership roles. He has served on the Georgia Cotton  Commission Board, the Georgia Boll Weevil Eradication Foundation, the  National Cotton Council, and represents Georgia on Southern Cotton  Growers and Cotton Incorporated.   I thank Bart for his continued dedication to his farm and to the  agricultural industry.

Tom is the current chairman of the board, CEO, and president of  Southern Company. For more than 42 years, Tom's excellent leadership  has helped mold Southern Company into the great company it is today. I  thank Tom for his decades of service to Southern Company and the First  District of Georgia.   On March 31, 2023, Chris Womack will become chairman of the board,  CEO, and president of Southern Company. Chris currently serves as  chairman, president, and CEO of Georgia Power. Prior to those  positions, Chris worked for former Congressman Leon Panetta.   I congratulate Chris and wish him well as he prepares to lead  Southern Company.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, this past Friday in Savannah,  Georgia, we celebrated St. Patrick's Day with over 400,000 people  lining the streets of Savannah.   Today, I rise to highlight the efforts that have been made by Georgia  Southern University to strengthen U.S.-Irish relations.   In 2019, the university established a learning center in Wexford,  Ireland. The new learning center allows students at Georgia Southern to  study abroad in Ireland. It allows them to take classes, experience the  culture of Ireland, and examine the longstanding connection between  Savannah, Georgia, and Ireland.   In addition to aiding students at Georgia Southern, efforts made by  the university have strengthened the Georgian economy. Efforts by the  university's Center for Irish Research and Teaching have led the  Savannah Economic Development Authority to select Ireland as a partner  for various trade and investment delegations.   The initiative also helped secure a Southeast U.S. distribution deal  for Survipod, an Irish manufacturer of innovative surveying tools, and  a broad-based distribution deal for the Savannah Bee Company in  Ireland.   I congratulate Georgia Southern University on its accomplishments and  thank the university for its efforts to improve U.S.-Irish relations.                            ____________________
