 Mr. Speaker, if we hold true to the idea that America  [[Page H3955]]  stands for equality, equity, and diversity, then equal rights must  apply to and be protected for all Americans.   No American should be discriminated against because of their sexual  orientation or gender identity. Yet, despite the historic  accomplishments toward equality over the past decade, LGBTQ Americans  still face systemic discrimination.   We know the fight for equality is always on the right side of  history, and today's passage of the Equality Act is a much-needed step  forward in that fight.   Today's vote allows us to see the moral arc of the universe, as  Martin Luther King, Jr., said, bend toward justice.                            ____________________
