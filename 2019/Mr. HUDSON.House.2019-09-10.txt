 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the rule and in  opposition to these anti-energy bills.   America leads the world in both oil and natural gas production, and  our gas prices are on track to be the lowest in 20 years. We are  experiencing, Mr. Speaker, an American energy renaissance.   The oil and gas industry today accounts for over 10 million jobs, and  we have the potential to add even more jobs in my State and others.  However, this legislation before us today is a jobs killer. It  increases our dependence on foreign oil and gas, and it reduces  our ability to develop our own natural resources.    In order for us to continue to lead, we need to explore our abundant  resources at home. By safely developing America's own energy resources,  we can create a more abundant, affordable, and sustainable energy  supply, while, at the same time, we can ensure strong protections for  the environment.   Not only are there economic concerns, but there are also serious  geopolitical implications. As a member of the Helsinki Commission, I  know firsthand the national security concerns that come with turning  over our share of energy markets.   Russia is the largest exporter of natural gas to the European Union,  and they use this to bully our allies and grow their sphere of  influence. By divesting our energy production, Washington politicians  are handing over opportunities to Russia to expand their energy  foothold and increase their influence over our allies. We should be  countering Russian influence in any way that we can, not giving up our  own economic and geopolitical power.   This opportunity will fade fast. If we don't take advantage of it  now, the jobs, the money, and the bright economic future will all go to  other countries, making our Nation and our allies more reliant on  foreign energy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and on these underlying  bills.
