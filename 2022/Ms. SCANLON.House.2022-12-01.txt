 Madam Speaker, this week I proudly joined Senator Durbin  and Senator Blumenthal in introducing the Corporate Crime Database Act,  bicameral legislation that requires the Department of Justice to  collect, aggregate, analyze, and publish comprehensive data on Federal  corporate criminal enforcement actions.   While the Department of Justice regularly collects data on nearly  every type of street-level crime, there is currently very little  reporting of corporate and white-collar crimes.   A Federal corporate crime database is critical to bolstering  corporate crime law enforcement and holding wrongdoers accountable. But  the last thorough DOJ report on corporate crime was in 1979.   Without data or transparency, lawmakers, journalists, and the public  are left in the dark about the size and scope of corporate crime in  America and the effectiveness of the Federal Government's response.   By requiring the DOJ to collect and analyze information regarding  enforcement actions, publish a database of the enforcement actions, and  submit an annual report to Congress, the Corporate Crime Database Act  will deter future crimes and protect victims.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  commonsense legislation to curtail corporate crime.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise as the designee of the gentlewoman  from Massachusetts (Ms. Pressley), and I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I come today before the House first in  strong support of Congresswoman Bass' bill, the One Stop Shop Community  Reentry Program Act.   Each year, hundreds of thousands of people are released from custody  after serving their time, and reentry services are a crucial tool to  help these individuals find success when they return home.   However, in many cases, returning individuals are not given adequate  support to succeed as they reintegrate in our communities. Too often  they struggle to access safe and affordable housing, educational  opportunities, and steady employment. This bill will provide critical,  accessible, and comprehensive resources to these individuals including  job training and help to obtain IDs, housing, mental health services,  and more.   Importantly, this bill would also expand services that I have direct  experience to know are critical to increasing the success of reentering  citizens.   Prior to coming to Congress, I had the opportunity to work with  returning citizens in the cutting-edge Federal reentry court started in  the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by U.S. Magistrate Judge Tim Rice  and now Third Circuit Judge Felipe Restrepo.   We saw in that courtroom how mentoring and legal assistance often  were the key to successful reentry by returning citizens. The  additional services provided by the reentry court and related  nonprofits resulted in a two-thirds reduction in recidivism by  participants in that program.   So in addition to supporting the underlying bill, I am proud to offer  my colleague, Ms. Pressley's, amendment to the One Stop Shop Community  Reentry Program Act.   This amendment will ensure that the grant program is evaluated for  its effectiveness. We know that it is not enough to create a grant  program, we must also ensure effective implementation of that program  and that the critical government resources we make available are  meeting the needs of the intended recipients and are a productive use  of taxpayer resources.   This additional provision will require evaluation of the grant  program and allow recommendations to improve the program and reduce any  barriers to access.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would simply encourage my  colleagues to vote in favor of Representative Pressley's amendment and  the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
