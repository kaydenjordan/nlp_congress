 Madam President, this will be a busy week here in the  Senate. We begin by making more progress on the President's nominees.  Later today, we will vote to advance the nomination of President  Trump's choice to serve as Deputy Secretary at the Department of the  Treasury, Justin Muzinich. This nomination was reported favorably by  our colleagues on the Finance Committee earlier this year. Chairman  Hatch has characterized the nominee as ``qualified, competent, and  ready to get to work.''   As we speak, of course, Mr. Muzinich is already serving as senior  counselor to Secretary Mnuchin. He is drawing on years of experience in  financial management and putting that experience to work through public  service. The nominee holds an MBA from Harvard Business School and a JD  from Yale. He has a distinguished record in the private sector and as  an instructor at Columbia Business School.   As the Treasury Department continues its work implementing the new  Tax Code, developing foreign sanctions, and in a variety of other  important areas, it is more important than ever that the Deputy  Secretary position be filled; therefore, I would urge each of my  colleagues to join me in voting to fill that vacancy with this well- qualified nominee as we advance his nomination later today.   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                         Committee on Armed Services    The Committee on Armed Services is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Monday, December 10, 2018, at 10:30 a.m., to  conduct a hearing on pending nominations.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  December 11; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that following leader  remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session and resume  consideration of the Muzinich nomination, with all postcloture time on  the nomination expiring at 11:30 a.m.; finally, that the Senate recess  from 12:30 p.m. until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly caucus  meetings.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:49 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, December 11, 2018, at 10 a.m.
