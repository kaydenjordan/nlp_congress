 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania for, once again, leading the Congressional Black Caucus's  Special Order hour, where we get to address the American people and  talk directly to the American people about what it is that is going on  in Congress, what we would like to do.   Tonight is a very somber but important Special Order hour. We are  talking about protecting American lives. It would not be Black History  Month without a quote from Dr. Martin Luther King, a Morehouse  graduate. He says: ``At some point, silence becomes betrayal.''   I want us to just think about that: silence becomes betrayal. When it  comes to our communities being inundated with guns, this Congress has  been far too silent. In fact, what we do is just take moments of  silence, one after another, whether it is Virginia Tech, moment of  silence; Sandy Hook, moment of silence; Pulse nightclub, moment of  silence; First Baptist Church, moment of silence; Las Vegas, moment of  silence; Mother Emanuel, moment of silence.   So far in 2018, we have already seen 8,200 incidents of gun violence  in America, including 34 mass shootings. These acts of violence have  taken more than 2,200 lives. That is 2,200 families affected by gun  violence.   I would just say that it is time for Congress to do something, at  least have the debate, but we ought not become coconspirators with the  crimes that are being committed across this country.   I know that many people will say: Hey, you all are in Congress, you  all deal in theory. We deal in reality. Banning assault weapons  wouldn't have kept this kid from being able to buy an AR-15.   Well, let me just tell you, that is not true.   An AR-15 from the store ranges about $500 and $600. A kid could  probably get $500 or $600, but during the days of the assault weapons  ban, those guns, the street value became three times as much. So that  means that $600 gun that he bought would have been $1,800. The question  is whether he would have had access to get to that $1,800, whether good  common sense would have prevailed before he got to $1,800, whether  somebody would have caught on to his plan while he tried to get $1,800.    At some point, we can't not do anything because we say it wouldn't  have made a difference.   The one thing I will say is it is amazing to see these young people  rise up and speak out with one voice that they want something done.   It is a sad day in America when our seniors can't go to church  without fear  [[Page H1253]]  of gun violence, when families can't go to the movies because of fear  of gun violence, and when children can't go to school because of fear  of gun violence.   We as a Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, have an obligation  to this country to make sure that we protect people who are vulnerable.  I don't think it is too much to ask for both sides to come together and  ignore the will of the National Rifle Association, but to listen to the  people in our country who are demanding that we do something.   When we start talking about background checks, assault rifles, high- capacity cartridges that go in these guns which allow people to shoot  large amounts of people in a very short order of time, those guns-- let's just be clear, and I want Congressman Evans to understand what we  are talking about: nobody is talking about ending the Second Amendment.  The right to bear arms is as fundamental and as protected as anything  else in this country. However, when we start talking about AR-15s and  these assault weapons and these automatic things, we are talking about  weapons of mass destruction.   We went to Afghanistan looking for weapons of mass destruction, when  they are right here in this country. We don't have to go to Iraq, we  don't have to go to Afghanistan. If you are looking for weapons of mass  destruction, they are sold in our sporting goods shops all across this  country, and they are being used to slaughter American citizens.   So I would just ask, in closing, that at some point, silence is  betrayal. As for me, because of my conviction, because of my  conscience, and because I don't lack any courage, I will not be silent.   I would just urge this body that we can't be silent anymore as  weapons of mass destruction destroy our communities.    I am frustrated. I come from a funeral home family, and  I know what it is like when people have to bury loved ones, and I know  the natural order of things, because I have had to bury my father and  my stepfather and my grandparents, who were--my grandfather  specifically, who stepped in for my father when he died, but that is  the natural order of things. Although my dad died when he was 32, it  was of natural causes.   Parents shouldn't be burying children. Children shouldn't be victims  and shot in school. So the frustration comes because I know the pain  associated.   So when we start talking about the 2,200 people who were killed, that  is 2,200 families that had to get up and hear the preacher say: Oh,  pain may endureth through the night, but joy cometh in the morning.   Well, joy is not going to come in the morning if the same thing keeps  happening and Congress will not do anything about it, because that  means those lives were lost in vain, and that is just as big a sin, in  my estimation. I just think that we have to do something about it.   It is one thing when the cameras are there and the family has the  support at the funeral of all these people, the Congressperson comes,  family comes, and says, ``Oh, we are going to be with you, and we are  going to support you and pray for you during this time,'' but at the  end of the day, that mother and father goes back to that house, and  that kid's room is empty.   There are no words of comfort that we can give to that family when  they walk by that room every night and it is empty because we let  somebody with mental issues get their hands on an AR-15 and slaughter a  bunch of kids in school. So if it sounds like I am upset, then you are  right, because those parents shouldn't have to pass an empty room.   Every empty room that happens, my fear is that we are complicit by  omission of letting it happen over and over again, and I don't want  that on my conscience.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.                                time  2000
