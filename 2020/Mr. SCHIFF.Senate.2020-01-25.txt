 And what is the President's response? Well, it       reads like a classic organized crime shakedown.        Shorn of its rambling character and in not so many words,       this is the essence of what the President communicates. We've       been very good to your country. Very good. No other country       has done as much as we have. But you know what? I don't see       much reciprocity here.        I hear what you want. I have a favor I want from you,       though. And I'm going to say this only seven times, so you       better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my       political opponent. Understand? Lots of it, on this and on       that.        I'm going to put you in touch with people, and not just any       people. I'm going to put you in touch with the attorney       general of the United States, my attorney general, Bill Barr.       He's got the whole weight of the American law enforcement       behind him. And I'm going to put you in touch with Rudy.        You're going to love him. Trust me. You know what I'm       asking? And so I'm only going to say this a few more times in       a few more ways. And by the way, don't call me again. I'll       call you when you've done what I asked.        This is in sum and character what the President was trying       to communicate.    Mr. Counsel PURPURA. That is fake. That is not the real call. That is  not the evidence here. That is not the transcript that Mr. Cipollone  just referenced. We can shrug it off and say we were making light or a  joke, but that was in a hearing in the U.S. House of Representatives,  discussing the removal of the President of the United States from  office.   There are very few things, if any, that can be as grave and as  serious. Let's stick with the evidence. Let's talk about the facts and  the evidence in this case.   The most important piece of evidence we have in the case, and before  you, is the one that we began with nearly 4 months ago--the actual  transcript of the July 25, 2019, telephone call between President Trump  and President Zelensky--the real transcript.   If that were the only evidence we had, it would be enough to show the  Democrats' entire theory is completely unfounded, but the transcript is  far from the only evidence demonstrating that the President did nothing  wrong.   Once you sweep away all of the bluster and innuendo, the selective  leaks, the closed-door examinations of the Democrats' hand-picked  witnesses, the staged public hearings, what we are left with are six  key facts that have not, and will not, change:   First, the transcript shows that the President did not condition  either security assistance or a meeting on anything. The paused  security assistance funds aren't even mentioned on the call.   Second, President Zelensky and other Ukrainian officials have  repeatedly said that there was no quid pro  [[Page S569]]  quo and no pressure on them to review anything.   Third, President Zelensky and high-ranking Ukrainian officials did  not even know--did not even know--the security assistance was paused  until the end of August, over a month after the July 25 call.   Fourth, not a single witness testified that the President himself  said that there was any connection between any investigations and  security assistance, a Presidential meeting, or anything else.   Fifth, the security assistance flowed on September 11, and a  Presidential meeting took place on September 25, without the Ukrainian  Government announcing any investigations.    Finally, the Democrats' blind drive to impeach the President does not  and cannot change the fact, as attested to by the Democrats' own  witnesses, that President Trump has been a better friend and stronger  supporter of Ukraine than his predecessor.   Those are the facts. We plan to address some of them today and some  of them next week. Each one of these six facts standing alone is enough  to sink the Democrats' case. Combined, they establish what we have  known since the beginning: The President did absolutely nothing wrong.   The Democrats' allegation that the President engaged in a quid pro  quo is unfounded and contrary to the facts. The truth is simple, and it  is right before our eyes. The President was, at all times, acting in  our national interest and pursuant to his oath of office.   Before I dive in and speak further about the facts, let me mention  something that my colleagues will discuss in greater detail. The facts  that I am about to discuss today are the Democrats' facts. This is  important because the House managers spoke to you for a very long time,  over 21 hours, and they repeatedly claimed to you that their case is  and their evidence is overwhelming and uncontested. It is not.   I am going to share a number of facts with you this morning that the  House managers didn't share with you during more than 21 hours. I will  ask you, as Mr. Cipollone already mentioned, that when you hear me say  something the House managers didn't present to you, ask yourself: Why  didn't they tell me that? Is that something I would have liked to have  known? Why am I hearing it for first time from the President's lawyers?   It is not because they did not have enough time; that is for sure.  They only showed you a very selective part of the record--their record.  And they--remember this--have the very heavy burden of proof before  you.   The President is forced to mount a defense in this Chamber against a  record that the Democrats developed. The record that we have to go on  today is based entirely on House Democratic facts precleared in a  basement bunker--not mostly, entirely. Yet even those facts absolutely  exonerate the President.   Let's start with the transcript. The President did not link security  assistance to any investigations on the July 25 call. Let's step back.  On July 25, President Trump called President Zelensky. This was their  second phone call, both were congratulatory.   On April 21, President Trump called to congratulate President  Zelensky on winning the Presidential election. On July 25, the  President called because President Zelensky's party had just won a  large number of seats in Parliament.   On September 24, before Speaker Pelosi had any idea what President  Trump and President Zelensky actually said on the July 25 call, she  called for an impeachment inquiry into President Trump.   In the interest of full transparency and to show that he had done  nothing wrong, President Trump took the unprecedented--unprecedented-- step of declassifying the call transcript so that the American people  could see for themselves exactly what the two Presidents discussed.   What did President Trump say to President Zelensky on the July 25  call? President Trump raised two issues. I am going to be speaking  about those two issues a fair amount this morning. They are the two  issues that go to the core of how President Trump approaches foreign  aid.   When it comes to sending U.S. taxpayer money overseas, the President  is focused on burden-sharing and corruption. First, the President,  rightly, had real concerns about whether European and other countries  were contributing their fair share to ensuring Ukraine security.   Second, corruption. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Ukraine has  suffered from one of the worst environments for corruption in the  world. A parade of witnesses testified in the House about the pervasive  corruption in Ukraine and how it is in American's foreign policy and  national security interests to help Ukraine combat corruption--turning  the call right off the bat.   President Trump mentioned burden-sharing to President Zelensky.  President Trump told President Zelensky that Germany does almost  nothing for you, and a lot of European countries are the same way.  President Trump specifically mentioned speaking to Angela Merkel of  Germany, who he said talks Ukraine but she doesn't do anything.   President Zelensky agreed; you are absolutely right. He said that he  spoke with the leaders of Germany and France and told them they are not  doing quite as much as they need to be doing.   Right at the beginning of the call, President Trump was talking about  burden-sharing. President Trump then turned to corruption in the form  of foreign interference in the 2016 Presidential election.   There is absolutely nothing wrong with asking a foreign leader to  help get to the bottom of all forms of foreign interference in an  American Presidential election. You will hear more about that later  from one of my colleagues.   What else did the President say? The President also warned President  Zelensky that he appeared to be surrounding himself with some of the  same people as his predecessor and suggested that a very fair and very  good prosecutor was shut down by some very bad people. Again, one of my  colleagues will speak more about that.   The content of the July 25 call was in line with the Trump  administration's legitimate concerns about corruption and reflected the  hope that President Zelensky, who campaigned on a platform of reform,  would finally clean up Ukraine.   So what did President Trump and President Zelensky discuss in the  July 20 call? Two issues: burden-sharing and corruption.   Just as importantly, what wasn't discussed on the July 25 call? There  was no discussion of the paused security assistance on the July 25  call. House Democrats keep pointing to President Zelensky's statement  that ``I would also like to thank you for your great support in the  area of defense.'' But he wasn't talking there about the paused  security assistance. He tells us in the very next sentence exactly what  he was talking about--Javelin missiles. ``We are ready,'' President  Zelensky continues, ``to continue to cooperate for the next steps  specifically we are almost ready to buy more Javelins from the United  States for defense purposes.''   Javelins are the anti-tank missiles only made available to the  Ukrainians by President Trump. President Obama refused to give Javelins  to the Ukrainians for years. Javelin sales were not part of the  security assistance that had been paused at the time of the call.  Javelin sales have nothing to do with the paused security assistance.  Those are different programs entirely. But don't take my word for it.  Both former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and NSC Director  Timothy Morrison confirmed the Javelin missiles and security assistance  were unrelated.   The House managers didn't tell you about Ambassador Yovanovitch's and  Tim Morrison's testimony. Why not? They could have taken 2 to 5 minutes  out of 21 hours to make sure you understood that the Javelin sales  being discussed were not part of the paused security assistance. This  puts the following statement by President Trump in a whole new light,  doesn't it? ``I would like you to do us a favor though because our  country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.''   As everyone knows by now, President Trump asked President Zelensky  ``to do us a favor.'' And he made clear that ``us'' referred to our  country and not himself. More importantly, the President was not  connecting ``do us a  [[Page S570]]  favor'' to the Javelin sales that President Zelensky mentioned; that  makes no sense in the language there. But even if he had been, the  Javelin sales were not part of the security assistance that had been  temporarily paused.   I want to be very clear about this. When the House Democrats claim  that the Javelin sales discussed in the July 25 call are part of the  paused security assistance, it is misleading. They are trying to  confuse you and just sort of wrap everything in, instead of unpacking  it the right way. There was no mention of the paused security  assistance on the call and certainly not for President Trump or from  President Trump.   As you know, head-of-state calls are staffed by a number of aides on  both sides. LTC Alexander Vindman, detailee at the National Security  Council, raised a concern about the call, and that was just a policy  concern. Lieutenant Colonel Vindman admitted he did not know if there  was a crime or anything of that nature, but he had deep policy  concerns. So there you have it.   But the President sets the foreign policy. In a democracy such as  ours, the elected leaders make foreign policy while the unelected  staff, such as Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, implement the policy. Other  witnesses were on the July 25 call and had very different reactions  than that of Lieutenant Colonel Vindman. LTG Keith Kellogg, national  security advisor to the Vice President, former Acting National Security  Advisor, and a long-serving and highly decorated veteran attended the  call.   According to General Kelly:         I was on the much-reported July 25 call between President       Donald Trump and President Zelensky. As an exceedingly proud       member of President Trump's administration and as a 34-year       highly experienced combat veteran who retired at the rank of       Lieutenant General in the Army, I heard nothing wrong or       improper on the call. I had and have no concerns.    The House managers said that other witnesses were also troubled by  the July 25 call and identified those witnesses as Jennifer Williams  and Tim Morrison.   Jennifer Williams, who works for Lieutenant General Kellogg, now  claims that she has concerns about the call. You heard that from the  House managers. They were very careful in the way they worded that.  What they didn't tell you is that Ms. Williams was so troubled at the  time of the call that she told exactly zero people of her concern. She  told no one for 2 months following the call--not one person. Ms.  Williams didn't raise any concerns about the call when it took place,  not with Lieutenant General Kellogg, not with counsel, not with anyone.   Ms. Williams waited to announce her concerns until Speaker Pelosi  publicly announced her impeachment inquiry. The House managers didn't  tell you that. Why not?   Tim Morrison, who is Lieutenant Colonel Vindman's boss, was also on  the call. Mr. Morrison reported the call to the National Security  Council lawyers, not because he was troubled by anything on the call  but because he was worried about leaks and, in his words, ``how it  would play out in Washington's polarized environment.''   ``I want to be clear,'' Mr. Morrison testified, ``I was not concerned  that anything illegal was discussed.''   Mr. Morrison further testified that there was nothing improper and  nothing illegal about anything that was said on the call. In fact, Mr.  Morrison repeatedly testified that he disagreed with Lieutenant Colonel  Vindman's assessment that President Trump made demands of President  Zelensky or that he said anything improper at all.   Here is Mr. Morrison:   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          In that transcript, does the President not ask       Zelensky to look into the Bidens?         But, yes, we would love to talk directly to the       whistleblower.        We will get the unfiltered testimony from the       whistleblower.        We don't need the whistleblower.    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Now, what changed? At first, Manager Schiff  agreed we should hear the unfiltered testimony from the whistleblower,  but then he changed his mind, and he suggested that it was because now  we had the transcript. But the second clip there was from September 29,  which was 4 days after the transcript had been released. But there was  something that came into play, and that was something Manager Schiff  had said earlier when he was asked about whether he had spoken to the  whistleblower.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          We have not spoken directly with the       whistleblower. We would like to.    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. It turned out that that statement was not  truthful.   Around October 2 or 3, it was exposed that Manager Schiff's staff, at  least, had spoken with the whistleblower before the whistleblower filed  the complaint and potentially had given some guidance of some sort to  the whistleblower, and after that point, it became critical to shut  down any inquiry into the whistleblower.   During the House hearings, of course, Manager Schiff was in charge.  He was chairing the hearings. That creates a real problem from a due- process perspective and from a search-for-the truth perspective because  he was an interested fact witness at that point. He had a reason--since  he had been caught out saying something that wasn't truthful about that  contact--to not want that inquiry, and it was he who ensured that there  wasn't any inquiry into that.   I think this is relevant here because, as you have heard from my  colleagues, a lot of what we have heard over the past 23 hours, over  the past 3 days, has been from Chairman Schiff. He has been telling you  things like what is in President Trump's head and what is in President  Zelensky's head. It is all his interpretation of the facts and the  evidence, trying to pull inferences out of things.   There is another statement that Chairman Schiff made that I think we  have on video.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)          Actually, no, Chuck. I can tell you that the       case is more than that. And I can't go into the particulars,       but there is more than circumstantial evidence now. So,       again, I think--         I don't want to go into specifics, but I will       say that there is evidence that is not circumstantial and is       very much worthy of investigation.    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. So that was in March of 2017, when Chairman  Schiff, as ranking member of HPSCI, was telling the public--the  American public--that he had more than circumstantial evidence, through  his position on HPSCI, that President Trump's campaign had colluded  with Russia.   Now, of course, as Mr. Sekulow pointed out, after $32 million and  over 500 search warrants--roughly 500 search warrants--the Mueller  report determined that there was no collusion, that that wasn't true.   We wanted to point these things out simply for this reason: Chairman  Schiff has made so much of the House's case about the credibility of  interpretations that the House managers want to place on not hard  evidence but on inferences. They want to tell you what President Trump  thought. They want to tell you: Don't believe what Zelensky says; we  can tell you what Zelensky actually thought. Don't believe what the  other Ukrainians actually said about not be being pressured; we can  tell you what they actually thought.   This is very relevant to know whether the assessments of evidence  that he presented in the past are accurate. We would submit they have  not been, and that that is relevant for your consideration.   With that, I yield to my colleague, Mr. Cipollone.   Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, I  have good news: just a few more minutes from us today. But I want to  point out a couple of points.   No. 1, just to follow up on what Mr. Philbin just told you, do you  know who else didn't show up in the Judiciary Committee to answer  questions about his report in the way Ken Starr did in the Clinton  impeachment? Ken Starr was subjected to cross-examination by the  President's counsel. Do you know who didn't show up in the Judiciary  Committee? Chairman Schiff. He did not show up. He did not give  Chairman Nadler the respect of appearing before his committee and  answering questions from his committee. He did send staff, but why  didn't he show up? That is another good question you should think  about.   They have come here today, and they basically said: Let's cancel an  election over a meeting with Ukraine. And, as my colleagues have shown,  they failed to give you key facts about a meeting and lots of other  evidence that they produced themselves.   Let's talk about the meeting. They said it was all about an  invitation to a meeting. If you look at the first transcript--at the  first transcript--the President said to President Zelensky:         When you're settled and you're ready, I'd like to invite       you to the White House. We'll have a lot of things to talk       about, but we are with you all the way.    President Zelensky said:         Well, thank you for the invitation. We accept the       invitation, and look forward to the visit. Thank you again.   [[Page S578]]     Then, President Zelensky got a letter on May 29 inviting him, again,  to come to the White House. Then, going back to the transcript of the  July 25 call--again, a part of the call that they didn't talk to you  about--President Trump said:         Whenever you would like to come to the White House, feel       free to call. Give us a date, and we'll work that out. I look       forward to seeing you.    President Zelensky replied:         Thank you very much. I would be very happy to come and       would be happy to meet with you personally and get to know       you better. I am looking forward to our meeting and I also       would like to invite you to visit Ukraine and come to the       city of Kyiv which is a beautiful city. We have a beautiful       country which would welcome you.    Then he said:         On the other hand, I believe that on September 1 we will be       in Poland and we can meet in Poland hopefully.    Now, they didn't read to you that part of the transcript, and they  didn't tell you what happened. A meeting in Poland was scheduled.  President Trump was scheduled to go to Poland. He was scheduled to meet  with President Zelensky.   What happened? President Trump couldn't go to Poland. Why? Because  there was a hurricane in the United States. He thought it would be  better for him to stay here to help deal with the hurricane. So the  Vice President went.   Why didn't they tell you that? Why didn't they tell you that  President Zelensky suggested: Hey, how about we meet in Poland?   Why didn't they tell you that that meeting was scheduled and had to  be canceled for a hurricane. Why? That was our first question that we  asked you. You heard a lot of facts that they didn't tell you--facts  that are critical, facts that they know completely collapse their case  on the facts.   Now, you heard a lot from them: You are not going to hear facts from  the President's lawyers. They are not going to talk to you about the  facts.   That is all we have done today. Ask yourself--ask yourself: Given the  facts you have heard today that they didn't tell you, who doesn't want  to talk about the facts? Who doesn't want to talk about the facts?   The American people paid a lot of money for those facts. They paid a  lot of money for this investigation. And they didn't bother to tell  you. Ask yourself why. If they don't want to be fair to the President,  at least out of respect for all of you, they should be fair to you.  They should tell you these things. And when they don't tell you these  things, it means something. So think about that. Impeachment shouldn't  be a shell game. They should give you the facts.   That is all we have for today. We ask you, out of respect, to think  about it. Think about whether what you have heard would really suggest  to anybody anything other than it would be a completely irresponsible  abuse of power to do what they are asking you to do--to stop an  election, to interfere in an election, and then to remove the President  of the United States from the ballot.   Let the people decide for themselves. That is what the Founders  wanted. That is what we should all want.   With that, I thank you for your attention, and I look forward to  seeing you on Monday.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.                            ____________________
