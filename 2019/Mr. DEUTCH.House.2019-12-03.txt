 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4018) to provide that the amount of time that an elderly  offender must serve before being eligible for placement in home  detention is to be reduced by the amount of good time credits earned by  the prisoner, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4018         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. GOOD CONDUCT TIME CREDITS FOR CERTAIN ELDERLY                     NONVIOLENT OFFENDERS.         Section 231(g)(5)(A)(ii) of the Second Chance Act of 2007       (34 U.S.C. 60541(g)(5)(A)(ii)) is amended by striking ``to       which the offender was sentenced'' and inserting ``reduced by       any credit toward the service of the prisoner's sentence       awarded under section 3624(b) of title 18, United States       Code''.       SEC. 2. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4018 is a modest, but important, bill that I  introduced with Ranking Member Collins to address an inadvertent  drafting error in the Second Chance Act, one that has prevented elderly  offenders who qualify for early release under a pilot program for  compassionate release from receiving credit for the good conduct time  they have accrued while in custody.   Our Nation's Federal prison population is rapidly aging. Of the 1.5  million adults currently in State and Federal prisons, there has been a  300 percent spike in the elderly population since 1999. By 2050, it is  estimated that one-third of the prison population of the United States  will be over age 50.   Today more people die of old age in U.S. prisons than ever before,  and from 2001 to 2007 alone, nearly 8,500 people over age 55 died  behind bars. The Federal prisoner reentry initiative, a pilot program  created under the Second Chance Act, allows offenders who are elderly  and have served at least two-thirds of their sentence to petition for  release from prison and to serve their remaining term of imprisonment  in a halfway house. This program is not only humane, it is fiscally  responsible.   The increasing number of elderly prisoners is leading to soaring  costs for the Bureau of Prisons. With a more elderly prisoner  population, prison infrastructure must be outfitted or equipped to  accommodate the unique needs of elderly prisoners. Prisons need to be  outfitted with ramps, lower bed heights, bunk beds eliminated,  handrails installed in showers, and other structural changes. Also,  prison staff need to be trained to work with elderly prisoners and move  elderly prisoners around the facilities.   We imprison too many elderly inmates unnecessarily for far too long,  and the data reveals that the recidivism rate is reduced dramatically  as the population ages. Good conduct time is provided to all prisoners  who have satisfactory behavior in the Bureau of Prisons. A prisoner can  earn 54 days of good conduct time or days off their sentence per year,  however, due to an inadvertent error in the Federal prisoner reentry  initiative, elderly inmates are not permitted to receive credit for  good conduct.   Elderly inmates, who otherwise have satisfactory behavior, should not  lose the good conduct time they have earned solely as a result of this  drafting error. Such an unjust result was not the intent of Congress  when drafting the Second Chance Act, as the intent behind this  compassionate program is to release a vulnerable population from prison  when they present little risk to their communities.   H.R. 4018 would correct this problem, and therefore, I urge my  colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill. Mr. Speaker, I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Cline, Chairman Nadler, Ranking Member  Collins, and Mr. Jeffries for their leadership on this effort.   Mr. Speaker, the process for earning time off for good conduct in  prison is important as a matter of fairness and also effective prison  administration.   Individuals who earn good conduct time should not lose credit for  this time because of an error in a statute, and elderly, nonviolent  offenders should receive credit for the time they have earned.   Therefore, H.R. 4018 is required to address an unfortunate,  inadvertent  [[Page H9192]]  error. I am glad that it will. I appreciate the support, and for all of  these reasons I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this good,  bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
