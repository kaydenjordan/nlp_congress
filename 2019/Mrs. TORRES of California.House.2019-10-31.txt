 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of  H. Res. 660.   Madam Speaker, impeachment is not something that we take lightly, but  [[Page H8692]]  when the President endangers our national security, he gives us no  other choice.   We now know from Trump's own call record that he pressured a foreign  government to interfere in our elections and investigate his political  opponent.   We now know that Trump potentially sought to apply leverage on  Ukraine, first with a coveted White House meeting and, second, by  withholding security assistance to fend off Russian aggression.    Today's resolution allows us to present these facts in a clear,  professional, and fair way.   Madam Speaker, I urge passage of H. Res. 660 so the American people  can, too, learn the truth.
