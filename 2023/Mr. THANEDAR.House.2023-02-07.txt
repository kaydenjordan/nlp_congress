 Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate National Black History  Month, I pay tribute to a Detroit-born African-American leader, Joe  Tate, who became the first African-American man elected as Speaker of  the Michigan State House this year.   Speaker Joe Tate, the son of a firefighter, played football at  Michigan State and later in the NFL. He also served in Afghanistan as  an officer in the United States Marine Corps.   I am honored to have Speaker Tate as my guest for tonight's State of  the Union Address.   Along with Joe Tate, today I also honor Congresswoman Barbara-Rose  Collins, the first Black woman elected to Congress from Michigan, who  worked tirelessly to break down barriers.   I proudly served with Mr. Tate in the Michigan House and look forward  to working with him for a better Michigan.                            ____________________
