 Madam Speaker, I rise to support Representative Lee's  amendment to say no to unauthorized wars.   The Trump administration claims that this outdated authorization  justifies future strikes against Iran. That is outrageous. And as a  result of the assassination of General Soleimani and Iran's  retaliation, we now have 50 American soldiers tragically injured.   Representative Lee, during debate in 2002 on this very authorization,  said: ``It does not take leadership to go drop bombs and go to war. It  takes real leadership to negotiate and to develop peaceful resolutions  to our security needs.''   Seventeen years ago, Madam Speaker, I spoke at a rally of 50,000  people in Seattle who believed the evidence was not there to go to war  in Iraq. Today, we know we were right. We must learn from that.   Let's repeal this outdated authorization and ensure that Congress has  real oversight and debate before we go into any war. Let's show  leadership and stop these endless, unauthorized wars.
