 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the urgent need  for increased U.S. Coast Guard assets in the polar regions of the  globe.   America has been a world leader and a dominant force in the Arctic  and Antarctic regions for over a century. While both of these areas are  currently models of internationally shared territory, the geopolitical  relevance of the polar regions is rising, and with it comes a larger  and stronger presence of countries such as Russia and China.   Russia and China have both declared plans to grow and strengthen  their presence in the polar region. China recently announced its status  as a near-Arctic nation and continues to rapidly grow its ice-breaking  fleet. Over the last 3 years, Russia has constructed six new bases in  Russian Arctic territory.   These are concerning and clear signs that Russia and China have  intentions to change the nature of their presence in the polar regions.   In order to compete with these countries, we must protect our  sovereignty in the Arctic and our national interests in the Antarctic.  It is time for Congress to reinvest in Coast Guard assets in this area.   The Coast Guard's sole heavy icebreaker, the Coast Guard cutter Polar  Star, is 40 years old, and the task of accessing the polar region  becomes more difficult for this ship every ice season.   Immediate investments in new heavy icebreaker ships, the Polar  Security Cutter fleet, is critical to ensuring a long-term presence for  the U.S. in these polar areas.   The U.S. Coast Guard has created a 6-3-1 approach to rebuilding its  polar region fleets. With this 6-3-1 position, the Coast Guard will  build a fleet of six polar icebreakers, including three Polar Security  cutters similar to the Polar Star, and the U.S. Coast Guard's first  Polar Security cutter.   These new heavy icebreakers provide continued access to the polar  region and, ultimately, will prevent the U.S. from ceding any ground to  our political adversaries.   I appreciate the hard work done by the folks at the Coast Guard, not  only in the polar regions, but across the world. Their efforts play a  role in ensuring our national security, and it is vital that we  continue to provide the Coast Guard with the funding they need in order  to do their jobs.   This investment will arm the Coast Guard with the tools, equipment,  and personnel it needs to complete its missions on the polar front.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in Congress to join me in  supporting the requested $750 million in funding.                            ____________________
