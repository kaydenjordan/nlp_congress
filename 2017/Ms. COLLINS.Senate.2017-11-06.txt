 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Bernard Shaw devoted his life to  supporting Maine's family farms and to preserving our State's  agricultural heritage. His recent passing at 88 years of  [[Page S7012]]  age was a great loss, but he left behind a legacy that will be  cherished for generations to come.   I rise today in tribute to this outstanding leader and to offer my  deepest condolences to his wife Norma, family, and friends.   Growing up in Aroostook County, the heart of Maine's potato industry,  I saw every day the importance of family farms to our way of life and  to our communities. Bernard was a leader in this iconic Aroostook  industry.   Born in Limestone, ME, near my hometown of Caribou, Bernard began  farming with Norma's father, Herman Ward. In addition to helping to  build a strong and successful family business, he served the industry  in numerous agricultural organizations at the local, State, and  national levels.   Bernard served as Maine's commissioner of agriculture from 1988 to  1996 during Governor McKernan's administration. During my own service  in State government, I had the pleasure of working alongside Bernard, a  leader of uncommon energy, intelligence, and dedication.   During their 67 years of marriage, in both Aroostook County and our  State capital of Augusta, Bernard and Norma were active volunteers in  their community, serving youth programs, civic organizations, schools,  and their church. Upon Bernard's retirement in 1996, the couple devoted  countless hours to the Augusta Food Bank, helping their neighbors in  need throughout the capital region.   In 2012, Bernard and Norma were honored with the Maine Agriculture  Commissioner's Distinguished Service Award. The citation accompanying  that award described them as ``two of the most accomplished, yet  humble, contributors to Maine's agricultural community'' who  personified the traditional, hard-working Maine farm family.   Bernard Shaw was guided by the traditions that define Maine, and he  strengthened them for the future. His invaluable contributions to  agriculture and to our State will be deeply missed, but he will long be  remembered for his leadership and vision.    Mr. President, I am delighted to commend Connors-Emerson  School in Bar Harbor, ME, on being named a 2017 National Blue Ribbon  School of Excellence. Serving students from kindergarten through the  eighth grade, this outstanding school is one of only 342 schools across  the country to receive Blue Ribbon recognition from the U.S. Department  of Education.   Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and  private schools that are either academically superior in their States  or that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The  schools singled out for this national recognition are models of high  educational standards and accountability.   The Blue Ribbon designation continues a tradition of quality  education at Connors-Emerson. Since first being named a Blue Ribbon  School in 2004, educators and staff have deepened and expanded  standards-based teaching and learning. More than half of the faculty  have advanced degrees or certification as master level teachers. A  strong commitment to professional development ensures that teachers and  staff, as well as students, are lifelong learners.   Bar Harbor is the gateway to Acadia National Park, and the school has  a strong ethic of environmental responsibility. Currently, the seventh  grade students at Connors-Emerson are working on an expeditionary  learning unit which is exploring the effects of climate change on  Acadia and all of Mount Desert Island.   Bar Harbor also is home to the MDI Biological Laboratory and to the  Jackson Laboratory, world-renowned research institutions. Connors- Emerson excels in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics  education. The math team and robotics team have received honors at both  the State and national levels, and the school has been awarded several  grants to advance STEM education.   Fully 98 percent of students in grades five through eight participate  in afterschool activities. From the State champion jazz band and drama  to Destination Imagination and the Outdoors Club, students are  encouraged to pursue their interests.   As a school community, Connors-Emerson is dedicated to the values of  fairness, compassion, honesty, responsibility, respect, and courtesy  that help to create a positive, diverse, safe, and caring learning  environment.   This Blue Ribbon Award is a tribute not only to the students but also  to the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents of Connors-Emerson  School. Together, they are succeeding in their mission to generate  excitement and momentum for learning. They are making a difference in  the lives of their students, helping them reach their full potential as  independent, responsible learners and citizens. I congratulate the  entire Bar Harbor community for this well-deserved recognition.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am delighted to commend Falmouth  Elementary School in Falmouth, ME, on being named a 2017 National Blue  Ribbon School of Excellence. Serving students from kindergarten through  the fifth grade, this outstanding school is one of only 342 schools  across the country to receive Blue Ribbon recognition from the U.S.  Department of Education.   Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and  private schools that are either academically superior in their States  or that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The  schools singled out for this national recognition are models of high  educational standards and accountability.   The Blue Ribbon designation continues a tradition of quality  education in Falmouth. Established just 6 years ago, the elementary  school is relatively young; however, it has a rich history steeped in  tradition. The union of two schools in 2011 created the largest  elementary school in Maine. One of those schools, Plummer-Motz,  received a Blue Ribbon Award in 2005, and the dedication to quality  education was expanded through a transition that was guided by a team  of representatives from each of the two schools.   Faculty and staff at Falmouth are committed to both academic  excellence and each child's social, emotional, and physical health.  They work to ensure a  [[Page S7013]]  safe and secure learning environment and to develop strong and  collaborative relationships with parents and community members.   Students have rich and diverse learning opportunities in art and  music, and library skills are part of every child's learning. World  language instruction starts in the first grade, and computer science  classes start in grade 3. Students benefit from interdisciplinary  learning through the garden-greenhouse and through celebrations such as  Arts Nights, Coder Express, and Engineering Night.   This award recognizes that Falmouth Elementary School students  achieve at the highest level. The school involves all students in  extracurricular activities, which helps forge a strong school community  where students are connected and encouraged to pursue their interests.   I applaud the administrators, teachers, staff, and parents of  Falmouth Elementary School. Together, they are succeeding in their  mission to generate confidence and momentum for learning. They are  making a difference in the lives of their students, helping them reach  their full potential as independent, responsible learners and citizens.  I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has selected  Falmouth Elementary School for this well-deserved honor, and I  congratulate the entire school community for this outstanding  achievement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am delighted to commend Fourteenth  Street School in Bangor, ME, on being named a 2017 National Blue Ribbon  School of Excellence. Serving students from prekindergarten through the  third grade, this outstanding school in the city I am proud to live is  one of only 342 schools across the country to receive Blue Ribbon  recognition from the U.S. Department of Education.   Created in 1982, the Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and  private schools that are either academically superior in their States  or that demonstrate significant gains in student achievement. The  schools singled out for this national recognition are models of high  educational standards and accountability.   The success at Fourteenth Street School is the result of two guiding  philosophies. The first is ``meet the students where they are,'' with  instruction and support tailored to the strengths and needs of each  individual student. The second is ``all hands on deck,'' a call for all  staff members to engage with students and encourage them to achieve  their full potential.   One of the unique features of Fourteenth Street School is the use of  every opportunity during the school day to support learning. Whether in  the classroom, preparing for recess, or standing in the lunchroom,  students may be participating in a math game, reciting a rhyme, or  singing. The entire school eats lunch together daily, and a staff  member uses this time to read aloud to students. This focus on literacy  even extends to physical education classes, where the PE teacher often  reads articles from sports magazines to students.   The impact of this dedication to individual students is evident. Over  the last 5 years, average attendance exceeded 95 percent, and 100  percent of students participated in at least one afterschool activity.   Another important factor in the school's success is the emphasis on  building strong relationships with families. Through schoolwide and  classroom newsletters, parent meetings, parents and educators  accelerating kids--PEAK--events, academic showcases, and, most  important, direct communication with teachers, parents have the  opportunity to play a significant role in their children's education.   I applaud the administrators, teachers, staff, parents, and students  of Fourteenth Street School. Together, they are succeeding in their  mission to generate confidence and momentum for learning. This  outstanding school is making a difference in the lives of its students,  helping them to become independent, responsible learners and citizens.  I am pleased that the U.S. Department of Education has selected  Fourteenth Street School for this well-deserved honor, and I  congratulate the entire school community for this outstanding  achievement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from  Nevada, Senator Cortez Masto, to introduce the Building Our Largest  Dementia Infrastructure for Alzheimer's--or BOLD--Act. I am pleased  that Senator Capito and Senator Kaine are also joining us as original  cosponsors.   Our legislation would create a public health infrastructure aimed at  combating Alzheimer's disease and preserving brain health. Alzheimer's  disease is one of the greatest and most under-recognized public health  threats of our time. Former Surgeon General David Satcher has said that  it is the most under-recognized public health threat of the 21st  century. Five and a half million Americans are living with the disease,  and that number will soar as our population continues to grow older and  lives longer.   In addition to the human suffering it causes, Alzheimer's is our  Nation's most costly disease. The United States spends more than $259  billion per year, including $175 billion in Medicare and Medicaid  costs. The financial impact of this dreadful disease will only continue  to grow. In fact, it is estimated that by the year 2050, Alzheimer's  will cost our country $1 trillion and afflict 16 million Americans.   While Alzheimer's is the only one of our Nation's most deadly  diseases without an effective treatment or cure, tantalizing new  research suggests that there are steps we can take to promote  prevention and improve treatment.   The first step we should take is to recognize Alzheimer's as a public  health crisis. It is because of public health advancements that we have  safe water to drink, vaccines to prevent deadly diseases, interventions  to quit smoking, and emergency preparedness tools to save lives. The  effort to combat Alzheimer's disease requires a similar unified,  national public health effort. That effort is gaining steam.   In 1999, when I founded the Bipartisan Congressional Task Force on  Alzheimer's, there was virtually no focus in Washington on this  devastating disease. In fact, people were afraid to even refer to the  disease, just as years ago people did not talk about cancer.   Seven years ago, I coauthored with then-Senator Evan Bayh the  bipartisan National Alzheimer's Project Act, which set the primary goal  of preventing and effectively treating the disease by the year 2025.  That bill created an expert council, which has calculated that $2  billion in Federal funding per year is needed to achieve that goal.   On the Appropriations Committee, I have worked hard with Senator  Blunt and others to turn the words of that recommendation into action.  The funding bill for this year provides another $2 billion increase for  the National Institutes of Health, and that includes a $414 million  increase for Alzheimer's research--the largest in history. That brings  the total for Alzheimer's research to $1.8 billion--well within reach  of the $2 billion goal, which the experts tell us is necessary for  breakthroughs.   While this research is moving forward, we must put into practice what  we know and enhance the quality of care and support for those living  with Alzheimer's and their families. In March, the Aging Committee,  which I chair, held a hearing on the arc of Alzheimer's, from  preventing cognitive decline to ensuring quality care for those living  with dementia. The hearing shed light on the fact that although we do  not yet know how to prevent Alzheimer's, we are advancing in our  understanding of the disease. Its progression does not happen  overnight; it is preceded by years and perhaps decades of changes in  the brain and a continuum of changes in behavior, including cognitive  decline. A growing body of evidence suggests that lifestyle factors,  such as regular physical activity and attention to heart health, may  reduce the risk of cognitive decline. There is so much we have yet to  know.   Alzheimer's is a public issue for those living with the disease, for  those caring for their loved ones with the disease, for all of us as  taxpayers, and for those who know that our brain is our most precious  resource. Alzheimer's exacts a tremendous personal and economic toll on  families and communities. More than 40 million Americans know all too  well the compassion, commitment, and endurance that it takes to be a  caregiver of a loved one facing a chronic disease like Alzheimer's.   The legislation we are introducing today would apply a new public  health approach to Alzheimer's disease. It would establish Centers of  Excellence in Public Health Practice dedicated to promoting effective  Alzheimer's disease management and caregiving interventions, as well as  educating the public on the disease, cognitive decline, and brain  health.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is already doing  tremendous work to combat Alzheimer's within the Public Health Road Map  of the Healthy Brain Initiative. This legislation would create centers  of excellence across the country to implement the CDC's Public Health  Road Map. The centers would take a number of key steps against  Alzheimer's. They would work to support early detection and diagnosis,  lessen the risk of avoidable hospitalizations, reduce the risk of  cognitive decline, enhance support to meet the needs of caregivers,  reduce health disparities, and support care planning and management for  those with the disease. The Centers' activities would support health  and social services professionals as well as families and communities.    In addition to establishing the Centers of Excellence in Public  Health Practice, this bill would spread the opportunity for communities  across America to create the necessary core capacity to combat  Alzheimer's and to enhance existing efforts in this regard. The  legislation would establish and distribute cooperative agreements to  public health departments to support systems change, communications,  and programmatic interventions. These agreements would also support the  actions in the CDC Healthy Brain Initiative's Public Health Roadmap.   Finally, at the heart of public health is data. This legislation  would direct the CDC to collect data on cognitive decline, cognitive  impairment, caregiving, and health disparities within its current  systems. The bill would also create cooperative agreements for the  analysis and reporting of data to ensure that the results are  disseminated to the public and are used, ultimately, to improve brain  health.   For far too long, we have viewed Alzheimer's disease as an aging  issue that plagues our seniors today and threatens to affect many more  tomorrow. In fact, the disease is far more than that.  [[Page S7018]]  It is a public health issue with a course that we can change. If we do  not take action, both in this new public health approach and by  continuing to build on the research, this disease will bankrupt the  Medicare and the Medicaid Programs. We cannot afford to spend over $1  trillion in the year 2050 on just this one disease. We cannot afford to  lose 16 million Americans by that year to this devastating disease. We  cannot afford to allow the heartache and devastation of this disease to  affect more and more American families.   There are steps that we can take today to prevent cognitive decline  and to improve the lives of those who are living with Alzheimer's and  the lives of their caregivers. This public health approach is not only  empowering, but it is key to avoiding the terrible impacts that I have  outlined.   After decades of expanding much needed biomedical research in  Alzheimer's, we are ready for the next step--to translate research into  policy. The BOLD bill would create a new, enlightened public policy out  of promising research by creating the first ever national public health  infrastructure for Alzheimer's disease.   I am pleased to say that the bipartisan bill that the Senator from  Nevada and I have introduced, with our colleagues from Virginia and  West Virginia, is endorsed by the Alzheimer's Association, the  Alzheimer's Impact Movement, the National Association of Chronic  Disease Directors, and the National Association of Counties.   I ask unanimous consent that their letters of support be printed in  the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   I urge my colleagues to support this critical and bipartisan  legislation.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                    Alzheimer's Impact Movement,                                   Washington, DC, November 6, 2017.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Shelley Moore Capito,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Tim Kaine,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins, Cortez Masto, Capito and Kaine: On       behalf of the Alzheimer's Association and the Alzheimer's       Impact Movement (AIM), including our nationwide networks of       advocates, thank you for your continued leadership on issues       and legislation important to Americans with Alzheimer's and       other dementias, and to their caregivers. The Alzheimer's       Association and AIM are pleased to support the bipartisan       Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for       Alzheimer's Act, which would create an Alzheimer's public       health infrastructure across the country to implement       effective Alzheimer's interventions focused on public health       issues such as increasing early detection and diagnosis,       reducing risk and preventing avoidable hospitalizations.        More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's       and, without significant action, as many as 16 million       Americans will have Alzheimer's by 2050. Today, another       person develops the disease every 66 seconds; by 2050,       someone in the United States will develop the disease every       33 seconds. This explosive growth will cause Alzheimer's       costs to increase from an estimated $259 billion in 2017 to       $1.1 trillion in 2050 (in 2017 dollars). These mounting costs       threaten to bankrupt families, businesses and our health care       system. Unfortunately, our work is only growing more urgent.        As scientists continue to search for a way to prevent,       cure, or slow the progression of Alzheimer's through medical       research, public health plays an important role in promoting       cognitive function and reducing the risk of cognitive       decline. Investing in a nationwide Alzheimer's public health       response will help create population-level change, achieve a       higher quality of life for those living with the disease and       their caregivers, and reduce associated costs. The BOLD       Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act would provide this crucial       investment by establishing Alzheimer's centers of excellence       across the country and funding state, local and tribal public       health departments to increase early detection and diagnosis,       reduce risk, prevent avoidable hospitalizations, reduce       health disparities, support the needs of caregivers and       support care planning for people living with the disease.       These important public health actions allow individuals with       Alzheimer's to live in their homes longer and delay costly       institutionalized care. These goals are consistent with the       National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, which includes       a strategy to ``work with state, tribal, and local       governments to improve coordination and identify model       initiatives to advance Alzheimer's disease and related       dementias awareness and readiness across the government.''        The BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act would also       increase the collection, analysis and timely reporting of       Alzheimer's data. This data is critical to identifying       opportunities for public health interventions, helping       stakeholders track progress in the public health response,       and enabling state and federal policymakers to make informed       decisions when developing plans and policies. Finally, the       bill would also strengthen implementation of the Center for       Disease Control and Prevention's Public Health Road Map,       which includes strategic action items for state and local       public health departments and their partners to promote       cognitive functioning, address cognitive impairment and help       meet the needs of care partners.        The Alzheimer's Association and AIM deeply appreciate your       continued leadership on behalf of all American's living with       Alzheimer's and other dementias. We look forward to working       with you to advance this important bipartisan bill. If you       have any questions about this or any other legislation,       please contact Rachel Conant, Senior Director of Federal       Affairs.            Sincerely,      Robert Egge,        Chief Public Policy Officer, Executive Vice President,       Government Affairs, Alzheimer's Association.                                   ____                                                   November 6, 2017.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Shelley Moore Capito,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Tim Kaine,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins, Cortez Masto, Capito and Kaine: On       behalf of the undersigned organizations, thank you for your       leadership on the important public health issues facing our       nation, including the urgent issue of Americans with       Alzheimer's and other dementias. We are pleased to support       the bipartisan Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD)       Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act, which would create an       Alzheimer's public health infrastructure across the country       to implement effective interventions focused on public health       issues such as increasing early detection and diagnosis,       reducing risk and preventing avoidable hospitalizations.

More than 5       million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer's and,       without significant action, as many as 16 million Americans       will have Alzheimer's by 2050. Today, another person develops       the disease every 66 seconds; by 2050, someone in the United       States will develop the disease every 33 seconds. This       explosive growth will cause Alzheimer's costs to increase       from an estimated $259 billion in 2017 to $1.1 trillion in       2050 (in 2017 dollars). These mounting costs threaten to       bankrupt families, businesses and our health care system.        Public health plays an important role in protecting the       health and well-being of Americans, including promoting       cognitive function and reducing the risk of cognitive       decline. Investing in a nationwide Alzheimer's public health       response will help create population-level change, achieve a       higher quality of life for those living with the disease and       their caregivers, and reduce associated costs.

We deeply appreciate your leadership on behalf of the       public health community and  [[Page S7019]]       all American's living with Alzheimer's and other dementias.       We look forward to working with you to advance this important       bipartisan bill.            Sincerely,      Alzheimer's Association,      Alzheimer's Impact Movement,      National Association of Chronic Disease,      Directors, National Association of Counties.     I am now very pleased to yield to the coauthor of this  important bill. Senator Cortez Masto has been an extraordinary member  of the Senate Special Committee on Aging. She attends every single  hearing, which is amazing, given our schedules, and she contributes so  much to the debate and questioning in those hearings. I am delighted to  join in this effort with her.    Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from  Nevada, Senator Cortez Masto, to introduce the Building Our Largest  Dementia Infrastructure for Alzheimer's--or BOLD--Act.

They would work to support early detection and diagnosis,  lessen the risk of avoidable hospitalizations, reduce the risk of  cognitive decline, enhance support to meet the needs of caregivers,  reduce health disparities, and support care planning and management for  those with the disease. The Centers' activities would support health  and social services professionals as well as families and communities.    In addition to establishing the Centers of Excellence in Public  Health Practice, this bill would spread the opportunity for communities  across America to create the necessary core capacity to combat  Alzheimer's and to enhance existing efforts in this regard. The  legislation would establish and distribute cooperative agreements to  public health departments to support systems change, communications,  and programmatic interventions. These agreements would also support the  actions in the CDC Healthy Brain Initiative's Public Health Roadmap.   Finally, at the heart of public health is data. This legislation  would direct the CDC to collect data on cognitive decline, cognitive  impairment, caregiving, and health disparities within its current  systems. The bill would also create cooperative agreements for the  analysis and reporting of data to ensure that the results are  disseminated to the public and are used, ultimately, to improve brain  health.   For far too long, we have viewed Alzheimer's disease as an aging  issue that plagues our seniors today and threatens to affect many more  tomorrow. In fact, the disease is far more than that.  [[Page S7018]]  It is a public health issue with a course that we can change. If we do  not take action, both in this new public health approach and by  continuing to build on the research, this disease will bankrupt the  Medicare and the Medicaid Programs. We cannot afford to spend over $1  trillion in the year 2050 on just this one disease. We cannot afford to  lose 16 million Americans by that year to this devastating disease. We  cannot afford to allow the heartache and devastation of this disease to  affect more and more American families.   There are steps that we can take today to prevent cognitive decline  and to improve the lives of those who are living with Alzheimer's and  the lives of their caregivers. This public health approach is not only  empowering, but it is key to avoiding the terrible impacts that I have  outlined.   After decades of expanding much needed biomedical research in  Alzheimer's, we are ready for the next step--to translate research into  policy. The BOLD bill would create a new, enlightened public policy out  of promising research by creating the first ever national public health  infrastructure for Alzheimer's disease.   I am pleased to say that the bipartisan bill that the Senator from  Nevada and I have introduced, with our colleagues from Virginia and  West Virginia, is endorsed by the Alzheimer's Association, the  Alzheimer's Impact Movement, the National Association of Chronic  Disease Directors, and the National Association of Counties.   I ask unanimous consent that their letters of support be printed in  the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.   I urge my colleagues to support this critical and bipartisan  legislation.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                    Alzheimer's Impact Movement,                                   Washington, DC, November 6, 2017.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Shelley Moore Capito,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Tim Kaine,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins, Cortez Masto, Capito and Kaine: On       behalf of the Alzheimer's Association and the Alzheimer's       Impact Movement (AIM), including our nationwide networks of       advocates, thank you for your continued leadership on issues       and legislation important to Americans with Alzheimer's and       other dementias, and to their caregivers. The Alzheimer's       Association and AIM are pleased to support the bipartisan       Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for       Alzheimer's Act, which would create an Alzheimer's public       health infrastructure across the country to implement       effective Alzheimer's interventions focused on public health       issues such as increasing early detection and diagnosis,       reducing risk and preventing avoidable hospitalizations.        More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's       and, without significant action, as many as 16 million       Americans will have Alzheimer's by 2050. Today, another       person develops the disease every 66 seconds; by 2050,       someone in the United States will develop the disease every       33 seconds. This explosive growth will cause Alzheimer's       costs to increase from an estimated $259 billion in 2017 to       $1.1 trillion in 2050 (in 2017 dollars). These mounting costs       threaten to bankrupt families, businesses and our health care       system. Unfortunately, our work is only growing more urgent.        As scientists continue to search for a way to prevent,       cure, or slow the progression of Alzheimer's through medical       research, public health plays an important role in promoting       cognitive function and reducing the risk of cognitive       decline. Investing in a nationwide Alzheimer's public health       response will help create population-level change, achieve a       higher quality of life for those living with the disease and       their caregivers, and reduce associated costs. The BOLD       Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act would provide this crucial       investment by establishing Alzheimer's centers of excellence       across the country and funding state, local and tribal public       health departments to increase early detection and diagnosis,       reduce risk, prevent avoidable hospitalizations, reduce       health disparities, support the needs of caregivers and       support care planning for people living with the disease.       These important public health actions allow individuals with       Alzheimer's to live in their homes longer and delay costly       institutionalized care. These goals are consistent with the       National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, which includes       a strategy to ``work with state, tribal, and local       governments to improve coordination and identify model       initiatives to advance Alzheimer's disease and related       dementias awareness and readiness across the government.''        The BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act would also       increase the collection, analysis and timely reporting of       Alzheimer's data. This data is critical to identifying       opportunities for public health interventions, helping       stakeholders track progress in the public health response,       and enabling state and federal policymakers to make informed       decisions when developing plans and policies. Finally, the       bill would also strengthen implementation of the Center for       Disease Control and Prevention's Public Health Road Map,       which includes strategic action items for state and local       public health departments and their partners to promote       cognitive functioning, address cognitive impairment and help       meet the needs of care partners.        The Alzheimer's Association and AIM deeply appreciate your       continued leadership on behalf of all American's living with       Alzheimer's and other dementias. We look forward to working       with you to advance this important bipartisan bill. If you       have any questions about this or any other legislation,       please contact Rachel Conant, Senior Director of Federal       Affairs.            Sincerely,      Robert Egge,        Chief Public Policy Officer, Executive Vice President,       Government Affairs, Alzheimer's Association.                                   ____                                                   November 6, 2017.      Hon. Susan Collins,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Shelley Moore Capito,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Tim Kaine,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Collins, Cortez Masto, Capito and Kaine: On       behalf of the undersigned organizations, thank you for your       leadership on the important public health issues facing our       nation, including the urgent issue of Americans with       Alzheimer's and other dementias. We are pleased to support       the bipartisan Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD)       Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act, which would create an       Alzheimer's public health infrastructure across the country       to implement effective interventions focused on public health       issues such as increasing early detection and diagnosis,       reducing risk and preventing avoidable hospitalizations.        Former Surgeon General and Director of the Centers for       Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Dr. David Satcher       recently said, ``Alzheimer's is the most under-recognized       threat to public health in the 21st century.'' More than 5       million Americans are currently living with Alzheimer's and,       without significant action, as many as 16 million Americans       will have Alzheimer's by 2050. Today, another person develops       the disease every 66 seconds; by 2050, someone in the United       States will develop the disease every 33 seconds. This       explosive growth will cause Alzheimer's costs to increase       from an estimated $259 billion in 2017 to $1.1 trillion in       2050 (in 2017 dollars). These mounting costs threaten to       bankrupt families, businesses and our health care system.        Public health plays an important role in protecting the       health and well-being of Americans, including promoting       cognitive function and reducing the risk of cognitive       decline. Investing in a nationwide Alzheimer's public health       response will help create population-level change, achieve a       higher quality of life for those living with the disease and       their caregivers, and reduce associated costs.

We deeply appreciate your leadership on behalf of the       public health community and  [[Page S7019]]       all American's living with Alzheimer's and other dementias.       We look forward to working with you to advance this important       bipartisan bill.            Sincerely,      Alzheimer's Association,      Alzheimer's Impact Movement,      National Association of Chronic Disease,      Directors, National Association of Counties.     I am now very pleased to yield to the coauthor of this  important bill. Senator Cortez Masto has been an extraordinary member  of the Senate Special Committee on Aging. She attends every single  hearing, which is amazing, given our schedules, and she contributes so  much to the debate and questioning in those hearings. I am delighted to  join in this effort with her.
