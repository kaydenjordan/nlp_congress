 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                     Washington, DC.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION           Poland--High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)         The Republic of Poland has requested to buy eighteen (18)       M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)       launchers; four hundred sixty-eight (468) HIMARS Launcher       Loader Module kits; forty-five (45) M57 Army Tactical Missile       Systems (ATACMS); four hundred sixty-one (461) M30A2 Guided       Multiple Launch Rocket System Alternative Warhead (GMLRS-AW)       pods with Insensitive Munitions Propulsion System (IMPS);       five hundred twenty-one (521) M31A2 Guided Multiple Launch       Rocket System Unitary (GMLRS-U) pods with Insensitive       Munitions Propulsion System (IMPS); and five hundred thirty-      two (532) XM403 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System Extended       Range Alternative Warhead (GMLRS-ER AW) pods. Also included       are Low Cost Reduced Range Practice Rockets; support       equipment; communications equipment; spare and repair parts;       test sets; batteries; laptop computers; publications and       technical data; facility design; personnel training and       equipment; systems integration support; Quality Assurance       Teams and a Technical Assistance Fielding Team; United States       Government and contractor engineering and logistics personnel       services; training; sensors; and other related elements of       logistics and program support. The total estimated cost is       $10 billion.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals       and national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a NATO Ally that is a force for       political stability and economic progress in Europe.        The proposed sale will improve Poland's military goals of       updating capability while further enhancing interoperability       with the United States and other allies. Poland intends to       use these defense articles and services to modernize its       armed forces and expand its capability to strengthen its       homeland defense and deter regional threats. Poland will have       no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin, Grand       Prairie, TX. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       connection with this potential sale. Any future offset       agreement would be defined in negotiations between the       purchaser and the contractor(s).        Implementation of this proposed sale will require U.S.       Government or contractor representatives to travel to Poland       for program management reviews to support the program. Travel       is expected to occur approximately twice per year as needed       to support equipment fielding and training.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 23-10       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)       is a C-130 transportable wheeled launcher mounted on a 5-ton       Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles truck chassis. HIMARS is       the modern Army-fielded version of the Multiple Launch Rocket       System (MLRS) M270 launcher and can fire all of the MLRS       Family of Munitions (FOM) including Guided Multiple Launch       Rocket System (GMLRS) variants and the Army Tactical Missile       System (ATACMS). Utilizing the MLRS FOM, the HIMARS can       engage targets between 15 and 300 kilometers with GPS-aided       precision accuracy.        2. The HIMARS Launcher Loader Module (LM) is mounted to the       vehicle chassis and provides the necessary structure and       mechanisms for the loading, launching, and unloading of all       the MFOM rocket and missile munitions. The LM consists of a       platform, a turret, and a base assembly. The base assembly       interfaces with the carrier vehicle. The turret system sits       on top of the base and allows for the aiming of the LM       assembly in azimuth. The platform, on which one rocket pod is       mounted, allows for the aiming of the LM in elevation.  [[Page S256]]             3. The M57 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS)--Unitary       is a conventional, semi-ballistic missile that utilizes a       500-pound high explosive warhead. It has an effective range       of between 70 and 300 kilometers, and has increased lethality       and accuracy over previous versions of the ATACMS due to a       GPS/Precise Position System (PPS) aided navigation system.        4. The M31A2 GMLRS Unitary is the Army's primary munition       for units fielding the M142 HIMARS and M270Al Multiple       Launcher Rocket System (MLRS) Launchers. The M31 Unitary is a       solid propellant artillery rocket that uses Global       Positioning System/Precise Positioning Service (GPS/PPS)-      aided inertial guidance to accurately and quickly deliver a       single high-explosive blast fragmentation warhead to targets       at ranges from 15-70 kilometers. The rockets are fired from a       launch pod container that also serves as the storage and       transportation container for the rockets. Each rocket pod       holds six (6) total rockets.        5. The M30A2 GMLRS Alternative Warhead shares a greater       than 90% commonality with the M31A1 Unitary. The primary       difference between the GMLRS-U and GMLRS--AW is the       replacement of the Unitary's high explosive warhead with a       200 pound fragmentation warhead of pre-formed tungsten       penetrators which is optimized for effectiveness against       large area and imprecisely located targets. The munitions       otherwise share a common motor, GPS/PPS-aided inertial       guidance and control system, fuzing mechanism, multi-option       height of burst capability, and effective range of 15-70km.        6. The Extended Range (ER) GMLRS provides a persistent,       responsive, all-weather, rapidly deployed, long range,       surface-to surface, area- and point-precision strike       capability. The XM403 Alternative Warhead (AW) carries a 200-      pound fragmentation assembly filled with high explosives       which, upon detonation, accelerates two layers of preformed       penetrators optimized for effectiveness against large area       and imprecisely located targets. The ER GMLRS maintains the       accuracy and effectiveness demonstrated by the baseline GMLRS       out to an increased range of 150 km and includes a modernized       Height of Burst (HOB) capability.        7. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        8. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        9. A determination has been made that Poland will provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        10. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Republic of Poland.                            ____________________
