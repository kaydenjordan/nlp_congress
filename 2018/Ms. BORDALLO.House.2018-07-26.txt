 Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank Chairman Thornberry and  commend Ranking Member Smith for their hard work in bringing this bill  to the floor. It has been an honor to be a member of this bipartisan  committee. I also want to recognize my chairman of the Readiness  Subcommittee, Joe Wilson of South Carolina, for his invaluable  assistance.   The conference agreement authorizes $247.2 billion in operations and  maintenance funding between the base and overseas contingency accounts.  This includes increases in readiness-enabling accounts to support  depot-level maintenance, parts and spares, training, and facilities  sustainment, restoration, and modernization.   The agreement also addresses readiness challenges of the surface Navy  following the four incidents that occurred in the Pacific last year.   With respect to military aviation, the agreement establishes a  National Commission on Military Aviation Safety that will assess the  causes of recent aviation mishaps and make changes for training,  maintenance personnel, and policies related to safety.   The FY19 NDAA also begins to address challenges with DOD's facilities  and infrastructure by authorizing appropriations of $11.3 billion for  military construction and family housing. This includes authorization  for 38 additional military construction projects from the services'  unfunded priorities list.   I am also grateful to the conference for including provisions  important to Guam.   First, the H-2B workforce provision allows us to fully implement the  marine relocation from Okinawa, which is vital to the security of the  Indo-Pacific region. This is an important step toward stabilizing  Guam's workforce crisis, and I hope to continue working on further  legislation needed for civilian relief.   Also, on the Navy's net negative commitment to Guam, the bill  improves transparency by establishing a publicly accessible list of  Navy property expected to be transferred to the Government of Guam.   The bill supports the ship repair industry on Guam and in the U.S.  The bill authorizes $32 million for the Navy to restore a dry dock  capability and prohibits the Navy from redeveloping the former ship  repair facility on Guam for any purpose other than to support depot- level ship maintenance.   I continue to stress that it is imperative for the Navy to maintain a  depot-level ship repair capability on sovereign U.S. soil in the  western Pacific.   I close by extending my gratitude again to the chairman and the  ranking member and to my colleagues and the professional staff and all  who participated in producing the conference agreement. I encourage my  colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce a constitutional  amendment that will fix a gross injustice within our democracy and  finally provide American citizens living in the territories the right  to vote for President and Vice President of the United States.   Every American should be alarmed that over 4 million of their fellow  citizens are denied the right to have a say in the selection of their  President. The people of Guam and other U.S. territories are patriotic  Americans who contribute to every aspect of American life.   We are Americans by birth, bear U.S. passports, and support and  defend the Constitution of the United States--many with their lives.  Yet, still Americans who reside in the territories are unable to vote  for our President.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to introduce this constitutional amendment so  that every American is finally able to cast a vote for President and  Vice President, just as the Founding Fathers intended.   Casting a ballot for President is a right for all Americans, and this  amendment is a step toward our Constitution's solemn promise to form a  more perfect union.                            ____________________
