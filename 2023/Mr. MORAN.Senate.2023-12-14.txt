 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the list of things that we can do but  haven't done is extensive. It is long.   We need to chip away at that list and get our work done as 2023 comes  to a close. Today, I want to highlight the urgent need to pass a long- term--a long-term--not a continuation of little, short extensions but a  long-term FAA reauthorization legislation.   The current FAA reauthorization expired on September 30, in which a  subsequent extension was passed until the end of this year--that is not  many days away.   Congress is now progressing toward another short-term extension until  mid-March 2024.   I serve as the lead Republican and ranking member of the Aviation  Subcommittee on the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee,  and I stated at the very beginning of my tenure in that position the  importance of passing a long-term reauthorization. And I am here today  to continue to beat that drum.   Continuous short-term extensions are detrimental to the Agency, the  industry, and the flying public. This is about public safety. We have  been genuinely and rightfully concerned about the flying public, and  reauthorization of the FAA bill, as we have developed it, is an  important component of making people safer as they fly.   Multiple-year reauthorization is necessary for long-term planning and  growth of the civil aviation industry.   I come from the air capital of the world, Kansas, and we know the  importance of this piece of legislation in our ability to compete  globally and to defend our Nation in this time of national security  needs.   Multiple-year reauthorization allows for planning and growth,  including the maintenance and modernization of aviation infrastructure  and technologies. If the United States is to remain a leader in the  aerospace domain, it is critical that we provide the FAA the resources  and the tools they require.   We spent months working on the legislation. It is designed to and  will improve the capabilities of the Federal Aviation Administration.  The U.S. House of Representatives has passed an FAA reauthorization,  and they did so last July. Unfortunately, the Senate has yet to move a  bill out of the committee.   In November, the Aviation Subcommittee convened once again to address  the close calls and near misses that have recently plagued our Nation's  air space--incidents that indicate, now more than ever, that our  aviation system needs certainty and stability provided, in part, by  long-term authorization by Congress.   While I was pleased to see my colleagues come together this past  October in a vote of 98 to 0--98 to nothing--in the Senate to confirm  Mr. Mike Whitaker as the FAA Administrator, I implore--I request--my  colleagues to once again find that collaborative spirit, that way  forward, to address FAA reauthorization.   Our colleague in the House, the House Transportation chairman, Sam  Graves, recently held a hearing on the consequences of a failure to  pass a long-term FAA reauthorization bill. While the hearing touched on  a myriad of issues that continued FAA extensions would present, the  witnesses particularly highlighted these items: airport programs and  project delivery impacts due to uncertainty in planning; the inability  of the FAA to adjust to emerging technologies; and workforce issues for  the entire aviation system, particularly air traffic control staffing,  which has led to continued delays and cancellations for the flying  public.   Mr. Rich Santa, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers  Association, summarized it this way--and I am quoting him:         The single most important action Congress can take for the       safety of the national airspace system would be to pass a       long-term, comprehensive FAA Reauthorization bill [and put       it] into law before the end of the year.    Our aviation system cannot make needed advancements and improvements  if we continue to allow the status quo, which has near-term and long- term implications.   So, once again, I stand ready to work with my colleagues, the  chairman and the ranking Member of the full committee; my colleague  Senator Duckworth from Illinois, my chairman of the subcommittee that I  am the ranking member of. I stand here ready to not only encourage my  colleagues but to put my work where my mouth is and make sure that we  take every step possible to find that sweet spot, that needle--which I  don't think is that small of a needle hole--to get us FAA reauthorized  long term. Our aviation system depends upon it and, most importantly,  my Kansas constituents and all Americans depend upon, for their safety,  this piece of legislation.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas Senator  Cruz, and I appreciate his leadership. He is here to make the effort to  see that we reauthorize, on a temporary basis, the FAA. He is  absolutely right; it has to be done before the end of the year. We are  creating more uncertainty every day, every hour that we fail to do so.  It is regrettable that the Senator from Texas is here to do that. It is  almost a question in my mind, When do we have an agreement that is not  an agreement?   We have been down this path several times now in which we believe we  are ready to markup, only to find that something else stands in the  way.   I was here earlier today to talk about the importance of a long-term  reauthorization. And while I am here to support the short-term  extension, only to get us to the point of a long-term reauthorization,  it is significant that we do what we need to do today, and that means  it is then an opportunity for us to complete our work in the early  year--the few first weeks of January 2024.   We came together to confirm an FAA Administrator. We can do this. We  did it 98 to zero. I implore my colleagues to allow this opportunity to  have this short-term extension take place, and, most importantly, I  implore my colleagues that we find this path forward for the safety of  those Kansans and the safety of Americans who utilize our airways.   Our country's economic interests, our public's safety interests all  come together. It is a mistake for us to have short-term extension  after short-term extension. One last time, let's do it today and  complete our work.   We should be able to do this, and I ask that we extend the FAA today  and complete our work in January. I thank the gentleman from Texas for  his efforts to accomplish that goal.
