 Madam President, I have a couple of matters I want to  discuss.   Today, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice,  and Science is holding its annual hearing on the President's budget  request, with the Department of Commerce, with representatives from the  Department.   The representative from the Department that is invited, in my  experience, has always been the Secretary--in this case, Wilbur Ross.  This year, for as long as I can remember, with no public explanation,  Secretary Ross declined the Subcommittee's invitation.   The Department of Commerce has a budget request for over $12.2  billion but couldn't send over its Secretary to defend it. It is  extraordinary that the  [[Page S2166]]  Secretary provided no justification to the Republican chairman of the  committee for his actions. It is extraordinary to me that this  Secretary believes he should be treated differently from other  Secretaries. He believes he may not be held accountable before the  American people.   Secretary Ross's absence is especially concerning to me, given the  last time he appeared before the subcommittee. He blatantly,  objectively, irrefutably misled me about a critical issue facing the  Commerce Department. Perhaps he knew he would be asked about what he  said last time and would be asked to tell us what is the truth.   A year ago, I asked Secretary Ross why he had marketed the proposed  addition of a controversial citizenship question to the census as being  necessary to enforce the Voting Rights Act. To claim that question was  needed to enforce the law when the administration had no interest in  enforcing it was actually laughable at the time. So I asked Secretary  Ross why he had such a sudden interest in adding the question when the  Department of Justice had not brought a single suit under section 2 of  the Voting Rights Act.   This was his response, and, remember, it is a crime to lie in your  testimony before the Congress. He claimed the Justice Department is the  one that made the request of the Commerce Department. He made similar  claims before the House. He testified that Commerce was responding  solely to the Department of Justice's request, and the Department of  Justice made the request for the inclusion of the citizenship question.   Those are the claims Secretary Ross made, and all of those claims are  false. This was proven as a result of emails obtained through a FOIA  lawsuit. It was not something he was willing to bring forth, but they  had to have a lawsuit to get the truth. We now know, Secretary Ross  himself made the initial request to include the citizenship question.  We know it was Secretary Ross who pressured the reluctant Justice  Department to claim that such a question would be helpful to enforce  the Voting Rights Act.   And now we know that the inclusion of this question, as many of us  suspected from the beginning, was a nakedly political act, one that  involves none other than Kris Kobach and Steve Bannon. The proof of all  of this is in the emails. Just 1 year before I asked Secretary Ross  about this issue, he wrote that he was ``mystified why nothing had been  done in response to my months old request that we include the  citizenship question.''   Well, I am mystified how Secretary Ross's testimony can be construed  as anything other than blatantly misleading Congress. His testimony  earned him four Pinocchios from the Washington Post.   Two courts have now declared that Secretary Ross's attempt to include  the citizenship question was illegal. One of them found that ``in a  startling number of ways, Secretary Ross's explanations for his  decision were unsupported by, or even counter to, the evidence before  the agency.'' That is a remarkable, but not surprising, declaration  from the court.   So today I have a simple message for Secretary Ross: You are not an  investment banker anymore. You serve the American people, and part of  your job is being accountable to Congress and to the public. Trying to  run from Congress will not solve your problems, and trying to hide from  the truth will not either. The truth has a way of catching up with you.  If you don't tell the truth, it eventually becomes obvious. Secretary  Ross did not tell the truth.                                  S. Res. 50    Madam President, to say it is disappointing that the Senate is going  to vote today in relation to the resolution to reduce postcloture  debate on nominations is an understatement. This is actually a  resolution in search of a problem. This is an erosion of the Senate's  responsibility--in fact, our sworn constitutional duty--to advise and  consent to the President's--any President's--nominations. It is a  removal of one of the last guardrails for quality and bipartisanship in  our nomination process. It is short sided. It is a partisan power grab,  and it is motivated by the far right's desire to flood the Federal  judiciary with young, ideological nominees, many of whom, as we have  seen time and again in the Judiciary Committee, are simply unqualified  to serve on our Nation's courts. We have seen nominees who have never  been in a courtroom, and they are being nominated for lifetime  judgeships.   Postcloture time is a critical tool for Senators, especially those  who do not sit on the Judiciary Committee, to vet nominees for lifetime  judgeships. In fact, last Congress, more than one nominee had to  withdraw after scrutiny during this time led the Republicans  withdrawing their support. We actually took the time to ask questions-- an extra 20 minutes of questions, or an extra hour of questions. For  somebody who is up for a lifetime appointment, I think that is what the  American public pay us to do.   Unfortunately, for the Republican leadership the nominations process  in the Senate is about quantity not quality. Let me give you an  example. In the past 2 years, Republicans have disregarded the  important role of the ABA. They denied them the time they needed to  evaluate judicial nominees, or when they have evaluated them and they  have come back saying they are unqualified, they have ignored that.   Republicans routinely stacked hearing panels with multiple circuit  court nominees over Democrats' objections--something Democrats never  did to Republicans. Republicans have even held several hearings over  recess despite our objections. That is certainly something I would  never do when I was chairman if any Republican asked me not to.   Upon the White House's changing hands from a Democrat to a  Republican, the Republicans abruptly changed the policy of the blue  slips. There has been a long-held tradition of honoring blue slips from  home State Senators on circuit court nominees. When I was chairman of  the Judiciary Committee, I respected the input of all home State  Senators, no matter whether we had a Democrat or Republican in the  White House and no matter whether the Senator was a Republican or a  Democrat. Republicans only seem to insist on honoring blue slips when a  Democrat is in the White House.   When I was chairman with a Democratic President, every single  Republican wrote a letter saying the blue slip was so sacred, and every  single one of them wanted it to be upheld. It had to be upheld. Whoops,  a Republican comes into the White House, and we don't need it any more.  Look no further than the Judiciary Committee's markup this week, where  they ignored the opposition of two home State Senators who are also  members of the committee, including the Ranking Member, and will  advance two circuit nominees for whom blue slips were not returned.    When Democrats were in charge, no Republican would condone that and  no Democrat would make them have to face that. Yet they have turned it  into a partisan rubberstamp. We are not being the conscience of the  Nation.   Opponents to this resolution can say it is necessary to do this  because of the slow pace with which President Trump's judicial  nominations are being confirmed. Let's quickly review that. In his  first 2 years, President Trump had more judicial nominations confirmed  than President Obama did in his first 4 years. In just 2 years, we  almost doubled the number of circuit court nominations confirmed  compared to President Obama's first 4 years. In fact, President Trump  had more circuit nominees confirmed in his first 2 years than President  Obama, President George W. Bush, President Clinton, or President George  H. W. Bush.   So I don't need lectures from Senators in this Chamber about the  importance of judicial nominations or the methods by which Members  could frustrate the confirmation process. I lived it. I have seen it. I  have served here longer than any other Member of this body.   Regardless of whether it was a Republican President or a Democratic  one, I respected the role of home State Senators, the role of the  Senate as a whole, and our roles as individual Senators to evaluate the  nomination before us.   In 2013, in a bipartisan vote, the Senate agreed to a resolution to  reduce postcloture debate that was supposed to be good for the life of  the 113th Congress, not the permanent rule change proposed by S. Res.  50. Let's remember  [[Page S2167]]  the facts, not just some of them. All the other guardrails of the  nomination process were intact at the time. Nominations were thoroughly  vetted by both the administration and the committees here in the  Senate. Nominees were still subject to a 60-vote threshold for judicial  nomination, including circuit nominees. Cloture was never filed on a  day in which a nomination was reported on the floor. For judicial  nominations, hearings were not continually stacked with multiple  circuit court nominees, something both Republicans and Democrats agreed  on. The prerogative of home State Senators and their in-State judicial  selection committees--most of which are bipartisan--were respected both  before and after the resolution.   I understand the Republican majority now wants to cry foul and accuse  Democrats of needlessly holding up our confirmation process. I wish  people had been here more than 2 years. I look back at the glacial pace  with which Republicans allowed us to process judicial nominations for  the first 6 years of the Obama administration.   From the very beginning, in 2009, Republicans inexplicably withheld  their consent to consider President Obama's very first circuit nominee  and one that was supported by his Republican home State Senator, the  highly respected Richard Lugar.   I always look back at the shameful treatment of Merrick Garland to  fill a critical vacancy on the Supreme Court. Never in the history of  this country have we refused to allow a Supreme Court nominee to at  least have a hearing and a vote until Merrick Garland. That was a  political power grab that undermined the legitimacy of the Senate and  the courts. This claim was made: We don't vote on Supreme Court  nominees in an election year.   Well, of course we do. I remember almost all of us Republicans and  Democrats voting on a nominee that President Ronald Reagan made in an  election year when he was going to be leaving the Presidency. Looking  back might provide a glimpse of history, but it will do little to  restore the comity that was a hallmark of the Senate when I first came  here--a hallmark which made the Senate seem like the conscience of the  Nation, not a partisan political stamp.   Looking forward, this resolution will do little to restore the comity  and will further polarize the Senate, which is supposed to be the  world's greatest deliberative body. It will only further contribute to  the politicization of our courts. The Federal courts are perceived  throughout the world as above politics and are now being seen, more and  more, as a political rubberstamp for President Trump.   When the Senate Rules Committee held a hearing to evaluate the  proposal back in 2017, I remarked that the word ``obstruction'' had  become a term thrown about in the Senate whenever unanimous consent was  not provided. ``Duty,'' unfortunately, is a word we hear too little in  this body.   Vermonters, time and again, give me their trust not only to represent  Vermont values here in Washington but to protect the centuries-old  institutions that have sustained our democracy and that made us the  longest existing democracy currently in the world. The Senate is part  of why that democracy still exists. The Senate should reject this  resolution. We cannot abandon the traditions that made the Senate, at  its very best, the conscience of the Nation in exchange for short-term  political gain and going from the conscience of the Nation to a  partisan rubberstamp. That is not the Senate that I admire. It is not  the Senate that has been led by some of the best Republicans and  Democrats I have known over my decades here. It is not the Senate we  want to see in the history books.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader
