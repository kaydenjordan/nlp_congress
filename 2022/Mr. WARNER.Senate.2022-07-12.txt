 Mr. President, I want to thank my friend the Senator from  Iowa for giving me a moment of personal privilege.   I also want to acknowledge our colleague who has been the Presiding  Officer. I want to acknowledge our colleague who was presiding prior to  you coming to the chair and acknowledge that it is her birthday today,  a great day of celebration across Arizona and elsewhere.   Mr. President, I will only rise for a moment, and I appreciate my  friend the senior Senator from Illinois being here for this. I want to  acknowledge my youngest daughter, Eliza, and her fellow classmates from  the London Business School--not LSE; the London Business School--where,  last Wednesday, I attended their graduation. My hope is that every one  of these young men and women who are going to be from across the  world--the United States, the UK, Nigeria, Lebanon, Israel, India,  Singapore, and a host of other countries--one, I wish them all well. I  know they are going to contribute to economies and growth around the  world.   I also believe that almost all of them now are going to go off their  family's payroll at this moment in time after they have received this  great, distinguished MBA they received from the London Business School.   I do appreciate, again, my friend the Senator from Iowa giving me the  courtesy of this quick acknowledgement and recognition.   With that, I yield the floor and yield to my friend the senior  Senator from Iowa.
