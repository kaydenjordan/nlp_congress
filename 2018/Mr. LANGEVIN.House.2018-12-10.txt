 Mr. Speaker, today I rise with my good friend and  fellow co-chair of the Congressional Career and  [[Page H9807]]  Technical Education Caucus, Mr. Thompson, to introduce the  Cybersecurity Education Integration Act, a bill to develop CTE programs  that include cybersecurity education.   Whether in our hospitals or our power grid, systems that make up our  critical infrastructure are increasingly internet-enabled. These  connections undoubtedly increase efficiency and service quality but,  unfortunately, they also provide pathways for cyber intruders to wreak  havoc.   Mr. Speaker, we need to provide training for workers who deal with  these systems on a day-to-day basis, whether it is in the  transportation, energy, or health sectors, so that they can keep us  safe, so they can identify these cybersecurity vulnerabilities early on  and prevent them, hopefully, from happening in the first place.   Many CTE programs already have strong physical safety elements;  however, cybersecurity is rarely included. We can't think of this as an  afterthought. It needs to be a forethought. By funding the creation of  CTE programs that fully integrate cybersecurity into their coursework,  we can ensure workers have the skills to protect our Nation's  infrastructure.   I thank Representative Thompson for his partnership on this bill, and  I urge my colleagues to support our bipartisan effort.                            ____________________
