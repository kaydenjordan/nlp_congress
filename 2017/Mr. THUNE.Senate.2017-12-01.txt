 Mr. President, we are about to embark upon a vote that I  think will be historic, a once-in-a-generation opportunity, in my view.   The last time we did major tax reform in this country was 1986, 31  years ago. Believe it or not, I happened to be a staffer here back  then. Although my boss was not on the Senate Finance Committee, I was  the tax LA in the office, and so I had the opportunity, in a very small  way, to be a part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, which at that point was  landmark legislation, very historic, very far-reaching, and had a  profound impact in a positive way on the economy.   Well, here we are 31 years later--long overdue, I might add, to get  to the point where we once again can do something fundamentally about a  tax code that is completely outdated, completely antiquated, and puts  us at a competitive disadvantage with countries around the world with  whom we have to compete. So we have an opportunity today--and we will  have an amendment process here that will get started very soon in which  Members will have an opportunity to lay down their amendments, to  debate them, and to get them ultimately voted on, but when it is all  said and done, I believe we will have a final product that moves us  fundamentally in a different direction when it comes to our tax policy,  in a direction that is good for jobs, that is good for growth--economic  growth--and that is good for wages in this country for hard-working  families and people who have been living paycheck to paycheck for a  really long time.   We didn't get here overnight. There has been a lot said about how  this is all of a sudden rushed to the floor. I have to tell you that I  got on the Senate Finance Committee in 2011, and since 2011 when I  joined the committee, we have had 70-plus hearings on tax reform. We  have had 70 hearings examining different aspects of the tax reform,  listening to recommendations about how it might be changed, how it  might be modernized, how it might be updated, and how it might be  improved. It has been a long, methodical process to get us to where we  are today.   Two years ago, in 2015, the chairman of the committee, Senator Hatch,  created five working groups, and each of the working groups had a  specific area of responsibility to look at different elements of the  Tax Code and come up with a series of recommendations for how it might  be improved. I was privileged to chair one of those working groups,  along with Senator Cardin. We had both Democrats and Republicans  participating in that process.   At the end of it, each of the working groups submitted  recommendations, many of which, I might add, are included in the mark  we are going to be voting on later today. A lot of those ideas came  from those bipartisan working groups. So there are a lot of Democratic  and Republican ideas that have been incorporated into this legislation.   I would hope, in the end, that there might be some Democrats who  ultimately will vote for it. But I think it is important to note, for  those who believe that perhaps this was somehow rushed in here, that  there has been a lot of thought over a long period of time. There were  not only months but years--literally years--of work that has gone into  bringing us to where we are today.   When the bill was introduced--the mark was put out there by the  chairman--that put in place a process in the committee where we had a  markup. So we spent 23 hours over several days marking up the bill. We  voted on 63 Democratic amendments in all 69, or thereabouts, amendments  on the bill while it was being marked up before it was reported out  here to the floor.   Since it was reported out of the committee, there have been a number  of changes that have been made in response to concerns and issues that  have been raised by individual Senators on both sides of the aisle. And  that brings us to where we are today.   I say that by way of context to let people know that this has been a  long process--an arduous process, I might add--and frankly one that is  really overdue. I happen to believe profoundly that it is high time  that we undertake the important work of readapting and readjusting our  tax policies to reflect an economy and a marketplace that is very  different from the last time this was done in 1986.   So that gets us to where we are today. In trying to figure out how to  modernize, how to update our Tax Code, there are a couple of things  that clearly needed to be dealt with. One is that we have a tax system  that has the highest rates among businesses in the industrialized  world. We have a 35-percent rate for corporations. When we look at  every other industrialized country around the world--look at the OECD  average; it is down around 22 percent. A number of countries have gone  well below that. We continue to hemorrhage jobs and businesses and  profits to other places around the world because our tax rate, our Tax  Code, frankly, isn't competitive.   We operate in what is known as a worldwide tax system in which not  only do you pay a tax in a country in which the income is generated,  but you also pay a tax when it comes back into the United States at the  higher level, at the 35-percent rate. So that also had to be adapted,  and we are moving now more toward what is called a territorial tax  system in which the income is taxed in the jurisdiction in which it is  generated. I believe that will make us a much more competitive economy  globally and make America a much more attractive place to do business.  [[Page S7664]]    We get the corporate rate, the business rate, down to 20 percent. And  when I say businesses, that is what we call C corporations. There is a  slightly different treatment for passthrough businesses. Those are your  partnerships, LLCs, and sole proprietorships, things like that. But we  also significantly reduce rates on small businesses. We believe that is  important to growth. This needs to be a pro-growth bill. We want to  grow our economy at a faster rate because a faster growing economy, an  economy growing at rates that are more normal to historic averages,  means that we are creating better paying jobs. That means we are  lifting wages in this country.   Wages have been flat for so long. For the last decade or so, the  American people have rarely had anything that could be characterize as  a pay raise. That is why we needed to update our business tax rates,  our business tax code, so that we can get the economy producing and  growing at a faster rate to generate those good-paying jobs and provide  higher wages to American families and American workers. We believe this  bill does that.    I think the changes that have been made in addition to lowering the  rate--allowing for expensing of capital investments allows businesses  to recover their cost of investment faster, accelerate that cost  recovery, which enables them to get that capital they can use to expand  and grow their operations and thereby, again, create those better- paying jobs. Those are key changes that are fundamental to greater  economic growth, better jobs, and higher wages in our economy.   There have been a lot of analyses and studies that have been done  that demonstrate how, in fact, that might work. If you look at what the  President's Council of Economic Advisers says, they suggest that  lowering the rate on businesses will generate $4,000 in additional  average household income on an annual basis. That is an additional  $4,000 in the pockets of families in this country as a result not just  of the tax reductions, which I will get to in just a moment, but the  changes we made on the business side of the code generate an additional  $4,000 annually per household. There is another study out there by  Boston University. They conclude that it would increase the average  household income by $3,500, which is slightly less than $4,000.   It is safe to say that families in this country, households in this  country, and people in this country are going to benefit, because when  you create a more favorable environment, favorable conditions for  investment and creating jobs, you get competition for labor.  Competition for labor raises the price of labor. When the price of  labor goes up, companies have to pay higher wages. That means bigger  paychecks for American workers. That is precisely what these particular  studies have shown.   Let me say, too, because I think that as I have listened to our  colleagues on the other side--they consistently make the argument that  somehow these are tax cuts for the rich, which I don't think is any  surprise. That is normally what they say anytime we have a debate about  reducing taxes.   My experience here, in the time I have been in Washington, both as a  Member of the House of Representatives and now as a Member of the  Senate, has been that, generally speaking, Democrats like to grow  government. We like to grow the economy. We believe the best way to  lift all boats--to generate better paying jobs, to improve the quality  of life and standard of living for American families--is to get a  stronger economy that is creating those better paying jobs and raising  wages in this country.   Suffice it to say that our colleagues on the other side have attacked  this bill, as they do most bills. This is no exception. Most of the  attacks are on reform bills for delivering too much relief to high- income earners. I have to say that I take issue with that because I  think, if you look at the actual content, the substance of the bill,  you will come to a very different conclusion.   I said this before, and I mean it sincerely: I hope people don't take  it from me. Sit down and look at your own tax situation. Plug in the  changes that we are making here, and find out if you come out better or  worse than you are today.   I will tell you that if you look at the average family of four with a  combined annual income of $73,000, you are going to see that they are  going to see a $2,200 tax cut. A $2,200 tax cut is what your average  family of four making $73,000 in this country is going to see. What  does that represent to them? That is a 60-percent reduction, a 60- percent tax cut relative to what they are paying today under current  law.   By reforming the Tax Code and putting these changes in place, the  average family of four with a combined annual income of $73,000 will  see a $2,200 tax cut or about a 60-percent reduction in what they are  paying today. Why does that happen? Well, it happens because we are  making some changes that provide significant relief in the Tax Code  relative to families when they file their taxes.   The first, of course, is we double the standard deduction. The  standard deduction is the amount that people can deduct from their  income right away, from their adjusted gross income. That lowers the  amount that is actually taxable to start with. Under our legislation,  the standard deduction for both married couples and those who are  filing single--they actually get a doubling of the standard deduction.   The second thing we do in our bill--and if you are raising kids, this  will dramatically reduce the tax burden you will have--is we double the  child tax credit, which under current law is $1,000 per child. Under  this legislation, that will double to $2,000 per child.   The other thing we do is we lower rates. We have a significant rate  reduction through all the different brackets in the code.   The combination of doubling the standard deduction, doubling the  child tax credit, and lowering rates means that middle-income families  are going to pay less in taxes.   We think we have found the right balance in designing a bill that  delivers tax relief to hard-working, middle-income families in this  country. At the same time, we are reforming the business side of our  Tax Code in a way that unleashes our economy and unleashes those job  creators and a lot of that investment that has been sitting on the  sidelines and allows our small businesses and our larger businesses to  expand their operations, and as they do that, they will have to hire  more workers and pay those workers higher wages.   We think the combination of those features of this bill makes this a  bill that is very beneficial to middle-income families in this country.  Those are just a few of the features of the bill that lead to, as I  said earlier, an average tax cut for a typical family of four of $2,200  or about a 60-percent reduction over what they are currently paying.   As we have listened to the debate from the other side, they attacked  it as being a tax cut for the rich. They attacked it for being rushed  out here. They attacked it for being a windfall for corporations. It is  very predictable. There is nothing new in any of these arguments. I  have been around here long enough to know in advance what the other  side is going to say. But in this case, these arguments simply don't  comport with reality. They just don't fit the facts. They don't fit the  data.   With respect to the issue of who pays, we pay a lot of attention--and  we should--to tax burdens in this country. One of the things this  legislation we will be passing today does is it maintains in the law  the progressivity in our Tax Code. We have the most progressive Tax  Code, I would argue, in all the world. So we paid very close attention  to this to make sure that the tax burden, when all is said and done,  doesn't change very much from where it is today. So people of different  income groups, income categories, continue to pay similar burdens to  what they are paying today.   What this shows is that those in the $20,000 to $50,000 category  today pay about 4.3 percent of the entire tax burden, the taxes  collected in this country. People who earn between $20,000 and $50,000  pay about 4.3 percent. Under our legislation, that will go down to 4.1  percent. Those in the $50,000 to $100,000 category--earners in that  group today pay about 16.9 percent of all the taxes collected. That is  their share of the tax burden. Under this legislation, that will go  down to 16.7 percent. Again, that is a slight reduction in the overall  tax burden relative to what they have today. Those making $100,000 or  more  [[Page S7665]]  actually will see their taxes tick up a little bit--not a lot but a  little bit. They are currently paying 78.7 percent of the tax burden in  this country, and that will go up to 78.9 percent. So those at $100,000  or more are paying almost 80 percent of all the taxes that are paid or  collected in this country today, and that number is very similar to  what it would be--up a little bit. But that is really the only category  that is going to pay more relative to what they are paying today.   To me, that is a demonstration, clearly, of how--when we went through  this process, we committed to ensuring that there was fairness in the  code, and we paid attention to the tax burden to ensure that people  continue to pay their fair share and that particularly those in the  upper income categories pay their fair share.   Another argument that has been made by our colleagues on the other  side--which is interesting to me because it is a revelation to many of  us that all of a sudden they are concerned about deficits--is that  somehow this is going to blow up the deficit. Well, we did allow for a  net tax cut in this. There is about $5.5 trillion of tax cuts overall,  about $4 trillion of which is offset by what we call base broadeners,  or killing and getting rid of preferences and loopholes and deductions  in the code, and the balance of which will be made up through economic  growth. There are debates about how much growth will occur in the  economy, but I think it is fair to say that this is going to grow the  economy.   Even the Joint Committee on Taxation, which uses numbers that, to me,  are completely inaccurate--I mean, it is hard to feature that over the  course of the next decade, our economy isn't going to grow at more than  1.9 percent, but that is what they assume. Just by way of example, over  the last two quarters, it has grown to 3.3 and 3.1 percent. If we can  continue to build on that, we will more than pay for and have lots of  revenue left over when this is all said and done. So if you assume  modest amounts of economic growth--about two-tenths, three-tenths of 1  percent of additional growth in the economy per year--it more than  covers what we are talking about here in terms of the shortfall of  forgone revenue associated with this tax legislation.   We have a bill that is based upon reasonable assumptions about  growth. We have a bill that, if our economy really does pick up--and I  believe it will if we put the right policies in place that encourage  investment, track investment into this country, and provide the right  incentives for businesses to expand their operations--we will see an  entirely new economy where 1.9 percent growth, which has become the  normal for too many people--there are too many people in this country  who don't know anything but 1.9 percent growth. We can do so much  better than that. This is America, the greatest economy on the face of  the Earth. We ought to be able to get up to that 3 to 3.5 percent  growth rate. If we do, this economy will take off, American businesses  will start, entrepreneurs will start creating jobs, and we will have  higher wages and bigger paychecks for American workers.   I hope we get a ``yes'' vote later today on this.   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Boozman). The majority leader is  recognized.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now  be 30 minutes for debate only, with no amendments or motions in order,  with the majority leader being recognized at the conclusion of that  time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    Mr. President, how much time is left on our side?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 8\1/2\ minutes on the majority's  side. There are 2\1/2\ minutes on the Democrats' side.   The Senator from Colorado is recognized.    Mr. President, our country has always been about  opportunity. The American dream is the hope that your kids and your  grandkids and those who come after you will have a better life than you  have had. One of the ways we do that is that we get a growing,  expanding economy that creates better paying jobs, more opportunity,  and higher wages. When you get higher wages, you improve that standard  of living, and you improve that quality of life. That is what Americans  aspire to. That is what all American families--moms and dads--aspire to  for their kids and those who are going to come after them.   I would say to our colleagues on the other side, who, like I said,  have a newfound interest in deficits and debt, that one of the ways in  which you deal with deficits and debt is to grow the economy. When you  get an expanding economy that is creating better paying jobs, more  people are working, more people are investing, more people are taking  realizations, and more people are paying taxes. What history has shown  is that when you have a vibrant, growing economy, you get more  government revenue.   Of course, the official scorekeepers, whether you use the  Congressional Budget Office or the Joint Committee on Taxation, both  agree that you are going to get more revenue when you get more growth  in the economy. There might be a slight difference of opinion about how  much. The CBO, I think, says that for every one-tenth of 1 percent  increase in the GDP, you see an additional $273 billion in tax revenue  that is generated over a decade or, to put it a different way, almost  $3 trillion for every percentage point increase in gross domestic  product.   If you want to get serious about dealing with America's fiscal  problems, you have to restrain spending, which there hasn't been much  appetite for around here in the time that I have been here. You also  have to get the economy growing and expanding. That is what this  exercise--what we are going through here in reforming our Tax Code--is  really all about, because 2-percent growth is not good enough.  [[Page S7669]]  This 2-percent growth is not and should not be the new normal for the  American economy.   That is what we have had for the last 8 years. During President  Obama's entire time in office, we didn't have a single year--not 1  year--in which the GDP was more than 3 percent--not 1 year. If you go  back historically--literally to the end of World War II, about 1948-- and roll forward to today, the average in the American economy has been  3 to 3.5 percent, but there has not been a single year in the last 8  years in which we have had 3 percent growth in the economy.   What does that mean?   That means that, without that kind of growth, businesses are not  expanding. They are not investing, they are not hiring new workers,  they are not paying those workers more, and you end up with flat wages.  We have had, literally, a decade now of flat wages, where American  families and individuals have not seen any growth in their incomes.   What we hope to accomplish through all of this will be changes made  to the Tax Code that will increase investment through lowering rates on  businesses, allowing them to recover their costs of investment faster,  and accelerating their cost recovery. Those are changes--those are  reforms in our Tax Code--that will help unleash this economy and get us  back, closer to normal, when we were creating those good-paying jobs.  Then, we can start doing something, at the same time, about spending  around here, and we will start seeing those deficits go down. The best  thing that can happen for the American economy, the best thing that can  happen for the American family, and the best thing that can happen for  the American worker is to have a growing, vibrant economy.   To my colleagues on the other side who consistently get up and say  there is no benefit to this that will be delivered to middle-income  families in this country, again, I will say what has already been said  by my colleagues from South Carolina and from Pennsylvania, which is to  look at a typical family of four with a combined annual income of  $73,000, who under this tax cut bill will receive a tax cut of $2,200-- a 60-percent reduction over what they are paying today under current  law. That is what that average family of four will see.   Now, the Senator from Colorado said that he doesn't believe that  Colorado Republicans are for this. I can tell you who is going to be  for this--the people, the families, who get the $2,200 tax cut. That is  $2,200 they are going to have in their pockets.   You heard my colleague from South Carolina talk about that family  that lives paycheck to paycheck or about that single mom who wants a  better future for her kids. How do we help them? One of the ways we  help them is to reduce the burden--the take--that their government  takes from them every single year and to allow them to keep more in  their pockets. Let's give them bigger paychecks, and let's let them  decide how to spend the money.   That is a fundamental difference that we have had around here for a  long time. We come here believing that the way you help American  families is to start growing the economy rather than growing the  government, allowing the American people to make decisions that are in  their best interests and in the best interests of them and their  families about how they want to save for retirement, how they want to  help their kids get college educations, how they want to improve their  lives, rather than sending the money to Washington, DC, and letting  Washington spend it. That is, fundamentally, the difference, I think,  that we are talking about here.   As to the arguments that have been made by the other side, they just  aren't based on facts. The data tells a different story as the Senator  from Pennsylvania pointed out. Look at the chart. Look at the  percentage of tax cuts. Who benefits? We have worked very, very hard on  this bill to maintain progressivity in the Tax Code so that we have tax  relief delivered to those hard-working American families, to those  hard-working American taxpayers who need a break, who are living  paycheck to paycheck.   Honestly, I hope, when this is all said and done, that not only will  we be able to pass this bill but that, maybe, we will get a few  Democrats who might decide that it will be in the best interests of  their constituents to help their families and their States realize more  income in their pockets and bigger paychecks and, hopefully, an  opportunity to live out their versions of the American dream for them,  for their kids, and for their grandkids. That is what the American  experience and the American dream are really all about. When we take  more and more here in Washington, DC, that means that American families  have less with which to help themselves and to plan for their futures.   Our time has expired.    Mr. President, Senator Scott and I and the Senator from  Pennsylvania were all there at what we call the markup.    My recollection is like his, and, frankly, my  recollection, when it comes to all the work that went into getting us  to where we are dates back a long way. I joined the Senate Finance  Committee in 2011. I am not sure when the Senator from South Carolina  joined or the Senator from Pennsylvania, but it was shortly after that,  I think.   Since I have been on the Finance Committee, we have had 70-plus  hearings--70-plus hearings on tax reform. We have looked at every  facet, every aspect, every element of the Tax Code. We even went so far  2 years ago, in 2015, to create five working groups. We all  participated in those, along with, I might add, our Democratic  colleagues, each of whom had a key role in helping with the final  recommendations that were put forward. A lot of what is in this bill is  based upon the work that was done by those working groups. There isn't  a single shred of the Tax Code that we haven't covered and haven't  studied in great detail.   Then, of course, as the Senator from South Carolina pointed out, when  it came time to mark the bill up, we spent several days--23 hours  debating back and forth, listening to each other, and in some cases  arguing. In some  [[Page S7673]]  cases, those were very spirited arguments. The Democrats offered 63  amendments, all of which got votes in the Senate Finance Committee.   So for anybody to suggest that this has been anything but a  transparent process based upon years of work and buildup and lead-up to  get us to where we are today is absolutely misstating the facts. I  think the work we have done in advance of this has led to a product  that is the culmination of a great deal of thought, a great deal of  input, and a great deal of research from not only experts in the field  but fellow Members--Democrats and Republicans--Senators and staff--who  have gotten us to where we are today.    I think the fact, which has been pointed out many times, that a  family that is living paycheck to paycheck will now get the benefit of  a doubling of the standard deduction and a doubling of the child tax  credit, frankly, I happen to believe--contrary to my colleague from  Pennsylvania--is a pretty big deal. If you are a family who has any  sort of tax liability, that tax credit is a dollar-for-dollar credit  against that tax liability. An increased portion of that is refundable  under this legislation.   If you look at the lower rates we have in the bill, that middle- income family in this country stands to benefit significantly as a  result of this to the tune of--if you are a family of four with a  combined annual income of $73,000--an additional $2,200 in your pocket.  That is $2,200 in the American family's pocket that they get to decide  how to spend.   As the Senator of Pennsylvania pointed out, don't take our word for  it. You can sit down, if you like to, and look at the features of the  bill. Look at your individual tax situation. Plug in these changes, and  I think you will find you are going to see a pretty significant  reduction in your tax liability.   When January rolls around when this passes, people will get their  check. When they look at their withholdings, they will realize they  have a lot more money. That paycheck is bigger. The paycheck is going  to be bigger. Why? The amount taken out in terms of Federal taxes is  going to be significantly smaller. That is a good thing for the  American family.   That is why this debate and the bill we have before us are so  important, not only to those families who are trying to build a  stronger, brighter, and more prosperous future for themselves and their  families but also for this American economy. With the other changes  that are made in the bill, it is going to lead to better paying jobs  and higher wages that are going to lift the boats of all Americans.   Americans haven't had a pay raise, literally, in about the past  decade. We haven't had a single year in the Obama years of 3 percent  growth, which has been the historical average going back to the end of  World War II. We are growing at 1.5 to 2 percent. We don't happen to  believe that is good enough. We think we can do better. That shouldn't  be the new normal. The American economy is the greatest economy on the  face of the Earth. We ought to be able to grow at 3 to 3.5 percent.   I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that the average middle-income  family in this country is not only going to get a big tax cut--which  means they are going to get a bigger paycheck and have more money in  their pocket--but they will get the benefit of the higher wages coming  with a growing, more dynamic economy that it reflects.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for  outlining and highlighting what are, I should say, some of the many  reforms that are included in this legislation. Now, what he talked  about is critically important.   If America is going to be competitive in the global marketplace, we  have to change our Tax Code because it is completely outdated,  completely antiquated relative to any of the countries with whom we  compete. So, as the Senator from Pennsylvania pointed out, the reforms  we make in this bill allow American companies to compete and win  against those other countries around the world--the Chinas of the  world, the Russias of the world. Those countries in which America has  to compete on a daily basis have a huge advantage over American  companies today simply because we have a tax code that doesn't  recognize and reflect what is happening in the global economy, and that  is why modernizing and updating our tax code was such a critical part  of our tax reform effort.   I was listening to my colleague from Vermont, and I think this is a  really great day in the U.S. Senate. We are getting close to the finish  line on this tax bill. Over the past 24 hours, I think we have made a  really great bill even better with more middle-class tax relief and  more relief for small businesses. We have moved our bill closer to the  House's bill in key areas, which I think will help us get this bill to  the President's desk in the very near future. I am excited about what  this tax bill is going to do for the American people.   America has always been about opportunity, a place where you could  start from nothing and become anything. Generations of people have come  to this country to build a better life for themselves and an even  better one for their children. My grandparents were those people. They  came here from Norway back in 1906, started a small merchandising  company after they had learned the language and worked for a while on  the railroads that were being built across this country. It later  became a hardware store, and to this day in Mitchell, SD, there is  still a store that goes by the name of Thune Hardware. The family is  not associated with it, but it is an example of the millions of  Americans or millions of people who came to this country, came to  America in search of opportunity.   Unfortunately, in recent years, those vast horizons that so many  people came to this country for seemed to shrink. The American dream  has grown dim. Getting ahead has been replaced by getting by. We have  watched idly as our jobs get shipped overseas, as other countries drop  their business tax rates to better compete in the global marketplace,  as emerging economies and developed nations grow faster than the United  States. Americans now frequently spend more time worrying about their  future than looking forward to it.  [[Page S7693]]    We are turning that around starting today with this tax bill. I am  reminded of Ronald Reagan's Presidential ad noting that ``It's morning  again in America.'' Well, it may not be morning yet, but the dawn is  peeking over the horizon.   The tax bill before us today is going to provide immediate relief to  hard-working Americans. It is going to immediately lower their tax  bills. It is going to immediately mean more money in their pockets, but  this bill is about much more than that. This bill isn't just about  helping Americans today, although it is most certainly going to do  that. This bill is about helping Americans for the long term. It is  about restoring the American dream. It is about giving Americans access  to the kinds of wages, jobs, and opportunities that will set them up  for a secure and more prosperous future, and it is about sending a  message to the world that America is finally serious about competing  for 21st century jobs and innovation.   For years, our tax laws have kept American businesses at a  disadvantage in the global economy. As other nations have changed their  Tax Codes to strengthen their businesses, our Tax Code has kept  American businesses struggling, but that ends now. This legislation  makes a tremendous investment in American businesses and American  workers. Under this bill, American businesses will no longer face the  double taxation that has kept them at a disadvantage next to their  foreign counterparts and has pushed them to keep jobs and investment  overseas. They will no longer face the highest corporate tax rate in  the industrialized world. They will no longer be playing catchup with  their foreign competitors. Instead, American business will have money  to invest in American workers. They will be able to expand their  domestic operations, and they will be able to compete with and beat  their competitors around the globe. What is the result of that? It  means more growth here at home, more jobs, more opportunities, higher  wages, and an America that can lead the world in innovation, job  creation, and economic growth.   America may have been through a rough patch lately, but she is coming  back stronger than ever. America led the world in the 20th century, and  this tax bill makes it clear that she is going to do the same in the  21st century.   I hope our colleagues, when it comes time to vote on this tonight,  will vote in favor of tax relief for middle-income families, vote for a  stronger, growing, vibrant, robust economy that is creating better  paying jobs, raising wages for American workers and American families,  and a brighter, better, and more prosperous future for future  generations of Americans.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.    Mr. President, let's keep in mind that the State and local  tax, or SALT, deduction disproportionately  [[Page S7704]]  benefits wealthy taxpayers in high tax States. More than 70 percent of  American families currently take the standard deduction, so they will  not even be impacted at all by this bill's treatment of SALT. Let's  also keep in mind that our improving amendment strikes a compromise on  SALT. It includes, as does the House bill, a deduction of up to $10,000  for property tax paid to State and local governments.   Democrats insisting on keeping the entire SALT deduction in place  should explain why they have prioritized a tax deduction for wealthy  taxpayers over middle-class tax relief. Our bill addresses this issue  in an appropriate way, and I urge my colleagues to vote against this  motion.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.
