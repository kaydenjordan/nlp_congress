 Mr. Speaker, I don't believe I have ever  seen a bigger mountain made out of a tinier molehill in my 29 years in  Congress than what is being made out of Donald Trump, Jr.'s, meeting  with the Russian lawyer. It reminds me of the Wendy's ad several years  ago that asked: ``Where's the beef?''   I know that hindsight is 20-20 and holier than thou, but this is  ridiculous.   Do you really believe that Chelsea Clinton would have refused to meet  with a Russian lawyer who she was told had evidence that would  incriminate Donald Trump?   Donald Trump, Jr., met with this woman for a few minutes, saw she had  nothing, and nothing came out of it. No action was taken. Even Director  Comey testified he had seen no evidence that even one vote was altered  by anything the Russians did.   They have been investigating this for months, and this is the best  they can come up with?   It is time to stop crying over the election and do something about  some real problems.                            ____________________
