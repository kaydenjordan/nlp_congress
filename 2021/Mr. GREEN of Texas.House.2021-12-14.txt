 Mr. Speaker, and still I rise as a Christian to  say as-salamu alaykum, which means peace be upon you.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5665 addresses the age-old question: Am I my  brother's and, I might add, sister's keeper?   If the answer is yes, then what do we do about it when our brothers  and our sisters are being victimized by Islamophobia--threatened,  murdered, killed?    Mr. Speaker, you can't be your brothers' or sisters' keeper without  keeping your brothers and your sisters.   H.R. 5665 addresses this by establishing an office to monitor and  combat Islamophobia in the Department of State. H.R. 5665 does  something such that we can be our brothers' and our sisters' keepers.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a cosponsor of it, and I close with  Allah hafiz. May God protect you.
