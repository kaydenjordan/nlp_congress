 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a bright and  talented group of young women from Kalispell, Montana, who excelled in  the recent Code Girls United Northwest Regional App Challenge.   Taylor Pooton won first place for her project that uses radio  frequency identification to provide real-time tracking information for  students.   Emma Anderson, Kyra Hutchison, and Trinity Hutchison took second  place for creating an app that reminds users to exercise throughout the  day.   Meara Greer and Abby Stillo placed third with their prototype of a  robotic self-driving vehicle.   Code Girls United is an after-school computer science program  teaching fourth through eighth grade girls to become problem-solvers  through coding and business training.   Congratulations to all the participants. The skills and ideas they  are developing could help tackle the challenges we face today and in  the years to come.                            ____________________
