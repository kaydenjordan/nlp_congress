 Madam President, today is Peace Officers Memorial Day,  when we honor the men and women of law enforcement.   During Police Week, thousands of officers from across the Nation and  the world travel here to Washington to remember their fallen comrades  and rededicate themselves to protecting our communities. I welcome  them, particularly the peace officers from the State of Kentucky. I  look forward to visiting later today with members of the Louisville  Metro Police Department. We owe them and the departments across the  Commonwealth our heartfelt thanks for keeping the Bluegrass State safe  and secure.   I also wish to pay tribute today to members of Kentucky's law  enforcement community who made the ultimate sacrifice on our behalf.   Since Police Week last year, three of the Commonwealth's finest have  fallen in the line of duty. Officer Scotty Hamilton, a 12-year veteran  of the Pikeville Police Department, was fatally shot while on duty. The  Hopkinsville Police Department lost Officer Phillip Meacham, who was  killed while off duty by someone who was impersonating a police  officer. Officer Rodney Smith, of the Hickman Police Department,  drowned while on patrol when his vehicle was washed into the water  during this spring's severe flooding. All of these men left behind  spouses, children, and a Commonwealth indebted to them for their  service.   We also remember Sergeant David Ray Gibbs, of the Kentucky State  Police, who was killed in a car crash in 2015 while he was on the way  to his grandmother's funeral. Sergeant Gibbs's name was added this year  to the National Police Memorial--a fitting tribute to a fine officer.  His sacrifice and that of each of these heroes will not be forgotten.   Finally, as we warmly welcome law enforcement from across the  country, I would also like to especially thank the men and women of the  U.S. Capitol Police. Each day, their vigilance protects Members of  Congress, our staffs, and visitors from around the world. After the  terrible events at the baseball park in Alexandria last June, we are  all reminded of just how lucky we are to have them.
