 Mr. Speaker, some may say that I am biased, but I  firmly believe that Washington State is home to the best farmers in the  world. Today I rise to congratulate one of those incredible farmers, my  fellow Washingtonian, Nicole Berg, for her appointment to the Federal  Crop Insurance Corporation board of directors.   Nicole's experience as a fourth-generation farmer in central  Washington has provided her with a strong, yet personal, understanding  of the needs of family-run farms in the United States.   For many years, I have seen Nicole's passion for putting food on  America's table. Her work with the National Association of Wheat  Growers has been of immense benefit to the region and to the world. And  there is no doubt in my mind that she will be a great asset to the  Federal Crop Insurance Corporation.   I wish Nicole the very best as she enters this new chapter. Her  appointment to the FCIC board of directors is well deserved, and I  congratulate her on this fantastic achievement.                            ____________________
