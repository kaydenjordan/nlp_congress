 Madam Chair, I yield myself 1 minute.   Madam Chair, with this legislation, Democrats are fulfilling our  pledge to the American people in passing legislation that will bring  down prescription drug costs for the people. That is one of the three  central pillars of our For the People Agenda.   With H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, we are  delivering for the people. This legislation, named in memory of my dear  friend and our colleague, Elijah Cummings, who fought so hard to lower  the cost of prescription drugs, will give Medicare the power to  negotiate directly with drug companies, which will help bring drug  prices down, as we do now, Madam Chair, for our veterans.   It will make those lower drug prices available to Americans with  private insurance as well--not just Medicare, but with private  insurance--and it will create a new out-of-pocket limit of $2,000, a  cap on out-of-pocket expenses for prescription drugs for those on  Medicare part D.   According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, H.R. 3 will  save American taxpayers approximately half a trillion dollars over the  next 10 years.   Now, H.R. 3 reinvests those savings, Madam Chair, in key initiatives,  including expanding Medicare benefits to cover dental, vision, and  hearing services; investing in new research, treatment, and cures; and  combating the opioid crisis--all three objectives that the American  public overwhelmingly support.   President Trump, Madam Chair, promised in 2016, before his election,  that he would work to negotiate lower drug prices, something this bill  would give his administration the authority to do. For that reason, he  ought to support it.   He said in 2016: ``When it comes time to negotiate the cost of drugs,  we are going to negotiate like crazy.'' He said that in a campaign  setting. Hopefully, he still believes that today.   I hope he will join in encouraging the Senate to take up H.R. 3,  because in 2018, he said this: ``One common cancer drug is nearly seven  times as expensive for Medicare as it is for other countries. . . .  This happens because the government pays whatever price the drug  companies set without any negotiation whatsoever.'' So said President  Trump on October 25, 2018.   He went on to say just 2 months ago, in October: ``. . . we want to  bring our prices down to what other countries are paying, or at least  close. . . .''   Madam Chair, that is what this legislation does.   President Trump went on to say: ``. . . and let the other countries  pay more. Because they're setting such low prices that we're actually  subsidizing other countries, and that's just not going to happen  anymore.''   Those were remarks before the Cabinet meeting on October 16, 2019,  just a few weeks ago.   That is what this legislation does. That is why the Senate ought to  pass this legislation and the President ought to sign it. I hope he  will join us in encouraging the Senate to take up H.R. 3 without delay  and pass it. And I urge the President to reverse his opposition to this  bill and sign it, his opposition being totally inconsistent with those  three quotes that I just articulated.   Too many Americans, Madam Chair, are struggling to pay for their  prescription drugs. I have heard awful stories from constituents in my  district, as I know every one of us has, about families rationing  insulin and having to forego rent or food or other necessities in order  to pay for their prescription drugs. That is not an option. Without  them, their health will deteriorate, and, yes, they may die.   One senior from Clinton, Maryland, in my district, wrote to tell me  that one of her prescription drugs more than doubled in price, and she  left the pharmacy empty-handed because she couldn't afford it.   With H.R. 3, we can bring relief to people like her.   With H.R. 3, we can lower the cost of prescription drugs so that  Americans can live healthy lives and pursue their American Dream.   Madam Chair, I want to thank Chairman Pallone, Chairman Neal,  Chairman Scott, and their committees for working hard on this bill to  help Americans lower their prescription drug costs and live longer and  healthier lives.   Madam Chair, this should not be a partisan issue. The President  articulated the desire to achieve the objective of bringing prices  down. That is what this bill does. That is what CBO says it does. So I  urge my colleagues to support this.   Now, Madam Chair, I know you could do this, but I want to do it  because I am so proud not only of Haley Stevens herself, who is an  extraordinary Member of the Congress of the United States, a wonderful  member of the previous administration, and somebody who has worked  in the private sector and the public sector and who has been elected  president of your class, Madam Chair, the freshman class, an  extraordinary group of 63 people, 64 if we count our friend Conor Lamb  who was elected in a special election just before you--and he, of  course, lords it over you that he is a senior member of the freshman  class; I understand that.    But Haley Stevens leads an extraordinary group of 64 people who have  contributed so much to our society already in their lives, in their  productive, constructive lives, and now have come to the Congress. And  they came with a promise to do three things, at least:   Number one, to help with wages and jobs and opportunities;   Number two, to bring prescription costs down; and   Number three, to invest in infrastructure.   In this bill, we meet one-third of those promises, and they have made  it possible.   Madam Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Stevens), the president of the freshman class, so she may  manage the remainder of the time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning-hour  debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Members are advised that no  votes are expected in the House on Monday. Again, no votes on Monday,  but we will do legislative business. We will be debating suspension  bills, and the votes will be rolled until the following day.   On Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, the House will meet at 9  a.m. for legislative business. Let me stress that so that every Member  understands. We normally go in at noon for a schedule like this on  Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, but we will be going in at 9 a.m. on  those days, as well as Friday.   Members are advised that the first votes of the week on Tuesday are  expected between 9 and 10. Again, I want to emphasize that, although we  do not have any votes on Monday night, we expect Tuesday to be a full  workday, so Members really ought to come into town on Monday.   We will consider several bills, Mr. Speaker, under suspension of the  rules. The complete list of suspensions will be announced by the close  of business tomorrow.   As Members know, the current continuing resolution expires on  December 20. The House will consider some appropriation measures.  Hopefully, and my expectation is, they are making progress in the  Appropriations Committee on coming to a resolution on the 12  appropriation bills.   It is my hope that we will consider those appropriation bills on the  floor on Tuesday, perhaps a series of minibus packages to fund all of  government for the remainder of the fiscal year.   I would urge all of my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee to  do  [[Page H10226]]  everything they can in the next 24 hours, frankly, to bring this matter  to a close and agreement so that the staff will have an opportunity to  put the bills together for consideration next week.   This week, negotiators were able to reach an agreement on a new trade  agreement. The Republican whip has been asking me about that agreement.  I have assured him we wanted to get to yes, and we have gotten to yes.  We are pleased at that, this trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.   It is possible that the USMCA trade agreement could be brought to the  floor next week. The only reason it is possible and not assured is the  administration is working on submitting implementing legislation to the  Congress. My presumption is they will have that legislation to us in  the relatively near term. It will be, therefore, available for  consideration next week.   This week, the House Judiciary Committee began markup, as the House  knows and the country knows, of two Articles of Impeachment. Following  committee action on these articles, the Judiciary Committee will make a  recommendation to the full House of Representatives. We will determine  a path forward on the floor following that recommendation.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, as is always the case in the last week, at least  the last scheduled week of a session, there may well be other pieces of  legislation that will ripen for consideration and that may well be  considered next week. We will announce those as soon as we know which,  if any, bills qualify for that treatment.    I appreciate the gentleman making the comment with respect  to the Defense Department and the importance of funding them, and I  agree with that.   I want to point out that the same challenge applies to all the other  agencies of government. The more quickly they can be funded, the more  they know what their funding is for the next 9 months--that is, between  December 20 and September 30--and the more able they are to plan and  rationally run their agencies. So I appreciate his observation about  the Defense Department. It applies to all of government.   We are hopeful that we can fund, and our intention is to fund, all of  government with full-year or at least the balance of the year  appropriation bills.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his question. We  don't have a specific day, but I will tell him that it is our  intention, assuming that the administration gets the enabling  legislation to us in a timely fashion, which is my expectation they  will do, to consider that next week. Now, which day next week has not  been decided, but we do intend to consider it next week. We want to  pass it before we leave here.    Ambassador Lighthizer, as I have said all along, we have  perceived as an honest broker. I think he has dealt with us fairly and  openly.   Very frankly, we believe that the agreement that has now been  finalized is substantially stronger and better than it was when it was  first given to us for consideration. I say that in the sense that we  took the position, and I have taken this position on the floor, the  gentleman knows, that enforcement was critical.   The Chamber of Commerce has said, if you have a trade agreement  without effective enforcement, you don't have a real agreement. What we  were able to achieve was, we think, real enforcement, which protects  workers, which protects the environment, which protects other aspects  of the agreement.   We also are pleased that some of the things that were in the bill  that we thought were harmful to consumers, in particular, were dropped.   But it was an honest negotiation, as the whip has pointed out. It was  a hard negotiation, not so much between Mr. Lighthizer and ourselves,  but between Mr. Lighthizer and some of the other interest groups,  including our friends in Mexico.   We have now reached that agreement. Hopefully, we can pass this next  week. Our friends in labor have endorsed this agreement. The Maryland/ D.C. AFL-CIO has endorsed this agreement because they have the  confidence that, unlike NAFTA--for which I voted, Mr. Speaker--in which  there was no successful enforcement action over the last two decades,  this will have the opportunity for successful enforcement for economic  reasons and for other reasons. And I hope that this will move forward.    Mr. Speaker, let me tell the gentleman very candidly, I  have not discussed with Mr. Nadler or others on the Judiciary Committee  that issue. So I really can't give you the rationale that was  articulated by the chair or by others.   I will say, however, that the President has indicated he wants to  move with dispatch on this issue. We are doing that, and we have little  time left. Very frankly, there were other witnesses to come forward,  and very frankly, there were a lot of witnesses who were precluded from  coming forward that we thought would amplify, frankly, people who work  for and with the President who may have had information to give. But I  can't specifically articulate the rationale, but we can get that for  you.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   First of all, of course, this is not the jury in the sense of a petit  jury that is going to decide guilt and innocence. It is, from a  lawyer's standpoint, more analogous to a grand jury, which simply  decides whether or not there is probable cause to believe the President  abused his power in the exercise of his authority and, secondly, in the  second Article, refused to cooperate with the Congress exercising its  constitutional responsibility of oversight.   Secondly, let me say to the gentleman, as the gentleman knows, the  President was given the opportunity to appear with counsel and to call  such witnesses as he wanted to call--I believe that is correct--but to  appear and defend against the allegations that are incorporated in the  Articles of Impeachment, and the President chose not to appear.   The President chose not to have counsel present. Mr. Cipollone,  counsel to the White House, in fact, responded to the offer to appear  and said: We have chosen not to do so.   So to say that the respondent in this case--I won't call him a  defendant. But the respondent in this case, the President of the United  States, chose not to respond, chose not to appear, chose not to produce  evidence in his defense. One could conclude that perhaps they decided  they didn't have any, but I won't conclude that, but that could be one  conclusion drawn.   But I will tell the gentleman, first of all, this is not a jury that  is deciding guilt or innocence; it is a jury deciding probable cause  whether or not there is cause to believe.   And, of course, we had extensive hearings at which many witnesses  testified, some of whom worked for the administration, with the  administration, in the White House, who testified to the facts, which  most constitutional experts believe, if believed, constitute an abuse  of power.   But, again, I will say to the gentleman, the central reality is the  President refused to appear.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, my friend articulates many things that have no basis in  fact and believes, in my view, that if he says it enough times that  people will believe them. To that extent, I think he mirrors the  President of the United States, who does the same thing.   First of all, the rules have been followed. Secondly, the evidence  that has been adduced is overwhelming and has not been controverted.   John Bolton, when talking about this deal, which we believe is an  abuse of power, said that this was the equivalent of a drug deal. That  is John Bolton.   My friend has talked for many weeks about how the Mueller report  found nothing.   First, let me read from the Mueller report something that was not  part of an article but certainly informs us as to the intent and the  feelings of the President of the United States.   The Mueller report said this: ``Our investigation found multiple acts  by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law  enforcement investigations, including Russian interference and  obstruction investigations.   ``The incidents were often carried out through one-on-one meetings in  which the President sought to use his official power outside of usual  channels.   ``These actions,'' the Mueller report said, ``ranged from their  efforts to remove the special counsel and to reverse the effect of the  Attorney General's recusal, to the attempted use of official power to  limit the scope of the investigation, to direct and indirect contacts  with witnesses and the potential influence of their testimony.   ``The special counsel did not reach conclusions because''--and this  is critical, and the whip constantly ignores this when he says the  Mueller report found nothing.   ``The special counsel,'' it says, ``did not reach conclusions because  Department of Justice guidelines prohibit indicting a sitting  President. Therefore, the Mueller report makes clear, however, that it  does not exonerate the President by saying this. If we had  confidence''--the whip may want to hear this.   The Mueller report said: ``If we had confidence after a thorough  investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit  obstruction of justice, we would so state. But, based upon the facts  and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that  judgment that the President did not, in fact, participate in  obstruction of justice.''                                time  1445    But because DOJ, for whom the counsel worked--not a special  prosecutor, the special counsel--counsel demurred, essentially refused  to make a judgment that he thought he was unable to make. But he made  it clear that they could not find that the President did not obstruct  justice.   Let me say something else. There are a number of people who thought  the Mueller report and the Mueller investigation had great effect:  [[Page H10229]]    Paul Manafort, pled guilty to lying;   Roger Stone, convicted;   Michael Cohen, the President's counsel, convicted, in jail;   Michael Flynn, convicted of lying, the national security adviser  appointed by President Trump, convicted;   Rick Gates, the deputy campaign manager for President Trump,  convicted;   George Papadopoulos, who the President claimed was his foreign policy  adviser--or one of his foreign policy advisers--convicted, pled guilty,  served a short period of time, and now is a candidate for Congress on  the Republican ticket in the State of California.   They all think that the Mueller report had some consequences. That is  the context in which we see this crowd. No wonder so many of them  didn't want to testify.   And when Mr. Sondland testified the first time and then, after that,  he saw some of these convictions, he amended his testimony.   He came in and said, oh, yes, there may have been some discussion  about a so-called quid pro quo or a bribery or extortion. He didn't say  those words. Those are my words. He talks about obstruction of Congress  and how there was no back and forth, and he says, well, they could have  gone to court.   As a matter of fact, we have gone to court time after time after  time. And guess what, Mr. Speaker, the court has said that Congress is  entitled to that discovery. Now, they keep appealing it.   Mr. Speaker, that is the President's modus operandi, which he has  pursued all of his adult life. When people said he owed them money;  when people said he didn't fulfill a contract; when people said he  should do this, that, or the other, he almost invariably took them to  court and delayed and delayed and delayed.   There is an editorial in ``USA Today'' which says this: ``Trump has  met the impeachment investigation with outright and unprecedented  defiance.'' We share that view.   No President in history has refused to cooperate with the Congress of  the United States in the exercising of its constitutional  responsibility of oversight other than this President. Those are the  facts.   This is not ``The Washington Post'' or ``The New York Times.'' That  editorial went on to say: ``Allowing this obstruction to stand  unchallenged would put the President above the law and permanently  damage Congress' ability to investigate misconduct by Presidents of  either party.''   Now, Mr. Speaker, I would again reflect that Articles of Impeachment  under the Constitution of the United States are what Mr. Mueller said  was the appropriate option if the Congress believed that this President  ought to be held accountable for abuse of power, because he said he  couldn't do it because the Justice Department policy said he couldn't  do it.   We have had hearings. Those hearings were participated in by the  Republican side of the aisle and the Democratic side of the aisle. Time  was divided equally between the sides for questioning of witnesses.   The witnesses were an ambassador hired by Secretary Pompeo, appointed  by the President to represent us; Mr. Sondland, a close friend of the  President's, apparently, or at least a big contributor of the  President's, appointed by the President, who came back and said no.   Certainly, I believe there was a quid pro quo that, if you didn't  start an investigation, if you didn't announce that in public, then  there wouldn't be the $391 million that you needed to defend your  country and to defend freedom in Ukraine, which this Congress had, in a  bipartisan way, sent to the President of the United States and that the  Defense Department and others had certified reforms contemplated by  that legislation had been effected, and they recommended the payment of  that money.   And in addition, you could not have a meeting with the White House if  this didn't happen.   So my friend continues to say no wrongdoing; nothing; no crimes; no  this, that, and the other. That is not the case, Mr. Speaker. And no  matter how many times he says it, whether it is an editorial in ``USA  Today'' or an editorial in some other paper or articles in some other  paper or--I will tell my friend--people with whom I talk on your side  of the aisle--I will not name their names--they, like Zelensky, would  be afraid of retribution, just as Mr. Sanford found out that  disagreeing would incur the wrath of the President of the United States  and get a response, either in a tweet or some other way.   Mr. Zelensky is in a very difficult position. The freedom of his  country, the security of his people, he believes, are contingent upon  whether President Trump will treat him fairly and as consistently as  the Congress would want them treated.   So I say to my friend: We are going to move ahead. We will all have a  chance to vote on these articles, and we will have a chance to debate  them. And then the Senate will have a trial, if, in fact, articles pass  this House. And that trial will be where the President, presumably,  will offer witnesses.   But I find it interesting, Mr. Speaker, that Republican Senators are  quoted frequently saying, we ought to have no witnesses. Republican  Senators are saying, we ought to have no witnesses. Perhaps they just  want to pass it so quickly. But it is as well, I think, because they  don't know of any witnesses who will absolve the President from the  actions that have been testified to without effective opposition to  those premises.   So, Mr. Speaker, we can debate this. We are going to debate it, I am  sure, next week. It will be debated in the United States Senate, and we  can continue to debate it here today. But the evidence, in the  perception of many, is overwhelming and uncontradicted.     Will my friend yield?    Will the gentleman tell me where he did that?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I think I am speaking English. Let me repeat. What the Mueller report  said was the Department of Justice policy was that they could not  indict a sitting President of the United States. It went on to say, as  I quoted, that did not mean that they could assert that there was no  obstruction of justice. And if they thought they could assert that,  they would have asserted it.   And Attorney General Barr then mischaracterized the Mueller report  before it was released to put, in my opinion, the President's spin on  the Mueller report, which, very frankly, the gentleman's side of the  aisle has continued to spin all the time.   I mentioned the six people who were convicted of lying to the  investigation, close associates of the President of the United States,  now in jail or waiting to be sentenced. Mr. Stone falls into that  category.   Mr. Barr said that there was no obstruction. He was wrong. He  mischaracterized, misstated, and misled the American people. And  Mueller said in his report that was not what he found.   Collusion is not a crime. Conspiracy is a crime.   But there were, in addition to the six people I have talked about, 10  Russians indicted for participating in trying to undermine the  integrity of the elections in our country on behalf of Mr. Trump.   Now, the gentleman indicates that the Mueller report has not been  mentioned. The Mueller report is not the gravamen or the central--we  lawyers say ``gravamen''--but the central tenet here.   The central tenet is, on July 25 and, frankly, leading up to that and  succeeding that, the President of the United States involved himself in  a way to enrich himself in terms of the election that was coming up,  2020--not the 2016 election, the 2020 election.   The evidence has not been rebutted that that was the fact; and, in  fact, people close to the President of the United States confirmed it.   What the articles say is there was an abuse of power, which is what  almost every constitutional scholar says was the central concern of our  Founding Fathers when they included the impeachment provision in the  Constitution of the United States: to be a check on authoritarian power  serving its own interests, not the people's interest. That is what the  central claim here is.   And with respect to the other Article of Impeachment, it does not  mention the Mueller report because what it was focused on--although  Mueller focused on the obstruction of justice evidence, not the charge,  but the evidence.   What we are focusing on is the biggest attempt to prohibit the  Congress of the United States and the exercise of its legitimate  constitutional responsibility of oversight from getting information,  either in testimony or in documents. And almost every scholar of past  Presidents--including President Nixon and including President Clinton  and the extraordinary discovery that was exercised against President  Obama on a regular basis--found that this President has stonewalled  more than any other President and with less justification than any  other President, because most Presidents referred to executive  privilege.   This President went much more broadly than those who dealt with him  [[Page H10231]]  personally, but simply wanted to preclude information from getting to  the Congress so that it could make decisions based upon that evidence.   And, of course, the other suit that we have is a President who said  he was going to release his tax information to the American people. He  has fought in every forum to prevent that from happening,  notwithstanding the legislation, which was not adopted by us--it is  very old legislation--which says the tax writing committee can get that  information.   And I would suggest the American people ought to have that  information so they can determine for themselves whether this President  is acting for his benefit or for their benefit, which is his  constitutional responsibility.    I didn't say that. Don't mischaracterize what I said. I  did not say that.    That is accurate.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The irony is that the reason we got cooperation in the Nixon case and  in the Clinton case is because those administrations cooperated. This  administration has absolutely not cooperated.   The gentleman has those letters, and he put them down as if they mean  something. They are further evidence of delay. The committee requested  legitimately.   What the gentleman didn't say--he said we ought to go to court. Mr.  Speaker, I wonder if the gentleman knows what happened when we went to  court, because we have gone to court five or six times. We haven't lost  a case yet. We have not lost a case yet where the court has said that  Congress is entitled to that information.   So these letters are fine, but they are delay and dissemble as we  throw them on the table, as if they mean something.   The gentleman says the Russians interfered in our election. They did.  The irony is, one of the reasons that the Obama administration didn't  get more involved in that is because there was knowledge by some that  they were interfering on behalf--or suspicion of--Mr. Trump because of  some of the evidence we have heard.   Mr. Stone's case, Mr. Gates testified about the knowledge that the  President had about WikiLeaks and of the President's invitation for  WikiLeaks to release information.   Sondland changed his testimony. We have gone to court. The  administration has refused to cooperate.                                time  1515    The gentleman ignores those facts. They are facts, and they are facts  that are generally accepted across the land, even by those who are  supporters of the President.   So we are going to have this discussion. They are going to have this  discussion in the Senate. But the President chose not to come to the  House to defend against the allegations. His counsel said they weren't  going to participate. They had the opportunity; they did not take it.  We will see what happens from there.  [[Page H10232]]         Mr. Speaker, we could go, I guess, all day on this. But  the fact is, let me say, with that letter, the gentleman says 1 week.  The fact of the matter is this President has been defying Congress for  years in terms of giving it information it constitutionally had the  right to have. He has not responded. In fact, we have gone to court,  and we have won every case. It is not like the court said: Oh, well,  they have the right to do this; they can talk back and forth for days,  years, and months.   The court said: No, they are entitled to that information.   Don't send me a letter; send me the information I request.   For my friend to pretend that that was just 1 week's delay--it has  been years of delay to responding to information requested legitimately  by the Congress of the United States.   After months of going to the court, the courts have come to a  conclusion over and over and over again that the Congress is entitled  to that information.   Two courts have now decided that we are entitled to his tax  information and to his financial information. We haven't gotten it.   Why? Because he appeals again.   Why? Because that is his modus operandi, as I said. He did it in the  private sector, and he is doing it in the public sector.    What surprises me is that--I am not wishing it, but my friend may be  in charge someday again, and my friend is going to be very upset with  the precedent that the gentleman is arguing for at this point in time  in terms of not cooperating with the Congress of the United States in  conducting its constitutional duties.   As I say, we could go on and on on this. We are going to have  additional hearings. I would repeat again, from a USA Today editorial:  ``Trump has met the impeachment investigation with outright and  unprecedented defiance,'' which is one of the reasons I suppose he  didn't appear and he instructed people who have information, like John  Bolton, like Secretary Pompeo, and like so many others: Don't appear.  Don't testify. Don't provide information. That is obfuscation and  refusal to cooperate. But we will have an opportunity to deal with  these in the future.   I would hope that, at this point in time, Mr. Whip, we might cease  and desist so our friends could have an opportunity to say what they  want to say. But I am prepared to proceed if my friend is so disposed.    Will the gentleman yield?    Of course he is.    This could go on forever.   Of course not. I didn't make that assertion. Don't put it in my  mouth.   My friend has every right, not only the President, but every citizen  has the right to repair to the courts of the United States for redress  of their grievances and the pressing of their case, period. The  President has that right.   I never asserted that the President ought to be impeached on that  basis, nor do I assert it now, nor do we assert it in our articles  which have yet to be voted on, so we will see what they do on that  vote.   But let me remind the gentleman and let me remind Mr. Speaker of the  House, we had a vote in 2017, we had a vote in 2018, and we had a vote  in 2019. Those votes were on whether or not we ought to move Articles  of Impeachment forward to impeach the President of the United States. I  voted ``no'' on each one of those votes. Over 60 percent of the  Democrats voted ``no'' on each one, some higher, on each one of those  votes in '17, '18, and '19.   So when you assert, Mr. Speaker, that somehow the Democrats were just  frothing at the bit to impeach the President--I don't want to impeach  this President. I wish this would pass from us. No one ran for Congress  to impeach the President of the United States. But no one ought to  shirk their responsibility.   I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, my belief is that there is not a single  Republican in this House, not one, confronted with these facts against  President Obama who wouldn't have voted to impeach President Obama--not  one of the minority. I am convinced to my bones, and I have been here a  long time and served with a lot of people, that not one of them would  have voted against either one of these articles if President Obama had  done the same fact pattern with the same evidence. Not one of the  minority would have voted against one of these articles.   That is my view, Mr. Speaker, but we will see.   I said this morning, quoting the papers, that we are not whipping  this. This is not about whipping some partisan vote. This is about each  Member having to decide for themselves, with their conscience, with  their moral values, and with their oath of office to defend and protect  the Constitution of the United States, whether or not--and my friend  quotes one witness, one constitutional expert. Three constitutional  experts said, if you do not move forward on impeachment, effectively,  the executive power will be unchecked and you will create a king, not a  President.   Three times this Congress said: We are not going forward. But then,  on July 25, a phone call occurred in which this President clearly said  to an ally to whom we wanted to give $391 million to defend himself and  his people and his country, but withheld because: I would like you to  do me a favor.   That favor was not to help America, and that favor was not to clean  up corruption, because he already had certified by his departments that  they had met that criteria. It was, as the evidence is almost  uncontroverted, to help him in the coming election and to undermine  somebody he perceived to be one of his, if not the, principal opponent.   This is a heavy decision this Congress and this House will have to  make, and each one of us will have to make it. Let us hope that each  one of us makes it honestly and unrelated to politics or party, but  related to patriotism and oath of office.    The good news is they didn't bring impeachment against  President Obama because he did nothing to warrant such an action. How  proud I am of that.
