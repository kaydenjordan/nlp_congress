 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to remove myself as  a cosponsor of H.R. 2069, the Fostering Stable Housing Opportunities  Act of 2017.    Mr. Speaker, I very much appreciate the kind words of my  friend from Pennsylvania, and I certainly appreciate his leadership of  this Special Order this evening. It is a subject of immense importance  to the American people, none more so, Mr. Speaker, than people of color  in the United States of America.   So I would like to begin this Special Order by speaking about  President Trump's district and circuit court nominees and then about  his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, who serves on the Court of  Appeals for the District of Columbia. That is the circuit of my own  home district, the District of Columbia.   Mr. Speaker, long before I came to the House, I had the distinct  honor of arguing and winning a case before the United States Supreme  Court. That case was a free speech case where I represented plaintiffs  with whom I profoundly disagreed. As we look at the President's  nominees, especially to the Supreme Court, one wonders today how these  nominees would rule.   Let's look first at President Trump's nominees so far to the circuit  courts and the district court. This is an amazing, unprecedented figure  for the 21st century. His nominees are 90.1 percent white, 2.3 percent  African American.   Now, one way to look at this is to look at another Republican  President. So I said to my staff: Find the racial makeup of President  Bush's nominees.   Remember, African Americans don't expect a Republican President to  offer anything like the number of nominees of, for example, President  Barack Obama, not because he was African American, but because he was,  after all, a Democrat. That is not the standard to which I am holding  this President. The standard I am holding this President to is, by  comparison, to Republican Presidents.  [[Page H6640]]    The lion's share of President Bush's appointees was also White. I had  no complaint then. I don't recall the Congressional Black Caucus taking  to the floor and saying: How come the lion's share of President Bush's  nominees was White, more than 85 percent?   That reflected his party and his supporters.   But 8.5 percent of President Bush's nominees were African American,  compared to 2.3 percent of Trump's nominees. So that means that  President Bush--and I am looking at the comparable period; I am not  looking at his overall two terms in office; I am looking at up until  now--he had appointed three times as many African Americans to the  bench. Far more Whites, and I have no complaint about that.   But the Supreme Court and the Federal courts have meant everything to  African Americans. I do not need to point out that the political  bodies, the House and the Senate, took many years to recognize equal  protection for African Americans. It didn't happen, indeed, until the  courts made it happen in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, showing,  I think, that the courts are of immense importance to a group that is  not the majority and must depend upon the fairness of the majority and  even more so on the courts, which are supposed to play no favorites  whatsoever, only to equal justice under the law.   The President and the Republican Senate have made the Federal courts  a top priority. I believe they have appointed as many as 40 nominees,  if I am not mistaken. In fact, the Supreme Court means so much to them,  even though they already have a majority on the Supreme Court with  their most recent nominee, it means so much to them that our Republican  friends in the Senate are wiping out their entire August recess to stay  here to try to get Brett Kavanaugh nominated, and there is a fierce  fight underway.   I am speaking about not only Brett Kavanaugh, the judge who sits on  the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, but I want to give you some sense of  judges who sit on other circuits in other district courts, to make it  clear why the Congressional Black Caucus is so alarmed at what is  happening with federal court nominees.                                time  2000    Some Federal court nominees proposed by this President have had to be  rejected because they were unacceptable on any court, beyond any sense  of conservatism.   Most recently--I believe it was just last week--Ryan Bounds was to  serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. A Republican Senate forced  Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to withdraw his name because two  Republican Senators, Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina and Senator  Marco Rubio of Florida, had indicated that they could not vote for Ryan  Bounds because of remarks he had made on multiculturalism and racial  issues. You don't want anybody on the bench who has already shown  racial animus.   Since the Senate is so closely divided--51 Republicans to 49  Democrats--they were forced to withdraw Ryan Bounds' nomination.   I point that out to let you know that it is not a done deal that  Brett Kavanaugh will go on the Supreme Court. That close number is  going to hold up, we think, not only for Democrats, but when Senate  hearings are over, we believe it will be very difficult even for some  of our Republican friends to vote for Judge Kavanaugh.   Remember, the Senate represents a rather broad swath of people, so  they will have to watch out for their own elections as well.   Let me give another example of how extreme President Trump's nominees  to the Federal courts can be. Three more have had to be withdrawn  related to race. Again, I am going to give you examples, and you will  say nobody would ever have nominated such people to any court in the  United States.   Last year, the White House was forced to withdraw a district court  nominee, Brett Talley. What forced his withdrawal were reports that he  had defended the first Ku Klux Klan in an online post--that is, the  first, I suppose, emergence of the Ku Klux Klan--as recently as in a  2011 posting.   Jeff Mateer had his nomination withdrawn over reports that  transgender children were--and I am quoting him now--part of ``Satan's  plan.''   Now, look, if I were to call out these remarks, you might think that  nobody thought of for the Federal bench would be who I was talking  about, but that is exactly who we were talking about. That is why the  Congressional Black Caucus cannot possibly support Judge Kavanaugh.   We understand that whatever nominee comes forward is going to be a  conservative nominee. We are not asking for the nominee we would  appoint. We are simply not asking for and will do all we can to oppose  nominees who are beyond the American pale. I am speaking for the  Congressional Black Caucus, which represents 17 million African  Americans.   It is interesting to note that we have, in looking at Judge  Kavanaugh, and here I am going on to the Supreme Court, in looking at  his decisions, we have grown truly concerned about his lack of respect  for precedent. I say that even though, increasingly, these precedents  run against us. But when they have run for us, they have been on  matters of equal protection under the law. And Judge Kavanaugh has  shown an uncommon disrespect for precedent.   I invite my Republican friends, who also respect precedent because  many of those precedents will reinforce their own views, to be leery of  any judge who disregards precedent. His views on civil rights and equal  protection have been out of the mainstream, but there haven't been a  lot of them, so I have had to look closely to see what his views  actually are.   I must say that, even his conservative colleagues and, I must  emphasize, on the D.C. Circuit, which is now a conservative circuit  with more Republican judges than Democratic judges, have often had to  disagree with their colleague Judge Kavanaugh. He has achieved a higher  number of dissents than any member of the D.C. Circuit Court annually.   How could that happen? This is a conservative court. Who is he  dissenting from? He is dissenting from not only the Democratic  appointees but from his own colleagues appointed by Republicans.   Now, of course, the notion of equal protection has disproportionately  protected minorities and women, so we are very mindful of such  decisions, even when they don't directly entail people of color whom we  directly represent.   For example, we are concerned that no Americans be arrested without  probable cause, and if you are a minority in any country, the  probability of arrest will be greater than if you are among the  majority.   We are concerned about the Affordable Care Act, again because of the  disproportionate number of African Americans who are affected.   I am going to cite some decisions that show that Judge Kavanaugh  cannot be trusted to uphold what even his conservative colleagues have  said on such issues as these.   Let us look at arrests without probable cause. I bring that up  because of the churning of relevent issues in our country. A week does  not go by that there hasn't been a shooting of an African American by a  police officer. This issue is among the very top in the African  American community, the concern about overzealous police officers.   Kavanaugh has both spoken out and written, over and over again, in  such a way to indicate that he would weaken probable cause standards  that have stood for the ages--that is how long they have been there-- making them, as he has written, more flexible.   As you consider this possible change as one about which African  Americans are concerned, I hope you understand that most of the people  who need probable cause in this country are White.   So decisions making it easier to do searches without a warrant or  ``individualized suspicion''--I am quoting him--are decisions he  believes need to be looked at more closely, even though the existing  precedents has been clear, and they have not been challenged in other  circuits.   Perhaps the rule that most Americans understand best is the so-called  Miranda rule. That is a rule that says you don't have to incriminate  yourself. Judge Kavanaugh appears to want to narrow that rule. I didn't  think I would ever see the day when, after decades--must be 50 years-- of Miranda juris prudence, there would be any judge sitting on any  bench who would want to narrow the self-incrimination rule.   Of special interest to African Americans are Judge Kavanaugh's  apparent  [[Page H6641]]  views on Roe v. Wade, or the right of a woman to choice. We don't know  precisely where he stands on choice, but there is a very troubling  precedent from this circuit involving an undocumented woman who had  been found to be entitled to an abortion.   Now, that hadn't happened here. The case was in the D.C. Circuit, but  the ruling was from a Texas court, perhaps the most conservative on  matters of abortion, which made this woman go through many steps before  deciding that she, indeed, qualified under Roe v. Wade for an abortion.   Judge Kavanaugh tried to do something that is unfathomable. The time  was running. The House wants abortions done within 20 weeks. Roe v.  Wade allows more time. The time was running, but Judge Kavanaugh ruled  that she should have to get a sponsor before she could, in fact,  enforce her constitutional rights to choice. His own court overruled  Judge Kavanaugh.   I bring that up in no small part because African American women, for  example, use abortion at a rate that is beyond the average American  woman, so this issue matters to the Congressional Black Caucus.   On the Affordable Care Act, we have perhaps the most astonishing of  Judge Kavanaugh's decisions. He hasn't said the ACA is  unconstitutional. That is pretty hard to say at the circuit court  level. But he has said something that has never been said before in  American juris prudence: that a President may decline to enforce a law  even after the Supreme Court has said that the law or statute is  constitutional.   Understand what this means. The Affordable Care Act has been found to  be constitutional. Yes, there are still attempts in this House to  overturn it, but it stands. It is so popular that, while Brett  Kavanaugh is being discussed in the Senate during the month of August,  Senate Democrats are going to be talking about the Affordable Care Act  because it has become one of the most popular laws in the United States  today, even though the Republicans have done all they could to cripple  it.   Judge Kavanaugh has said that the President may decline to enforce a  law like the Affordable Care Act even after it is found to be  constitutional. What happens to the rule of law if that becomes the  standing law of the United States?   This is not just a wrong view but a dangerous view. It would allow  Presidents to pick and choose which laws to enforce, notwithstanding  the courts, that a President could stand as the sole decider of what  laws to enforce, notwithstanding the jurisdiction of the United States  Supreme Court.                                time  2015    Mr. Speaker, Brett Kavanaugh isn't fit to go to the Supreme Court of  the United States based on the record he has shown. Yet Judge Kavanaugh  seems to have gone out of his way to try to write his way onto the  Supreme Court.   Why would he write so often in dissent? Why would he so often in  write the law, views that are uncommon among Republicans?   I think he was trying to draw the attention of President Trump. And  one of the reasons I think so is the last issue I will discuss, and  that is this nominee's view, Judge Kavanaugh's view, of the independent  counsel. You really had to dig this one up.   As recently as 2017, he dug back into a decision of long ago. This is  a 1988 decision, Morrison v. Olson. He said he had not agreed with the  author of the decision. It was Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the  Republican Chief Justice. But he went out of his way to wonder about  Judge Rehnquist's holding in that case, Morrison v. Olson, that the  independent counsel was constitutional.   Why has Judge Kavanaugh gone out of his way to talk about the  independent counsel when, in fact, there was no such case before him?   I think he was sending a signal to this President: Don't worry about  the independent counsel as far as I am concerned. I quarrel with  whether or not the independent counsel law is constitutional.   If there wasn't an independent counsel law, really, what would be the  deterrent to a lawless President?   The deterrent, of course, would have to be impeachment. Impeachment  is understood to be a political but difficult process. That is why it  is very hard to get.   So right now, we have matters before the independent counsel that,  indeed, are ordinary criminal and civil matters. The notion that  somebody sitting on any Federal court of the United States believes  that the independent counsel statute is unconstitutional or could be-- he hasn't said that it is unconstitutional. He has come so close to it  that it is noteworthy, for anyone judging whether he should go on the  Supreme Court of the United States.   Judge Kavanaugh has demonstrated such a departure from established  American law that one wonders why he wants to be on the Supreme Court  of the United States. He has made a lifetime record of numerous  dissents, I think, in order to show that he means to bring an even  sharper departure from precedent than we have seen.   One of the most important and most conservative ways in which the  courts operate is by precedent. So it is very hard to overturn  precedent. But a determined member of the Court can chip away at  precedent, and, we are sure, can chip away at the rights of the  minority who is disproportionately dependent on a fair Supreme Court.   So I say to my good friend from Pennsylvania that we have our work  cut out for us. But the President's district and circuit nominees have  not all been upheld, and that should encourage us to know that, while  we are not in the Senate, we do have two members of the Congressional  Black Caucus who are in the Senate, and we must all be doing all we can  here in the House to help them make the American people understand what  is at stake and to make sure that the Court of Appeals for the District  of Columbia Judge Brett Kavanaugh, does not become a member of the  Supreme Court of the United States.   I thank my good friend for his leadership this evening.    Mr. Speaker, my good friend who raises the question about  Brown v. Board of Education may seem to be raising the question about  such settled law, both with the American people and the courts, that it  couldn't possibly come up.   If I may first respond to the gentleman by saying that one of  President Trump's nominees was asked where she stood on Brown v. Board  of Education, and she declined to give an answer. More than 50 years  after the Supreme Court, for the first time, recognized that African  Americans must be treated the same as everyone else in the United  States, we now have a nominee who questions even that precedent.   You may not be able to overturn it, but consider the notion of  chipping away any part of it, remembering what it meant is spread now  not across schools, but across the juris prudence of equality.   I appreciate the question. I say to my good friend from Pennsylvania,  I appreciate the question so that Americans will understand that our  opposition to Judge Kavanaugh is not far-fetched, that we are talking  about a Supreme Court nominee, who leads us to believe that the most  settled of decisions could be rocked by this nominee to the Supreme  Court.    Mr. Speaker, that is a most interesting question. And as  the gentleman indicated, I pointed out that I didn't expect a  Republican President to come anywhere near Democratic Presidents in  proposing nominees. However, I don't expect complete disdain for the  importance of the courts to African Americans. I would not expect the  lowest number of African Americans appointed to the courts of the  United States in memory, certainly not since the 20th century in Brown  v. Board of Education.   There had been some sense among Republican Presidents that one way to  indicate that a Republican President believed in equal justice was to  propose some African Americans on the court. Now, when you get to 90  percent--more than 90 percent nominees White, you are sending a very  strong message on equal protection to African Americans.   This President has been accused of racism because of some of the  things he has said. For example, Charlottesville, when he seemed to be  for those killing people and not against them. I am not sure what his  personal views are, but I am sure that when he shows disdain for equal  protection and has given us no evidence that he understands equal  protection, that we have every reason to wonder what it is that he  intends to do to show people of every background that he is for equal  justice.   It does seem to me that the President needs to make some gesture to  indicate that he believes that all people are created equal. The best  gesture would be to bite into this 90 percent--this 2 percent figure, a  little over 2 percent figure of African Americans appointed to the  bench, raise that number, as the Congressional Black Caucus calls on  him to do this evening.   He may have, for example, been reacting to those staff who have been  giving him judges to appoint, but I say to you, I say to my good friend  from Pennsylvania, that there are many Senators who, I am sure, have  suggested some qualified African American nominees or could do so.   I would urge the President to wipe away this notion that he thinks  the United States of America should have as close to an all White  judiciary as he can get by talking to, listening to some Senators who I  am almost certain will have already put forward some African Americans,  or surely will be doing so in the future    Mr. Speaker, the most important thing I would say to the  people is look at that 49-51 figure of how close the Senate is, and  within a couple of months, there will be an election. We could turn a  lot of this around.   If, as the polls tend to show, Democrats capture the House, and they  are increasingly showing that they will keep the Senate, it seems to me  all the American people can do now is take it to the ultimate remedy,  and that is to change the Congress. And that way, it seems to me, would  slow these nominees or get nominees where there will be some  consultation with Democrats, as there has been in the past, often, in  the Senate because you want to get your nominee through.   So I don't think, by any means, that there is anything to fear  because there is an election coming and I believe that what this  nominee for the Supreme Court and others for the district courts--and  here we have African Americans mindful of the district courts and the  courts of appeals throughout the United States. Surely all of that is,  forgive the word, ammunition to go to the polls to make sure we halt  this stripping of equal protection from the Federal courts of the  United States.                                time  2030
