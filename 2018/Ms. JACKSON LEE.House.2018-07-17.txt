 Mr. Speaker, there are moments in history that  require the deliberate and thoughtful response of the most powerful  body in the world, the United States Congress, this House and the other  House.   While Americans are preparing for recreation and fellowship with  family members during this period of summer, when schoolchildren are  out, as others are dealing with the excruciating heat, others dealing  with the impact of climate change, gun violence, the need for putting  back in the terrible cuts of the Republican budget on Medicare and  Medicaid, and a number of other issues dealing with their communities  and neighborhoods, and, I would say, frankly, keeping their children  safe and recognizing the values of this Nation that include not  snatching children away from family members, I get that and I  understand the responsibility of this Congress to pass laws, to work  together to ensure that the beauty of what America stands for, her  values and her opportunities for so many others, is heard.   But I also think it is important because, as I have traveled in the  last 24 hours, I saw Americans concerned about their Nation and wanting  to be able to understand what transpired in Helsinki yesterday, Monday,  July 16. As many have said, Republicans and Democrats, it was a  disgraceful display of unpatriotic behavior. The tragedy of it is that  it came from the Commander in Chief of this Nation.   As I read the Constitution, it says that executive power shall be  vested in a President of the United States, and he shall hold his  office for a period of time. His powers under section 2 include that  the President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the  United States, and of the militia of several States, when called into  actual service. And, as well, it indicates that he shall appoint  ambassadors.   That is translated into the President's responsibilities over the  intelligence communities and many aspects of our defense. Also, the  power of the President articulates the foreign policy of this Nation.   Yesterday, the display that was shown was that the foreign policy,  and the patriotism, and the stature, and the leadership, and the  Constitution of the United States became a footstool to a despot by the  name of President Putin.   No one is against engagement, diplomacy, or resolving conflict, but  President Putin stands very proudly as ex-KGB to have poisoned his own  citizens, to have shot journalists, to have shot down an airplane over  Ukraine with 300 innocent family members, children, and others, and, as  well, has taken over a land of another country.   So here we stand with this picture to the world. As well, when posed  a question of, who do you believe, the Commander in Chief, to the  absolute dismay of those of us who have lived through 9/11 here in  Congress, and who saw the loss of life in conflicts like Iraq and  Afghanistan, were amazed that the sacred aspect of our work, and that  is voting, was determined by the intelligence community of this Nation,  that Russia invaded in our 2016 election and literally stole the  election, and will continue to do so today, as emphasized by the  Director of National Intelligence, Director Coats, and the intelligence  community.   A report given by the Mueller investigation indicted 12 intelligence  agents of Russia--not of any other country, not civilians, but  intelligence agents, military--who had direct orders from President  Putin. You would think that the President of the United States would  forcefully say to the President: Stop it and stop it now.    That is a patriot. That is one who has the powers of the Presidency  under Article II, section 2.   Yet this is what came about. President Trump was asked by a reporter:  ``You first. Just now, President Putin denied having anything to do  with the election interference in 2016.''   It is amazing how my time goes because I am talking about the  President. But, in any event, let me conclude by saying that this  document reports that the President said that he stands with Putin over  the United States of America. Congress must demand the transcripts. We  must have congressional hearings, Mr. Speaker. This is a serious  matter.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4989,  Protecting Diplomats from Surveillance Through Consumer Devices Act.   H.R. 4989 directs the Department of State to: (1) establish a policy  on the use of location-tracking consumer devices, including GPS-enabled  devices, at U.S. diplomatic and consular facilities by U.S. government  employees, contractors, locally employed staff, and members of other  agencies deployed to or stationed at such facilities; and (2) submit a  related report to Congress.   This bill states that existing and new employees at such facilities  shall, as a part of their security briefings, be informed of such  policy and given instructions on the use of location-tracking consumer  devices on and off facility premises.   The State Department may coordinate policy formulation with other  agencies whose employees are deployed to or stationed at U.S.  diplomatic and consular facilities.   The public release earlier this year of GPS tracking data from the  American fitness company Strava revealed highly sensitive information  on U.S. activities abroad, such as military base locations, jogging  paths of personnel located at these bases and, in many cases, also  identified paths with individual accounts.   This data was collected from wearable electronic devices such as  Fitbits and other technologies and presents a glaring security  vulnerability that our adversaries may exploit to undermine our  interests, thereby putting our personnel serving abroad at extreme  risk.   While the issue has most seriously affected U.S. military  installations, in lieu of a policy on the use of these devices, State  Department personnel remain at risk as well.   As such, H.R. 4989 requires the Department of State to establish and  disseminate a policy on the use of location-tracking consumer devices  by diplomats and other employees at U.S. embassies and consular  facilities outside the United States.   This is a commonsense step to ensure we are doing all we can to  protect our diplomatic personnel serving our nation abroad.   Our enemies and adversaries work around the clock to undermine our  interests.   We should not make it any easier for them.   I thank my colleague and good friend, Congressman Joaquin Castro, for  introducing this important legislation.   By passing H.R. 4989, we can help ensure the safety of our nation's  dutiful diplomats.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 4989.    Madam Chairwoman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I thank the chairman and ranking  member, Mr. Calvert and Ms. McCollum, for their leadership on these  issues of preservation.   The Jackson Lee amendment increases grant funding by $500,000 so that  organizations interested in historical preservation, especially in  underrepresented communities, have the ability to study, survey, and  nominate properties to the National Register of Historic Places.   Due to lack of resources, certain communities are underrepresented in  this process, so this amendment ensures that they have a greater  opportunity.  [[Page H6438]]    The Jackson Lee amendment ensures that sites important to our  American history are no longer overlooked due to mere lack of  resources. It accomplishes this goal by promoting research that  uncovers information to assist in telling the full American story.   Historical places create connections to our heritage that help  understand our past, appreciate our triumphs, and learn from our  mistakes. And they cover all of the cultural backgrounds, from African  Americans, to Anglos, to Hispanics, and to Asians, all in this  wonderful, diverse country who have had a story to tell, as well as  Native Americans and many others.   Such stories might otherwise be lost because urban renewal and out- migration of Blacks destroyed or led to the abandonment of many African  American communities. Preservation helps recognize, save, revitalize,  and protect Americans' historic places, build communities, and foster  education and pride.   I am reminded of Freedmen's Town in my home city and Emancipation  Park, which was the first park bought in the entire State of Texas by  freed slaves.   Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment.   Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of Jackson Lee Amendment No. 8  to Division A of H.R. 6147, the Department of the Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act of 2019.   This Jackson Lee Amendment increases grant funding by $500 thousand  so that organizations interested in historical preservation, especially  in underrepresented communities, have the ability to study, survey, and  nominate properties to the National Register of Historic Places.   Due to lack of resources, certain communities are underrepresented in  this process so this amendment ensures that is no longer the case.   This Jackson Lee Amendment ensures that sites important to our  American history are no longer overlooked due to mere lack of  resources, it accomplishes this goal by promoting research that  uncovers information to assist in telling the full American story.   Historical places create connections to our heritage that help us  understand our past, appreciate our triumphs, and learn from our  mistakes.   Madam Chair, by understanding and designating landmarks we stimulate  local revitalization and foster interest in places that otherwise may  go unnoticed, despite cultural and historic significance.   By preserving historic sites that tell the story of Americans in this  country, we draw attention to the contributions of both ordinary and  extraordinary people.   Such stories might otherwise be lost because urban renewal and the  out-migration of blacks destroyed or led to the abandonment of many  African American communities.   Preservation helps to recognize, save, revitalize and protect  America's historic places, build communities, and foster education and  pride.   The Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) provides matching grants to  State and Tribal historic preservation offices.   These HPF grants are used to pay for research and surveys of historic  sites, training for staff, and the work involved in nominating these  sites to the National Register of Historic Places.   In short, it makes preservation possible to communities that  otherwise would not have the means to engage in the nominating process.   The Jackson Lee amendment is essential because it provides funds to  preserve sites that are directly connected to the Civil Rights  Movement.   For example, earlier this year I introduced H.R. 4745, the  Emancipation National Historic Trail Act that seeks a federal  designation of the Emancipation National Historic Trail.   The Emancipation National Historic Trail extends approximately 51  miles and marks the migration of newly freed slaves, who, upon learning  of the Emancipation Proclamation two years after the President had  signed it into law, departed from what is now the Osterman Building and  Reedy Chapel in Galveston, and charted a course along Texas State  Highway 3 and Interstate Highway 45 North to Freedmen's Town and  Emancipation Park in Houston.   Increasing grant funding for this program would make projects like  the Emancipation Trail possible.   Madam Chair, it is imperative that we preserve and codify the  historical record and memorialize significant events of our past.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for Jackson Lee Amendment  No. 8 to Division A of H.R. 6147 as it is vital that we support the  preservation of important sites.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for that, and I  want to give an example that earlier this year I introduced H.R. 4745,  the Emancipation National Historic Trail Act, that seeks Federal  designation of the Emancipation National Historic Trail, that it would  extend 51 miles and mark the migration of newly freed slaves. But, more  importantly, it takes us from Captain Granger in Galveston, who brought  the slaves in Texas who were freed in 1865, 2 years after the  Emancipation Proclamation, and it tracks the historic markers all the  way to Freedmen's Town and Emancipation Park.   This is an opportunity not only for the communities to be joined  together but, again, to reemphasize history that is intertwined. A  study shows the connection between culture, heritage, and tourism, and  that 37 percent of global tourism has a cultural motivation, and 57  percent of travelers are strongly influenced by history and culture in  their choice of holiday destination. This will help underserved  communities.   Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I thank the chairman and the ranking  member of this committee for their commitment to historic preservation.   Since 1837, Historically Black Colleges and Universities have served  the needs of higher education for the African American community. The  first HBCUs were established in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Missouri, and  Tennessee.   After the Civil War, there was an influx of HBCU establishments  throughout the Southeast, Midwest, and Southwest. The Jackson Lee  amendment provides an additional $1 million for the Historic  Preservation Fund, and within that fund to be allocated to Historically  Black Colleges and Universities, institutions that are uniquely  American, fundamentally historical, and distinctly beneficial to the  American culture and history.   In my State of Texas, it joins with any number of States throughout  the United States in the North, the South, the East, and the West.  Interestingly, these schools are not relegated to the South. They are  actually all over the United States, and they are older structures. For  those of us who visited these schools, we recognize the importance of  continuing to preserve their historic structure.   I mentioned earlier that there are great results in funding and  profits for those who can provide historic opportunities for travelers  to visit.   In 2017, Congress appropriated $4 million for the Historic  Preservation Fund to rehabilitate historic structures on campuses of  HBCUs that are listed in the National Register of Historic Places  either individually or as contributing to the National Register of  Historic Places. I can assure you that these are great assets to  America. The projects must meet major program selection criteria, and  all work must meet the Secretary of the Interior's standards and  guidelines for archeology and historic preservation.   Simply, what we are doing is allowing our history to be preserved.  The network of more than 100 historic institutions, established as  early as 1837 for former slaves and by former slaves and freedmen,  contain repositories of important books, papers, and memorabilia of  Black history.   Black history, as other history, is American history, and the  opportunity to preserve it and to continue to expand the opportunity to  improve buildings that will now educate this generation of students is  an important role for us to play.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of Jackson Lee Amendment No. 10 to  Division A of H.R. 6147, the Department of the Interior, Environment,  and Financial Services Appropriations Act of 2019.   Jackson Lee Amendment No. 10 provides an additional $1,000,000 for  the Historic Preservation Fund to be allocated to Historically Black  Colleges and Universities--institutions that are uniquely American,  fundamentally historical, and distinctly beneficial to American culture  and history.   Since 1837, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have  served the needs of higher education for the African American  community.   The first HBCUs were established in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Missouri, and  Tennessee.   After the Civil War there was an influx of HBCU establishment  throughout the Southeast, Midwest, and Southwest.   Since the 1990s, the National Park Service has awarded over $60  million in grants to over 80 of the remaining active HBCUs.   These grants work to preserve the historic structures on HBCU  campuses, many of which are listed in the National Register of Historic  Places.   In 2017, Congress appropriated $4 million from the Historic  Preservation Fund to rehabilitate historic structures on campuses of  HBCUs that are listed in the National Register of Historic Places  either individually or as contributing to a National Register historic  district.   Projects must meet major program selection criteria and all work must  meet the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines for  Archeology and Historic Preservation.   HBCUs represent a significant place in American history.   This network of more than 100 historic institutions established as  early as 1837 for former slaves and freedmen contain repositories of  important books, papers and memorabilia of Black history.   In addition, HBCUs served as meeting places during the civil rights  struggles of the 1900s.   Against substantial odds, HBCUs have played a unique role in  transforming the landscape of higher education in the United States,  and continue to prepare the African American professional and civic  leaders needed by communities, employers and the nation.   In 2013, HBCUs comprised 3 percent of all four- and two-year colleges  and universities, but enrolled 10 percent of African American  [[Page H6440]]  undergraduates, produced 18 percent of the nation's African American  college graduates, and generated 25 percent of African Americans with  bachelor degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics  (STEM) fields.   Created to educate black students at a time when society had yet to  integrate, historically black colleges and universities (HBCU's) have  had an outsize impact on the success of the black community and  therefore the American community as a whole.   HBCUs do not only educate--HBCUs have and will continue to fill an  important role in education opportunity and engagement for millions of  young people from diverse backgrounds.   Ensuring HBCUs receive the funds necessary to succeed enriches our  culture as a nation and promotes a more complete history of our country  to be preserved.   Emphasizing the importance of diversity is the best way to tell the  complete story of the American experience, and when the American story  is told by all of those who helped shape its success as a nation, we  perpetuate American exceptionalism.   Madam Chair, our HBCUs are not just academic institutions, rather,  incubators that stimulate black excellence that, more importantly,  preserve the rich and true history of those of African descent--again,  contributing to the fabric of American culture as a whole.   Texas Southern University, an outstanding HBCU, is a major  contribution and asset to the 18th District, serving as a distinct  example of the benefits that these institutions offer to the community.   HBCUs not only enjoy historical campuses, but they are also  repositories of expertise on American History.   In a 1998 study, more than 100 HBCUs identified 712 historic  properties that were owned by the schools in responses to a survey from  the U.S. Government Office of Accountability.   Nearly half of those buildings, 323, are on the National Register of  Historic Places indicating significance in American history, and the  others were eligible for the national register based on surveys by  state historic preservation officers or considered historic by the  colleges and universities.   According to the surveys at that time, 103 HBCUs estimated $755  million in costs to restore and preserve the properties, such as  improving accessibility to people with disabilities, roof replacement  and removing lead-based paint or asbestos, both known for containing  cancer-causing material.   Routine maintenance costs were not part of the estimates.   We, as a nation, have a responsibility to foster education, culture,  knowledge, diversity and leadership; and with that, Mr. Chairman, we  have a responsibility to ensure that HBCUs continue to serve as  repositories of American History and thrive as academic institutions  and continue to benefit society as a whole.   I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for Jackson Lee Amendment  No. 10.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I thank Mr. Calvert, and, again, I  thank the ranking member who has been so gracious.   I believe Texas Southern University--not as old as 1837--Prairie View  A&M, and others throughout the Nation will benefit from preserving  these historic buildings, and, as well, providing them as a source of  learning for everyone around the Nation.   Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
