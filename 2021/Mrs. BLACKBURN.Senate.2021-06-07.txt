 Madam President, it appears the White House had good  reason to wait until the Friday before Memorial Day to release their  budget proposal. They couldn't afford a full week's news cycle any more  than the American people can afford to fulfill the wish list items  President Biden is asking them to pay for. It is a very long list.   I think it is safe to say my Democratic colleagues are trying to make  the most of the next year and a half. They know that time is not on  their side nor are the American people. There really is something for  every faction of the left. Here are a few of the items that are  contained in this Biden boondoggle of a budget.   The environmental lobby did a great job these past few months. They  are more than taken care of with more electric car subsidies and a $936  million payout toward environmental justice initiatives.   We also have more funding to expand the Department of Education. If  you think that more government is what your child's educational  experience has been missing, well, this is the budget for you. Yet, if  you are fed up with the way teachers unions have treated children in  the classroom, if you are fed up with schools that have been in  lockdown, you will want to pay close attention to what I am talking  about today.   Apparently, the good people over at the Department of Health and  Human Services have time on their hands. Bear in mind, it is your money  that is paying them to do the job at which they have time on their  hands. Now, they will be switching gears from pandemic response to a  new focus on environmental extremism, reparations, and gutting the  Second Amendment.   What is in this budget? Bigger government, a higher deficit, and  runaway inflation.   What is out? According to this budget, national defense is no longer  a priority for the Biden administration or for the Department of  Defense. Border security is also on the back burner along with the  family-friendly tax policies we implemented under President Trump.   President Biden and the Democrats are doubling down on every mistake  they have made so far. Instead of doing their jobs, they are paying lip  service to struggling businesses, to struggling stores on Main Street  in your hometown, to crumbling bridges--like in Memphis, TN--and  roadways, and to future generations of Americans who will come into  this world owning their own, personal chunk of our skyrocketing  national debt. That is right. If you have a child or a grandchild born  this year, their share of the national debt is going to be about  $80,000. Think about that.   Think about what has happened to this debt. From President Washington  to President George Bush, it was about $10.6 trillion. During the  Obama-Biden years, that debt doubled. Then it was added to through the  pandemic. Now one would be led to believe that this administration had  decided it was going to take the credit cards and swipe them so many  times they would run the numbers off of them   Yes, this is the Biden surcharge at work--forcing the American people  to pay a premium just to live. Cradle to grave, daylight to dark, they  have got a list of tax hikes and increased fees for you. You hard- working Americans, you cannot escape it, and what a world they have  decided they want to leave for future generations. I think it is awful.   I will tell you what--this budget is such a terrible representation  of what America actually needs that, back home in Tennessee, as I was  home last week, people would come up to me and ask me if this was  really a serious budget. It is so extreme. It is so huge.   They would say: Surely, your Democratic colleagues are not serious  about this. Surely, President Biden is not serious about this budget.   Still, my colleagues across the aisle are so eager to get this done  that they are prepared to, once again, throw regular order out the  window.   My Democratic colleagues are living in an alternate reality. It is  the only explanation for why they continue to insist that this country  will be better off under a government that strips away your freedoms  rather than guarantees them and one that tries to tell you how to live  your life every minute of every day--from the time your feet hit the  floor in the morning until the time you brush your teeth and get in bed  at night.                          For the People Act of 2021    No, Madam President, when it comes to the Biden administration, Big  Government is its theme not only of the day but of every day. It is the  theme when it comes to spending, to regulations, and even to intrusions  into constitutionally mandated State authority.   Before the State work period, the majority leader indicated that he  intended to use this month to shove through yet another wish list item.  My Democratic colleagues have tried several times to skip debate and  sneak through various provisions of their S. 1 election takeover bill.  They tried to do this for the same reason President Biden released his  disastrous budget on a Friday after everyone had already left town. It  is because the bill could not survive a fair news cycle once the  American people knew what was in it.   To my Democratic colleagues, remember the American people know--  [[Page S3952]]  after we went through ObamaCare and the Affordable Care Act--that the  current Speaker of the House had then said: Well, we have to pass this  bill so we can read it and find out what is in it.   They know that this is the way you like to operate.   I am sure many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would  dispute my characterization of the bill. So, for the benefit of the  record, let's go through a few of the provisions they are absolutely  convinced will somehow expand freedom and secure our elections. This is  what you will find in their S. 1 election takeover bill:   It would require States to allow ballot harvesting and no-excuse  mail-in balloting, which we know from experience will open the door to  fraud. We know this. So are they intentionally trying to open the door  to fraud? You are right; people are correct in asking that question.   It would also overrule State-level voter ID laws--another great way  to guarantee rampant fraud. So, yes, you heard me correctly. They want  the Federal Government to tell your State that you cannot require  someone to prove his identity, to show an ID in order to--what?--vote  in an election. How about that?   It would weaponize the FEC against minority parties, mandate donor  disclosure, and require the Federal Government to match private  contributions. You heard me right. They want your tax dollars to fund  people who are running for office even if you don't agree with their  opinions. Your money would be going to them to match the contributions  that they are raising. By the way, it is a 6-to-1 match. Pretty  convenient, isn't it?   I call it insanity, and anyone who has ever staffed a polling place  or has helped to count ballots knows this. Yet here we are, staring  down yet another attempt to put this bill on the fast track--taking  away the States' authority to run elections in their States.   Here is what I say to my Democratic colleagues: You are not going to  get the benefit of a quiet news cycle on this. America is watching and  listening, and they are paying attention.   Your attempts to whip the Senate into a state of partisan warfare  over a bill you don't have the votes to pass will not go unnoticed.   Your attempts to make another run at the filibuster and invent a  mandate the voters refuse to give you will not go unnoticed.   Your attempt to sneak through this unconstitutional, partisan power  grab is not going to go unnoticed. People are paying attention, and my  Republican colleagues and I are going to stand up against it. Members  of your own caucus have said they will not stand for it.   Most importantly, the American people are watching, they are  listening, they are paying attention, and they do not stand for what  you are seeking to do.   I yield the floor.
