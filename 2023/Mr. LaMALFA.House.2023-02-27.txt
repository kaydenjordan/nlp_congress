 Mr. Speaker, for the last 2 years, the Biden  administration has consistently waged a war on American energy and our  fuel sources.   This unscientific, ideologically driven assault has crippled American  energy and hurt American families and our economy greatly. The American  economy and our way of life are dependent on reasonable, reliable, and  easy access to energy.   He has gone so far as to even deplete our Strategic Petroleum  Reserve--as you see here, these numbers going down dramatically--in  order to cover over this bad policy and make everybody think it is  going to be okay.   Americans rely on access to low-cost, efficient energy from sources  like natural gas to heat their homes, cook their meals, and keep their  lights on. It is neither feasible nor desirable for most Americans to  abruptly switch to green alternatives, such as wind and solar power,  and have to change all of their appliances and yard tools out simply  because of the whims of government and having too much time on their  hands.   Many can't afford to do these changes, nor should they have to. The  unreliability of green energy makes it a much less preferable  alternative. Faced with a choice between these two, most Americans make  the sensible decision to stick with low-cost, reliable natural gas over  expensive, unreliable green energy.   In my home State of California, the electricity power grid in the  summertime at any time could go down, yet they are trying to force  people into electrifying just about everything--their cars, their  stoves, their yard tools, even generators. Think about this for a  minute. How do you have an electric generator when the power goes off  from your electricity?                                time  1230    I guess this is supposed to mean we have a warehouse of batteries  somewhere because, otherwise, I don't know how you do it.   Generators are supposed to be a backup plan. Frequently, hospitals  have diesel generators. People have generators they own for camping as  well as backup for their homes. But they just keep going on and on,  making up regulations.   So faced with these choices, Americans would rather have their own  choices. This administration has essentially tried to ban and regulate  Americans off of fossil fuels, off of nuclear power, it seems, until  recently when California--hallelujah--decided to expand the Diablo  Canyon Power Plant an additional 5 years, which is 9 percent of the  power grid of California--9 percent. Imagine if they took that offline  like they were hell-bent on doing.   Keeping natural gas is part of the equation. We have so much natural  gas reserved in this Nation now because of the miracle of hydraulic  fracturing. It is amazing what that has caused for us.   Radical environmentalists, though, can't take no for an answer. They  have done away with trying to argue for their ideas and simply use  government fiat, a stroke of a pen, to try and take these things away,  including the latest proposal by the Department of Energy to ban gas  stoves, which has got everybody all in a twitter right now.   Is that what we really need to be focused on right now with the  situation with the railroad in Ohio and whatever the mess is we are  going to make out of Ukraine, our border, and so many other issues?   No, let's keep people distracted with this gas stove situation here.   So what we have is a proposal by the Department of Energy to do it by  the stroke of a pen, by just making a regulation to ban the sale of  stoves that don't meet what is called an EL2 standard. They are just  going to block the sales of these stoves, which means about half of  them that are currently on the market will no longer be available on  the market. People will have less choices that may not fit their style  of kitchen, the size of their family. It may not fit a restaurant. It  may not fit what you need for a kitchen that helps aid people that are  short of food, soup kitchens. They want to take all these options away  simply by a stroke of a pen.   People are getting furious over this stuff. And for families that  enjoy the use of that gas stove, they work nice. I have one. I saw  First Lady Jill Biden, a picture of her cooking on one in the White  House.   So where does the hypocrisy end on all this?   Evidently, it doesn't end at the White House. It ends at the choices  that humans have in this country.   We need to block this EL2 regulation that the Department of Energy is  putting out, yet another thing that is trying to distract us I think  from other issues. It is an important one for people to have natural  gas stoves and  [[Page H883]]  other appliances that are available to them.   And so I sum up on that with the ideal being that the only reason we  are really doing all this stuff, ostensibly, is because of  CO2. You see right here, carbon dioxide represents 0.04  percent of our atmosphere, okay.   People think from all the hype over CO2: Oh my gosh,  climate change, climate change. It is a religion being pounded away in  our schools and in our society, in ESG, and these corporations all day  long. It is only 0.04 percent of our atmosphere.   So they would have us all live in caves eating crickets because of  0.01 percent and take away our stoves on top of that right now.   We have to fight back on the DOE regulation.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, many Americans have raised concerns over  the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines.   We were told these shots were safe and effective. Now, we have  information that raises serious doubts.   One pharmaceutical company asked that its research and safety data be  hidden from the public for 75 years. What is to hide if these shots are  safe and effective?   The Twitter files have shown that pharma companies and government  agencies encouraged that social media giant to censor that information  that raised doubts over the shots.   The vaccine information report that lists the potential side effects  of the shot has been censored and left blank. This is what comes with  the vials--censored, intentionally left blank. Amazing.   One company's representative even admitted they had no idea if their  injections even worked before introducing them to the market. Several  of these shots have already been pulled from the market, and others  have had warning labels attached for young children and pregnant women,  who were pushed into taking these injections.   Americans deserve the truth. Given the number of deaths from COVID-19  among vaccinated people, it is very questionable and worth asking these  questions. Are they effective? The next question is, are they even  safe?                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I might be an oddity here. Why is a guy  from California standing here tonight?   First of all, as a friend to my great Texas colleagues and neighbors,  so to speak.   Congratulations to the State of Texas, the people of Texas, on their  anniversary, and also all that goes with that independence, that spirit  that I admire of the people of Texas and its long, great history.   I think we need a lot more of that across the whole country, because  you can always, I think, trust a Texan to stand up for this country.   So as a Californian, we used to have a lot of that same spirit, as  pioneers of the West, going back to the gold rush, and we have, indeed,  a lot of great things to point toward in my home State. But we are on  harder times, self-inflicted.   I think the spirit of patriotism, of America first that is exhibited  by Texans, is indeed one the whole country can use.   It was interesting when we were talking about annexation a little bit  earlier here, where Texas might look like it might take over the world  sometimes. I wouldn't doubt it; it is possible. But in my home State of  California, there is kind of a mass exodus from my State to others,  escaping the cost of living, the regulations, some of the other crazy  things that are going on in my home State. Indeed, the recipient of a  lot of those good folks that are leaving is the State of Texas. So I am  not sure if California is trying to annex Texas or if Texas is annexing  California a little bit here. But I hope at least it is to the benefit  of Texas as we try and sort through our issues and getting back on  track, such as growing so much of the Nation's food supply that comes  from my State and conserving the water to do so. But I am getting off  on a tangent here.   Indeed, there is much to admire. Every chance I get to be in the  State, it feels like an extension of home to me. I come from a very  rural part of northern California, and we listen to a lot of the same  music and eat similar food and farm and ranch maybe in a similar way.   So hats off, literally, to the people of Texas. The only thing I  can't get along with, as a 49ers fan, is the Dallas Cowboys. That is  about the only thing, but we will leave that aside.   I am indeed glad to stand here with you tonight and wish the best and  a happy anniversary of Texas independence.   Please keep leading the way. You are going to lead our Nation through  difficult times with your spirit.   God bless Texas.
