 Mr. President, yesterday many parts of my home State of  Iowa were hit by extreme winds and severe storms--90-mile-an-hour  winds, probably along the path along Interstate 80 from the Missouri  River to the Mississippi River. Trees are uprooted, roadways are  obstructed, crops are severely damaged, grain bins are busted,  outbuildings lost, some homes hurt, and over 400,000 households lost  power.   Just like any other natural disaster Iowa has experienced, I know  that Iowans are going to band together and support each other as we  recover from this storm. Senator Ernst and I stand ready to help with  any Federal assistance Iowa may need, and I hope that you will not  hesitate to contact our respective offices--both in Washington, DC, and  in Iowa--if you need us.   For sure, if Governor Reynolds declares this as a disaster area,  Senator Ernst and I will be quick to advise the President to follow the  recommendations and requests of Governor Reynolds.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
