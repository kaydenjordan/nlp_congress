 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the unspeakable  suffering of the Rohingya people. We must do all we can to shine a  spotlight on their plight. Last night, the PBS NewsHour presented an  hour-long documentary about the brutal campaign against the Rohingyas  led by the Burmese military. At times it became intolerable to continue  watching footage of young men being beaten, listening to the accounts  of young girls and women being raped and killed, and seeing human  remains shoved into mass graves.   The facts are well known. Since August last year, nearly 700,000  Rohingya Muslims have fled the violence in Myanmar to neighboring  Bangladesh, where they are being housed in deplorable conditions and  face an uncertain future. Some of the conversation lately has focused  on returning the Rohingya Muslims to Burma, resettling them to a remote  island or some third country. However, I believe the most pressing  conversation today must be for the Burmese military and civilian  government led by Aung San Suu Kyi to confront the issue head-on.   The Burmese leadership must acknowledge ethnic cleansing and acts of  genocide that have been inflicted on the Rohingya people. As recently  as March, a senior Burmese official reportedly made a series of  comments designed to deny or downplay any violence and atrocities  against the Rohingya Muslims, saying the vast majority remain in Burma,  and ``if it was genocide, they would all be driven out.''   He went on to declare that the Burmese Government ``would like to  have clear evidence'' of ethnic cleansing and genocide. That clear  evidence already exists. Even as Burma has denied international  investigators the ability to enter the country to gather evidence of  such crimes, the United Nations' factfinding mission found ``concrete  and overwhelming'' evidence of ``human rights violations of the most  serious kind, in all likelihood amounting to crimes under international  law.''   The investigative team found widespread and systematic ``State-led  violence'' and had ``numerous accounts of children and babies who were  killed, boys arrested, and girls raped.''   Various rationales have been suggested for the failures of the  Burmese Government to acknowledge and act upon atrocities against  Rohingya Muslims. It is said that Aung San Suu Kyi does not control the  military and there is a danger that the military would use the present  crisis as a way to dismantle the civilian government. It is said that  the civilian government is working within a deep traditional bias  against the Rohingyas, and some see them as illegal immigrants from  Bangladesh.   Others have suggested that pressure on the civilian government could  lead to Burma moving closer to the Chinese. Still others point out that  talks about the Rohingyas returning to Burma must be afforded time to  work out, and the process has only begun.   None of this--none of this--can undermine for a moment the realities  of the persecution of the Rohingyas. The PBS documentary ``Myanmar's  Killing Fields'' left no doubt about the extent and nature of the  atrocities perpetrated against the Rohingyas. As a U.N. official has  stated, it is ``a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.'' Until the  Burmese civilian government and military openly acknowledge their role  in these atrocities, protection and justice for the Rohingya Muslims  will remain out of reach.   There is an overriding need for the Burmese Government and the world  to step up to the plight of the Rohingyas. Senator John McCain and  Senator Dick Durbin introduced, on September 7, 2017, a resolution  clearly addressing the plight of the Rohingyas. I introduced the same  resolution 7 days later.   Subsequent events have darkened still further the plight of the  Rohingyas since then. While the basic message in the resolutions  remains the same, it would be wise to update them and then that this  entire issue be fully and directly addressed by the Congress.   Bishop Desmond Tutu once said: ``If you are neutral in situations of  injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.''   The documentary on ``Frontline'' last night made it painfully clear  that this Congress must not accept neutrality or any shade of it. We  must stand tall on the side of justice.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 58 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, May 10, 2018, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
