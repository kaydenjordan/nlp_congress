 Madam President, I know we have all been talking about  what is going to happen in the next 2 days, and it is very significant,  the things that have to take place.   But I want to remind some people out there that it doesn't mean that  everything else stops. We have a couple of issues that are major issues  but not to really large numbers of people. But they are issues that are  meaningful--very meaningful--to a few, and it happens that there has  been progress in both of these.   Now, one of them is an issue that has to do with Western Sahara. And  I know that a lot of people are not really familiar with that or what  the issue is, but it is an old issue. It has been around since 1966. It  is a very significant issue. It is one that you have heard me talk  about for quite some time, but we have made some great progress.   First of all, it bears repeating because--they are called the  Sahrawis. The Sahrawis are the people from Western Sahara, and they are  kind of a voiceless people. That is why I am here--because nobody else  is here on that.   So how we got here: As West Africa was being decolonized, Western  Sahara was clear and declared an independent nation, despite Morocco  attempting to claim it as a territory.   In 1966, the U.N. General Assembly resolution agreed that the  referendum of self-determination should be held. That is the U.N.  General Assembly. There was no disagreement at that time except from  Morocco. Everyone was in agreement. In fact, at that time, Morocco was  even in agreement. This is 1966. And we were going to have a  determination in the form of a referendum that would be taking place in  1975. So it was 1966, planning for 1975.   Self-determination is just merely letting the Sahrawi people decide  for themselves the imperative principle of action, the right to judge  for themselves to be independent or to be a part of Morocco. Now, this  was just the first promise of a referendum. To date, none has been  kept.   The International Court of Justice opinion from 1975 also agreed that  Morocco did not have any sovereignty over the land and that the  referendum of self-determination should be held. So you have the  International Court of  [[Page S6091]]  Justice agreeing with this, the U.N. General Assembly--all in  agreement.   Morocco maintained its unlawful claim to Western Sahara and, after  decolonization, attempted to annex the country with force. Western  Sahara--officially the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic--through the  Polisario, defended their rights to the land.   And after more than a decade of violence from Morocco, the United  Nations finally intervened in 1991, and both sides agreed to a cease- fire and a path forward. That was 1991. It was called at that time the  Settlement Plan. It solidified that Morocco and Western Sahara agreed  to hold a referendum and a date for that referendum and created the  United Nations Mission for the Referendum to solidify this.   If you are keeping track, that was the third promise. And it is worth  noting that the U.N. regularly reaffirms the 1991 commitment to a  referendum for self-determination.   Now, self-determination is something that people assume there is not  opposition to. Self-determination is something that is very meaningful  to us and our history in this country, and this is something that at  that time was accepted.   I can remember talking several times in previous administrations,  going back to the Reagan administration, and people were, at that time,  knowing that this was going to happen but just didn't know for sure how  it was going to happen or when it was going to happen. And here it is  now decades later, and it hasn't happened yet.   The referendum for 1992 never took place, and the process  stalled. The process stalled, although the cease-fire held. Morocco  just wouldn't hold up its end of the bargain.    Former Secretary of State James Baker--I remember when the previous  administration came in, James Baker had read someplace that I was  concerned about this issue. This old issue had never been resolved, and  he called me up, and he said: Well, I want you to know that I spent a  lot of years with three different Presidents trying to get this done.  We were unable to do it, but let me work with you.   This is one of these rare things where everyone agrees.   So, anyway, they had a special envoy to Western Sahara. Baker worked  on multiple plans with Morocco and Western Sahara and came close many  times, but it never happened.   Most notable is the Houston agreement was signed by Morocco and  Western Sahara and recommitted to a referendum of self-determination  plan for 1998. That would have been the fourth time. Morocco recognized  they would likely lose a vote quickly and tanked all negotiations. The  next year, by declaration, they would never accept a referendum that  included independence as an outcome despite years of promise otherwise.   The conflict stalled then, leaving us in what is called a frozen  conflict for more than two decades. At the end of last year--November,  to be precise--Morocco tried to violently crush a peaceful protest in  the Gujarat area. The Western Saharans were peacefully protesting  Morocco's direct violation of the United Nations' cease-fire agreement  by using the road in this direction.   The international community did nothing. Then truly the worst thing  happened. There was a change in policy of the United States that had  been a policy for some three decades where they actually were  recognizing Morocco's sovereignty. That decision was wrong. It reversed  decades of U.S. policy. But the policy held until 1966. It was a  shocking announcement and deeply disturbing to all who valued  individual rights and self-determination.   That is why earlier this year Senator Leahy and I led 25 of our  colleagues in a bipartisan letter to President Biden urging him to  reverse the harmful policy and to recommit to a policy of self- determination. This is something that I know that he recognizes. I  actually personally talked to him about this in his first week in  office. It hasn't been done yet, and it should be done. Many of our  colleagues and I are not alone in our push for Western Sahara to have  the right for self-determination. So does the African Union, which is  comprised of 55 member states. We have most of the European community  who supports the U.N. efforts on our side. The European Court of  Justice also ruled that Western Sahara is not a part of Morocco, and  the EU and the economic agreements can cover Western Sahara.   So, anyway, this has happened over and over again for a long period  of time. Just fairly recently, Sultana Khaya had a CNN--I am actually  going to wind this up with an agreement with my friend from Maryland-- this is the statement that she made. She said:         Morocco's repression of the Sahrawi people, and Sahrawi       human rights defenders in particular, is well documented. The       Sahrawis have struggled under Moroccan occupation since 1975,       and this repression will continue until the occupation is       ended. And while the United Nations Security Council supports       giving the people of Western Sahara the chance to determine       their own future through a referendum, Morocco has refused to       allow the referendum to take place, depriving us of the       chance . . . [for] self-determination.    She concluded by saying:         I cannot find the words to describe the endless suffering       that I personally, and the Sahrawi people more generally,       have endured under this violent occupation.    They are resolute, and we should be too   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                         [From CNN, July 29, 2021]  I've Been Raped, Beaten and Held Under House Arrest for Fighting for My                               Sahrawi People                   (Opinion by Sultana Sidibrahim Khaya)         Earlier this month, the Biden administration reaffirmed the       United States' recognition of Morocco's sovereignty over       Western Sahara, a disputed region on the northwest coast of       Africa. The United Nations calls Western Sahara a ``non-self-      governing territory''; I call it home. My home is under       occupation and my people, the Sahrawis, are under attack, and       the US position on Western Sahara legitimizes this occupation       and will be used as license for further attacks. I know this       because I have lived it.        As an outspoken advocate for self-determination in Western       Sahara, I have long been a target for the occupying Moroccan       government. I have been beaten, tortured, and abducted by       Moroccan police while engaged in peaceful protests; after a       particularly violent assault in 2007, I lost my right eye.        Because I refuse to be silenced, Morocco stepped up its       efforts against me late last year. On November 19, while       driving to my home in Boujdour, I was stopped at a police and       military checkpoint. The authorities forced me into a police       car and took me to a nearby police station, where I was       interrogated, sexually assaulted, and told to go home and not       to speak to anyone. I arrived home soon thereafter to find it       surrounded by 21 police vehicles and numerous officers, who       physically pushed me into the house. I have been forcibly       confined to the house ever since. My de facto house arrest,       which is now in its ninth month, has absolutely no legal       basis--I have never been shown a court order authorizing my       detention or informed of any criminal charges against me.        The Moroccan government has told Amnesty International that       I'm not under house arrest and denied a statement by the UN       Special Rapporteur on the situation of Human Rights Defenders       that included details of the assaults, saying that the       rapporteur's statement ``interferes with the ongoing debates       in the framework of the 47th Session of the Human Rights       Council'' and ``do not fit at all with the framework of       dialogue and mutual respect'' it expected at the UN.       Meanwhile, the occupying Moroccan forces appear determined to       not just detain me unlawfully, but to harass, torture, and       perhaps even kill me.        Moroccan police, military, and other security agents       maintain a constant presence outside the house and prevent       anyone from leaving or coming in, even to bring food. They       cut the electricity in mid-April. Police throw a toxic,       foulsmelling liquid into the house on a near-daily basis,       making it difficult to breathe. They frequently (and       explicitly) threaten to kill me.        Moroccan authorities have also repeatedly raided the home       and brutally assaulted me, my sister. my brother, and my       mother. In May, during one such raid, Moroccan agents raped       my sister and I--in a barbaric message, they penetrated my       sister using the broomstick that we use to wave the Western       Sahara flag. Despite all this, I continue to wave the Western       Sahara flag from my rooftop every day--an act of resistance       that may end up costing me my life.        Unfortunately, my story is just one of many. Morocco's       repression of the Sahrawi people, and Sahrawi human rights       defenders in particular, is well documented. The Sahrawis       have struggled under Moroccan occupation since 1975, and as       recently as July 1, the State Department reiterated that       there is no change in the administration's policy. The Biden       administration has claimed that human rights are central to       its foreign policy--this is difficult to believe while it       sides with Morocco in its occupation of Western Sahara and       its repression of the Sahrawi people.        Second, as part of its reengagement with the United Nations       Human Rights Council, the US should press forcefully for a       referendum on self-determination in Western  [[Page S6092]]       Sahara. The U.N. General Assembly reaffirmed the right to       self-determination of the people of Western Sahara as far       back as 1966, when it was still referred to as ``Spanish       Sahara,'' and the U.N. Security Council unanimously       established a mission to coordinate a referendum on self-      determination for the people of Western Sahara in 1991.        The US, for its part, has consistently voted in favor of       Security Council resolutions seeking a referendum on self-      determination. Since President Biden has advocated for a       return to a rule-based international order, the US should       take the lead to ensure that the long-promised referendum is       finally held and the results are honored.        And third, the U.S. should make the protection of human       rights in occupied Western Sahara and self-determination for       the Sahrawi people key issues in its bilateral relationship       with Morocco. For example, the readout from a recent call       between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Moroccan       Foreign Minister Nasser Bourita shows that while Blinken       encouraged Morocco to reaffirm its commitment to human       rights, the readout omitted any mention of Western Sahara or       the right of its people to self-determination.        For any productive change to occur, Morocco needs to know       that its powerful allies care about both.        I cannot find the words to describe the endless suffering       that I personally, and the Sahrawi people more generally,       have endured under this violent occupation, But we remain       strong, our will unshaken, and we will persevere with our       peaceful resistance.     With this, I would like to offer my friend, since he has  been waiting for a long period of time, to use the remainder of my time  if he will then yield the floor to me at the conclusion.    I thank my friend. We worked on a lot of bills-- infrastructure--together since we were both elected the same year many  years ago and we accomplished a lot together.   What I want to do is complete my remarks that I began a few minutes  ago.   Before I do, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that during the  course of the remarks I made concerning Western Sahara, that the speech  that was made by Sultana Khaya, that was published in CNN, be printed  in the Record during the course of my presentation                                    Ligado    Madam President, let me repeat what I said in the beginning of my  previous remarks, and that is we are all talking about the same thing  right now. We are now getting down to the last--conceivably, the last  two votes that we are going to be having, so all of the concentration  has been on those.   But I want to mention two of the other issues that were made very  popular issues and they are making great progress right now. Let me go  ahead and do that for a short while, and that is to provide an update  on the Ligado issue--the Ligado issue.   Friday was inauguration day of a thing called the Space Beat Memo. It  is a new weekly newsletter from POLITICO designed to focus on space and  satellites. This is their inaugural, first-ever newsletter with a great  rundown on--they chose the Ligado issue.   Just to remind everyone what we are talking about--Ligado, L-I-G-A-D- O--the Ligado Order was a spectrum sale approved back in April of 2020,  that would let Ligado use the L-band or the spectrum--that is the  spectrum close to the GPS for commercial use.   Why is that a problem?   It is a problem because Ligado's signals are about 2 billion times as  powerful as GPS signals, so they would cause interference, according to  all unbiased sources, to the GPS.   Here is one way to put the interference into perspective: Because GPS  signals travel from satellites in space, by the time those signals get  to the Earth's surface, they are low power. Because the FCC order  allowed Ligado to repurpose spectrum to operate in a terrestrial-based  network, Ligado signals on Earth's surface will be much more powerful  than GPS, causing substantial harm and interference.   Now, we know that basically everyone in government opposes this. We  talked about this now since the last time--just June 23, down here on  the floor. Shortly after the Ligado Order was announced in April of  2020, the NTIA filed a petition to reconsider--basically, a petition  asking them to reconsider their decision again, given the negative  impact it would have. This was signed on behalf of some 15 governmental  Agencies.   The NTIA is the National Telecommunications Information  Administration. They are an Agency within the Department of Commerce  that serves as the President's primary adviser on telecom policies.   As I announced on June 23, I recently received a letter from  Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo confirming that--and I'm quoting  now--``there has been no change to the Department of Commerce's or  NTIA's opposition to the FCC's Ligado Order.''   That is a direct quote. That is the new administration. We know the  last administration believed the same thing, and this administration is  following on this cause. It is a very significant one.   She also pledged that NTIA will continue to pursue the petition for  reconsideration. The petition represents the Departments of Commerce,  Defense, Interior, Justice, Homeland Security, Energy, Transportation,  NASA, FAA,  [[Page S6094]]  and more. This is primarily the entire government. This is huge.   It showed, once again, that there is a bipartisan opposition to the  Ligado Order that is continuing into the Biden administration.   But that is not all I am doing. I am also introducing the RETAIN GPS  Act, which would ensure Federal Agencies, State governments, and all  others negatively impacted--all that were negatively impacted by  Ligado's activities--by the actions of a private actor are not left  holding the bag when the costs start coming in and, worse, are not put  in a position where they have to push the costs onto the American  consumers.   The House has introduced legislation as well, led by Representatives  Cooper, Mike Turner, Frank Lucas, and others. It is just common sense  and only fair.   As David Grossman, the Executive Director of GPS Innovation Alliance,  said to POLITICO:         The RETAIN Act--    Talking about the act that I have introduced--       is just extending those protections that the FCC recognized       were critical for Federal Agency GPS systems on the civil       side.    In other words, if we are going to protect government, protect  individuals, too, if it is done through the negative operations of  Ligado.   The GPS Innovation Alliance is just 1 of more than 100 we are talking  about. This is a large number of people, companies, and industry groups  who support my RETAIN GPS Act.   Why is it so popular?   Because GPS is essential to everything we do. You know, people  thought--when this thing first came on, they were just concerned about  the air industry, the airlines, and others; but these are some of the  day-to-day things. I don't really have to read this, but I think it is  important that people know it is important to others and themselves.    I don't know anyone who isn't really concerned about GPS and its  safety and working ability. A big one is using your credit or debit  card. Every time you use a credit or debit card, when you are making a  purchase or using an ATM, our financial systems rely on GPS timing to  work.   Another: Making a phone call. Cell phone networks rely on GPS to  synchronize cell towers so calls can be passed seamlessly. If they  experience interference, your call can drop when moving from tower to  tower.   Here is one people don't expect, and that is energy, whether that is  filling up your tank at the pump or managing electrical grids to light  our homes. We rely on GPS timing to safely operate underground  pipelines and our electricity grid.   Farmers and ranchers, we don't think about them as being involved in  this. But in this day and age, when they are planting crops, when they  are applying fertilizer, and during harvest operations, moving large  and critical machinery with precision, they depend on GPS working to do  it.   Working out. All these healthy people doing what they are supposed to  be doing--and I am not doing--and that is running and keeping in good  health. Twenty percent of them use a fitness tracker or smartwatch, the  majority of which use GPS to count steps and track distances.   Taking a flight. Commercial and civil aviation relies on GPS to  navigate safely.   Just driving around. Each day, countless Americans rely on Google  Maps, Waze, Apple Maps, and other navigation systems to get them from  point A to point B.   And while no one hopes that there could be any kind of a problem in  terms of a fire, an ambulance, or an injury--the 9/11 operators and EMS  used GPS and satellite communications to locate a caller and navigate  as quickly as possible. We had a group coming in, documenting cases of  lives that have been saved.   And there is more: Weather forecasting, the movement of goods on our  highways, and the rest. It goes on and on.   That is why everyone agrees we need to protect GPS usage from being  damaged by the Ligado Order.   Who is on the other side?   Just Ligado and the people who they pay to support them. That is a  whole lot of lobbying firms. The POLITICO article highlighted that they  are staffing up their lobbying and public relations:         So far this year the Virginia company has enlisted a       powerful roster of lobbying firms . . . currently numbering       some 15.    And on the side of GPS and satellite communications are Members of  the House and the Senate, 15 Federal Agencies, over 100 companies and  organizations. The other, Ligado, is really just a lobbying group.   I will just leave with one reminder. We know that the Ligado Order  will damage GPS. The FCC said as much when they approved the order. The  FCC said:         Ligado shall expeditiously repair or replace as needed any       U.S. Government GPS devices that experience or are likely to       experience harmful interference from Ligado's operations.    But if Ligado believes that their press states that they won't cause  interference to GPS, then why should they be afraid of my RETAIN Act?   While they ponder that, I yield the floor.
