 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I  thank him for his very special efforts for this reauthorization.   Perhaps our entire committee and subcommittee are due some self- congratulations for reaching a bipartisan agreement for a long-term  reauthorization for the FAA, but the lion's share of the appreciation  belongs to Chairman Shuster. I thank the chairman for his leadership,  especially as he is retiring from the House, and I am grateful for the  considerable efforts of Ranking Member DeFazio.   Mr. Chair, there was only one major disagreement, and that was, of  course, on privatization of air traffic control operations.   This bill includes many areas that demonstrate the importance of  bipartisanship. It is almost impossible to help Democrats and not  Republicans, and vice versa, when it comes to matters affecting  aviation.   I appreciate my own amendments in the bill addressing airplane noise,  many of them embedded in the bill. And I am sure, given the complaints  throughout the country, that my noise provisions, too, are bipartisan.   Mr. Chair, I ask that the House oppose the Cuellar amendment. This is  a special destinations amendment for San Diego and San Antonio mainly  to benefit the House Members from those districts so they can fly into  Reagan National Airport nonstop rather than Dulles, which is nearby,  and Baltimore-Washington, which is also very close to the District of  Columbia.                                time  1315    The Congress has spent billions of dollars to expand Dulles, which is  still very underutilized because it is a little further from D.C. than  Reagan.    The limit on slots to Reagan helps relieve enormous  congestion there and ensures safety of one of the Nation's most crowded  and critical airfields.
