 Mr. Speaker, May marks National Foster Care Month, a time  for our country to come together to acknowledge the half million people  in our child welfare system.   No one knows the child welfare system like the foster youth who have  grown up in the system, and no one can raise their voices like foster  youth voices.   Today, the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth and the National  Foster Youth Institute have brought together more than 100 young people  from every corner of the country here, to Washington, D.C., to shadow  their Members of Congress.   The young people here today have traveled thousands of miles to share  their stories, their challenges with abuse, trafficking,  overmedication, or homelessness, but in addition, to share their  successes with education accomplishments, mentorship, adoption, family  unification, and community activism.   With me here today, from Los Angeles, is Megan Simon. She is 24 years  old, and she was placed in foster care when she was only 1 year old.  She was raised by her grandparents, and she has two other siblings who  were involved in the system. She is actively involved in the National  Foster Youth Institute Leadership Corps, where she attends meetings  every Thursday night. She is an advocate and someone who wants to use  her pain and her experience to make changes in the child welfare  system.   She is a student at Los Angeles Trade Tech College, and she says that  she is a leader, she is a survivor, and she is a winner, not because  she wins every battle, but because she never stops fighting.   Mr. Speaker, too often the government--us--forgets our children. I  hope that today's Shadow Day continues our fight to reverse that  course.                            ____________________
