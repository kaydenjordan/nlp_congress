 Madam President, first, I want to thank my colleague  from Massachusetts for her very important comments about a very  important, well-qualified nominee.                         Oxford High School Shooting    Madam President, today I rise to speak about a heartbreaking tragedy  that far too many American families and communities are familiar with.  Americans have learned that gun violence can happen in any place, at  any time, in any State, and in any town.   This time, the community is Oxford, MI, home to about 20,000 people  in northwest Oakland County. It is a place with beautiful lakes and  bike trails. It is a place where people know each other. It is the kind  of place where the neighbors might drop off some Christmas cookies or  clear your sidewalk after a snowstorm since they were doing theirs  anyway. Now, it is the kind of place that has been needlessly,  senselessly shattered by unspeakable violence.   It was a typical Tuesday at Oxford High School, home of the Wildcats.  The Oxford band and orchestra had recently  [[Page S8894]]  returned from a trip of a lifetime, performing at Disney World. Student  leaders were celebrating a successful Thanksgiving food drive--almost  5,500 cans of food collected for the local food pantry. Athletes in  winter sports were getting ready for Meet the Teams Night. But in an  instant, everything changed. Everything changed.   We are still learning the details, and, frankly, that is not what is  important. What is important is that, thanks to the cold efficiency of  modern weaponry, it took mere minutes for a gunman to shatter a  community. Thankfully, law enforcement officers showed up within  minutes, but still, 11 people were shot. Tragically, four students have  died. We hope and pray that there are not more deaths, but several  other Oxford students remain in the hospital in critical condition. A  typical Tuesday in a typical high school in 2021 in America.   Madisyn Baldwin was a 17-year-old with a beautiful smile. According  to her grandmother, she was a kind and patient big sister and an  artist. She had already been accepted to a number of colleges.   Justin Shilling, also 17, was cocaptain of the school's bowling team  and also loved to golf. He worked at Anita's Kitchen, a Lebanese cafe  in nearby Lake Orion, where his boss said everyone loved him.   Tate Myre, aged 16 and a tight end and running back on the Oxford  football team, had recently been honored by the Michigan High School  Football Coaches Association. He was also an honor student who was  known as a leader both on the field and in the classroom.   And Hana St. Juliana was just 14 years old. She was passionate about  volleyball and basketball. Her teammates say they will never forget her  kind heart and her silly personality and her passion for the game. They  have dedicated their upcoming season in her memory.   Madisyn, Justin, Tate, and Hana--four lives that were just beginning,  four losses that have left their families and their community  struggling--struggling--to understand.   And we certainly know that Oxford is not alone. This year alone,  there have been shootings at 29 schools in our country--29 schools-- from Rigby Middle School in Rigby, ID, to Timberview High School in  Arlington, TX, to Heritage High School in Newport News, VA. No  community is immune. Just ask the grieving residents and the grieving  parents of Oxford.   This community will come together. They already have. They will hold  prayer vigils and deliver casseroles and wrap their arms around these  shattered families. But, in God's name, why should they have to?   High school students should be sharing memories of last month's band  trip or celebrating a successful food drive or looking forward to the  spotlight of Meet the Teams Night. They shouldn't be ducking for cover  in their classrooms or fighting for their lives in the ICU because they  just happened to be in the wrong hallway at the wrong time, and they  certainly shouldn't have their names mentioned during a speech on the  floor of the U.S. Senate after yet another school shooting in 2021 in  America.   Madisyn, Justin, Tate, Hana, and the more than 100 Americans who are  killed by gun violence every day deserve more than thoughts and  prayers. They deserve action to keep them safe, and we certainly will  focus on this in the days ahead. What I know for sure right now is that  we must refuse to settle for a world in which a typical Tuesday turns  into such tragedy.   My deepest, heartfelt sympathies to everyone in Oxford and throughout  our State. I share in their grieving of this senseless, senseless  tragedy.   I yield the floor to my partner and colleague in the U.S. Senate,  Senator Peters.    Mr. President, I have 5 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
