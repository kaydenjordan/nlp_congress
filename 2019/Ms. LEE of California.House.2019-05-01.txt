 Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for yielding,  for his tremendous leadership on this and so many issues.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 9, the Climate Action  Now Act. This piece of legislation is an extremely important first step  in protecting our environment--major first step--and we have to move  forward and do even more.   H.R. 9 ensures that the United States remains in the Paris Agreement  and prohibits Federal funding to exit the agreement. It is critical  that the United States takes the lead on addressing climate change on  the world's stage.   Let me be clear. The Trump Administration is plugging their ears and  pretending that climate change doesn't exist.   America was once a global leader in fighting climate change. It was  our leadership that led so many nations to commit to climate action.  Yet this administration has abandoned plans to address climate change  and, instead, has weakened our leadership in the world. It is really  shameful, and this needs to stop.   Climate change is an urgent matter. It creates more flooding and  superstorms, threatening the safety of millions of Americans and people  around the world.   People around our country and throughout the world are breathing in  polluted and unhealthy air. Here in our own country, communities of  color and low-income communities also, disproportionately, are impacted  by the effects of climate change and have a lack of access to adequate  healthcare services on top of that.   We owe it to our children and future generations to do more for the  environment. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 9 and ``yes''  on fighting climate change.
