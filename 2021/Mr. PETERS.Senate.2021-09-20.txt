 Mr. President, I rise today to honor an  accomplished and highly regarded leader of Michigan's philanthropic  community, Mariam C. Noland, president of the Community Foundation for  Southeast Michigan.   Ms. Noland, a resident of Grosse Pointe Farms, MI, has made an  immeasurable impact on southeast Michigan, our State, and the entire  country during the past 36 years. It is my privilege to recognize her  here today and celebrate her upcoming retirement.   Mariam Noland earned her bachelor of science from Case Western  Reserve University in 1969, followed by her master of education from  Harvard University. During her time at Harvard, Ms. Noland worked on a  research project through the Pittsburgh Foundation, another community  foundation. This was her first experience in the foundation field, a  field in which she would spend almost her entire distinguished career.   In 1975, Ms. Noland began working as an education policy fellow,  secretary, and treasurer at the Cleveland Foundation. It was there, she  states, that she truly learned the power of community foundations and  the power of change. Six years later, she became vice president of the  Saint Paul Foundation of Saint Paul, Minnesota.   In 1984, Joseph L. Hudson, Jr., and other civic leaders started the  Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan with a mission to enhance  the quality of life for residents of Wayne, Oakland, Macomb, Monroe,  Washtenaw, St. Clair, and Livingston Counties. This group of  visionaries hired Mariam Noland in 1985 as the foundation's first  president, a role in which she has remained to this day.   As a result of Ms. Noland's steadfast leadership and tireless  devotion, the Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan has grown  over the last four decades into one of the 30 largest community  foundations in the country. The organization has awarded more than $1.2  billion in grants, benefiting countless nonprofits and the individuals  and families they serve. This past year alone, during the challenging  COVID-19 pandemic, the Community Foundation provided over $101 million  in grants, its largest annual grant total to date.   Ms. Noland has personally raised hundreds of millions of dollars and  has initiated many new and innovative programs. Some of the highlights  from her career include the GreenWays Initiative that has built  interconnected trails throughout southeast Michigan, as well the New  Economy Initiative, the Nation's largest multi-foundation funded  collaborative addressing economic development and opportunity.  Additionally, Ms. Noland was also essential to the creation and  development of the HOPE Fund, which is one of the largest and most  effective funds in the Nation at a community foundation addressing  needs of the LGBTQ+ community.   Ms. Noland, a creative and effective problem-solver, is also known  for the historic role she played during Detroit's bankruptcy. She  influenced 14 foundations to collectively donate more than $366  million, which, when combined with $350 million in State funds and $100  million raised by the Detroit Institute of Arts, provided $816 million  to help protect pensions for city workers while at the same time  safeguarding the cultural pieces of the art museum.   Ms. Noland's contributions go well beyond her impressive work at the  Community Foundation. She generously gives her time and expertise as a  member of the boards of trustees for the Detroit Riverfront  Conservancy, the Downtown Detroit Partnership, and the Bipartisan  Policy Center in Washington, DC. She also previously served as vice  chair of the Henry Ford Health System Board of Directors, as well as  chair of the Council of Michigan Foundations Board of Trustees.   Ms. Noland's incredible work has been recognized with numerous  prestigious awards and honors. In 2009, she received the Eleanor  Josaitis Unsung Hero Award. That same year, the Community Foundation  established its own Mariam C. Noland Award in her honor to recognize a  local nonprofit leader who exemplifies leadership in his or her  organization and the broader nonprofit community.   I cannot understate the impact Mariam C. Noland has had on the people  of Michigan. She has created influential philanthropic initiatives,  promoted positive changes in our communities, and enhanced the lives of  countless Michiganders. She leaves a community foundation that now  holds more than $1.1 billion in ``community capital'' that will benefit  future southeast Michigan residents for decades to come. Moreover, she  has created a model for charitable giving and foundation management  that is unmatched.   Though her leadership at the Community Foundation for Southeast  Michigan will be sorely missed upon her retirement, her legacy will  most certainly endure.  [[Page S6550]]    For these reasons, I am grateful for this opportunity to recognize  her accomplishments and to extend our collective gratitude on behalf of  all who have--and who will--benefit from her efforts.                            ____________________
