 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman, the number one  second baseman on the team.   The bill you are about to vote on is the gravy train, and the final  stop before it goes off the cliff is this Chamber, Mr. Speaker. It  costs $1.9 trillion, and only 9 percent goes to addressing the  coronavirus.   It is easy to understand why my colleagues across the aisle are so  eager to vote for this massive bailout, because everything in it is for  political paybacks: $300 billion for mismanaged governments in blue  States; $100 million for a subway for Speaker Pelosi; even Mr. Schumer  gets a bridge to nowhere.   There is way too much dadgum pork in here for special interests that  have nothing to do with addressing the coronavirus. This was drafted  for the politicians in D.C., not my constituents in east Tennessee.   Mr. Speaker, I will proudly vote ``no'' on this so-called relief  package.
