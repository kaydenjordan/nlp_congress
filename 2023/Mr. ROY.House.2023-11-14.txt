 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the amendment that I am offering here prohibits  any of the funds in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill from being used  to carry out President Biden's executive orders on climate change.   Now, I have been offering this amendment to each of the  appropriations bills. They have happily been accepted for virtually all  of them, either by voice vote or on a roll call vote, and I think it is  because particularly colleagues on my side of the aisle understand the  absurdity of the President's orders and its impact on the American  citizens, who are struggling to be able to make ends meet, be able to  afford their cars, be able to afford their energy.   In this instance, these executive orders were responsible for the  creation of the Office of Climate Change and Health Equity within HHS.  When we are sitting here with $2 trillion deficits each year and $34  trillion of debt, and we have created an Office of Climate Change and  Health Equity within HHS, it just tells you the absurdity of this  administration.   In September of 2021, I sent a letter in opposition to the creation  of this office highlighting how absurd it is, and among its  responsibilities were ``regulatory efforts to reduce greenhouse gas  emissions and criteria air pollution throughout the health sector,  including participating suppliers and providers.''   The vast majority of emissions in the healthcare sector stem from the  hospital electricity consumption. It seems to follow that where this  office would focus its regulatory efforts would be on that.   Does this administration want to make hospitals dependent on  intermittent wind and solar for their energy? Will it ban the backup  generators they depend on which run on diesel and natural gas? On a  windless, cloudy day, you still need to have a hospital function. That  is the whole point.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to dismiss the  whole notion of having reliable energy. Meanwhile, China has 1,100  coal-fired plants. America only has 250. China is building two coal- fired plants a week. We are building none. We are building no nuclear  power, which would actually be reliable power so that we could actually  have zero-emission reliable power, but FERC, the regulators, and my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to stand in the way of  that.   Here we are wanting wind and solar to be the unicorn power of the  future, in which we can just live with hospitals not being able to  function. That is the whole point. We are more concerned about ``health  equity'' in an Office of Climate Change than ensuring that people don't  die because hospitals don't have the power that they need.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the gentlewoman and a number of my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle raise issues about the fact that we are  using appropriations bills to address some of these issues.   First of all, my constituents and most Americans I know of care how  taxpayer dollars are used. They want these dollars to be used  efficiently and effectively, particularly when we are running $2  trillion deficits. They don't want us to fund things like health equity  offices, when, in fact, we are bleeding money out of every pore of our  body, and we have got a diminishment of our debt.   We have Moody's last week saying, oh, wait, we are going to just  reduce America's debt rating. We have got the Treasury unable to carry  out an auction last week because our debt is so high that people are  starting to question investing in American debt.   Why? Because we are irresponsibly spending money we don't have for  utter nonsense and garbage. That is what the American people see every  single day, why are you spending money on these absurd things, these  absurd programs? That is the truth. The American people are sick of it.   How about we actually authorize something, by the way, instead of  just doing stuff in appropriations? We haven't even authorized DHS  since we created it 20 years ago. It is absolutely absurd.                                time  0000    I can't even tell you the last time we authorized HHS. It is not even  clear-cut because there are so many programs in HHS.   The reality here is that we have programs the American people don't  want us to continue to fund. We are trying to put forward commonsense  ways to strip down and focus on the actual bare necessities of what the  American people need us to fund. That is the point. That is what we are  trying to accomplish.   Look, I have to say something. I appreciate in the underlying bill  that we defund the ESG rule and requirements.   Let me remind you, it is the President's executive orders and the  Department of Labor that allow ESG to creep into Americans' 401(k)'s,  which is undermining performance and undermining the ability of the  American people to earn a return on their investments because of all of  these ridiculous ESG requirements.   Meanwhile, we are making people suffer. The head of the Department of  Transportation, the Secretary of Transportation, literally was on  record this year saying the American people need to feel pain. I have  gotten the same answer from every Democratic colleague, that they want  the American people to suffer so they can push forward this radical,  nonsensical agenda.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment to stop it,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
