 Mr. Speaker, I agree with almost everything the Speaker  just had to say, and I may repeat some of it. What I do not agree with,  however, Mr. Speaker, is that we didn't notice. I noticed. My staff has  noticed. My staff has not only noticed, but appreciated the  extraordinary work that Lydia has done for this House--yes, for your  office, yes, for the Republican side of the aisle, but for this House  and for the American people.   Lydia and I have a great relationship, but probably more importantly,  she has a great relationship with Shuwanza Goff, who runs the floor on  our side of the aisle.   What a privilege it is to rise and say to Lydia, thank you--not as a  Democrat, not as a Republican, but as an American who appreciates the  role that you have played, Lydia, in making a difference. I always say  that, when the House runs well, it is the staff's work. When it doesn't  do so well, it is the Members' responsibility and fault. So you have  been absolutely terrific.   And Jeff and Graham and Evie, I join with Speaker Ryan in saying that  your mom is a great American, a wonderful human being. You know that  personally. You see it every day in your own lives. But for the past 9  years, Lydia has been a presence on this floor first in the Republican  Cloakroom as an assistant, later as a staffer with the Rules Committee,  and then, as the Speaker just pointed out, deputy floor director for  the Republican side of the aisle.   They are the majority party, so Lydia's responsibility really is  institutional--not partisan, but institutional--and she has performed  that in the best traditions of the best of this House.   It is a testament to Lydia's skill and professionalism that she has  earned the respect not only of her own colleagues on the Republican  side, but also those who work on my staff and the Democratic leader's  staff on this side of the aisle. That is why, Lydia, I said we have  noticed, we have appreciated it.   In many ways, Mr. Speaker, public service is a family affair for  Lydia Strunk. She grew up around it when her father worked in the  George H.W. Bush White House handling legislative affairs. Her dad is a  good friend of mine, so perhaps I am not objective. I am also the  father of three daughters, so perhaps I am not objective.   Nick Calio is one of the great people with whom I have served through  the years. I think he is here in the gallery somewhere with his wife.   Thank you, Nick, for your service, and thank you for being such a  wonderful example for your daughter. She has brought that same kind of  cooperative, collegial, inclusive spirit to her work that you brought  to yours not only working in the public sector, but also in the private  sector.   Let me end. She grew up in a great State: Maryland. Again, perhaps  making me more subjective than I otherwise would be.   After she began as a Cloakroom assistant, she met and later married  Jeff Strunk, who then worked on Speaker John Boehner's floor staff,  also very effectively and productively. And when Jeff left Capitol Hill  in 2013, Lydia was promoted to take his place, a somewhat incestuous  operation, but it worked extraordinarily well, Mr. Speaker.   I am grateful. We ought to all be grateful. The American people ought  to be grateful for her efforts, her know-how, and the dedication she  brings to the task of ensuring that our work, Americans' work, the  American people's work here on this floor and on behalf of all of us  can continue smoothly each day.   Lydia, thank you. We wish you the very best. We know that whatever  you do, you will be extraordinarily successful in doing, and that you  will be perceived by your colleagues and by those with whom you work in  the same very positive and very appreciative way that we view you  today. Godspeed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in support of this  legislation.   I want to thank Mr. Frelinghuysen, Mrs. Lowey, and all the  subcommittee chairs and ranking members for the work that they have  done to get us to this place.   This vote we are about to take represents an example of how Members  of this House can work together to reach a reasonable compromise and  deliver a product that reflects both rationality and reasonableness. It  is clear from recent history that Democratic Members' participation is  absolutely essential if we are going to pass fiscal bills and  appropriations bills. I am glad that the Republican leadership and  negotiators came to that conclusion and worked with us to advance this  omnibus to the floor.   I will support this omnibus funding bill. It is not a perfect bill,  but no bill is a perfect bill. It is, however, a compromise that  includes provisions that Democrats and Republicans want to see passed.    It does not include poison pill riders that would prevent Democratic  support or, frankly, Republican support. It does not fund President  Trump's border wall which, of course, he had promised the American  people they would not pay for.   Furthermore, it includes critical funding for health benefits for  America's coal miners and their families, and it funds Puerto Rico's  Medicaid program.   This omnibus also adds additional funding for the National Institutes  of  [[Page H3294]]  Health, something that all of us ought to support, including former  Vice President Biden's Cancer Moonshot, as well as Pell grants,  disaster relief, international famine aid, and funding to fight opioid  addiction.   It is the product of frank and thorough negotiations conducted by  Ranking Member Nita Lowey and Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, both of  whom are positive leaders of the Appropriations Committee and of this  House. I congratulate them and their staffs for their hard work to  reach this funding agreement.   The Congress should not have waited this long to act, Mr. Speaker. It  is now 7 months into the fiscal year. We should not allow this to  happen again. It has happened too often, and it has happened under both  parties, but it is not the way to run the greatest enterprise on Earth:  the Federal Government of the United States of America.   We must get back to dealing with appropriations bills in a timely and  discrete manner, appropriations bill by appropriations bill. It is  important that we segue from these successful negotiations into talks  in the same spirit of compromise to pass appropriations bills through  regular order for fiscal year 2018 before the end of September. We are  very late in doing this process.   I was very much alarmed by President Trump's tweet yesterday  suggesting that he would welcome a government shutdown. It is this kind  of flippant, uninformed, and irresponsible approach, as opposed to what  ought to be a serious, bipartisan process, that puts us again and again  at the eleventh hour, often months past the original deadline, trying  to keep the government open.   We ought to do better. We must do better. I hope the bipartisan  process that brought us to this omnibus bill will show us that we can  do better.   In that context, I want to again thank Mr. Frelinghuysen, with whom I  have served for a long period of time both on the committee and as a  colleague in the House of Representatives. I want to thank Mrs. Lowey,  with whom I served for 23 years on the Appropriations Committee and  with whom I have served in my capacity as leader and herself as a  leader on the Appropriations Committee.   This represents, today, what the Congress ought to be, how it ought  to work, and what the American people expect. As we vote today on this  bill, let us say to ourselves: let us continue this kind of  cooperative, positive, constructive work.    Mr. Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the  majority leader the schedule for tomorrow, and I yield to the gentleman  from California (Mr. McCarthy).   Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House will vote on H.R. 1644,  our North Korean sanctions bill. I do believe it is important that the  House speak with one voice against the recent actions of the Kim  regime.   Next, as I said in our colloquy on Friday, additional legislative  items are possible. As soon as any items are added to our schedule, I  will be sure to notify Members. However, Members should be prepared to  be here and voting tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I would hope the majority leader might give  us some idea. Obviously, everybody in this town and around the country  believes the possible legislation that might come forward is a version  of, revision of, the American Health Care Act that has been pending for  some time not necessarily on the House floor, but in this House.   Can the gentleman tell me whether or not Members ought to prepare for  a debate on that bill tomorrow? And if so, does the gentleman know  whether there will be a CBO score on the bill that might be brought to  the floor, and thirdly, the timing for tomorrow so that Members might  plan on what the schedule would be?   I yield to my friend.   Mr. McCARTHY. I thank my friend for yielding. I appreciate his  questions.   As has been reported in the press, we have made significant progress  on our healthcare bill. When we are ready to bring the bill to the  floor, I will make an announcement and relay scheduling information to  all Members.    I asked a question, though, you did not address. If, in  fact, the healthcare bill were brought to the floor tomorrow, would it  have a score from the Congressional Budget Office?   I yield to my friend.   Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.   As the gentleman clearly knows, there is a CBO score out there right  now on the bill. As the gentleman knows, we are making progress; and as  soon as we designate that, yes, we will move the bill, and I will  notify the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I presume, therefore, Members ought to be  prepared for that bill to come forward, and what we hear, we don't  know, is in a revised form.   Mr. Speaker, we hope, if it comes forward in a revised form, that it  is accompanied with a Congressional Budget Office score so that Members  on both sides of the aisle might know the ramifications of the changes  in the bill.   Unless the gentleman wants to say anything further, I will yield  back, but I hope that we can get as much notice and information as  possible, Mr. Leader.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
