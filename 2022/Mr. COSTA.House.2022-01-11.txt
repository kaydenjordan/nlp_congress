 Madam Speaker, I rise to discuss the surge in the  coronavirus cases that Americans are struggling with. Part of that is  the access to COVID tests. Many are waiting in long lines to get PCR  tests and 2 to 3 days to receive their results. We should and can do  better.   Households cannot find rapid tests in stores and wait weeks in line  for online orders.   In Fresno County, which I represent, the demand for testing has  increased 30 percent in the last several weeks.   We must expand testing. I call on the administration to prioritize  our testing systems. Access to testing and timely results are critical  to determine if someone is infected with COVID-19 and enables them to  take steps to avoid spreading it to others. It is that simple.   It is vital that every American has access to the rapid test at no  cost. It is critical for our economic recovery.   At this stage, no one should have to wait long hours or pay a single  dime for same-day results. We can and we should do better.   We are not out of the woods yet. We can end this pandemic through  robust testing and getting vaccinated. That is what we must do.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend and colleague Eric  Swalwell, Rodney Davis, and Jerry McNerney. I think we are all here to  celebrate a life well-lived.   Coach John Madden had such an extraordinary career in so many  different areas that I think reflected, with all of that fame and all  of that success, a common touch, a common touch that we honor today.   I don't think there is anything difficult about being a Raider fan  from California and being a 49er fan because the Raiders played in the  AFC and the 49ers played in NFC. I think we have had a good run here  for many decades because of those two incredible franchises. The same  could be said for the San Francisco Giants and the Oakland A's.   But as a kid, John Madden was a hero of mine. He actually started in  a very humble way playing at Cal Poly. Cal Poly's program was a smaller  collegiate program in those days.   Sadly, there was a plane crash in 1961 that took place. Madden was  able to avoid that disaster. I think that probably brought about his  fear of flying for the rest of his life. But he never forgot Cal Poly,  and he continued to support the university as he supported so many  worthwhile causes, whether it was athletics in Pleasanton and East Bay  or whether it was other important efforts.   As my friend noted, I don't know whether his record will ever be  topped, with 103 victories, 32 losses, and 7 ties, a regular-season  record, and the youngest coach to win a Super Bowl.   What a lot of people don't realize, Madam Speaker, unless you are  from California, is the San Joaquin Valley that I have the honor and  privilege to represent has always had a large group of Raider Nation  fans there. Tom Flores, who was born in Fresno and raised in Sanger,  the first Hispanic quarterback in the NFL, was succeeded by Daryle  Lamonica, who was at Clovis and was a quarterback for the Raiders.    I think the Raiders have something that they really focus on, and  they want their quarterbacks from the valley because Derek Carr is a  Fresno State guy and, of course, had that great victory Sunday. We hope  that continues through the post-season.   I was talking to Coach Flores, who was just inducted into the Hall of  Fame--long overdue. Coach Flores was a valley guy. After he quit, after  he retired as quarterback, he came back to the Raiders and coached as  an assistant coach with Tom Flores. He talks about what kind of  atmosphere Coach Madden had in the Raiders organization, and the  players loved him. He said that when you have assistant coaches, you  have rivalries, and you have coaches who want to then move on to become  their own head coach. But he said that Madden had a great way. They  would sometimes argue a difference on a game plan, but Coach Flores  said that, in his opinion, Coach Madden, over the years and decades  that he played in the NFL and coached, was a great game-day coach. In  other words, the players not only trusted and had faith in him, but  when they developed the plan to go out on that field on that Sunday  afternoon, as the dynamics were changing and shifting, Madden's focus  on the ability to be flexible and to make those adjustments were a  large degree of his success as a head coach.   From one Hall of Fame head coach to another Hall of Fame head coach,  I think that is an incredible compliment, and it reflects both on Coach  Tom Flores and Coach John Madden.   I would be remiss if I didn't talk about the person who I think a lot  of people know today, and that is Coach Madden, the man with a common  touch. In his multitude of successes, he got involved in valley  agriculture and got to know a number of my good friends in Merced in  the area where he farmed grapes and almonds. Dan Fiahlo and a lot of  the folks there used to love to get together with Coach Madden as well  as with Dominic Mercurio from Cafe Fina on Fisherman's Wharf in  Monterey.   What did these gentlemen all have in common?   First of all, Coach Madden would be a guy you would be attracted to  because of his larger-than-life personality. But they loved the common  touch. They loved the ability to grow things that people could consume,  whether it be almonds or whether it be grapes, and the appreciation of  the hard work it took to put that food on America's dinner table every  night. So the love of food, for people who understood Coach Madden, was  really part and parcel with his friends.   There was a card game for 27 years that Dominic Mercurio and Dan  Fiahlo and others participated in, a legendary card game apparently  that one could only hope to be a part of. Of course, both Danny and  Dominic loved to cook and were great barbecue extraordinaires, and  Coach Madden would hang out at Cafe Fina where he first got to know  Dominic for his legendary chowder, which developed into a regular  fixture, so when Coach Madden was inducted in 2006, he asked  restaurateur Dominic Mercurio of Cafe Fina, Danny Fiahlo, and their  team if these folks would come back to do the barbecue. You have  thousands of people for the Hall of Fame induction in August, but  Madden had his plan, and they fed over 500 people.   And Coach Madden says: Look, we are going to do it this way.   He is giving instructions.   Everybody who comes, whatever they are going to eat, there is going  to be a multitude of foods. There has to be enough for everybody,  whether you want chicken, whether you want brisket, sausages, whatever.   What they did was, after they fed everybody, they had an abundance of  food left over that they gave to the charities, to the churches.   But that is what Coach Madden did in all the things that he was a  part of. If there was stuff left over, you give it back to other people  who need it most.   I think that there are a lot of reasons why we honor Coach Madden  here today and his incredible, celebrated career, but the common touch,  the fact that whether he was in Los Banos, California, or in the upper  crust, one might say, of Carmel-by-the-Sea, he was still the same  person. He was Coach John Madden, whom you would love to have breakfast  or lunch with, talk about football, talk about other things that were  important, important to communities and neighborhoods, as he related to  you as a Representative.   I am honored today to celebrate the life of an American who made a  difference, who made a difference in so many different ways. He touched  so many people in so many different ways because he knew people, and he  liked people. That was evident in terms of any capacity that you ever  came across John Madden with.   We celebrate that larger-than-life legend today. We see him as a role  model who impacted people throughout California and throughout not only  the professional football league and other professional sports but his  understanding of collegiate sports because he came from that. His  understanding that and making changes and protecting collegiate  athletics was something that John Madden knew well.   I thank Congressmember Eric Swalwell for allowing me to give my own  thoughts about a person whom I will remember.   I can only close by saying one thing: Coach Madden, God bless you,  and thank you for all you have done. Go Raiders.
