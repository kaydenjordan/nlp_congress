 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division D (before the short title) insert       the following new section:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available in this division       may be used--        (1) to implement or enforce section 430.32(x) of title 10,       Code of Federal Regulations; or        (2) to implement or enforce the standards established by       the tables contained in section 325(i)(1)(B) of the Energy       Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6295(i)(1)(B)) with       respect to BPAR incandescent reflector lamps, BR incandescent       reflector lamps, and ER incandescent reflector lamps.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Burgess) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to  prevent the distortion of the free market by the Federal Government.   Since its passage in 2007 of the Energy Independence and Security  Act, I have heard from virtually tens of thousands of constituents  about the language in that act and how it will take away consumer  choice when constituents are deciding which lightbulbs they will use in  their homes. Mr. Chairman, they are right.   Mr. Chairman, in the interest of time, I want to point out this exact  amendment has been accepted for the past 6 years by the House. Three of  those years it was accepted by voice vote. It was included in the  annual appropriations legislation signed into law by President Obama  every year since its first inclusion in 2011, and has been a priority  of the Republican Conference since its adoption into law. It allows  consumers to continue to have a choice and to have a say about what  type of lightbulb they will put into their homes. Congress should fight  to preserve the free market. It is common sense.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will disagree on the economics that were  just presented. But apart from the economics of the lightbulb mandate,  that is, in fact, only part of the story.   With the extreme expansion of Federal powers undertaken in the last  administration, when the Democrats were in charge of Congress for 4  years, Americans have just now begun to see how far the Constitution's  Commerce Clause has been manipulated from its original intent. The  lightbulb mandate is a perfect example of this manipulation.   The Commerce Clause was intended by our Founding Fathers to be a  limitation on Federal authority, not a catchall in order to allow for  any topic to be regulated by Washington. Indeed, it is clear that the  Founding Fathers never intended for this clause to be used to allow the  Federal Government to regulate and pass mandates on consumer products  that do not pose a risk to either human health or safety.   Mr. Chairman, in December of 2007, when this bill was first passed,  the columnist George Will observed on television one Sunday morning  that it is the job of the Federal Government to defend the borders and  deliver the mail. But instead of keeping up with those two tasks, we  instead decided to ban the incandescent bulb. It was wrong in 2007. It  is wrong in 2017.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).   The amendment was agreed to.                  Amendment No. 62 Offered by Mrs. Blackburn    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 62  printed in House Report 115-259.
