 Madam President, I come to the floor today to support  the funding bill for the defense of our Nation. This funding package  provides a well-earned, well-deserved pay raise for our troops--the men  and women in uniform, the men and women I had the privilege of visiting  earlier this month, part of the Wyoming National Guard deployments in  multiple places around the world.   Yet Democrats have blocked a key vote. They did it last month. I want  to make sure they don't do it again. It seems they are doing it for  purely political reasons. It is a partisan blockade of our Nation's  troops' pay raise. It is hard to believe they are doing it, but they  did it, and it seems they want to do it again.   Both parties agreed to support our military, and they support our  military families as well. They made that promise 3 months ago. Then  they went back on the promise. It was part of that bipartisan budget  deal that was signed in August.   By moving this defense funding measure, Republicans are keeping our  promises; the Democrats are breaking theirs. Now it is time once again  to vote. It is time for Democrats to stop blocking the bill. It is time  to stop playing politics, especially with our troops' paychecks.   We need to pass this bill to fully fund the Defense Department. It  honors our commitment to our troops. It delivers critical resources our  military needs to keep us safe, to keep us strong, to keep us  prosperous. The bill protects America's standing among our allies and  our adversaries.   We need to get this done. It also funds Health and Human Services.  That is what we are looking at as well. It includes our Nation's  medical research.   It is time for the Democrats to get to yes. It is time to keep our  promises to the military; it is time to honor our commitment to our  troops; and it is time to get on with the business of our Nation. It is  time to pass the bill.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
