 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of Mr. Joseph Martin Rose, Sr., Moka'ang Giizis or ``Rising Sun'' in  the Ojibwe language, a beloved elder and member of the Eagle Clan of  the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Ojibwe. As a member of the Three  Fires Midewiwin Grand Medicine Lodge, Joe was a teacher, culture  keeper, pipe carrier, and treasure to his community. His life was one  of far too many claimed by the COVID-19 pandemic.   Joe was born on April 24, 1935, to Carl Rose, Sr., and Mary ``Dolly''  (Jackson) Rose in Oklahoma. When his father volunteered to repair naval  ships in Alaska during World War II, his mother brought the family back  home to Odanah to live with her parents on the Bad River Native  American Reservation. Joe often told stories about growing up in  Odanah, calling it a ``time of kerosene lamps, outhouses, and wood  heat.'' He credited his grandfather, Dan Jackson, with instilling in  him a strong connection to the natural world by teaching him about  traditional plants, ceremonies, and medicines. He spent his youth  netting fish in the spring, wild ricing in late summer, duck hunting in  the fall, then ice skating and enjoying bonfires in the winter.   He attended DePadua High School in Ashland, where he played nose  tackle on the football team, wrestled, and sang in the school choir.  His athleticism earned him a scholarship to Northland College, where he  majored in biology and secondary education, earning a certification to  teach high school science and math. After graduation, he spent the next  10 years teaching in South Dakota and Wyoming, while coaching youth  sports. With the help of his parents, he raised two children, taught  full time, and earned a master's degree in guidance counseling before  returning to Bad River in 1970.   Back in Wisconsin, he became the homeschool coordinator and guidance  counselor at Ashland High School. As an advocate for Bad River  children, he taught them Native American arts and crafts and offered  courses about culture. In 1974, he was asked to develop the newly  formed Native American Studies Program at Northland College, one of the  first such programs in America. As its director, he created a culture- based curriculum that emphasized environmental stewardship and the  connection Ojibwe people have with Lake Superior.   Joe's experiential learning courses were memorable for the visits to  his home on Waverly Beach, birch bark canoes, ceremonial lodges, and a  round house built by his students. He helped create the Traditional  Ways Gathering, an annual event celebrating Ojibwe crafts such as  beading, basket making, and flintknapping. He formed a relationship  with the recently dedicated David R. Obey Northern Great Lakes Visitor  Center in Ashland and curated its exhibits on Lake Superior tribal  history and culture.   As a staunch defender of Native American treaty rights, Joe and his  son, Joe Dan, were among Lake Superior Ojibwe who exercised their  rights to spearfish lakes in the ceded territory. They did so in the  face of sometimes violent demonstrations in opposition to those rights.  He later served on the Voigt Intertribal Task Force, which facilitates  the cooperative management of shared natural resources in ceded  territory.   Joe retired as an associate professor in 2007, although he continued  to teach and serve in leadership roles until the end of his life. Even  after retirement, Joe continued his activism against environmental  threats facing Lake Superior, including nuclear waste, oil exploration,  garbageincineration, factory farming, and taconite mining in the  Penokee Hills. His most recent fight was against the Enbridge Line 5  oil pipeline that crosses the Bad River reservation, one of his primary  issues of concern as a member of the Ashland County Board. One way or  another, Joe was a part of virtually every significant environmental  and treaty-rights struggle in the region over the past half century.   While soft-spoken, Joe had a voice that proved powerful and deeply  resonant. He believed that he had the responsibility to ``go out and  share this knowledge and wisdom of how to live in harmony and balance  with the natural world.'' With this ethos and an indomitable faith in  grassroots organizing, he never turned down an opportunity fight the  good fight and share his knowledge with others. The countless people  who were fortunate enough to know and learn from Joe Rose, Sr., will  keep his memory alive and continue his good work for generations to  come.                            ____________________
