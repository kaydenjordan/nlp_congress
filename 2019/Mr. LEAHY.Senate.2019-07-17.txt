 Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority leader  and the distinguished Democratic leader--both very close friends of  mine whom I have served with for so long. And my dear, dear friend  Senator Shelby from Alabama.   It is the friendships that mean the most, both to me and to my wife  Marcelle. It is the friends we gather on both sides of the aisle and  the people I have traveled with around the world.   One of my proud achievements was the War Victims Fund, but it was  Senator Mitch McConnell who had it renamed the ``Patrick J. Leahy War  Victims Fund.'' I know that Senator Schumer helped guide me into  committee assignments that made the most sense for Vermont and for my  own career and, I hope, for the Senate.   My first vote was for the Church Committee. Frank Church wanted  oversight of our intelligence agencies, and the Intelligence Committee  came out of that. The two leaders of the Intelligence Committee now-- Senator Burr and Senator Warner--do such a great job with that.   As I was looking at the paper today, I thought of the first Supreme  Court Justice I voted for, John Paul Stevens, a wonderful man. I have  voted on each member of the Supreme Court since then.   Going back through the 16,000 votes, I am sure I could find some and  think, what the heck was I thinking when I voted that way?   But I am proud to serve Vermont. I am proud to be in this body. I am  mostly proud to serve with all the Senators who are here on both sides  of the aisle. Some of my closest friendships are here.   I have served with three wonderful Senators from Vermont. Senator  Robert Stafford, who is no longer with us, was the senior Senator from  Vermont when I came here. He was Mr. Republican in our State, and I  wondered how he was going to react to this youngster, this Democrat  coming in. He and his wife Ellen took Marcelle and me under their wing  and helped us on everything. He taught me how best to form coalitions  across the aisle. I will never forget that.   I am not going to hold up my colleagues here. I will speak more about  this at another time.   But I was the first Vermonter to vote to end the war in Vietnam,  which we ended by a one-vote margin at that time in the Armed Services  Committee. There were other votes that were very close. There were  bipartisan votes.   It is a privilege to be in this body. This body has been at times,  and can be and should be, the conscience of the Nation. I urge my  friends on both sides of the aisle to continue to work together. We  have worked together on trips that many of us have taken. I will close  with mentioning just one trip to give you an idea of that.   Senator Hubert Humphrey and Republican Leader Hugh Scott were going  to go to Moscow. He said: Patrick, you and Marcelle are going to come  to Moscow.   I was 34 years old. I had just gotten through a campaign that nobody  had contributed to. We were flat broke.   I blurted out: What is the airfare to Moscow?   He said: No, we are going to take Jerry's plane.   I said: Jerry who?   He said: Jerry Ford. He is the President. Don't you read the papers?   We had an equal number of Republicans and Democrats on that trip, and  we formed lifelong friendships and learned how to work together. I urge  Senators to continue doing that. And it was better than flying  commercial.   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank my  colleagues.   (Applause.)                            ____________________
