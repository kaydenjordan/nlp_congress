 Mr. President, a lot of praise has flowed in for Judge  Kavanaugh since his nomination, but I think the tribute that has struck  me the most is the letter from his law clerks. These individuals have  worked closely with Judge Kavanaugh and have a special insight into his  temperament and philosophy. Here is what they have to say:         It is in his role as a judge on the D.C. Circuit that we       know Judge Kavanaugh best. During his time on the D.C.       Circuit, Judge Kavanaugh has come to work every day dedicated       to engaging in the hard work of judging.        We never once saw him take a shortcut, treat a case as       unimportant, or search for an easy answer. Instead, in each       case, large or small, he masters every detail, and rereads       every precedent. He listens carefully to the views of his       colleagues and clerks, even--indeed, especially--when they       differ from his own. He drafts opinions painstakingly,       writing and rewriting until he is satisfied each opinion is       clear and well-reasoned, and can be understood not only by       lawyers but by the parties and the public.        We saw time and time again that this work ethic flows from       a fundamental humility. Judge Kavanaugh never assumes he       knows the answers in advance and never takes for granted that       his view of the law will prevail.    Those are the words of 34 of Judge Kavanaugh's law clerks. Every one  of Judge Kavanaugh's clerks who was not prohibited by his or her job  signed this letter.   These clerks represent a diverse group. They wrote:         Our views on politics, on many of the important legal       issues faced by the Supreme Court, and on judicial       philosophy, are diverse. Our ranks include Republicans,       Democrats, and Independents. But we are united in this: Our       admiration and fondness for Judge Kavanaugh run deep. For       each of us . . . it was a tremendous stroke of luck to work       for and be mentored by a person of his strength of character,       generosity of spirit,  [[Page S5244]]       intellectual capacity, and unwavering care for his family,       friends, colleagues, and us, his law clerks.    This letter is a pretty significant tribute, and it confirms what has  been clear from the beginning, and that is that Judge Kavanaugh is the  type of judge who should sit on the Nation's highest Court. His clerks  describe a judge who takes the weight of his responsibility seriously;  a judge who is committed to reaching the right decision in every case  and who does the hard work necessary to get to that decision; a judge  who approaches each case with an open mind, looking for what the law  says, not the outcome he wants.   As Chief Justice John Roberts famously said, ``Judges are like  umpires.'' Their job is to call the balls and strikes, not rewrite the  rules of the game. As Justice Roberts said, ``Umpires don't make the  rules; they apply them.'' It is essential that a judge understand this.  If you are a judge, your job is to rule based on the law and the  Constitution and nothing else. Your job is not to make policy. It is  not to revise the law according to your personal feelings or your  political principles. Your job is to figure out what the law says and  to rule accordingly.   Why is this so important? Well, it is because the rule of law and  equal justice under the law only exist as long as judges rule based on  the law. Once judges start ruling based on their political opinions or  their feelings about what they would like the law to be, then we will  have replaced the rule of law with the rule of individual judges.   As the testimony of his clerks and many others makes clear, Judge  Kavanaugh understands the role of a judge. He understands that his job  is to interpret the law, not make the law; to rule based on the plain  text of the statute, not his personal opinions or political beliefs.   In a 2017 speech at Notre Dame Law School, Judge Kavanaugh said:         I believe very deeply in those visions of the rule of law       as a law of rules, and of the judge as umpire. By that, I       mean a neutral, impartial judiciary that decides cases based       on settled principles without regard to policy preferences or       political allegiances or which party is on which side of a       particular case.    I will say it again: That is the kind of Justice we want on the  Supreme Court. I hope this Senate will take very seriously the  responsibility we have to give fair consideration to this nominee.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
