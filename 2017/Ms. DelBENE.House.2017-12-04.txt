 Mr. Speaker, over the past few weeks Republicans have  been cutting backroom deals that benefit the wealthy and well-connected  out of the light of day, piling hurt onto people who won't be able to  speak for themselves.    Now we are on the verge of being force-fed a bill in which  corporations  [[Page H9608]]  get massive tax cuts while hardworking Americans are forced to pick up  the tab. Over the life of the Ryan-McConnell plan, 36 million middle  class families struggling to pay for healthcare, education, childcare,  housing, and retirement are going to see their taxes go up. Now  millions may lose healthcare coverage as well.   What happened to fiscal responsibility?   Economists are telling us that the increased debt won't be paid for  by economic growth, and CEOs are openly sharing their plans to reward  their shareholders with their new tax breaks--not create jobs.   This bill is reckless, and I urge my colleagues to support this  motion.
