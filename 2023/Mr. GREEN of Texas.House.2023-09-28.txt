 Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose amendment 51 to the  Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  Appropriations Act, 2024, which would prohibit funds in this  legislation from being used to aid the country of Pakistan. This  amendment is misguided and counterproductive.   I traveled to Pakistan in September 2022 to assess in person the  devastating flooding caused by record monsoon rains and melted glaciers  in the region. More than 1,000 individuals had lost their lives to the  flooding at that point, and approximately one third of Pakistan  remained underwater. Pakistan produces less than one percent of global  greenhouse gas emissions, yet it is at greater risk of ecological  catastrophes from climate change. The World Bank estimated that the  economic costs of the damage totaled over $30 billion. Therefore, the  international community should assist Pakistan in recovering from this  natural disaster that was massive in scale. I am grateful for the  relief funds that the U.S. has provided Pakistan, and I firmly oppose  what amounts to a blanket prohibition on further relief, as this would  include much needed humanitarian relief.   Blocking these funds will not only hurt Pakistan and prolong its  recovery from the 2022 floods, but also give China the opportunity to  provide much needed aid where American global leadership is lacking. We  cannot abandon Pakistan in this time of crisis, and I urge My  colleagues to oppose this amendment.
