 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity. In  following my colleague, Ms. Bush, with an example of how we are fine- tuning the apprenticeship program, one of the secrets in this country,  best-kept secrets, in terms of a path to middle-class wage,  empowerment, and key to our ability to rebuild and renew America.   President Biden hit the ground running. He has been working on a  number of areas. And none of his promises is more important than  rebuilding and renewing America. We need to have a workforce that  enables us to get this job done.   I have seen these programs work in my State and national training  programs around the country.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement from James Hoffa,  the general president of the Teamsters, who points out that this is an  investment of over $1.6 billion in private capital annually. The  programs have long been considered the gold standard for workforce  development in the construction trades. They provide a debt-free ladder  of opportunity. Apprentices earn wages from the first day, develop  demand skills, and portable credentials.                                        International Brotherhood                                                   of Teamsters,                                   Washington, DC. February 1, 2021.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: The International Brotherhood of       Teamsters supports H.R. 447, the National Apprenticeship Act       of 2021 which the House is expected to consider this week. We       urge you to support H.R. 447 which reauthorizes the       Registered Apprenticeship Program.        The Registered Apprenticeship Program (RAP) reauthorized by       this bill has been the most successful workforce development       initiative. For decades, the most highly skilled and       productive construction craft workers have been trained       through RAPs. These privately funded training centers and       programs are jointly administered by construction contractors       and building trades educators. With an investment of over       $1.6 billion in private capital annually, these programs have       long been considered the gold standard for workforce       development in the construction trades. Often affiliated with       unions, RAPS Apprentices provide a debt free ladder of       opportunity. Apprentices earn wages from the first day,       develop in demand skills, and portable credentials. The       National Apprenticeship Act protects a vital (and       progressive) wage scale for the next generation for       individual apprentices, and contractors through greater       productivity and safety.        The bill expands RAPs into new occupations and sectors.       And, for the first time, there will be concrete standards       associated with pre-apprenticeship programs which have grown       significantly over the last several years. These standards       will provide protections from unscrupulous contractors to       ensure a clear and defined pathway into RAPs. These programs       are important to opening doors for greater participation and       diversity in both programs.        RAPs are a pathway to the middle class with over 90 percent       of individuals completing a RAP employed upon completion and       earning an average wage of $70,000 annually. Again, the       Teamsters Union urges you to support H.R. 447, the National       Apprenticeship Program of 2021.            Sincerely,                                                    James P. Hoffa,                                                 General President.    Mr. Speaker, this is what it is about, being able to  take qualified young people, give them skills, let them earn money  through the apprenticeship programs, not a mountain of debt. And time  after time we have seen examples after just a couple of years they  graduate into wages that enable them to support their family.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to work with my colleagues in strengthening  these programs. I have seen the training centers for the carpenters,  and IBEW, these are the gold standards that ought to provide an  inspiration for everybody in terms of how we provide this path to the  middle class, how we strengthen ability to deliver on our promises to  rebuild and renew America, and have the opportunity for them to earn  money while they are doing it.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support this proposal.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy  as I appreciate his words.   This is a step in a long process. There are ample opportunities for  bipartisanship. I am hopeful that after years of talking about  infrastructure, for instance, and having Lucy pull the football away-- President Trump said he would like to do it, but we were incapable of  moving forward even though there was a broad consensus, actually, on  both sides of the aisle--I think President Biden is prepared to roll up  his sleeves and do that with us. And the contrast between what we saw  with President Biden opening up, talking to Republicans, leveling with  the American people; and yet, at the beginning a year ago, we had  documented evidence that Trump refused to acknowledge the urgency of  the coronavirus.   He soft-pedaled it along with a bumbling result where tens of  thousands of people have died--maybe hundreds of thousands of people-- who didn't need to die. We have seen it in other countries.   We are moving forward and I look forward to having opportunities with  our Republican friends to join us. The reconciliation process is one  step forward.   I can't help contrasting it with how we have seen Republicans use  reconciliation. I was on the Ways and Means Committee while they were  literally writing the bill as we were meeting late into the morning,  changing it as it went on. They didn't know what was in it. And that  produced almost $2 trillion worth of deficit from people who are now  fiscally conservative.    The contrast is stunning. We are going into meetings with the Ways  and Means Committee during the day next week, not 1 day, not 2 days. We  are prepared to be there 3 days or on into the weekend.   But I wanted to just take a moment to talk about one area of  bipartisan cooperation that really lifts my spirits. I have been  working for a year to try and rescue America's independent restaurants,  the people who have been hit hardest by the coronavirus of any  employment group. 500,000 restaurants--there are 11 million employees-- have suffered more than any other area.   I am pleased that the Senate, last night, by a 90-10 vote approved  the framework of our restaurants bill, providing space in the  reconciliation process, 90-10. And I am pleased that the restaurants  bill that we have reintroduced that last session had over 200  cosponsors, we picked up on H.R. 793 44 cosponsors in less than 24  hours. I commend our friends in the Senate who have helped us out. I  commend the bipartisan work on this.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy.   I am excited that this is one area that there was an opportunity to  have that bipartisan cooperation. The Biden administration supports it.  We have Republican and Democratic support in the Senate. My good  friend, Senator Wicker, and Senator Sinema have led the charge there.  This is a bright spot for a very troubled part of our economy,  independent restaurants, which are the cornerstone of all of our  communities.   I hope we can come together to support this on a bipartisan basis as  we move forward with the reconciliation. I appreciate the gentleman's  courtesy. I appreciate the time.
