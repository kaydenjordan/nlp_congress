 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment simply requires a mission  statement from the National Command Authority.   We used to insist on a mission and an exit strategy before we  committed to wars. Make no mistake, this is a proxy war in Ukraine.  Russians have unjustly invaded their neighbor, and Ukrainians are  rightly defending their country.   The first thing the administration did was offer President Zelenskyy  a ride. He said, in a very inspiring response: I don't need a ride. I  need ammunition.   Who couldn't be inspired by that?   Before we spent $113 billion, we should have expected a mission. We  still don't have a defined mission. Whether it is in public or in a  classified setting is fine with this amendment, but it should be  required. We should have done it up front, we should have done it  subsequently, but we should at least do it now.   Before we spend this other $300 million that is in this National  Defense Authorization Act, we should require what every E-5 and above  is able to draft. It is the least we can expect out of our National  Command Authority.   When we commit to something, the Nation should commit to it, not just  our military and not just our checkbook, an open checkbook. Without a  mission, we can't hold anyone accountable for failure, and we can't  properly claim mission accomplished. We must have a mission.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, this amendment requires a mission. We have  asked nicely, we have asked persistently, and they have given us no  response, so there has to be consequences.   We figure $300 million out of $113 billion is a small price. It is  enough to get their attention, hopefully. Who knows?   They can't account for billions of dollars at the Pentagon. Instead  of holding them accountable for it, even firing anybody, we are giving  them even more money.   Now, I couldn't be more pro-military. I enlisted in the Army. I got  the chance to go to our Nation's military academy. I came back as an  Army infantry officer, served in the Ranger regiment. I love this  country with a soldier's passion.   We have got to put our country first. If we are going to spend money,  we should at least demand a mission, and $300 million is small change.   In fact, before this bill could even make it through the Senate,  before appropriations could even come up, they could draft a mission.  They could draft a mission today, and they probably have it. The  trouble is, they have three or four versions of the mission.   The mission to make sure this war doesn't spread to a NATO ally would  be a just cause, but it is not clear that is what they are trying to  do. They are not pursuing any kind of peace negotiation.   The mission to require no Russians in Ukraine could be a just cause,  but that is very different than a mission that says no Russians in  Ukraine including Crimea. Each of those are radically different  resource allocations.   I want to know, if we are going to give resources, what mission are  you asking me to fund?   Here is the really radical one. Victoria Nuland from the State  Department says that our mission is regime change in Russia, including  war crimes tribunals for Vladimir Putin. Now, if that is our mission,  we don't have resources for that fight. That would require us to be in  the fight. That is fundamentally a declaration of war. That is an  unlimited war of regime change, a war of aggression by the United  States because we have not been attacked.   Now, make no mistake, we are using a proxy. But isn't a proxy meant  to facilitate a broader war with Russia? Unless we demand that mission,  how do we hold them accountable for not growing it and expanding it? We  must demand a mission.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the gentleman from South Carolina talks  about war criminal Putin. That makes me think he supports regime change  in Russia, because that is what it would take to prosecute Vladimir  Putin for war crimes.   Now, I am not saying that he is not a war criminal. I am not saying  anything he has done is just. It is not. The question is: Is that  really the mission that we are trying to fund?   The sequence is ready, aim, fire for a reason. It is not ready, fire,  aim. It is not too late to pull back and do the rational thing here and  commit to a mission so that we can be accountable, and we can hold this  administration accountable, our military commanders accountable, and,  frankly, our weak State Department accountable for actually  accomplishing a mission.   Hopefully, they succeed, and we can say: Well done. Mission  accomplished. But they don't want to be accountable for the mission.  That is why they worked so hard to oppose this rational standard that  was always the cause. Post-Vietnam, we learned we commit to a mission,  and we commit to an exit strategy. We abandon it at our peril. We are  less free, less safe, and more burdened by debt because of it. We have  to demand a mission.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, the amendment I have introduced, amendment  No. 40, simply requires that the Department of Defense study and report  the health conditions arising in members of the Armed Forces after  administration of the COVID-19 vaccine.   We have important voids in the data collected afterwards. We moved  development of this vaccine at warp speed, and the Department of  Defense mandated that members get the vaccine, so we have a great  ability to study these members.   They have very consistent health checkups. They have very consistent  requirements for predeployment, postdeployment, during deployment.  There are lots of ways to capture data in the military population, and,  frankly, it is overwhelmingly young, fit, healthy people that make up  our military, so the study could be very important.   It would be important to understand any long-term effects or  healthcare needs in the vaccinated population, and we could learn from  that process to develop future considerations, whether it is risk  assessments as we mandate vaccines, or how to combat future health  emergencies more effectively.   The Biden administration forced our men and women in uniform to take  this vaccine without really knowing the full effects which would have  been great to know in advance. But given the pandemic, they made a  decision that the risk was too great. Lots of us disagreed with that  risk assessment. That is all past.   At this point, we simply want to study how did it turn out? What were  the effects? What have been the results? That is all the study does.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am inquiring as to whether the gentlewoman  is actually opposed to my amendment. For her to qualify as an opponent  of my amendment she would have to speak in opposition to the amendment;  what it does.   My amendment does nothing about abortion. It simply requires a study  of COVID-19.    Mr. Chair, I must say that I consider the opposition to  this amendment, which no one raised an objection to the actual  amendment that I am offering, dilatory. I think it could be objected to  by the Chair and gaveled down, and we could just call the question,  unless they are actually opposed to the amendment.   They are debating something that my amendment doesn't do. It simply  requires a study on the results of COVID-19. It doesn't say what the  outcome has to be. It just says to study it, to come back to us and  tell us: How did it turn out for the people who got vaccinated? Do they  have any other health problems? Do they have better health? What is the  outcome as a result of these folks being vaccinated?   I just want a study of the vaccinated population. It is a very simple  amendment. We are considering hundreds of amendments, so if the other  side is simply looking for a way to filibuster and delay, I would  appreciate them not doing it on this amendment and staying to the rules  of the House. If they have an objection, then state it, but they object  to something else and are using the time inappropriately in my  consideration.   I ask for the consideration of the Chair.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I haven't heard an objection to this  amendment. I hope we can agree to move forward and conduct the study.  We just want to know what the health effects were on the vaccinated  population in the military so that next time we can make a better risk  assessment and hopefully get it right.   We will learn a lot from the military population that can surely help  the rest of the country because they have much more consistent access  to healthcare, much more consistent required checkups. I think the  dataset can be very good. I hope we can get this study done.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this good amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this amendment requires the Secretary of  Defense to submit to Congress a report on allied contributions to  defense spending.   The 1985 NDAA established an annual report from the Department of  Defense on allied contributions to our common defense with the initial  focus on NATO. Of course, the Cold War was going on then, but that  continued until 2004. The DOD stopped producing this report as the  Pentagon's priorities shifted to the global war on terror.   Nevertheless, the report is an important one. NATO allies have an  obligation to provide their own defense. We don't want there to be some  misunderstanding that NATO membership has somehow bought war insurance  and that America will either fight or fund your war. We will help you  fight and win a war under article 5 and only then if Congress  authorizes combat.   We might authorize spending, we might authorize combat, but Congress  is the body that declares our wars. We can do that better when we know  whether our allies are promoting their own defense. If they are  shortchanging their own defense, we might feel differently about the  vulnerability.   Weakness invites aggression. Unfortunately, many of our allies have  invited that aggression. As Donald Trump cautioned Germany, as an  example, you shouldn't be doing business with Russia. Look how it  turned out. Now, this isn't simply the fault of Germany underfunding  their defense or becoming totally dependent upon Russia. Russia took  advantage of it, but Germany was naive enough to fall victim to it. It  hasn't hurt Germany as directly as it has hurt Ukraine, but it all  works together.   Ukraine is not a NATO ally, but they are an ally. They are clearly  paying a high cost for their own defense. Could we have worked  differently and prevented this combat?   Let us look at other areas around the world. As we look at our  allies, whether it is Israel as an ally, Taiwan as an ally, our NATO  allies, or others around the world, I think it is important that this  report gets produced and we understand it.   I think it is also important that, if appropriate, we share it in  public so that our adversaries know that we have  [[Page H3542]]  a very strong collective defense and a strong commitment. If we don't  hold people accountable for it, we will inherently be weak, because  their intelligence service will know. It motivates our allies to do the  right thing.   Since 2006, the majority of our NATO allies have consistently failed  to meet their 2 percent GDP defense commitment. Even as a war is taking  place in their own backyard, the United States remains the largest  contributor to the war in Ukraine.   The U.S. should not continue to subsidize the defense of NATO member  countries who choose not to invest in themselves.   Good data makes for good legislation, and this report would supply  Congress with valuable information that is needed to make sound policy  decisions that put America first.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the gentleman didn't raise an objection to  understanding how much they are contributing. He implies he already  knows. The world doesn't know, and I certainly don't get access to all  of that information.   I do know they are paying for their own defense, and some of them  quite a lot. I do know that they have helped in the war in Ukraine, and  they have certainly taken on a heavy burden with refugees. All of that  is different in different places around the world.   Our allies stating how much they contribute certainly helps us make  policy. I hope all my colleagues will see through this as an attempt to  avoid accountability for our allies. We shouldn't underappreciate them,  but we shouldn't cover for them either. We should hold them  accountable, and the American people should know they are stepping up,  they are doing really well.   You can state it in percentage of GDP. That is the obligation, 2  percent of their GDP, and yet the biggest countries with the biggest  resources with very little debt, I might add, aren't paying their  defense.   In our case, we are borrowing from China to defend our country and,  frankly, to defend lots of them and people that aren't even part of our  NATO alliance.   It is important that we pass this and we study it. Whether this  amendment passes or not, we need to know it, and we need to hold them  accountable for their failure to honor their obligations.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, my amendment strikes section 217 which authorizes funds to  NATO for the joint fund established for the Defence Innovation  Accelerator for the North Atlantic Initiative with the acronym DIANA.   NATO has suffered from major mission creep and bureaucratic bloat  while separate entities like DIANA are tied closely to the innovation  fund that was to launch in NATO in 2022.   There are 22 allies listed as participants, and the United States  isn't one of them. Meanwhile, there are numerous countries that are  participating in this fund; Germany, Turkiye, Italy, Spain, et cetera,  who already do not meet their 2 percent GDP commitment to fund their  own defense.   Why would we expect them to contribute fully to DIANA when they won't  contribute the basic amount to their own defense, which is NATO's  purpose, to defend. It is a defensive alliance.   We have colleagues who support a new strategic purpose for NATO. It  doesn't need a new strategic purpose. It isn't even accomplishing its  own purpose to focus on its own defense.   You have countries like Germany who have literally no debt. There is  very little debt in their country. Meanwhile, the United States is  borrowing money to fund things like this.   We could fund it for our own country, but I don't know that we need  to fund it on behalf of NATO. This program adds one more financial  burden to the United States within NATO while European countries take a  free ride off our efforts.   There is no focus from the United States Government to make these  countries pay for the commitments they made as part of being members of  the NATO alliance.   Since 2006, they have all avoided their basic financial  responsibility. There is no reason to expand the financial obligations  within NATO until they follow through and honor their commitments.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I agree that we should be working  collaboratively with our NATO allies. In fact, we do.   I was fortunate to get to serve in Germany at a time when the Cold  War was at its height. I saw the wall fall while I was there, and I got  to see people rushing to our side. They were not asking for more  government. They were asking for more freedom.   Germany is reunified, things we never thought we would see, but they  are also spending their money on all sorts of things except their own  defense. Now, they spend something. They are helpful. I don't want to  underappreciate the good things they do, but we shouldn't continue  funding initiatives together unless they honor their commitment.   In fact, only 7 countries out of these 23 countries are paying 2  percent of their GDP. If we don't hold them accountable, why are they  going to step up? They are not. Meanwhile, we are bankrupting our own  country, making us weaker, less free, less safe, more burdened by debt,  and we are not holding our allies accountable for paying their fair  share.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, this is an important signal to send to all  our allies. We are, indeed, your allies, but we are not going to fund  or fight your wars. You are not buying insurance for America to carry  the load. We are a participant. We would love a collaborative  relationship. The idea that they are doing something better in DIANA is  encouraging, but they are not honoring the fundamental nature of the  agreement, and that is a problem. We have to hold them accountable for  doing just that. I don't understand why my colleagues object to doing  that.   I understand people are passionate about the DIANA program, and that  is why I hope they are passionate about it. You have something maybe  they care about. I don't know. We have got to send the message that you  can't just underinvest in your own defense and count on America to bail  you out.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, it is precisely the time to lean in and have  your allies' back. If our allies won't do that now, when will they do  it? There is a war on their borders, and they will not invest at the  levels they have committed to as part of the treaty.   If they won't do it now, when will they? How do we not hold them  accountable for this?   We have no defined mission, we have no accountability, no defined  strategy. We just have an open checkbook. How in the world does this  encourage a stronger alliance? It doesn't.   I ask my colleagues to please support this amendment. Please hold our  NATO allies accountable for doing what they said they would do.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer amendment No. 51 as the  designee for Mr. Roy.    Mr. Chair, this amendment expresses a sense of  Congress. This doesn't even have teeth on it. It just asks nicely,  please, NATO allies, would you contribute the amount that you said you  would, please? It is a kind ask. It is a sense of Congress that you  should do what you said you would do.   NATO countries who choose not to invest in their own defense,  specifically meeting the 2014 Wales Summit Defense Spending Benchmark,  better known as the 2 percent GDP commitment, should be held  accountable for that. That is all it is saying, you should actually do  what you said you would do.   In 2006, NATO defense ministers agreed to annually commit a minimum  of 2 percent of their Nation's GDP on their own defense. According to  NATO, this spending threshold ``serves as an indicator of a country's  political will to contribute to NATO's common defense. . . . ''   In 2014, the NATO alliance adopted the ``defense investment pledge.''  At that time, only 3 of NATO's 28 NATO member countries were meeting  their 2 percent defense spending commitment. At that time, the NATO  alliance issued the statement: We agree to reverse the trend of  declining defense budgets, to make the most effective use of our funds,  and to further a more balanced sharing of costs and responsibilities.  Our overall security and defense depend both on how much we spend and  how we spend it.   They recognized the problem, and they committed to change course back  in 2014. The Senate ratified this pledge in 2014 with a ``yes'' vote  97-2.   In 2022, NATO's annual report showed that only 7 of now 30 NATO  member countries meet the 2 percent GDP defense spending level.  Numerous NATO member countries use the United States security umbrella  to evade their financial commitments to their own defense.   There is a war raging on their borders, and they are still not  stepping up. If not now, when? This amendment that I am offering now on  behalf of Mr. Roy that I have cosponsored doesn't cut anything. It just  says, it is a sense of Congress that you should do what you said you  would do. It is a sense of what the Senate said 97-2 when they ratified  it that, yeah, we agree with this pledge.   The United States is doing it. Why in the world shouldn't our own  countrymen expect the members of their alliance to do what they said  they would do as a part of the alliance?   Failing to do this makes our alliance weaker, it makes our alliance  less secure, and it sets a horrible standard for any future ally.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I would just point out that Ukraine is not a  member of NATO. I know some of my colleagues want to make them that,  maybe so that we could already go to war with a country that would  inherently involve Article V, or they would be admitted today because  they are in a state of war today. However, they are not, so we aren't  having NATO allies in bunkers right now hunkered down and having allies  call them out.                                time  2030    The surest way to wind up there is to continue to under-invest in our  defense, and that is exactly what more than 75 percent of our NATO  allies are doing. They said they would invest in their defense and they  are not doing it.   Do they have no shame? They expect us to carry the load? Are we going  to fight and fund their wars?   I mean, we did help a lot in World War I. We helped a lot in World  War II. There were a lot of people that fought and died, not just  Americans, to get there. But America is a great ally, and  [[Page H3550]]  we are simply asking that they too become great allies. That is all  this amendment does. It doesn't cut funding. It doesn't bail on them.   It simply says, we expect you to do what you said you would do. We  are just calling it out. You are not doing it. Please do it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment doesn't deal with Ukraine,  it deals with NATO. It doesn't say anything bad. It denounces people  that don't do what they said.   I denounce people that don't keep their word. Shame on you. You said  you would do something, and you didn't do it. You should be held  accountable for that. That is all we are saying.   Seventy-five percent of NATO countries, the biggest, strongest,  biggest economies, they are the ones that are underinvesting. There are  some heroes out there like Poland or Estonia that are spending more  than their share of their GDP. But the biggest, wealthiest countries in  Europe are underinvesting, and it is time to hold them accountable.   I urge our colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
