 Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, President Trump and his  foreign policy team made the right choice to withdraw from the nuclear  agreement with the dishonest Iranian regime. This Iran deal was flawed  from its inception, freeing up billions of U.S. dollars and relaxing  sanctions in exchange for weak restrictions and little enforcement.   Iran has taken advantage of this deal. In 2016, German intelligence  found that Iran was secretly pursuing nuclear technology and equipment  from German companies, violating the agreement less than a year after  it was finalized.   That same year, Reuters reported that secret exemptions had been  created for Iran after the talks were over, allowing them to evade some  restrictions and get relief from our sanctions even faster.   Months after, another loophole in the agreement was exploited when  Iran planned to buy 950 tons of uranium to make nuclear fuel since the  agreement never placed a limit on how much uranium they could have.   All of this more than demonstrates the ineffectiveness of this deal  and the potentially catastrophic effects of trusting Iran, which has a  long and detailed history of blatantly being dishonest.   This is a bad deal for this country.                            ____________________
