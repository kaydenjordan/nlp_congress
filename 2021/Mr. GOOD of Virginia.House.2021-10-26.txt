 Person Speaker, I rise today in strong  opposition to H.R. 2119.   The other side of the aisle claims that this would help families, but  instead, it would devastate them. The bill would coerce faith-based  providers, as the gentlewoman from North Carolina has already said, to  violate their deeply held beliefs or stop their work altogether.   This bill would redefine the definition of sex, and it inserts gender  identity language into U.S. Code. Isn't that the objective of this  administration, this majority, to force our faith-based providers out  of business and to redefine sex and to change the identification of  gender?   My colleagues on the other side claim they want to protect the  family, but instead, they have chosen to attack the very bedrock of our  country--the moral principles and the traditional family that hold our  families and communities together.   In fact, nearly everything that plagues our society can be attributed  to a failure to follow God's laws for morality and His rules for and  definition of marriage and family.   The very name of this bill is steeped in irony--the Family Violence  Prevention and Services Improvement Act--as it would truly inflict more  violence on unborn babies' lives and force taxpayers to fund the murder  of unborn life; again, consistent with the goals and objectives of this  administration and this Democrat majority.   This would be a bad bill without its attack on the unborn. This would  be a bad bill without its dangerous sexual orientation and gender  identity provisions, or SOGI. This is a bad bill because it spends over  a billion dollars more in expansive and intrusive government. Violence  is already illegal. We Republicans are against it in all forms. This is  a matter for local and State law enforcement.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill, and I  will be doing so.
