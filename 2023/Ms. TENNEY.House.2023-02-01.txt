 Mr. Speaker, sports and athletic competitions provide  essential opportunities for women to thrive at every stage of their  life, as children in youth sports and as teens in high school and in  college, in order to live a healthy and productive life.   As a former competitive athlete, an equestrian, a basketball player,  a golfer, and, yes, the teenage curling champion of 1975 in my  hometown, I know the unparalleled opportunities that sports offer to  women and girls.   Competitive sports give women a chance to learn new skills, to  develop lifelong friendships, and to challenge themselves to compete at  the highest levels. Title IX and the banning of discrimination against  women in sports made so much of this possible for me and countless  other women.   Today, these opportunities are under threat. Joe Biden's Department  of Education and State agencies across the Nation are allowing, even  encouraging, biological men to participate in women's sports. This is  fundamentally unfair. It deprives women and girls of what so many of us  fought for decades to achieve: equal opportunity to train, to compete,  and to excel in athletics.    We witnessed this past year, during the NCAA women's swimming  championship, a phenomenal female athlete robbed of her title by a  biological male. This is not an isolated incident. The tragedy is  playing out in countless other sports and athletic leagues across our  Nation.   Today, we take a stand, with compassion for all, in defense of  women's sports to stop this dangerous precedent.   I am honored to be joined by an amazing group of outstanding women  athletes who are in our Chamber today and are courageously standing up  for women in all sports across our Nation and all women athletes.   This is why I am so honored to cosponsor Representative Greg Steube's  Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act and to announce its  introduction today in honor of National Women and Girls in Sports Day.   Mr. Speaker, I have here the legislation. This bill will make it a  violation of Title IX for biological men to compete in sports  designated for women or girls. Further, it sensibly defines sex based  on one's biological designation at birth.   This bill isn't just anti-woke. It is actually pro-science. This bill  will protect opportunities for women and girls to compete fairly on the  athletic field and in life without interference from woke agencies or  politicians who are making up definitions of sex and gender as they go,  all to fit toxic political agendas and ideologies.   Women have fought hard over the years for equality of opportunity,  and it is essential that we protect these opportunities we cherish  today for generations of women and girls to come.   The Republican majority has pledged to protect women's sports, and  today, we are delivering on that promise with Congressman Steube's  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I shall introduce Mr. Steube's bill today.                            ____________________
