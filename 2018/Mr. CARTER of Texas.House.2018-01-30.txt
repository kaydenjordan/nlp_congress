 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this Defense  Appropriations bill which will provide full-year funding for the  Defense Department so they can continue to effectively defend our  country from an ever-expanding threat which exists in the world today.   This bill ends uncertainty and ineffectiveness of a continuing  resolution, allows the DOD to plan and execute on the things they need  to do today, not last year. Our military needs to modernize to face new  threats it will face in this world, and they can't do that with a CR.   This bill also lifts sequestration caps which have, to paraphrase  Secretary Mattis, caused more harm to our military than any enemy.  Lifting these caps for FY18 is essential towards improving the  readiness of our force.   The world is changing rapidly and so is the nature and threat to our  military forces and what they face day and night. We owe it to our  servicemen and -women to give them the resources to modernize their  capabilities so that they can best face this threat.   Mr. Speaker, our military is the greatest natural resource in the  country. I am reminded of this every time I visit The Great Place, Fort  Hood, in my district. The troops at Fort Hood are currently leading the  fight against ISIS and will benefit from this bill, and we owe it to  them.   We sleep every night under the blanket of freedom they provide  through their sacrifice. I am proud to support them and hopeful that we  will pass this bill so we can give them what they need right now so  they won't face the uncertainty of endless sequestration and CRs. I  support this bill and encourage my colleagues to support it.   And it is a current event. Last night, as I flew into Washington,  D.C., we carried the remains of an American warrior. It is a current  event. We are all responsible for it. We need to get this job done.
