 Madam Speaker, I am frustrated. For 26 days, critical  functions of the Federal Government have been nonoperational.  Coastguardsmen have not been paid, and there is no end in sight.   We must work together to pass a bill, end the shutdown, and fund  security measures at our borders. Put all 435 of us in a room with no  phones, no TV, until the job is done.   I came from the private sector. In the private sector, you do not  leave until the job is done.   Is our job done here in Washington? Did we end the shutdown? Did we  adequately fund border security? The answer is no, we have not.   House leadership has refused to bring any serious attempt to open the  government and address critical security needs to the House floor.  Rather than playing political games with government funding, let's work  on solutions.   I am ready to stay here until we get the job done. Let's get to work.
