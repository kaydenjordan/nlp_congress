 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 736, I call  up the bill (H.R. 3299) to amend the Revised Statutes, the Home Owners'  Loan Act, the Federal Credit Union Act, and the Federal Deposit  Insurance Act to require the rate of interest on certain loans remain  unchanged after transfer of the loan, and for other purposes, and  [[Page H1148]]  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3299, the Protecting  Consumers' Access to Credit Act of 2017, a most important goal of this  Chamber. H.R. 3299 is an important bill that is cosponsored by a  bipartisan group of Members of the House and was approved by the House  Financial Services Committee with a very strong bipartisan vote of 42- 17.   I would like to start out by thanking my colleague, the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), the vice chairman of the committee,  for introducing this legislation and leading our congressional efforts  to help create a regulatory framework which will encourage the growth  of financial technology and expand much-needed access to credit for  American small businesses and consumers.   H.R. 3299 is a legislative response to the 2015 Second Circuit Court  of Appeals decision in Madden v. Midland Funding, which clearly appears  to have not not considered the valid-when-made legal doctrine, which is  a nearly 200-year-old principle of usury law in our Republic. Again,  Mr. Speaker, 200 years of settled common law upended in one court case.   In the decision, the court held that, while the National Bank Act  allowed a federally chartered bank to charge interest under the laws of  its home State on loans it makes nationwide, nonbanks that bought those  loans could not continue to collect that interest because nonbanks are  generally subject to the limits of the borrower's State.   The Second Circuit decision has caused considerable uncertainty and  risk for many types of bank lending programs, including bank model  marketplace lending where national banks originate loans and then  transfer them to nonbank third parties.   Being able to offer consistent terms nationwide is vital to scaling  the marketplace lending business, which, in turn, allows lenders to  access cheaper investment capital and then pass the savings on to the  borrowers who may be looking to buy their first home, start a business,  send a kid to college.   H.R. 3299, again, is a commonsense bill that simply codifies the 200- year-old valid-when-made legal doctrine, which would preserve the  lawful interest rate on a loan originated by a bank even if the loan is  sold, assigned, or transferred to a nonbank third party.   This fundamental concept is the backbone of how fintech companies  partner with banks. Without it, consumers are faced with higher costs  and less availability of credit, particularly those consumers with less  access to traditional lending sources.   Mr. Speaker, don't take my word for it. According to a recent  Columbia/Stanford University study, borrowers with credit scores under  625 have seen their credit cut in half, cut in half thanks to this  decision. Again, Mr. Speaker, borrowers with less than stellar credit  scores have seen their credit cut in half in the territory comprising  the Second Circuit. We simply cannot allow this to happen.   Now, Mr. Speaker, thanks to President Trump and Congress passing the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we are beginning to see this economy start to  take off. We are finally seeing wages begin to grow after 8 years of  failed economic policy, but so much work remains to be done for working  American families.   We have heard, on our Financial Services Committee, Mr. Speaker, from  so many of these families who are trying to make ends meet, and it is  just vital that they be able to access credit.   Americans like Alan from New Hampshire, who recently had trouble  finding credit through traditional  [[Page H1149]]  banks and credit unions due to the regulatory load. As he explained:  ``But for my local dealer's efforts on my behalf, there is no doubt I  would not be driving my current car. And this was a desperate  situation, as I am the sole income earner for my family. My wife is  ill, and we have two young children in school. After my old vehicle  broke down, I needed to find reliable replacement transportation so I  could get to work and continue to provide for my family.''   Mr. Speaker, we should not let the Second Circuit prevent Alan from  getting that car loan he desperately needs in order to get to work as  the sole provider for his family.   A small-business owner from Utah named Maxine applied for a loan for  her 37-year-old established business so she could update and purchase  equipment to support a contract that would have led to the creation of  50 additional jobs. She explained: ``Three banks informed us that our  rating, according to new bank regulations imposed by Dodd-Frank,  disqualified us from loan consideration.''   Fifty jobs, poof, gone, Mr. Speaker.   So is not Dodd-Frank bad enough? Now we are going to add this Second  Circuit opinion to deny credit, which, for lower credit score  individuals, has cut credit opportunity in half?   I don't think so. I don't think so. It is not up for the unelected to  make such decisions.   We cannot continue to allow, Mr. Speaker, Washington red tape and the  Second Circuit to cut off credit opportunities for hardworking  Americans. As the bill says: ``We must preserve and protect consumers'  access to credit.''   I urge every Member to support this very important bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1415     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), vice chairman of the committee and  sponsor of the legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say to  the gentleman who says this is a majority bill, I would also point out  it is supported by Congressman Meeks, Democrat from New York;  Congressman Clay, Democrat from Missouri; Congressman Scott, Democrat  from Georgia; Congressman Cleaver, Democrat from Missouri;  Congresswoman Moore, Democrat from Wisconsin; Congressman Perlmutter,  Democrat from Colorado; Congresswoman Sinema, Democrat from Arizona,  and the list goes on.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Rothfus), the vice chairman of our Subcommittee on Financial  Institutions and Consumer Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), the vice chairman of the Terrorism and  Illicit Finance Subcommittee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton), vice chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight  and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), a hardworking member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, number one, just for the Record, it is Mr. Rothfus from  Pennsylvania and Mr. Pittenger from North Carolina. Since we serve with  these colleagues, it would be nice to learn their names.   Mr. Speaker, what the ranking member is proposing is to take away  credit opportunities for those who need it the most.   The greatest credit program is a competitive marketplace. And,  unfortunately, the policy that she is advocating, this Second Circuit  court case, has cut credit opportunities in half. That means people are  paying more. In many respects, this is a more usurious result than what  the ranking member is otherwise claiming will happen without the Second  Circuit decision.   Again, I alluded to it in my opening statement, but we have the  definitive academic study. We don't have to guess at this, Mr. Speaker.  They studied those with lower credit scores in the Second Circuit.   And what did they find out?   I will quote from the study. The results presented in figure 3  indicate that the FICO increase was caused by a decline--a decline--in  lending to lower quality borrowers.   Thank you, Second Circuit.   The pattern is most obvious for the lowest quality borrowers, those  with FICO scores below 625. The growth rate for these borrowers in  Connecticut and New York was a negative 52 percent.   Mr. Speaker, that means they had their credit opportunities cut in  half. So exactly what the ranking member says that she wants to do to  help these people, she is hurting these people; taking away their  opportunities to buy a home or taking away their opportunities to buy a  car when they may be the sole breadwinner for their family; taking away  opportunities, perhaps, to send somebody to college.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.   And then this so-called radical bill of the gentleman from North  Carolina, I would note it is a Democrat bill in the Senate. The exact  companion bill is carried by a Democrat Senator, Senator Warner from  Virginia. It is a Democrat bill. It is bipartisan. It is supported by  at least nine Members of the ranking member's party that sit  [[Page H1153]]  with her in our hearings. Clearly, they heard something she didn't  hear.   Again, Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that what the Second  Circuit has done is change settled law that has been settled law for  over 200 years; that will completely not only cut credit opportunities  in the Second Circuit, but cut credit opportunities all over America.   We cannot allow that to happen.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say:  Apparently, Mr. Meeks is abusing these consumers, as is Mr. Clay, as is  Mr. Scott, as is Mr. Cleaver, as is Ms. Moore, as is Mr. Perlmutter, as  is Ms. Sinema, as is Mr. Heck, and as is Mr. Gottheimer, all Democrats  on the House Financial Services Committee that actually support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Trott), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say-- with the exception of the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B.  Maloney)--I don't see any of the committee Democrats on the floor, even  those who are supporting the ranking member's position.   I am now pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Budd), a hardworking member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth), another hardworking member  of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the ranking member has lamented that she has heard from  few Democrats on this matter, so let me take the liberty of quoting  from Congressman Greg Meeks, a Democrat from New York, the lead  Democratic cosponsor of the bill, who said, during markup:         This bill would facilitate such affordable lending to those       who need it the most.    He goes on to say:         H.R. 3299 is a community bank bill. Fintech firms have       partnered with small community banks and provided these       institutions with technological expertise needed to contend       with larger competitors. In fact, I'm aware that there are       fintech firms engaging with Black-owned banks who have       benefited tremendously from new technologies.    Congressman Meeks goes on to say:         H.R. 3299 is also a small-business bill. According to the       Urban Institute, 34 percent of my constituents in Jamaica,       Queens, who have bank accounts rely on alternative financial       service providers, including rent-to-own agreements and       refund anticipation loans because they have unmet lending       needs. Madden does little to help these underbanked       individuals. Instead, it shuts the door to more affordable       bank loans facilitated through partnership models.   [[Page H1155]]     Madam Speaker, I could go on, but what we are trying to do here is  assure that what just happened in the Second Circuit, where credit  opportunities are cut in half, doesn't happen nationwide. The  hardworking men and women of America deserve better, and so we must  support H.R. 3299.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 736, I  call up the bill (H.R. 3978) to amend the Real Estate Settlement  Procedures Act of 1974 to modify requirements related to mortgage  disclosures, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3978, which is  a package of five strongly bipartisan bills, yet again, from the  Financial Services Committee of the House. As standalone bills, all  were favorably reported, again, with strong bipartisan support of at  least three-quarters of the committee.   The title provision of this package is the TRID Improvement Act by  Congressman French Hill. This bill amends CFPB's complex TILA/RESPA  integrated disclosure, known as the TRID rule, in order to simplify the  closing documents consumers get when they close a mortgage.   It does this by allowing for the calculation of the discounted rate  that title insurance companies provide to consumers when they purchase  a lender's and owner's title insurance policy simultaneously. This  makes it more accurate, Madam Speaker.   Title II is the Protection of Source Code Act introduced by  Representatives Sean Duffy and David Scott, a Republican and a  Democrat. This provision ensures that the Securities and Exchange  Commission cannot require financial services firms to disclose  algorithmic trading source code without first obtaining a subpoena.  Source code is among a firm's most sensitive information, and this  bipartisan provision balances privacy and due process concerns while  preserving the SEC's ability to obtain such information when necessary.   The third title is the Fostering Innovation Act which was introduced  by Representatives Sinema and Hollingsworth to provide relief to small  and emerging businesses by extending the popular onramp exemption of  the JOBS Act for emerging growth companies in a more tailored manner.  In short, it provides emerging growth companies more time to reach a  size when they reasonably can be expected to financially sustain the  legal, accounting, and compliance costs associated with the full  Sarbanes-Oxley section 404(b) compliance.   Fourth, Madam Speaker, is the National Securities Exchange Regulatory  Parity Act which was introduced by Mr. Royce and which will ensure  further clarity and competition among national security exchanges by  modernizing the blue sky exemption in the Securities Act. Modernizing  this provision will ensure all national security exchanges operate on a  level regulatory playing field and help protect retail investors from  arbitrary acts by State regulators that may bar investors in one State  from buying stock freely available to investors in every other State.  [[Page H1157]]    The final title of this bill is a provision introduced by Congressman  Stivers to allow mortgage loan originators who work as loan officers in  banks and credit unions to transition to a new job at a nonmortgage  company without losing the ability to originate loans. Without this  bill, the transition process can take weeks or months depending on the  State.   Each of these measures, Madam Speaker, will cut through layers of red  tape and help level the playing field making regulations smarter,  fairer, clearer, and more efficient, thus ensuring that there are more  competitively priced credit opportunities, more credit opportunities  for consumers, and that investors have greater investment opportunities  in competitive markets. They will provide commonsense regulatory  relief. They are practical, they are bipartisan, and they are needed.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support the  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the majority whip of the committee and the  sponsor of the legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing  and Insurance and the sponsor of title 2 of the Protection of Source  Code in this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say the  widespread opposition to the bill alluded to by the ranking member  doesn't include roughly half the Democrats on the committee, including  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster), who was quoted in our markup  as saying: ``As someone who can code in at least seven languages, I  understand that source code is qualitatively different from other  documents that a firm might have and that our regulators should have  legitimate access to. They are truly the crown jewels of an electronic  trading firm, and there are obvious dangers that have been exposed in  transferring things really not just to the government, to any entity.  The first line of defense in cybersecurity is to keep the data as  closely held as reasonable and still be able to do your job.''   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), the vice chairman on the Subcommittee on  Capital Markets, Securities, and Investment.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Williams), the vice chairman of our Subcommittee on  Monetary Policy and Trade.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), a hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Zeldin), another member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), another proud member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I would tell the ranking member that I  have potentially two speakers, if they make it. They are on their way  from a hearing, but they are not here now.                                time  1600     Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Madam Speaker, there may be other Members coming, so,  at the moment, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Madam Speaker, again, all over America today, fortunately, because of  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, people are waking up to new opportunities.  They are finally seeing their wages begin to grow. We have seen the  greatest wage growth in almost a decade, Madam Speaker, again, thanks  to President Trump and thanks to a Republican Congress, a bill that was  opposed by every single Democrat.   But as they wake up to these new opportunities, Madam Speaker, they  also need new credit. As their incomes rise--this is good--they still  need credit in order to buy a home, in order to purchase that car, and  sometimes just to put groceries on the table. Unfortunately, over the  last 8 years of the Obama administration where we saw probably one of  the greatest increases in the cost, expense, and burden of costly  Washington red tape, we have seen fewer credit opportunities.   So now, fortunately, today there are good men and women on both sides  of the aisle who are trying to work together to bring some rationale  and reason to the regulatory burden. Many Members on the other side of  the aisle do realize that Dodd-Frank did not come down as tablets from  Mt. Sinai, that it isn't chiseled into stone, and that maybe there are  some improvements that could be made.   So today, we are taking a number of very bipartisan bills to the  House floor. The Protecting Consumers' Access to Credit Act, which we  debated earlier, Madam Speaker, passed by 42-17.   The TRID Improvement Act by Mr. Hill from Arkansas passed through our  committee 53-5--90 percent. Almost all of the Democrats but the ranking  member supported the bill. The Protection of Source Code Act, 46-14;  the Fostering Innovation Act passed by a vote of 48-12, a Democratic  bill; the National Securities Exchange Regulatory Parity Act, 46-14.   We have a lot of bipartisan bills, but with one exception, title V of  the TRID Improvement Act, none of them were supported, unfortunately,  by the ranking member.   So there is, again, a lot of bipartisan work we are trying to get  done here. Unfortunately, very little of it is supported by the ranking  member.   And why is this important? It is important, Madam Speaker, because  every day we are still hearing from our constituents who need access to  competitive affordable credit. And because of this Washington red tape  and regulatory burden, they are not getting it.   It wasn't that long ago we heard from Ann of Wisconsin, who said:         My husband and I had very high credit scores. We have       plenty of equity in our home. But because my husband has a       seasonal job and finds other employment in the winter, many       banks we contacted rejected our loan request. They based our       annual income only on the job he has currently and said that       was part of the new regulations.    Part of the new regulations--there is somebody who won't buy a home;  they can't get a home.   I heard from a mortgage banker in North Carolina who said:         Last year, we declined a young man and his family fixed       rate financing to purchase a primary home. The applicant       recently relocated to work for a family business. Prior to       Dodd-Frank, it would have been easy to qualify, but no more.    Another potential American home buyer denied credit because of this  regulatory burden. Madam Speaker, that is what many of us, on both  sides of the aisle, are trying to remedy today.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Arizona (Ms. Sinema), a sponsor of title III of the Fostering  Innovation Act.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I want to hear the voices of hardworking  Americans, not just Washington, D.C., letterhead groups.   We heard from a community banker, who said:         A local union member wanted to refinance his primary       residence. He was currently laid off due to the winter       season. His tax return showed he was generally laid off for       about 6 weeks each year during the extreme cold but was       always called back when weather improved. Since he was laid       off, we could not meet the requirement to validate his       current income that would continue for 3 years. We had to       deny the loan.    Yet again, Mr. Speaker, more Washington red tape taking away home  opportunities from hardworking Americans. It is wrong. We must do  something about it. It is why, on a bipartisan basis, so many of us  have gotten together to pass H.R. 3978.   Yes, we want to make sure that people can buy homes, they can buy  cars, they can put groceries on the table, and right now, when the  economy is finally starting to improve, thanks to President Trump and  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we want them to have opportunities.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 3978, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order on the  gentleman's motion.    I object.    Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of  order.     Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition.    Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to my  colleague on the Financial Services Committee. I lost track of how many  times he mentioned Wells Fargo. That has nothing to do with an early  growth company. That has nothing to do with this title of the bill.   So the Fostering Innovation Act by the gentlewoman from Arizona is  all about allowing emerging-growth companies the opportunity to  actually grow. What a novel concept.   What we know is, Mr. Speaker, in 8 years of Obamanomics, they were  only able to produce about 1.8 percent economic growth, for all intents  and purposes. Nobody's savings account came back. Wages were stagnant.  And now that we have sensible regulation, now that we have passed the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, now we have 3 percent economic growth, which is  economic growth for America's working families. Unemployment is at a  17-year low. It remains at a 17-year low.   Again, wages grew at 2.9 percent last year, the fastest in almost a  decade. Two million Americans have gone back to work, Mr. Speaker, and  this is not by accident.   So what the gentleman is doing with his motion to recommit is sending  us back. He is rolling the clock back to an era where working Americans  didn't get ahead, where entrepreneurship was at a generational low,  where small businesses were finding it hard to access lines of credit.  So the bill that he so much maligns from the gentlewoman from Arizona,  who happens to reside on his side of the aisle--at markup, the ranking  member of the relevant subcommittee, the gentlewoman from New York  (Mrs. Maloney), supported the provision and said: This is a sensible  compromise that provides a narrowly targeted relief to only the  companies that truly need it.   Researching a new drug and getting FDA approval is a very, very long  process, which is exactly what we heard in our committee. For example,  we have heard from John Blake, senior vice president of finance at Atyr  Pharma, who testified before the Subcommittee on Capital Markets,  Securities, and Investments. He said: It remains the case that the  biotech development time line is a decades-long affair. It is extremely  likely that Atyr will still be in the lab, in the clinic, when our EGC  clock expires, our early growth company.   In other words, they may have revenues, but they don't have profits.  They don't have profits. This is something that is especially common in  the biotech area. They need this capital for innovation.   So once again, we have heard this rhetoric on the other side of the  aisle before. This is all about Dodd-Frank revisited. They aim at Wall  Street, but they are hitting Main Street, Mr. Speaker. The MTR, the  motion to recommit, hits Main Street in the gut. It will mean fewer  early growth companies. It will mean fewer jobs. It will mean lower  wage growth. And it will mean, again, a decimated and declining  American Dream.                                time  1630    Mr. Speaker, we should reject the motion to recommit, and we should  support the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
