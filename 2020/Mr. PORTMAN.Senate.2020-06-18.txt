 Mr. President, today I rise to ask unanimous consent to  pass S. Res. 623, which is a resolution commemorating Otto Fredrick  Warmbier and condemning the North Korean regime for their continued  human rights abuses.   Otto Warmbier was a native of my hometown of Cincinnati, OH. He was  also a young man of great spirit, intellect, and promise.   He attended the University of Virginia, and in 2015, he flew to North  Korea on a cultural trip. He went with a tour group.   At the end of his brief visit there, he was unjustly arrested by  North Korean security officials at the airport, as he was departing,  and he was imprisoned for 17 months on trumped-up charges relating to a  political poster.   During his captivity, he was badly mistreated and was returned to the  United States on June 13, 2017, only after falling into a comatose  state. He never recovered. Otto died on June 19, 2017--6 days later and  3 years ago tomorrow.   Senator Brown from Ohio and I have introduced this resolution to  remember what happened to him, to keep the memory of Otto, alive, and  to hold the North Korean regime accountable for their gross  mistreatment, their human rights abuses. Many others, in addition to  Otto Warmbier, have been subject to those human rights abuses,  including the North Korean people, whom they continue to repress, even  starve and mistreat.   Our resolution calls for the United States to continue to use our  voice, including at the United Nations and other forums, to speak out  against the human rights abuses of the North Korean Government.   It calls for the sanctions enacted under the Otto Warmbier North  Korea Nuclear Sanctions and Enforcement Act of 2019 to remain fully  implemented.   Most importantly, this resolution honors and remembers Otto Warmbier,  lest we forget what the North Korean dictatorship did to him.   His parents, Fred and Cindy, have channeled their grief into  constructive efforts to expose the human rights abuses of the North  Korean dictatorship, and I commend them for that. No parent should have  to endure what they have gone through.   Jane and I plan to visit with them at their home in Cincinnati  tomorrow on the third anniversary of Otto's death, and I hope to be  able to hand them a copy of this resolution and to be able to say that  the entire U.S. Senate voted to approve it.   This resolution is the right thing to do, and I encourage my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass it by unanimous consent.   I yield the floor to my colleague from Ohio.    Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask  unanimous consent that the Foreign Relations Committee be discharged  from further consideration and that the Senate now proceed to S. Res.  623.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I am here on the floor to talk about a  significant step forward in holding China accountable for not playing  by the rules. Today, after months of work, we are introducing  bipartisan legislation called the Safeguarding American Innovation Act  that will help crack down on the rampant theft of U.S. taxpayer-funded  research and innovation at America's colleges and universities by  foreign governments like China. It's outrageous, and it has to stop.   At the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, we  conducted a bipartisan year-long investigation in 2019 into how China  has used so-called talent recruitment programs, most notably its  Thousand Talents Plan, to steal U.S. taxpayer-funded research. The  Chinese Communist Party has systematically targeted the most promising  U.S. research and researchers, and then paid these grant recipients to  take their taxpayer-funded research to China. That research and  technology often ends up going directly to China to help fuel the rise  of its military and economy. Part of the reason it's gone on so long,  frankly, is because we've been asleep at the switch. That's starting to  change in the wake of our Subcommittee investigation.   Right now, our law enforcement officials and other federal entities  are working to hold China accountable for this IP theft problem but are  limited in the actions they can take under current law. All of the  arrests they've made so far have been about peripheral financial crimes  like wire fraud and tax evasion, not the core issue of taking American  taxpayer-paid research to benefit China. Why? Because they don't have  the legal ability to address the root causes of this problem.   That changes today. Along with my Democratic counterpart on the  Subcommittee, Tom Carper from Delaware, we are introducing the  bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act to empower the  government to protect our research enterprise while keeping it open and  transparent.   First, our bill makes it a crime failing to disclose their foreign  ties on federal grant applications, which, shockingly, it currently  isn't.   It requires the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, to streamline  and coordinate grant-making between the federal agencies so there's  needed accountability and transparency when it comes to tracking the  billions of dollars of taxpayer-funded grant money that's being  distributed.   It also allows the State Department to deny visas to foreign  researchers who we know are seeking to steal research and IP by  exploiting exemptions in our export control laws. This may surprise  you, but the State Department can't do that now. Career foreign service  officers, employees at the State Department, have asked us to provide  this authority.   Our bill also requires research institutions and universities to  provide the State Department basic information about the sensitive  technologies that a foreign researcher will have access to.   And our bill ensures transparency by requiring universities to report  any foreign gift of $50,000 or more and empowering the Department of  Education to fine universities that repeatedly fail to disclose these  gifts.   Rather than just pointing the finger at China, we ought to be looking  at our own government and our own institutions and doing a better job  here. Until we start to get our own house in order and take a firmer  stance on foreign influence here in this country, we're not going to  see much improvement. That's what this legislation does. In turn, I  think showing that we're serious about fixing our own vulnerabilities  will send a firm but fair signal to China--and other adversaries  looking to take advantage of our research enterprise--to change their  behavior. I encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan effort.   I yield back.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Duckworth):   S. 4002. A bill to amend the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act to  extend the interest rate limitation on debt entered into during  military service to debt incurred during military service to  consolidate or refinance student loans incurred before military  service; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
