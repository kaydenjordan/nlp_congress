 Madam Speaker, the American people are frustrated and  exhausted with the corruption and role of big money in the Halls of  Congress. That is why I am introducing a five-point plan.   First, ban all PAC and lobbyist money to congressional campaigns. I  don't take a dime of it.   Second, ban completely stock trading and Members of Congress from  ever becoming lobbyists. Activists like Unusual Whales, Quiver  Quantitative, and the leaders at CREW have been mobilizing for this.   Third, term limits for Members of Congress.   Fourth, term limits for Supreme Court Justices.   Fifth, an ethics code for Supreme Court Justices.   This is common sense. The people demand it. It is time we give them  back their government and reform in Washington. We should have  bipartisan support for this five-point plan.                            ____________________
