 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the importance  of supporting the brave men and women who protect us every day in all  50 States. As I laid out on this floor last month, the fires that we  face are getting worse, not better. Every day, there are more fires  ravaging our communities and more folks relying on firefighters for  protection.   Just last week, almost 4,000 acres in our neighboring State of New  Jersey were scorched by the Jimmy's Waterhole fire, forcing evacuations  from something like 170 buildings and homes.   In Pennsylvania, over 2,500 acres were burned and over 150 homes  threatened, forcing the Pennsylvania Turnpike to temporarily close.   Let me just make this as clear and as strong as I can. We have to  support our firefighters. We have to support our firefighters so that  when they bravely run toward danger to help others, they are well  prepared; they are properly trained and equipped.   That is one of the reasons why I continue to colead the Fire Grants  and Safety Act with my colleagues on the Congressional Fire Service  Caucus. Firefighters put their lives on the line for us every day-- every day--and it is our duty to provide them with the necessary  support that they need.   I am proud to join alongside Senators Gary Peters, Susan Collins, and  Lisa Murkowski in fighting for this crucial legislation to better  ensure that our firefighters are armed with the tools that they need to  get the job done on behalf of other people.   Today, I want to talk for a few minutes, if I could, about the Fire  Grants and Safety Act and how it will actually have an impact on  communities not just on the east coast, not just on the west coast, the  middle of our country, but all over the United States of America.   At a high level, this bill reauthorizes three critical Federal  programs that support the local fire departments. Let me break it down  just a little bit, if I could.   First, this legislation will reauthorize the Federal Emergency  Management Agency Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response-- also known as the SAFER Grant Program. The SAFER Grant Program provides  funding for career, for volunteer, and some combination of local fire  departments to increase the number of men and women on duty at any  point in time.   The job of a firefighter can be incredibly demanding, and baseline  industry standards include protocols like 24-hour staffing to make sure  our communities have adequate protection of all hours of day and night.   The SAFER Grant Program also provides funding to recruit staff so  that we can ensure staffing needs can actually be met. For example,  SAFER grants could help ensure that more personnel are properly trained  and available on the ground to assist in major fires in the areas that  need it the most.   In States like Delaware, where the majority of our firefighters are  volunteers, it is particularly important that staffing needs are met  and resources are provided so that all first responders are ready to  take on each day that lies ahead of them.   The Fire Grants and Safety Act also reauthorizes the Assistance to  Firefighters Grant Program. The Assistance to Firefighters Grant  Program helps local fire departments and EMS organizations to fulfill  equipment and training needs, like firetrucks and protective gear, all  of which lead to a more effective emergency response.   But firefighters do a whole lot more than just put out fires--I think  the Presiding Officer and other of our colleagues know. Annually, there  are over 36 million emergency calls that fire services across the  country respond to.   Let me say that again. There are over 36 million emergency calls that  fire services respond to across the country. That is not going down.  That is going up. I think it increased about 20 percent over the last  dozen or so years.    Just a few weeks ago, in my own State, a strong, dangerous tornado  struck Southern Delaware in the area of Sussex County, our southernmost  county, near a community called Greenwood and another community called  Bridgeville. It was our firefighters who showed up to lead people to  safety.   We lost a grandfather when the tornado struck Bridgeville, as I  recall. I think he was in his seventies. He left behind a family.   Ensuring that funding is provided for EMS alongside fire services is  critical to the emergency response.   Finally, the Fire Grants and Safety Act will reauthorize the U.S.  Fire Administration to provide leadership, to provide coordination, and  to provide training for first responders and healthcare leaders.  Responding to emergencies is no small undertaking. It is a huge  undertaking. In addition to our firefighters, healthcare leaders help  to guide the disaster response by making sure that people are taken  care of, both during and after emergency response.   The U.S. Fire Administration also plays a critical role in that  coordinated effort, ensuring that our first responders are ready to  handle hazards, from saving lives to preventing loss of homes and  personal belongings.   Beyond the initial response, the Administration collects fire data,  conducts important research and prevention methods, and hosts public  safety information and fire service training. This proactive approach  assists local fire departments in handling future emergencies and  creates a more comprehensive approach to fire safety.   The lifesaving work made possible by these three Federal programs  must continue, and we have the opportunity here in the Senate to make  that happen. Last month, we came together--Democrats and Republicans-- to vote to take up the Fire Grants and Safety Act. That vote passed by  a whopping 96 to 0. As the Presiding Officer knows, that doesn't happen  here every day, and it is a testament to the power of bipartisanship.  It is also a testament to the critical role that firefighters play in  communities across America.   Today, we will improve our emergency response, and we will make sure  that our firefighters have, if not everything they need, more of what  they need. I am pleased that our President has announced his support  for this legislation. I want to strongly encourage our colleagues and  friends over in the House of Representatives to do their part once we  have taken care of business here and send the Fire Grants and Safety  Act to the President's desk.   Mr. President, I want to go back a little in time. I remember a time  when my sister and I were young and playing with other kids in our  neighborhood. Maybe our cousins were with us. We had a firetruck. In  fact, we had a couple of little firetrucks. We would take turns being a  firefighter. Some days we would put out fires, and other days we would  respond to imaginary weather events that endangered our community where  we lived.   Later on, decades later, my sister would have her kids--a son and  daughter--and my wife and I had a couple of boys, and one of their  favorite toys was firetrucks. On more than a few occasions, they and  their friends would come over to our house to play, and we would bring  out the firetrucks.   They didn't have anything else to do but fight fires. For them, it  was just  [[Page S1156]]  fun. They loved doing it--doing it with their neighbors and friends-- and loved doing it with their cousins who might be visiting with us.  That was fun for them.   In the real world, being a firefighter can be enormously satisfying.  I don't know that I would say it is fun. It is dangerous, and there is  a chance that someone will get hurt trying to help out other people,  and the risks can be, as we know, great. I just want to make sure that  those young kids who grow up to be firefighters--like the ones whom we  honored this past month in the Bridgeville Fire Company in Southern  Delaware--I just want to make sure they know that we value them. We  value their service. We value their willingness to risk their own lives  on behalf of other people, including people they may not even know.   In the legislation that is before us, we have the opportunity to make  that clear to firefighters around the country--States large and small,  east and west, blue and red--how much we value them and the service  they provide to so many of us.   That is what I have today. I don't see anybody else yearning to  address our colleagues.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I don't rise every day to oppose  amendments offered by Senator Lee. I am afraid I am going to have to  oppose this one for a couple of reasons.   One, as the chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and  Public Works and as a recovering Governor who has helped run a State  and was actually the chair of the National Governors Association for a  while, I believe this amendment undercuts the National Environmental  Policy Act and the Federal Government's important role in managing our  Federal lands.   While I appreciate the need for Federal Agencies and States to work  together to minimize wildfire risks on our public lands, this  amendment, I am sorry to say, misses the mark.   Specifically, this amendment would require--and I underline the word  ``require''--this amendment would require the Forest Service and the  Bureau of Land Management to allow States to take over Federal  responsibilities for environmental reviews of many activities on public  lands. This would be a  [[Page S1158]]  significant change in the management of our public lands, which belong,  as we know, to all Americans.   Although Senator Lee's proposal is modeled on a program at the  Department of Transportation that allows States to assume some  responsibilities for highway projects, this amendment is far broader in  scope and impact and lacks the numerous safeguards that are in place  for the highway program.   For instance, this amendment establishes mandatory--I emphasize  ``mandatory''--not discretionary assignment of responsibilities to  States. It has no requirement, as best I can tell, for public notice  and comment and does not require the Federal Agency to verify that the  State has the resources and the personnel available to carry out  Federal responsibilities. It also includes, as best I can tell, no  auditing or monitoring requirements.   I am working with my colleagues, I believe on both sides of the  aisle, on opportunities to improve environmental review procedures. But  I must say, this is not the right vehicle or way to proceed on this  provision, and I am reluctantly going to have to urge our colleagues to  vote no on this particular amendment.    I yield the floor.    I don't think I have got this wrong. I may be mistaken,  but I don't think so.   I would just say, again, Senator Lee's proposal appears to be  modeling on a program at the Department of Transportation that allows  States--and I underline ``allows States''--to assume some  responsibilities, not all but some responsibilities, for highway  projects.   Having said that, this amendment is far broader in scope and impact  and lacks the numerous safeguards that are in place for the highway  program. For example, this amendment establishes mandatory--mandatory,  not discretionary--assignment of responsibilities to States. In doing  that, it has no requirement for public notice. It does not require the  Federal Agency to verify that the State has either the resources or the  personnel available to carry out Federal responsibilities. Moreover, as  best I can tell, this mandate includes no auditing or monitoring  requirements. That should give all of us pause. That should give all of  us pause and cause for concern.   Having said that, I am working with our colleagues on opportunities  to improve environmental review procedures, but I just don't believe  this is the right vehicle for the way to proceed on this particular  provision. I look forward to discussing it further with our colleague  from Utah in the days ahead, but for now I am going to urge our  colleagues to vote no on this amendment.    Yes, Mr. President.    Mr. President, I am looking at the language of the  amendment.   On page 4, subparagraph (D), which is entitled ``Verification of  Resources,'' reads--I will read part of this. It says:         As a condition on entering into an agreement under       paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned may require a State or       [may require] an Indian Tribe to verify that the State or an       Indian Tribe has the financial and personnel resources       necessary to carry out the responsibilities described in that       paragraph.    It doesn't say ``should.'' It doesn't say ``must.'' It says ``may  require a State or . . . Indian tribe to verify that the State or  Indian Tribe has the financial and personnel resources necessary to  carry out the responsibilities described in that paragraph.''    I, again, have significant concerns here. I appreciate the intent of  the author of the amendment, but I will just reiterate again the  concerns that the more I look at this, the more concerned I am. I would  rather be less concerned but more concerned I have become.   With that, I yield back my time.    I am not prepared to know whether or not there are other  safeguards--I appreciate the good intent that the Senator from Utah is  showing. But standing here on the fly, I am just reluctant to say that  if you change this one place and this one word in this proposal, then I  am OK with all of it. I will need a little bit of time to work on it  and decide. It is hard to do it on the fly.    This is the last thing I would say with respect to this  amendment. If this amendment is not adopted, I would say to the Senator  from Utah, I welcome the opportunity for my staff and your staff to sit  down and talk through it and to better understand our concerns and  better understand where you are coming from.    Yes. We will keep on it.    Madam President, I have 11 requests for committees to  [[Page S1217]]  meet during today's session of the Senate.
