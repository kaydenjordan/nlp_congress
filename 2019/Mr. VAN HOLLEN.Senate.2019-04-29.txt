 Mr. President, today we say farewell to a member of  our Senate family: Julianna Albowicz. For more than 20 years, Julianna  has served the U.S. Senate and the residents of Maryland.   Julianna started her career in the U.S. Senate working for my friend,  Senator Barbara Mikulski. After her retirement, Senator Mikulski let me  know that Julianna was the ``real deal'' in western Maryland and that  Julianna knew everyone and everyone knew Julianna. Senator Mikulski was  right. I was delighted that Julianna signed on as my western Maryland  regional director after my election to the U.S. Senate in 2016.   Julianna started her Federal service in 1965 as a supply clerk at the  U.S. Naval Station in Keflavik, Iceland, where her husband Bill was  stationed. When she returned stateside, she worked at the National  Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, MD, as a purchasing agent until 1970.   Julianna and her husband owned and operated Hoff, Inc., a family  retail business, for 31 years in the town of Clear Spring, MD, while  serving in various elective offices for the town, first as councilwoman  and then as vice mayor. When her husband died in 2002, Julianna sold  the business. With her children grown, she decided to learn computer  skills and eventually landed what she referred to as her ``dream job,''  working for an elected official.   Let me tell you, Julianna has been a dream to work with. I could  always count on Julianna to be everywhere serving our constituents in  western Maryland. Whether it was representing me at Fort Detrick in  Frederick County or crossing over the western Maryland ``Alps'' to  Garrett County, Julianna performed her duties with dedication,  diligence, and professionalism. I don't think there is a firehall, a  family business, or a nonprofit organization that hasn't met Julianna  or hasn't had a Senate citation presented on my behalf by Julianna.  Fittingly, Julianna was recognized for her accomplishments recently  when she was named a Woman of Achievement by the Hagerstown Business  and Professional Women.   We wish Julianna well as she turns the page into a new chapter of her  life, which will enable her to spend well-deserved time with her  beloved children: Vincent, a police officer in Boulder City, NV; Kay,  who worked for the National Association of Secretaries of State; Marc,  a first class deputy for the Washington County, MD, sheriff's  department; and Nikole, who works at the U.S. Treasury Department. Most  importantly, she will have more time to dote on her eight  grandchildren: William, Dillon, Carter, Wyatt, Julia, Dalton, Claire,  and Vivien.   I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our deepest gratitude to  Julianna Albowicz for all that she has done for the residents of  Maryland and the U.S. Senate and in wishing her well in the years to  come.                            ____________________
