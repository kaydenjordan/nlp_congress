 Madam Speaker, I include the letters that I have in my  hand in the Record.          International Federation of Professional & Technical             Engineers, AFL-CIO & CLC,                                     Washington, DC, July 15, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of 90,000 workers       represented by the International Federation of Professional       and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), we are writing to urge you       to vote for the passage of H.R. 748, the Middle Class Health       Benefits Tax Repeal Act. This important bipartisan       legislation repeals the 40 percent ``Cadillac Tax'' on high-      cost employer-sponsored health care plans--set to take effect       in 2022--that millions of working and retired Americans       depend on.        Since the 40 percent excise tax was enacted as part of the       Patient Protection & Affordable Care Act, out of pocket       health care costs have continued to increase faster than       wages. At the bargaining table, workers in all sectors of the       economy are accepting lower or no pay increases, and cuts to       other important benefits in exchange for an employer-provided       health benefit that is both affordable and meets the health       needs of their families. If this tax is not repealed,       millions of workers and retirees will see the gains from       these tradeoffs fall by the wayside, while the underlying       issues driving health care costs will go unaddressed.        Analysis by the Congressional Research Service and the       Congressional Budget Office shows that the costs of this tax       will be passed onto workers in the form of lower wages,       reduced benefits, and the loss of coverage options. Even       though the excise tax has not taken effect yet, it has       already affected the benefits and quality of employer-      sponsored health insurance. Employers themselves admit that       they have little appetite for providing a health care       benefits that could end up triggering the 40% excise tax. In       anticipation of the tax's original effective date in 2018,       the American Health Policy Institute reported in 2015 that       ``Almost 90 percent of large employers are taking steps to  [[Page H5963]]       try to prevent their company from having a plan that triggers       the excise tax.'' In the federal sector, the OPM's Federal       Employees Health Benefits Program carrier guidance tells       insurance companies to design plans to avoid triggering the       excise tax.        If the excise tax is allowed to take effect, it will       further burden working families instead of addressing the       factors that continue to drive up the cost of health care. As       it stands, the excise tax will go into effect in 2022 on       plans that exceed annual limits of $11,500 for individual       coverage and $31,100 for family coverage and will be chained       to inflation. By and large, plans that will be subject to the       excise tax have high costs not due to generous benefits, but       because of demographic factors, geographic disparities,       market concentration, and risk pool size.        H.R. 748 has board support from affected stakeholders,       including unions, public and private sector employers, health       advocacy organizations, and health insurance providers.       Today, a bipartisan majority in the House recognizes that the       excise tax will result in reduced health benefits and       coverage options, lower wages and pension benefits, hurt       employers who are trying to provide competitive benefits to       employees, while failing to address the real cost drivers in       the health care system.        Therefore, we urge you to vote for H.R. 748.            Sincerely,      Paul Shearon,        President.      Matthew Biggs,        Secretary-Treasurer/Legislative Director.                                   ____                             International Association of Machinists                                           and Aerospace Workers,                                  Upper Marlboro, MD, July 15, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the International       Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (1AM), I       strongly urge you to support working families and vote       ``Yes'' on the bipartisan Middle Class Health Benefits Tax       Repeal of 2019, H.R. 748. This vital legislation introduced       by Representatives Joe Courtney (D-CT) and Mike Kelly (R-PA)       would rightly repeal the 40% health benefits tax on employer-      sponsored healthcare before working Americans and their       families are further impacted by this onerous tax.        In a time where so many Americans are feeling the pinch of       rising healthcare costs, the so-called ``Cadillac Tax'', as       it is commonly known, is a gut punch directed squarely at the       middle class and working families. Despite several delays in       its implementation, millions of Americans are already feeling       the impact of the 40 percent health benefits tax. They feel       its impact at the doctor's office and at the bargaining table       as employers increase deductibles, reduce benefits, and drop       plan options to prepare for the tax's looming threat. In       order to halt its harmful repercussions on American workers,       the tax must not simply be further delayed, but swiftly       repealed.        Originally, the 40% health benefits tax was intended only       to be levied only on ``gold-plated'' health insurance plans       with very rich benefits. However, the realities of continued       medical cost inflation, an aging workforce, and new medical       technologies are pushing the cost of even modest plans above       the tax's threshold. We also know that the impact of the tax       would disproportionately burden certain demographics that       often face higher healthcare premiums. Plans hit by the tax       often cover more female employees, more workers with       dependent children, more senior workers, employees at smaller       businesses, and employees with physically demanding jobs.        To be clear, it is not employers or insurance companies who       will end up shouldering the tax's burden; it is workers and       middle-class families who end up floating the bill for this       regressive tax. Researchers at CUNY School of Public Health       found the 40 percent health benefits tax will       ``disproportionately harm families with incomes between       $38,550 and $100,000, while sparing the wealthy''. This tax       will only serve to increase healthcare costs and reduce       benefits for working Americans in a time where they simply       cannot afford to pay more for less coverage.        For all of these reasons, I urge you to support working       families and vote ``Yes'' on H.R. 748, the Middle Class       Health Benefits Tax Repeal of 2019.            Thank you,                                              Robert Martinez, Jr.,      International President.                                   ____                                           International Brotherhood                                                    of Teamsters,                                      Washington, DC, July 15, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: This week, the House of       Representatives will consider H.R. 748, the Middle Class       Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2019. On behalf of the more       than 1.4 million members of the International Brotherhood of       Teamsters, I ask you to vote yes on H.R. 748. This bipartisan       legislation would repeal the excise tax on high value       employer sponsored health insurance (ESI), often referred to       as the ``Cadillac Tax''.        The Teamsters have long opposed proposals that tax worker       health benefits. Attempts to tax employer provided health       care benefits through the 40 percent excise tax on high       quality health care plans reduce the health benefits that       hard working Americans receive and increase their out of       pocket costs. Policy makers should not penalize, with an       egregious tax, employers that do the right thing and provide       high value health insurance to their workers.        More than 181 million people (a majority of the country)       receive employer sponsored insurance. While the tax is       ``levied'' on employers, experts expect costs largely to be       shifted to workers and their families. And, it is       unconscionable that hard working Americans will continue to       have this 40 percent penalty on benefits that they have       fought hard to achieve/receive looming over them. While this       tax does not take effect until 2022, having twice been       delayed by Congress, this egregious tax is already hollowing       out the benefits of working people who have employment-based       coverage. Indeed, employers are already scaling back their       health care benefits and offerings, and/or increasing       workers' out of pocket costs.        In recent years, deductibles and out of pocket costs of ESI       plans have risen considerably, while costs continue to grow.       According to the CUNY School of Public Health research, the       health benefits tax predominantly impacts the middle class.       Congress should be looking for ways to strengthen the middle       class instead of promoting policies that will ultimately take       money from their hard earned paychecks and reduce, and make       more costly, the health care benefits they receive.        I call on you to support the full and permanent repeal of       the so-called ``Cadillac Tax''. I hope that I can report to       our members that you stood with the International Brotherhood       of Teamsters family to pass this important legislation. Vote       yes on H.R. 748.            Sincerely,                                                    James P. Hoffa,      General President.                                   ____                                           International Association                                                of Fire Fighters,                                      Washington, DC, July 16, 2019.        Dear Representative: The International Association of Fire       Fighters represents more than 316,000 professional fire       fighters and emergency medical personnel, working in every       state in the nation. We strongly support the bipartisan       Middle-Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2019 (HR 748)       and request that you vote YES this Wednesday when it is       considered under suspension of the rules.        Voting yes on HR 748 would repeal the 40 percent tax on       employer-provided health insurance and protect the healthcare       that so many public safety workers have fought to get and       protect.        This ill-conceived tax was originally sold to lower and       slow the rate of healthcare costs. What the tax actually does       is shift more costs onto consumers through higher       deductibles, copays and coinsurance. Taxing health plans with       high premiums will do nothing to drive down costs because the       real drivers of those costs are age, gender and geography. As       a result, this tax will punish fire fighters based on who       they work with or where they live, and that is both bad       policy and unfair to workers.        Proponents of the tax argued it would only target the       richest Americans, but that too turned out to be untrue. Most       plans that would fall victim to this tax cover working class,       middle-income Americans. Fire fighters in particular, fall       into this category. The dangerous nature and high risks       associated with working in the fire service make fire       fighters' health plans critically important; workers will       often choose to protect their health care over increased pay.        Taxing health benefits will undermine an integral component       of our health care system. One of the primary reasons why       most Americans receive health care coverage through their       employer is owed to the fact that their benefits are not       taxed. At the risk of weakening health benefits, depressing       wages and burdening workers with higher taxes, we should not       support policies that tax health care for American workers.        While the tax does not go into effect until 2022, the IAFF       seeks its immediate repeal. Many of our members negotiate       multi-year contracts that are directly impacted by the       eventual implementation of this tax. The time for incremental       relief is over. Congress must pass HR 748 and fully repeal       the excise tax on employer-provided health insurance.        When the House votes tomorrow on this measure, I ask that       you stand with all public safety workers and vote YES. Thank       you for your considered support on this important issue.            Respectfully,                                            Harold A. Schaitberger,      General President.                                   ____                                                 International Union                                          of Operating Engineers,                                                      July 16, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: On behalf of       400,000 members of the International Union of Operating       Engineers and their families, I respectfully request that you       support H.R. 748, the Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal       Act of 2019.        The International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE)       represents nearly 400,000 working men and women in the United       States and Canada, thousands of whom would be affected by       this 40% tax on high-cost health insurance premiums.        As you know, Congress has acted twice to delay this tax--      its current effective date is  [[Page H5964]]       January 1, 2022--but multi-year collective bargaining       negotiations are now underway and the uncertainty surrounding       the possible imposition of the tax is already pushing       employers to hollow out the health-care benefits of their       workers. The excise tax on high-premium health plans should       be permanently repealed.        Proponents of the tax argued that it would incentivize       employers to move away from ``overly generous'' health care       coverage. They argued that forcing workers to have more       ``skin in the game'' would reduce ``overutilization'' of       health care services, forcing people to consider the       financial implications of seeking care. Surveys of employers       over the years have shown that they have reduced coverage       under their health plans in anticipation of the tax. The tax,       however, would have no effect on a ``unit cost'' of health       care.        In the decade since the tax was enacted, it is clear that       the health care affordability crisis now affects millions of       individuals with employment-based coverage. From 2008-2018,       the general annual deductible for family coverage has       increased 212 percent, while workers' earnings have only       increased 26 percent. This tax is clearly having a negative       impact on working families, and its repeal is overdue.        The International Union of Operating Engineers supports       H.R. 748 and respectfully requests that you repeal the tax on       high-cost health insurance premiums as quickly as possible.       We believe that permanent repeal of the 40-percent tax should       be a top priority for this 116th Congress, and we look       forward to working with you to enact it into law.        Thank you for your leadership on this vital issue for       Operating Engineers and their families.            Sincerely,                                                 James T. Callahan,                                                 General President.     Madam Speaker, I support this legislation, H.R. 748.   During our discussions on health reform in 2009, many of us strongly  opposed the excise tax on so-called Cadillac employer-provided health  plans. We were successful in keeping it out of the House version of the  bill, but we all know it ended up in the final bill. It has been  delayed since then, but now it is enactment time. This is imminent. We  need to do something now.   The Cadillac tax would impact employers and families whose health  insurance plans cost more than $11,100 for an individual and $29,750  for family coverage. This is not a small universe, and the effects will  be highly negative.   If we do nothing, this tax would fall squarely on employees,  encouraging employers to shift away from tax-free health benefits to  taxable wages.   As deductibles have risen more than 200 percent in the employer- sponsored insurance plans, the cost of care has continued to grow while  wages remain flat. We must ensure that employers can continue to  provide high-quality healthcare.   I urge my colleagues to support the bipartisan repeal of the Cadillac  tax.
