 Mr. President, I rise to speak on two issues, but, first,  I would  [[Page S5972]]  like to ask unanimous consent that the New York Times article entitled  ``We Are No Strangers to Human Suffering, but We've Seen Nothing Like  the Siege of Gaza'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Dec. 11, 2023]  We Are No Strangers to Human Suffering, But We've Seen Nothing Like the                               Siege of Gaza    (By Michelle Nunn, Tjada D'Oyen McKenna, Jan Egeland, Abby Maxman,                    Jeremy Konyndyk and Janti Soeripto)         We are no strangers to human suffering--to conflict, to       natural disasters, to some of the world's largest and gravest       catastrophes. We were there when fighting erupted in       Khartoum, Sudan. As bombs rained down on Ukraine. When       earthquakes leveled southern Turkey and northern Syria. As       the Horn of Africa faced its worst drought in years. The list       goes on.        But as the leaders of some of the world's largest global       humanitarian organizations, we have seen nothing like the       siege of Gaza. In the more than two months since the       horrifying attack on Israel that killed more than 1,200       people and resulted in some 240 abductions, about 18,000       Gazans--including more than 7,500 children--have been killed,       according to the Gazan health ministry. More children have       been reported killed in this conflict than in all major       global conflicts combined last year.        The atrocities committed by Hamas on Oct. 7 were       unconscionable and depraved, and the taking and holding of       hostages is abhorrent. The calls for their release are urgent       and justified. But the right to self-defense does not and       cannot require unleashing this humanitarian nightmare on       millions of civilians. It is not a path to accountability,       healing or peace. In no other war we can think of in this       century have civilians been so trapped, without any avenue or       option to escape to save themselves and their children.        Most of our organizations have been operating in Gaza for       decades. But we can do nothing remotely adequate to address       the level of suffering there without an immediate and       complete cease-fire and an end to the siege. The aerial       bombardments have rendered our jobs impossible. The       withholding of water, fuel, food and other basic goods has       created an enormous scale of need that aid alone cannot       offset.        Global leaders--and especially the United States       government--must understand that we cannot save lives under       these conditions. A significant change in approach from the       U.S. government is needed today to pull Gaza back from this       abyss.        For a start, the Biden administration must stop its       diplomatic interference at the United Nations, blocking calls       for a cease-fire.        Since the pause in fighting ended, we are again witnessing       an exceptionally high level of bombardment, and at increasing       ferocity. The few areas left in Gaza that are untouched by       bombardment are shrinking by the hour, forcing more and more       civilians to seek safety that does not exist. Over 80 percent       of 2.3 million Gazans are now displaced. The newest Israeli       offensive is now forcing them to cluster on a tiny sliver of       land.        The bombardment is not the only thing brutally cutting       lives short. The siege of--and blockades surrounding--Gaza       have led to a critical food scarcity, cutoffs of medical       supplies and electricity, and a lack of clean water. There is       barely any medical care to be found in the enclave and few       medications. Surgeons are working by the light of their       mobile phones, without anesthetics. They are using dishcloths       as bandages. The risk of waves of waterborne and infectious       disease will only grow in the increasingly overcrowded living       conditions of the displaced.        One of our colleagues in Gaza recently described their       struggle to feed an orphaned infant who had been rescued from       the rubble of an airstrike. The baby had not eaten for days       after her mother's death. Colleagues could only scrounge up       powdered milk--not formula, not breast milk, and not a       nutritionally suitable infant food--to help stave off her       starvation.        Before the war, hundreds of truckloads of aid were needed       each day to support Gazans' daily existence. Only a trickle       of that required aid has made it into Gaza in the two months       since the war began. But even if more were allowed in, our       work in Gaza is dependent on ensuring our teams can move       safely to set up warehouses, shelters, health clinics,       schools, and water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure.        Today our staff members are not safe. They tell us they're       making the daily choice of staying with their families in one       place so that they can die together or go out to seek water       and food.        Among leaders in Washington, there is constant talk about       preparing for the ``day after.'' But if this relentless       bombardment and siege continue, there will be no ``day       after'' for Gaza. It will be too late. Hundreds of thousands       of lives hang in the balance today.        So far, American diplomacy in this war has not delivered on       the goals President Biden has conveyed: protection of       innocent civilians, adherence to humanitarian law, more aid       delivery. To stop Gaza's apocalyptic free fall, the Biden       administration must take tangible measures, as it does in       other conflicts, to up the ante with all parties to the       conflict and bordering countries.        Secretary of State Antony Blinken once said of the war in       Ukraine that the targeting of heat, water and electricity was       a ``brutalization of Ukraine's people'' and ``barbaric.'' The       Biden administration should acknowledge that the same holds       true in Gaza. While it has announced measures to deter       violence against Palestinian civilians in the West Bank, Mr.       Blinken and his colleagues should apply similar pressure to       stop violence against civilians in Gaza, too.        The harrowing events unfolding before us are shaping a       global narrative that, if unchanged, will reveal a legacy of       indifference in the face of unspeakable suffering, bias in       the application of the laws of conflict and impunity for       actors that violate international humanitarian law.        The U.S. government must act now--and fight for humanity.    Mr. President, this article is authored by some  remarkable people: Michelle Nunn, president and chief executive of  CARE; Tjada McKenna, chief executive of Mercy Corps; Jan Egeland,  secretary general of the Norwegian Refugee Council; Abby Maxman,  president and chief executive of Oxfam; Jeremy Konyndyk, president of  Refugees International; and Janti Soeripto, president and chief  executive of Save the Children U.S.   I would like to take a minute to read two paragraphs from this essay,  which I have just entered into the Congressional Record.   It reads as follows:         As leaders of some of the world's largest global       humanitarian organizations, we have seen nothing like the       siege of Gaza. In the more than two months since the       horrifying attack on Israel that killed more than 1,200       people and resulted in 240 abductions, about 18,000 Gazans--      including more than 7,500 children--have been killed,       according to the Gazan health ministry. More children have       been reported killed in this conflict than in all major       global conflicts combined last year.        The atrocities committed by Hamas on October 7 were       unconscionable and depraved, and the taking and holding of       hostages is abhorrent. The calls for their release are urgent       and justified. But the right to self-defense does not and       cannot require unleashing this humanitarian nightmare on       millions of civilians. It is not a path to accountability,       healing, or peace. In no other war we can think of in this       century have civilians been so trapped without any avenue or       option to escape or save themselves and their children.    I think this essay is worthy of all my colleagues and for the public  to read it. I hope they saw it initially in the New York Times and will  read it now.   Now I ask consent to go to a separate, unrelated topic.    Mr. President, 5 years ago, Congress came together to  pass the First Step Act, the most important criminal justice reform  legislation in a generation. I am happy to come to the floor today with  my colleague and friend Senator Booker of New Jersey and celebrate this  momentous anniversary.   The First Step Act passed the House and Senate by overwhelming  bipartisan majorities and was supported by a broad coalition from  across the political spectrum, including former President Donald Trump,  who signed it into law. I was proud to champion this landmark  legislation with the help of Senators Booker, Grassley, and Lee. It  took months of bipartisan negotiation and painful compromise, but the  net result was a historic victory that significantly improved our  system of justice.   I am thankful for the tireless efforts of many dedicated advocates  who never gave up hope that this law could be passed. It was a dramatic  change to finally acknowledge that just being tough on the so-called  war on drugs was not enough.   I often think back to my early days in the House of Representatives,  during the 1980s, when the crack epidemic was devastating America. I  vividly remember, in 1986, when the Nation reeled from the news that a  Maryland basketball player named Len Bias had died from a heart attack  induced by cocaine. All of the evidence points to it having been powder  cocaine. Somehow, his death, nevertheless, became a public symbol of  the crack epidemic.   Members of Congress were desperate to do something to stop the  despair caused by drugs in our communities and to punish the dealers  who were trafficking this new, highly addictive product. So we passed  legislation, the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, that established mandatory  minimum sentences for distribution of specific quantities of  [[Page S5973]]  drugs. We thought we would clearly deter people from selling drugs by  imposing tougher--tougher--sentences for larger quantities.   The law imposed much tougher sentences for crack cocaine offenses  than for powder cocaine offenses. An individual would receive a  minimum--minimum--5-year Federal prison sentence for selling just 5  grams of crack, the same sentence provided for selling 500 grams of  powder cocaine. At the time, we believed this 100-to-1 hit between  sentences for crack and powder cocaine was the right thing to do. We  were so frightened by the impact that crack was having in America.   But it became clear over the next 30 years that we were terribly,  terribly wrong. Instead of the price of crack going up, after the law  was passed because of reduced supply, the opposite occurred. The price  went down. Even though we were locking up more people than ever for  drug offenses, primarily African Americans, the amount of drugs on our  streets and the number of addicts was increasing.   Years after the law passed, I met a young African American from  Alton, IL, who told me the story of his sister Eugenia Jennings, also  from Alton. As a child, she was abandoned and seriously abused. At the  age of 15, she started using crack to dull the pain of her life. At the  age of 23, Eugenia was convicted for trading a small amount of crack  cocaine for clothing for her small children. She was sentenced to 22  years in a Federal prison--22 years.   She was a model prisoner while serving her sentence. While in prison,  she developed leukemia. I went to visit her in Greenville, IL, at the  Federal correctional center. I will never forget the moment when I  walked into the room and she was seated at the table. Then, she had  been in prison for over 10 years.   She talked about how nice it was that she was in Greenville, close  enough to Alton, IL, and that her children could visit. But she was  afraid because her cancer was taking her to a prison hospital in Texas,  and she wouldn't be able to see her children.   She said to me something I will never forget. She said:         ``I don't know how much longer I am going to live, Senator.       But I promise you this: If you can find some way to get me       out of prison to be with my girls, I'll never do anything       wrong again in my life.''    So I wrote a personal note, handwritten, to President Barack Obama,  asking him to commute Eugenia's sentence. He did, just in time for her  to see her eldest daughter graduate from high school. It was the thrill  of her life.   Sadly, Eugenia died less than 2 years later.   Her story was tragic in so many ways, but it inspired me to keep  working to pass legislation to help other individuals who had been  unjustly sentenced by our overly punitive laws. It became my personal  mission to correct these errors and fix a policy that was doing far  more harm than good.   We took a big step in that direction in 2010, when President Obama  signed into law a bill I authored, the Fair Sentencing Act. We reduced  the 100-to-1 crack-to-powder-cocaine disparity to 18 to 1, but the Fair  Sentencing Act was not retroactive, meaning that people were still  serving long, disparate sentences on crack cases after the law was  passed.   The First Step Act finally brought them relief, allowing them to be  resentenced under the 18-to-1 ratio. The First Step Act also created an  entirely new system programming in Federal prisons, designed to prevent  incarcerated people from reoffending, with a chance for them to earn  extra time in community confinement or supervised release at the end of  their sentence, a strong incentive for them to do the right thing while  in prison.   Last week, Senator Booker and I had the pleasure of meeting with a  group of individuals from an organization called Families Against  Mandatory Minimums. It was a great meeting. Many of the folks we met  had been incarcerated under the harsh 1980s drug law. I spoke with  them, including some from my own home State of Illinois.   One lady looked me in the eye, and she said: I was sentenced to life  without parole, and without your bill, I would still be there.   Several of them noted they would still be in prison today, and now  they were back with their families. They are back in their communities.  They are spending time and contributing to our society.   The reforms in the First Step Act have been tremendously successful.  I want to put these numbers on the record because they are so  important. Of the 29,944 incarcerated people released under the First  Step Act reforms through January 2023, only 12.4 percent have been  arrested for new crimes. By comparison, the overall recidivism rate in  the Bureau of Prisons currently stands at nearly 43 percent--12 percent  versus 43 percent. The success of the overwhelming majority of  individuals released under the First Step Act demonstrates that  reducing the population in our overcrowded prisons can be done safely  and effectively, and it is the right thing to do.   It is however, as its name, just the first step. To keep making our  justice system fairer and our communities safer, we must continue  reforming our outdated sentencing laws and provide opportunities for  those incarcerated to successfully return. I hope Congress will take  many more steps in this direction toward more just criminal sentences.   There is a natural impulse--Mr. President, you know it; you have  heard it; you have seen it--when we talk about narcotics and drug  crime, to say: If we can just get tough, if we get the message out  there that we are going to impose tough sentences, then they will stop  using.   We tried it. It was a disastrous failure when it came to crack  cocaine.   Let's not just get tough. Let's get smart when it comes to sentencing  people. Let's realize an addiction is more than just a curse in the  person's life. It is a medical situation that can be resolved many  times, and we can do it if we work conscientiously to make America  safer.   I hope that Congress takes steps in that direction for more just  criminal sentences and wiser responses to the crisis of substance abuse  in America.   And now I am going to turn the floor over to a man who has become a  close friend and an ally in this effort.   When he first came to Congress, Cory Booker may have been new to the  Federal level of this issue, but he certainly had ample experience when  it came to State and local enforcement of drug laws because of the fact  that he was the mayor of the city of Newark, NJ, of which he reminds us  frequently--as he should.   He has led on this issue personally in his home and in his community.  He has seen the devastation it can cause. He has the same hope that I  do--that rather than just say no, these individuals are given a chance  to find a new way in life to overcome their addiction and become  contributing members across America.   I yield the floor to Senator Booker.    Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague. He is  outstanding as a Senator and extraordinary as a public speaker. I thank  him very much for really driving the message home.   I am sure he would join me in adding our congratulations and thanks  to dutiful staff members who worked without any kind of reluctance for  months and years to get this project done.   I want to name two of them, and there are others--Joe Zogby, who is  my  [[Page S5975]]  chief of staff on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Dan Swanson, who  is no longer serving with me. Those two did an exceptional job on this  issue and showed the kind of patience that was absolutely essential for  success. So I want to add those to the list of those I have thanked.    I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr.  Blumenthal) is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Jerry Edwards, Jr., to the U.S. District Court for the Western District  of Louisiana.   Born in Shreveport, LA, Mr. Edwards received his B.A. from Georgia  State University and his J.D. from Vermont Law and Graduate School  before clerking for Judge Scott J. Crichton and Judge Jeanette G.  Garrett on the First Judicial District Court of Louisiana. He then  entered private practice in Shreveport, where he maintained a diverse  litigation practice. In 2019, Mr. Edwards joined the U.S. Attorney's  Office for the Western District of Louisiana as an assistant U.S.  attorney. He defended Federal Agencies in civil cases and also handled  affirmative work on behalf of Federal Agencies. In 2022, he was  appointed first assistant U.S. attorney. In that role, he oversees  civil litigation and the prosecution of various Federal crimes.   Mr. Edwards has significant experience in both State and Federal  court, and he has tried nine cases to verdict, including two jury  trials. Mr. Edwards has also been involved in a variety of legal  activities outside of his legal practice. He is a member of the  Louisiana Supreme Court Committee on Bar Admissions, and he previously  served on the Louisiana Judiciary Commission.   Mr. Edwards enjoys the strong support of both of his home State  Senators--Mr. Cassidy and Mr. Kennedy--as well as the Louisiana legal  community. The American Bar Association unanimously rated Mr. Edwards  as ``well qualified'' to serve on the Western District of Louisiana. If  confirmed, he will be the first person of color to ever sit on the U.S.  District Court for the Western District of Louisiana.   During Mr. Edwards's confirmation hearing, Senator Cassidy noted that  ``Mr. Edwards's commitment to his community and bar is a personal  credit to the character required to be a successful judge.'' I am  confident that Mr. Edwards' character, strong ties to the Western  District of Louisiana, and extensive legal experience ensure that he  will be a successful judge on the Federal bench. I strongly support his  nomination, and I urge my colleagues to join me.    I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr.  Blumenthal) and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Welch) are necessarily  absent.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to resume  consideration of the Long nomination.    Mr. President, today, the Senate will vote to confirm  Brandon S. Long to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of  Louisiana.   Born in Metairie, LA, Mr. Long received his B.B.A. and B.A. from the  University of Texas at Austin in 1999 and his J.D. from Duke Law School  in 2005. From 2005 to 2010, Mr. Long worked in the Washington, DC,  office of King & Spalding, LLP, as an associate in the special matters  and government investigations practice group. While in private  practice, he focused on Federal criminal matters, internal  investigations, corporate compliance, and civil matters involving  securities law.   Mr. Long then served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the U.S.  Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia from 2010 to 2014.  There, he tried approximately 27 criminal cases to verdict, of which 15  were jury trials and 12 were bench trials. Since 2014, Mr. Long has  served as an AUSA in the Eastern District of Louisiana. From 2017 to  2018, he served as deputy chief of the narcotics unit. Mr. Long also  served as the office's opioid coordinator from 2017 to 2020. For a  brief stint from 2020 to 2021, Mr. Long served on detail as deputy  chief of staff and acting chief of staff to FBI Director Christopher  Wray. In 2021, he returned to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the  Eastern District of Louisiana, where he serves as a member of the  financial crimes unit.   The American Bar Association unanimously rated Mr. Long as ``well  qualified,'' and his nomination is strongly supported by his home state  Senators, Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Cassidy.   Mr. Long will serve the Eastern District of Louisiana with  distinction.   I am proud to support his nomination and urge my colleagues to do the  same.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture  motion with respect to the Long nomination be withdrawn.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the  nomination.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr.  Blumenthal), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Sanders), and the  Senator from Vermont (Mr. Welch) are necessarily absent.
