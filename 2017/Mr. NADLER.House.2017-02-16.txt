 Madam Speaker, Republicans are continuing their crusade  to cut off access to comprehensive family planning services. Last year  they tried to zero out title X in their budget. This year they intend  to repeal ACA's cost-free contraception coverage for women with private  insurance. Today Republicans are attempting to stop the flow of title X  grants to health centers around the country.   Title X grants ensure that low-income families have access to birth  control and can plan their pregnancies so that moms and kids stay  healthy. Research has shown that without these vital services, the  unintended pregnancy rate would be 33 percent higher and the number of  abortions would also be higher. My anti-choice Republican colleagues  should cheer this program, but instead not only are Republicans trying  to defund Planned Parenthood so they won't be able to provide  contraception help, but now we are hypocritically rolling back a rule  that allows title X funds to flow to reproductive health centers, which  are the most effective providers of title X services and which we were  told would provide the contraception and other health services that  Planned Parenthood no longer would be able to.                                time  1445    Women are watching us today. They know that this joint resolution is  nothing more than another attempt to stop low-income women from  accessing the health care they need and to allow the government to once  again step between women and their doctors.   It is no secret I support a woman's constitutional right to access  abortion; but even if you don't and are committed to reducing abortion  in this country, you should step up to the plate and support  comprehensive and robust family planning for all women. This joint  resolution should do the opposite. We should all support contraception  for the women of this country.   I urge my colleagues to reject this joint resolution.
