 Mr. Speaker, in the past 5 years, the DACA program has  given nearly 800,000 young men and women who came here as children, and  have only known the United States as their home, a shot at the American  Dream. It rightfully allowed them to come forward to live, work, and  learn in the United States legally, and without fear of deportation.   President Trump, this week, made his most heartless decision  yesterday by cruelly rescinding DACA protection for these young  DREAMers. These DREAMers now face the painful reality of a President  betraying their trust, forcing them back into the shadows, and kicking  them out of their homes.   These kids put their faith in our government to protect them. They  underwent rigorous background checks and paid the required fees, all  for an opportunity to better themselves and their communities. And we  are failing them.   I share a similar story as many of these DREAMers. I emigrated to the  United States with my parents as a 5-year-old boy from Mexico. This  great country since has given me the opportunity to work hard, raise my  two children, and serve my country in local  [[Page H7109]]  government, the military, and here in Congress.   Terminating DACA and stripping DREAMers of that same hope and  opportunity is unconscionable and incompatible with our American  values. We are a nation of immigrants and are made stronger by their  contributions. Following the President's shameful decision this week,  Congress must take action and pass the bipartisan Dream Act which would  provide a permanent legislative solution to allow DREAMers to remain in  the United States and continue to contribute to our Nation's future.   They are our neighbors, our children's classmates, our coworkers.  These are all hardworking and law-abiding individuals. We cannot afford  to abandon DACA recipients who have lived in America all of their lives  and contribute to this country in many ways.   Ending this program undermines our economic growth and  competitiveness, costing our economy $490 billion in lost GDP over the  next decade, in addition to losing potential innovation and  entrepreneurship.   This House has already passed the DREAM Act in 2010, and a majority  of Senators also supported this legislation. However, it fell short  with a filibuster from then-Senator Jeff Sessions, the same Attorney  General who announced the termination of DACA this week.   This Congress must now ensure the well-being and future of these  800,000 youth living and working in the United States. I urge my  colleagues to stand up for DREAMers by bringing H.R. 3440, the  bipartisan Dream Act, immediately to the floor for a vote.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to refrain from  engaging in personalities toward the President.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title) insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to process any application under the Outer       Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) for a       permit to drill or a permit to modify that would authorize       use of hydraulic fracturing or acid well stimulation       treatment in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from California (Mr. Carbajal) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division A (before the short title) insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to process any application under the Outer       Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.) for a       permit to drill or a permit to modify that would authorize       use of hydraulic fracturing or acid well stimulation       treatment in the Pacific Outer Continental Shelf.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from California (Mr. Carbajal) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, I am offering my amendment on behalf of  my constituents on the central coast of California. It simply prevents  the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management from issuing any new permits that  would allow companies to use hydraulic fracturing or acid well  stimulation, otherwise known as fracking, in Federal waters off the  West Coast. It will prohibit the use of fiscal year 2018 funds to  process any new applications for this purpose. This would provide us  more time to study whether offshore fracking is safe for the  environment and public health.   In 2013, we learned that offshore fracking had been occurring off  California's coast for more than two decades. In the Santa Barbara  Channel alone, there have been more than a dozen documented instances  of offshore fracking, yet we know very little about the environmental  and health impacts this has had on our communities.   Already, the United States Geological Survey has concluded that the  practice of injecting pressurized water into deep rock formations  causes earthquakes. My constituents deserve to know the risks  associated with offshore fracking on our environment, marine life, and  public health.   My constituents have seen the devastating impacts of some of the  largest oil spills in California's history, like the 1969 Santa Barbara  oil spill. My amendment echoes my constituents' concern surrounding the  impacts of offshore fracking and prohibits the use of funds to process  any new applications for this purpose.   This is a commonsense measure that we should implement until we know  all the facts and risks associated with this practice.   Mr. Chair, I urge passage of my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will note that oil platforms off  California's coast are already permitted to dump 9 billion gallons of  wastewater, including fracking chemicals, into the ocean each year.   Fracking increases air pollution and can expose coastal communities  to air pollutants that cause cancer and other illnesses.   Most offshore fracking jobs have occurred within 3 miles of the  coast. Injecting fracking wastewater underground can induce  earthquakes, and all of southern California's offshore injection wells  are within 3 miles of an active fault.   These are just a few reasons why it is important to pass this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California  will be postponed.                                time  2230                    amendment no. 59 offered by mr. perry    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 59  printed in House Report 115-297.
