 Madam Speaker, I rise today in memory of Dr.  Ahmad Jaber, who passed away last week after a lifetime spent building  New York's thriving Muslim-American community.   Dr. Jaber was a towering figure who rose from humble origins. He was  a proud Palestinian who won prestigious scholarships to study medicine  in Iraq, Jordan, and later to do his residency in this great country.   As a young doctor, Dr. Jaber had done and seen more than most people  do in a lifetime, but he did not stop there. He built his medical  practice in Sunset Park into a thriving business, personally delivering  more than 5,000 babies.   He attended to his community's spiritual needs, and he was a fixture  at his mosque, providing financial support as well as translating  sermons or offering medical assistance. Dr. Jaber helped found numerous  organizations throughout his life, which now carry on his legacy of  strengthening the Muslim-American community in New York and around the  country.   We need more people like Dr. Jaber in this country, people who leave  their mark on society through humble and dedicated work on behalf of  their community.   We are forever grateful to have benefited from Dr. Jaber's presence,  and he will be so deeply missed. Allah yerhamo.                            ____________________
