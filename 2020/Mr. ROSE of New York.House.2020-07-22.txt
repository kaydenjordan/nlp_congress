 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the NO BAN  Act to finally repeal the racist and discriminatory Muslim bans that  have stained our Nation for the past 3 years.   The Muslim ban undermines everything that this great country stands  for, the greatest country in the history of the world.    It has torn apart my constituents' families and trapped their loved  ones in war zones and refugee camps. It has made Muslim Americans feel  like second class citizens in their very own country. They are  Americans just as much as I.   This ban has done nothing to make us safe. Senator John McCain, in  fact, once called the ban a self-inflicted wound in the fight against  terrorism.   The administration's own officials admit this does absolutely nothing  to protect our country. The State Department says that just one-tenth  of 1 percent of the people blocked from this country under the Muslim  ban was deemed a security risk. Those stats do not lie. DHS cannot  point to a single threat that our existing immigration policies and  systems would not have handled.   If we are going to fight for this country to fulfill its promise,  this ban must be overturned.
