 Madam Speaker, once again, we have to say: How  did we get to where we are today? How did we get to where we have to  have a debate to defend life that survives the heinous practice of  abortion?   In the infamous words of the Governor of my very State, the  Commonwealth of Virginia, just a few years ago, if a baby survives an  abortion attempt, the mother and the doctor would have a conversation  while they kept the baby comfortable to decide what to do with it. He  said that on air in a radio broadcast.   I realize that the other side may not recognize the science of  conception. I realize that the other side may not share the premium or  the value of innocent life in the womb that most Americans have. The  party of death that believes in abortion up until the moment of birth  at any time for any reason--today we find ourselves even having to  defend and protect life, a baby that survives an abortion attempt.   If it were not so, if it were not true, then this bill should pass  unanimously. I fear that will not be the case for this same party will  not even vote later today against and condemn the violence at pregnancy  centers across the country.   Madam Speaker, I encourage everyone to support this bill and protect  all life.
