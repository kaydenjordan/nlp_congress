 Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate  Professor George Pugh for his distinguished legal career and  outstanding tenure as an educator at the Paul M. Hebert Law Center at  Louisiana State University LSU. His dedication to the law, along with  his many accomplishments and military career, is exceptionally  impressive and displays his commitment to his community and fellow  American.   Pugh was born on Bayou Lafourche in 1925 and in 1942 began his  studies at LSU. In the midst of World War II, he volunteered for  military service and was deployed to France. After the war, he returned  to LSU after three semesters, he enrolled in LSU Law School. He earned  his juris doctor in 1950 and went on to Yale Law School to earn his  doctorate of juridical science in 1952. Later that year, he joined the  LSU Law School faculty as an assistant professor.   Pugh served 2 years on the Judicial Council as the State's first  judicial administrator for the Louisiana Supreme Court. He is known as  the ``intellectual father'' of the Louisiana Code of Evidence, as he  and his fellow co-reporters confected the Code of Evidence for the  Louisiana State Law Institute, using the Federal Rules of Evidence as  its model. It would be enacted into state law in 1998 and serve as an  invaluable resource for judges, district attorneys, and other legal  professionals. In all, he has provided 43 years of instruction to  almost three generations of students.   Pugh also served as a member of the Baton Rouge, LA, and American Bar  Associations, chairing several committees. He was a member of the  American Law Institute and received several invitations to teach at law  schools in America and around the globe. At LSU, he received the  ``Hub'' Cotton Faculty Excellence Award and an honorary doctorate of  law from the University of Aix-Marseille III in France, was named a  Sterling Fellow at Yale Law School, and was listed in ``Who's Who in  America.'' Upon retiring in 1994, the Louisiana Law Review dedicated  its January publication to Professor Pugh, as he had been its longtime  editor and associate editor.   I cannot congratulate Professor George Pugh without mentioning his  late wife of 60 years, Jean Hemphill. Together, they founded the George  W. and Jean H. Pugh Institute for Justice in 1998, working to promote  justice for individuals in the administration of criminal and civil  justice systems in Louisiana and around the world.   Professor Pugh's compilation of the Louisiana Code of Evidence,  distinguished teaching career, and contributions to the legal system of  Louisiana show the extent to which he has used his God-given talents to  make the world a better place. His incredible legal career and many  awards speak volumes to who he is as a Louisianan and an American.   Professor Pugh, you have made our State and our Nation proud.                            ____________________
