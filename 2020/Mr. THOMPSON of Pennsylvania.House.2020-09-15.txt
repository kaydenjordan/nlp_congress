 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor  the GIVE MILK Act with my Pennsylvania colleague Fred Keller.   The GIVE MILK Act is an important piece of legislation that gives  families who use the WIC program more control over the nutrition of  their children.   The bill would make 2 percent and whole milk available through the  WIC program to any child over the age of 2, reversing an Obama-era rule  limiting WIC participants to low-fat or non-fat milk.   This legislation will give families who depend on WIC more options  when considering nutritional options for their children. It will also  help increase milk consumption, which is a win for our dairy farmers.   Whole milk has been wrongfully targeted as unhealthy in recent years,  but in reality, it provides a wealth of vital nutrients that are  particularly important for growing children.   Including whole milk in the WIC program will provide a healthy option  for those families who find themselves depending upon these benefits  for essential nutrition.                            ____________________
