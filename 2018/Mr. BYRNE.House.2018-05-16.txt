 Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning, during National Police  Week, to recognize and remember the men and women in blue, who protect  and serve our local communities each and every day.   Law enforcement officers leave the safety of their homes each day not  knowing if they will pass back through their own front doors when their  day is done. They leave their families behind to ensure the safety of  our loved ones at schools, in neighborhoods, and on roadways. These  individuals are true public servants who answer the call and put their  lives on the line.   Among their many roles in the community, law enforcement officers  serve as role models for our children, keep the peace in our  neighborhoods, direct traffic for football games, and are the first to  respond when help is needed. Far too often we take their services for  granted.   This week, I am proud that the House is taking up a number of  important bills to support our local law enforcement. From legislation  to prevent attacks on our officers to providing funding for additional  resources, we are working to ensure that these dedicated individuals  have the tools they need to do their jobs and keep us safe.   See, our law enforcement officers are heroes who put their lives on  the line each day to keep our citizens from harm's way. National Police  Week is a time for us to stop and show our appreciation to these heroes  for all that they do for our communities. Our law enforcement officers  serve selflessly, facing the many dangers of the job with courage and  bravery.   Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity to ride along with members of  the Baldwin County Sheriff's Office in southwest Alabama. It was an  eye-opening experience.   At every single traffic stop, the deputies had no idea what to  expect. Every call was different, but each one came with an inherent  risk of the unknown. Despite the uncertainty, the deputies always  conducted themselves with respect and professionalism.   Whether it is a routine traffic stop or responding to a domestic  call, these officers have no idea how their encounters will turn out.  There is always the risk their interaction on the job can turn hostile  and, in some cases, even deadly.   National Police Week is also an opportunity to honor the heroes who  have lost their lives while serving our communities. In 2017, 136  officers were killed in the line of duty. Already this year, 54  officers have lost their lives while serving our communities. Sadly,  one of these deaths occurred in my home State of Alabama earlier this  year.   Mobile Police Officer Justin Billa paid the ultimate sacrifice when  he was shot and killed while responding to a domestic violence call on  February 20. At just 27 years old, Officer Billa left behind a loving  wife, Erin, and a 1-year-old son, Taylor.   In such a time of immense grief, we saw the city of Mobile rally  together to support the family and friends of fallen Officer Billa. You  see, these officers are much more than enforcers of the law; they are  an integral part of the community.   Mr. Speaker, I loved seeing the community wrap Officer Billa's family  up in a shield of prayer and love, but we shouldn't just do that when  we lose an officer, and we shouldn't just do it during National Police  Week. Each and every day, we should show our deep appreciation to  members of law enforcement, at every level, who put their lives on the  line so that we can live in safe communities. May we not forget that we  get to lay our heads down on our pillows at night feeling safe because  of the brave men and women out there patrolling the streets.   Mr. Speaker, as we observe National Police Week, I can think of no  better way to show appreciation for our men and women in blue than  encourage every American to take the time to say ``thank you'' to your  local law enforcement officers. May their sacrifices never be  forgotten.                            ____________________
