 Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be here tonight, with so  much going on, but it seems, other than some people rushing to judgment  to beat up on a smiling high school kid with a sweet disposition,  people are still concerned about the border.   In talking to some TSA agents, some Border Patrol, some of those who  are not getting checks--we are still getting some calls--I am still  hearing from people, personally, saying: Look, it is really hurting not  to have gotten a check; and if we don't get a check, our next check  here in the next week, it is going to hurt. But we also know how many  American people are hurting because of an insecure border.   How many people have to die, how many people have to have their homes  broken into, how many people have to be hit by drivers that should not  be driving without insurance, without a driver's license, without fully  understanding the laws?   It shouldn't have to be said, but because there are so many people  who are quite dense in the liberal media, we know that everybody who  comes into this country illegally is not out to hurt America. But what  they don't understand and what some in this country--thank God,  literally, that it is a minority--don't understand is that, if you keep  the border as open as it is, then this country will continue to be more  and more overwhelmed, and we will  [[Page H990]]  lose that great light on the hill that has helped illuminate so much of  the world through our being the most generous country in the history of  the world, helping others that couldn't help themselves.   But when you do enough damage to a country, this country--the  greatest, I would continue to submit, in the history of the world, and  that is because of all races, creed, color, gender. I mean, we have  blessed the world. God has blessed this world through us.   But as we weaken ourselves by having more and more people without  regard to the law and we give more and more of our cities over to being  used by the drug cartels in Mexico, and as we continue to use Homeland  Security--thank goodness it is to a much, much lesser extent than  during the Obama administration. But during the Obama administration, I  have said here before, the Border Patrol says: The drug cartels call us  at Homeland Security, and also HHS, their logistics. They get people  illegally into the country who still owe more money to the drug  cartels, and they provide them with a piece of paper with an address, a  name sometimes, sometimes a phone number, but mainly that address.                                time  2015    And Homeland Security, sometimes HHS, they ship them where the drug  cartels need them to be to help finish out their network through the  United States that will continue to poison our young people with drugs,  70,000 or so a year, to their deaths. At some point it has got to stop.   I was fortunate to be on a trip to the border. Actually, we all just  met there, down in southern Arizona. I have spent a tremendous amount  of time, all hours of the day and night, on our Texas-Mexico border,  but I had not spent time, like I should have, on the Arizona border. It  was quite eye-opening.   They have areas where they do have some border fence that is making a  world of difference. Like Secretary Nielsen testified, when we add a  wall barrier, it cuts down illegal immigration by 90 to 95 percent.  They have seen it in San Diego, El Paso, and some places in Arizona  where there is a massive fence or barrier. So it was interesting.   Here is something we put up down by Douglas, Arizona, and we have got  this fence here, and you can see between these big metal poles--and  those go deep into the ground. These metal, hollow pipes are filled  with concrete. So it is not easy to get through those. And then even if  you do, you get over it--and there is some razor wire. But if you get  over it, then at least to this point you still have another barrier.   When there are heavy rains, there is water in there, but then you  have got that to get over, and then you have a road here that the  border patrol drives. They can see--and I was there--you can see for a  long way. They can come zipping up, just like we watched them do near  Nogales, Arizona, yesterday.   So it does make a difference. Talking to the border patrolmen that  were patrolling this area, they said: Oh, you wouldn't believe what a  help this is. It is a huge help.   Here is another area. This barrier, it is hard to tell, it looks  solid, but you can see through the wall. Border patrolmen say they  actually like to see through the wall or the fence so they can see what  is on the other side, and, you know, see what is coming, and it is very  helpful. And this is a great fence--a great barrier. You can tell a  little better here that, you know, it has got razor wire.   And they were telling us that that is something that the National  Guard, that President Trump had sent down--or not National Guard--our  military. The military has been sent down. Just in the last 90 days,  they put up a tremendous amount of concertina wire that has made it  much more difficult for people to get over.   So this has been a terrific barrier until you get up here to the end,  and that is the end of the barrier. They say: Well, then we have got  this Normandy barrier for vehicles. Well, most of them aren't coming in  vehicles into the United States, unless they have real serious drugs.  But anyway, this is a major, major problem.   So I now recognize my friend, who was down there on the border with  me on this trip that   Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar helped put together. I  yield to Morgan Griffith.    Mr. Speaker, it looks like--no, it is him because that  is his--nobody else had binoculars that good. I yield to Congressman  Griffith.    Mr. Speaker, funny he should ask. Yes, we just happen to  have the rope. So here is the end of the barrier right here. It is an  impressive barrier till you get to the end, and then you have got the  rope he was referring to, and then they have got this barbwire fence-- pretty sad barbwire, four-strand, and it is anything but tight. The  only thing that keeps somebody from crossing our border, you have got  the massive barrier, the concertina wire, and then you have this little  quarter-inch cord here and kind of a slipknot that you can undo, and  then pull the gate open and come right through.   That is one of our brave border patrolmen right there. I won't give  Art's full name. But anyway, and the other thing we saw, there is a  trail that goes right down there. That trail--and I know Mr. Griffith  noticed this--but that trail doesn't come down all the way to the  barrier. It leads--and you can follow it all the way through this area  for miles. It comes right here to where the cord is instead of where  the big barrier is.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, it absolutely does.    Mr. Speaker, it was interesting to hear from the  landowners down there that, you know, even up to the 1990s, the people  that came were, you know, mainly people looking for jobs, and they  would put out food and stuff. The border patrolmen had confirmed this.  We were hearing it from the landowners, and we were hearing it from the  border patrol. It used to be that when they caught people, it was the  first time they had been caught. They probably were just looking for a  job in the U.S.   But now, most of the people coming, other than family units, most of  them have records, criminal records. Not just in Mexico. Like one that  we were being told about is wanted for murder in Mexico, but for all  kinds of crimes, including murder in the United States. And that this  has become a common event. You catch them, you do the fingerprints, and  then here comes this big criminal history, and that that is what they  are getting so much of. That used  [[Page H991]]  to be an anomaly, and now it is regular course of business.   I yield to Mr. Griffith.    It is amazing.    Mr. Speaker, he brings up a matter that touched a memory  of what was being said by my friend--and sometimes people say that  sarcastically--John Garamendi is a friend. He is a good man.   But there were people talking before us about the drugs and that 90  percent of the drugs are coming through our legal ports of entry.   I have been contending for some time, having spent so much time on  the Texas-Mexico border, we cannot know how much drugs is coming where.  They are catching more drugs coming through the legal port of entries.  But there have been all hours--virtually every night down on that  border south of McAllen, southwest there, where the border patrol tell  us: We know. They send a group of people across in the middle of the  night; they know we have to all come to start processing them, asking  the questions, and we know that is when the big drug shipments come  across, and they know we are tied up.   And how do we know how much drugs? Nobody can say there is a  percentage.   I now yield to my good friend, Ralph Norman.    Mr. Speaker, this is a different spot where the wall  ended from the one that we are talking about a moment ago.    Mr. Speaker, he pulled that sleeping bag out, and that  was in the area where the wall stopped, was it not?    If my friend will yield for a question.   Did you go in the Sasabe little store there where we stopped?    How were those bullets packaged? I had not seen them in  a store like that.    Have you ever seen bullets for sale in a plastic bag  like that before?    What was the other big thing you don't normally see, but  it took up a whole row there?    MREs, Meals, Ready-to-Eat.    I hope the gentleman can stick around and we can talk  some more.   But we have been joined by our friend from northern California,  Congressman Doug LaMalfa. I know his friends and families have endured  quite a tragedy this past year with the fire, but I yield to the  gentleman for such comments as he might have about our border.    What was that something? He signed off on the amnesty.  What was it that the other side didn't provide that they had promised  in that law?    Has the gentleman been there where the fence is or where  the barrier is, like San Diego?    All three of you, Mr. Norman, Mr. LaMalfa, and Mr.  Griffin, you guys are caring guys, and the Republicans are often  castigated as being hard-hearted and not caring. But the stories we  have heard from Angel Families and Angel Moms, I know it has affected  you guys. We have talked about it.   How anybody can work so hard to get elected to come to this body and  not be deeply moved by these stories of families that are ripped apart  because someone came in illegally and killed a family member--and I  know it is a serious issue.   We don't normally abide separating children from families, even  though it is temporary, but there is a point to make sure that children  are not handed over to sex traffickers.   But it broke my heart as a felony judge, and it happens in this  country over and over every single day of the year, that someone  commits a crime and they are taken away; their children are separated  from the parent--the parent goes to jail--because we don't believe in  incarcerating the children for the father's sins or illegal activity or  the mom's. It happens every day.   So it rings kind of hollow to me when people start screaming about  that and yet have no compassion whatsoever. We heard from a lot of  Angel Moms, so many of those who are so derogatory about Republicans  wanting to secure our borders, but they will not even give these moms  who have lost precious children a minute of their time to hear these  tragic stories.   One of the stories we heard this weekend was there was a group of  people who were being smuggled into the country, and as we have talked  about before, nowadays, the drug cartels control every inch of our  border from the south side--and, some might argue, from our side as  well.   There was a wife who was the only female with the group, and they got  to the border and they spent, I believe it was, 7 days where the wife  was raped by all the other men; and they would hold the husband hostage  while the men, for  [[Page H993]]  several nights in a row, raped his wife, and there was nothing he could  do about it.   I mean, how hard-hearted do you have to be to not want to stop the  invitations of the drug cartels to contribute to that kind of activity?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Griffith)  for his comments.    I hope my friend from California won't have to go far because we have  got enough microphones for everybody here.    It was over 200,000 acres in one of the fires.    Mr. Speaker, I was going to ask Congressman Norman if he  would reflect. We heard from a lot of landowners. Individually, we  talked to a number of folks on a separate basis.   But, yes, we see here the end of that barrier, all you have to do is  just go to the end.   Mr. Speaker, after all the folks we talked to in the last few days, I  would like to ask Mr. Norman his thoughts about what needs to be done.  We have some of our friends across the aisle who say we don't need any  kind of barrier. We just need the technical equipment, the cameras, the  drones. We don't need a wall.   After what he has seen and heard, I would like to hear his thoughts  regarding that.    Mr. Speaker, that was a family member of some of the  folks we were with.    Mr. Speaker, that is right. It was seven people raping  his wife 3 days in a row.    Right. That is it.    Mr. Speaker, we were all taking pictures down there.   I want to go to a point about the caravans. We all heard about the  caravans. We knew that this was a serious invasion coming. The  mainstream, or lame stream, media was trying to say it was a  manufactured crisis. These were thousands and thousands of people  coming to try to invade this country.    From news reports, it sounded like they were originally heading to  Texas, but our Governor made it clear he was going to work with the  Federal Government and anybody the President would send, and we were  going to do all within Texas' power with Federal help and the military  that was there, to keep them from coming in. Then we hear they are  heading toward California, Congressman LaMalfa's State.   It sounds like this new caravan that is ginned up may be heading to  California, too. I would appreciate the Congressman's comments and  thoughts about people heading toward California. People elected him.  Surely, they can't be thrilled about an invasion coming like that.    Mr. Speaker, it is a great point, just a great point.   We have heard from angel moms, angel families here, and they complain  that they have tried to talk to our Speaker and others on the other  side of the aisle, and they are not given time.   But we heard from additional angel moms and families down in southern  Arizona in the last few days. They didn't seem to me to be bitter. They  were just heartbroken, seemed like, not only for losing their loved  one, but there will continue to be people who were separated from their  children forever, not just for the pendency of a hearing, but forever,  because we weren't doing our job that we took an oath to do.   Congressman Griffith, what about those meetings struck you?    Mr. Speaker, she didn't know who we were.    Mr. Speaker, I know some on the left try to say, oh,  this is because you are a xenophobe or afraid of Hispanics. I know this  is a generalization, but personally, in my opinion, I think the three  things that helped make America the greatest country in history were a  love of God, a love of family, and a hard-work ethic.   Generally speaking, when I look at the Hispanic culture, all my  friends, they have a love of God, tremendous devotion to family, kind  of like a lot of people in my hometown used to have, but don't have.                                time  2100    I think the Hispanic culture can help reinvigorate what made America  the greatest country in the world. I want those folks coming. But like  Congressman LaMalfa was saying: Legally. I know Congressman LaMalfa has  got a lot of agriculture, and it takes a lot of workers who are willing  to get out there and sweat. I hear it is harder and harder to find  those folks. We know it. Hispanic folks are some of the hardest working  folks I have ever been around. But, as Congressman LaMalfa said, it has  got to be legal.   Some people are saying: Well, so what is it going to take? Why don't  you throw out there on the table so many more visas? And my contention  is: We have been through this in `86, again when Clinton was President;  how many times do we have to be fooled?   I keep contending: We secure the border and we can work this out. We  are  [[Page H995]]  already the most generous country in the history of the world when it  comes to legally allowing people to come into this country. Nobody  gives a million visas like we do--over a million. But, even then, we  can still get the workers we need, we can do what we need.   But as long as that border is porous--it is silly to keep luring more  people in with the hope that they will be given amnesty before we  secure the border, because then we will see more and more of the human  tragedy that both gentlemen have been talking about.   California has had its share of human tragedy at the hands of illegal  aliens, but so has the whole country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from California (Mr. LaMalfa) one  more time, and then I would like to hear from my friend, Congressman  Griffith, before we wrap this up.    By the way, we saw, last week, a big photograph of a  massive metal barrier around the perimeter of the 2016 Democratic  National Convention. Somebody there knows that walls or fences work  when they are combined with security.   I yield to my friend.    So you are going on the record as saying, you believe  the question of citizen or noncitizen should be on the census?    Well, that would exclude some of our Federal judges,  apparently.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman LaMalfa, and I thank my  friend, Congressman Norman, who was here earlier, for their comments.    Mr. Speaker, we ought to be able to extend that barrier just a little  further. It is too easy to walk around the end. Where it is there, it  does a lot of good.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Griffith)  for his comments.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Griffith. I appreciate  his wisdom. I always have and always will.   I, again, echo the comments he made about thanking Congressman   Andy  Biggs, for arranging this, and Paul Gosar for his help. They are both  fantastic Members of Congress from Arizona.   I thank Arizona for sending   Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar here. They  are invaluable.   I hope we are going to be able to help Arizona finish--look, the  President has already backed off of the $25 billion requested. I  thought that was an exceedingly reasonable request when you look at the  damage occurring to families all over America, and especially to the  families of people who are being lured in here to their death or  detriment.   Let's move that fence a little further along. Let's get an agreement  done so that we can help out these landowners and the people who are  suffering, so no more people will be stabbed, even though they were not  American citizens, stabbed and forced to watch your wife be repeatedly  raped. I mean, how callous do you have to be to say: No, we don't want  to deal with that problem; we are going to allow that to keep going?  How callous do you have to be?   As we understand it, the family member--we have talked to his  sister--he went out there and always provided water and food to people  who were illegally crossing into the United States and were illegally  on their property, and yet he ends up being shot dead in the head.   It is time to start doing more to protect Americans. It is time to  start doing more out of compassion for the people of Mexico to dry up  the tens of billions of dollars every year going to the drug cartels.  Let's extend the barriers where we need it. Let's do the humane thing  for our friends south of the border, and especially those people to  whom we have taken an oath to protect their constitution, including  them.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 9 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, January 23, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
