 I thank Mr. Johnson.   I thank Ranking Member Conyers for the leadership that he provided  the committee for so many years. I thank Chairman Goodlatte and  Congressman Graves for working in a bipartisan way.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is common sense. It calls on the  government to bring transparency to the major rules.   Once an agency finalizes a major rule, that is the end of it. They  are not required to review the benefits or the economic impacts. This  amendment, however, holds the agency accountable by requiring that it  look back and assess the costs and benefits of that rule after it has  taken effect. Should the cost of the regulation exceed the proposed  costs under the rule, then, under this amendment, this agency will  report back the increase to the Congress. This amendment would  facilitate a dialogue between the agency and the stakeholders. If the  costs have gone up, then the agency must open up a comment period to  hear the stakeholders and consider possible modifications or  alternatives to reduce the cost and increase the benefits. We do that  in Congress. Every time we pass a piece of legislation, we go back and  fine tune the legislation, and I think we need to do the same thing  here.   Again, we must not allow regulations to run out of control. We should  hold agencies accountable. This amendment will bring transparency and  begin those conversations between stakeholders and the agencies.   Again, I thank Congressman Graves for this bipartisan amendment.
