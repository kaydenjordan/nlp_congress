 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the Rock Bridge High  School Bruins boys basketball team of Columbia, Missouri, for winning  the Missouri State Championship Class 5 Basketball Championship in  Springfield.   In winning the school's first boys basketball state title, the Bruins  exhibited a never-say-die attitude, staging a comeback after being down  by eight points heading into the final quarter against Christian  Brothers College High School.   The Bruins came close last year, bowing out in the semi-finals, but  this year's team would not be denied.   The long hours of practice paid off, as Rock Bridge came roaring back  in the final quarter to win 63-59 and bring home the championship.   This season finale is a testament to the great coaching of Jim  Scanlon and the dedication and hard work of all the players, whose  determination and teamwork brought home the victory.   So congratulations to the Rock Bridge High School Bruins, state  champs from Missouri's Fourth District. We are proud of you and we wish  you continued success.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, let me tell you about a sharp, young  patriot from my district.   She worked hard, earned straight A's, and was accepted into law  school to join the JAG Corps. She, however, was denied entry into the  military because she had bunions on her feet.   She is an amazing woman and a long-distance runner, but DOD's policy  was clear that, due to the risk of future surgery, she could  potentially be temporarily undeployable and, so, was denied entrance  into military service. She did not meet the physical-mental-medical  standards.   Another constituent was denied service because he had asthma. He,  too, wanted to serve his country, but the health risk outweighed the  benefits to the military. He did not meet the physical-mental-medical  standards.   DOD's military exception standards state:         Individuals must be free of medical conditions or physical       defects that may require excessive time lost from duty for       necessary treatment or hospitalization.    Our all-volunteer military is the greatest military force in the  world, and we must allow it--we must allow it--to make the best medical  and military judgment about what medical conditions should qualify or  disqualify an individual from serving. We should not carve out  exceptions for an entire population.   Military service is a privilege, not a right. That is why Secretary  Mattis reviewed and issued a new policy on transgender service and the  medical condition of gender dysphoria.   The policy is not a ban, and it allows transgender servicemembers to  serve in their biological sex. The Mattis policy does not kick anyone  out of the military for being transgender, nor does it give  preferential treatment to transgender persons. All persons, unless  grandfathered or granted a waiver, must serve in their birth gender.   It is a fair policy, allowing transgender individuals to serve openly  as long as they are willing to serve in their biological sex and they  can meet the medical behavioral standards.   This resolution we are voting on today is riddled with inaccuracies.  First, as I just stated, the policy is not a ban.   Second, it claims there is a global medical consensus that  transgender care is effective, safe, and reliable. That is not true.  RAND, the Mayo Clinic, CMS, and others have all determined that there  is not enough quality evidence to be able to say that. And there are  valid concerns.   There are costs as well. The Department of Defense announced already  that they have spent $8 million on those individuals who have  identified as transgender last year, and that money has been spent on  psychotherapy, on sex change operations. That is money that could have  been spent on bullets, body armor for our troops.   Third, the resolution claims there is not an adverse effect on  military readiness. This is false. The individual readiness of those  undergoing treatment for gender dysphoria will be impacted. It takes  over 260 days just to recover from the surgery.   Individual readiness directly impacts the readiness of our forces, so  the diagnosis and treatment for transgender personnel takes them away  from their jobs for an indeterminate amount of time. This lost  deployment time means someone else will have to step forward and go in  their place. This is unfair.   The military has valid reasons for excluding people with certain  medical conditions from service. It is not the job of Congress to  dictate what medical conditions the military should accept.   We should not degrade the efficiency and lethality of our Armed  Forces. This resolution is riddled with false claims, and I urge my  colleagues to oppose its passage.
