 Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has taken up  the National Defense Authorization Act.   There is a 60-year tradition in this body of getting this bill done  because the importance of this bill transcends partisanship. In fact,  81 Senators of both parties joined forces earlier this year to override  a senseless veto of this important bill by the former President.   Now, while both sides of the aisle can work cooperatively to get this  defense policy done, we are now seeing unprecedented--unprecedented-- obstruction by the minority party for passing a budget that will fund  the programs that our military and our veterans need.   Now, look, if Republicans succeed in this obstruction, I am going to  tell you that the government will be forced to go to a full-year  continuing resolution. That is not workable. The result will be frozen  spending levels for the Department of Defense and for the Department of  Veterans Affairs, which amounts to a $70 billion cut in spending for  those two Agencies alone, compared to the appropriations bills prepared  in the U.S. Senate.   I serve as chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, and  let me tell you what is at stake for America's veterans and their  families. Funding will be blocked for priorities like expanding  veterans' access to lifesaving mental healthcare services, enhancing  women veterans' healthcare, providing housing assistance, and  expediting the delivery of benefits and care for those suffering from  toxic exposure.   Let me say this again.   If we go to a 1-year continuing resolution, that means we go off of  last year's budget, last year's spending bill. We will block priorities  like expanding access to mental health services for our veterans. We  will block services for expanding women veterans' healthcare. We will  block services for housing assistance and for expediting what is one of  the most serious issues coming out of the conflict of 20 years in the  Middle East, and that is care for those that are suffering from toxic  exposure.   The bottom line is this would keep the VA from properly addressing a  whole host of issues on behalf of those who would put their lives on  the line for this country, and they are going to continue to pay the  price for us not doing our job.   As chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I was able to  draft a bill that provided a $31 billion increase for defense compared  to last year. This military bill is consistent with the spending levels  approved by  [[Page S8418]]  the bill we are working on today. In fact, in an amendment offered by  Senator Inhofe, that amendment passed 25 to 1, which will plus-up this  bill.   So why isn't the defense appropriations bill flying through this  Senate just like the NDAA?   Well, I will tell you. In September, the Republicans on the  Appropriations Committee announced they would vote against all  appropriations bills in part because Senator Inhofe's bill doesn't  increase defense with enough spending. So the idea here is, just take  money and throw it at the wall and hope that it's spent right.   The bottom line is there needs to be plans and there needs to be  planning. And I am going to tell you, the last time I checked, the $31  billion increase is a pretty good chunk of dough.   So it is simple. Do we want to fund the VA? Do we want to fund the  military? Do we want to fund this country's government?   Or do we want to go back to last year's funding? Which, by the way,  would be totally inadequate, but it is what some on the other side of  the aisle are advocating right now.   Look, guys, we are in a continuing resolution right now. It expires  on December 3. If, in fact, we had a budget deal today, we couldn't get  an omnibus out for nearly 5 weeks.   So what I am saying is this: no more finger pointing, no more  changing the rules of the game, no more foot dragging. Do what the gang  of 10 did on the bipartisan infrastructure package. Let's go into  negotiations to get to yes. Let's all work together. Let's not play  irresponsible political games with our military and with our veterans  and with everybody else who lives in this country.   What are we here for? Are we here to advocate for this country? Or  are we here to advocate for a political party?   I am telling you the appropriations bills should have been done last  September. We should be sitting at the table today. I am ready to roll  up my sleeves and help in any way that I possibly can to make sure  these bills get through this body and to the President's desk so we can  fund our veterans and fund the needs that they have, so we can fund our  military and deal with the threats that are facing us around the world.   It is time, folks. It is time to quit talking, and it is time to  start doing.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have 6 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate.
