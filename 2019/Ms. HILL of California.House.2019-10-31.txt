 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, this is the last speech that I  will give from this floor as a Member of Congress. I wasn't ready for  my time here to come to an end so soon. It is a reality I am still  grappling with, and I will be for a long time to come.   I expected, or I at least hoped, to be here for as long as the voters  of California's 25th District deemed me worthy of the honor of  representing them. I thought I could make a difference here in making  our community, our great country, and the world a better place for  generations to come.   I, like so many of my colleagues, ran for office because I believed  that our political system was broken, controlled by the powerful and  the wealthy, ignoring and failing the regular people that it is  supposed to serve. I came here to give a voice to the unheard in the  halls of power.   I wanted to show young people, queer people, working people, and  imperfect people that they belong here because this is the people's  House. I fell short of that, and I am sorry.   To every young person who saw themselves and their dreams reflected  in me, I am sorry.   To those who felt like I gave them hope in one of the darkest times  in our Nation's history, I am sorry.   To my family, my friends, my staff, my colleagues, my mentors, and to  everyone who has supported and believed in me, I am sorry.   To the thousands of people who spent hours knocking on doors in the  hot summer Sun, who made countless phone calls, and who sacrificed more  than I could ever know to give everything they could in every possible  way so that I could be here, I am so, so sorry.   And to every little girl who looked up to me, I hope that one day you  can forgive me.   The mistakes I made and the people I have hurt that led to this  moment will haunt me for the rest of my life, and I have to come to  terms with that.   Ever since those images first came out, I barely left my bed. I have  ignored all the calls and the texts. I went  [[Page H8714]]  to the darkest places that a mind can go, and I have shed more tears  than I thought were possible.   I have hidden from the world because I am terrified of facing the  people that I let down. But I made it through because the people who  loved me most dragged me back into the light and reminded me that I was  stronger than that.   To those of you who were by my side in my worst moments--you know who  you are--I love you. I am so grateful, and I will never forget.   And I am here today because so many of the people I let down--people  close to me, supporters, colleagues, people I have never even met--told  me to stand back up and that, despite all of my faults, they still  believed in me and they were still counting on me. And I realized that  hiding away and disappearing would be the one unforgivable sin.   I will never shirk my responsibility for this sudden ending to my  time here, but I have to say more because this is bigger than me.   I am leaving now because of a double standard.   I am leaving because I no longer want to be used as a bargaining  chip.   I am leaving because I didn't want to be peddled by papers and blogs  and websites, used by shameless operatives for the dirtiest gutter  politics that I have ever seen and the rightwing media to drive clicks  and expand their audience by distributing intimate photos of me taken  without my knowledge, let alone my consent, for the sexual  entertainment of millions.   I am leaving because of a misogynistic culture that gleefully  consumed my naked pictures, capitalized on my sexuality, and enabled my  abusive ex to continue that abuse, this time with the entire country  watching.   I am leaving because of the thousands of vile, threatening emails,  calls, and texts that made me fear for my life and the lives of the  people that I care about.   Today is the first time I have left my apartment since the photos  taken without my consent were released, and I am scared.   I am leaving because, for the sake of my community, my staff, my  family, and myself, I can't allow this to continue, because I have been  told that people were angry when I stood strong after the first article  was posted and that they had hundreds more photos and text messages  that they would release bit by bit until they broke me down to nothing,  while they used my faults and my past to distract from the things that  matter most.   I am leaving because there is only one investigation that deserves  the attention of this country, and that is the one that we voted on  today.   Today, I ask you all to stand with me and commit to creating a future  where this no longer happens to women and girls.   Yes, I am stepping down, but I refuse to let this experience scare  off other women who dare to take risks, who dare to step into this  light, and who dare to be powerful.   It might feel like they have won in the short term, but they can't in  the long term. We cannot let them.   The way to overcome this setback is for women to keep showing up, to  keep running for office, and to keep stepping up as leaders; because  the more we show up, the less power they have.   I am leaving, but we have men who have been credibly accused of  intentional acts of sexual violence and remain in boardrooms, on the  Supreme Court, in this very body, and, worst of all, in the Oval  Office.   So, the fight goes on to create the change that every woman and girl  in this country deserves. Here in the Halls of Congress, the fight will  go on without me.   I trust so many of my colleagues to be strong on this front while I  move on to one of the many other battlefields, because we have an  entire culture that has to change, and we see it in stark clarity  today:   The forces of revenge by a bitter, jealous man, cyber exploitation  and sexual shaming that target our gender, and a large segment of  society that fears and hates powerful women have combined to push a  young woman out of power and say that she doesn't belong here; yet a  man who brags about his sexual predation, who has had dozens of women  come forward to accuse him of sexual assault, who pushes policies that  are uniquely harmful to women, and who has filled the courts with  judges who proudly rule to deprive women of the most fundamental right  to control their own bodies sits in the highest office of the land.   And so today, as my last vote, I voted on impeachment proceedings,  not just because of corruption, obstruction of justice, or gross  misconduct, but because of the deepest abuse of power, including the  abuse of power over women.   Today, as my final act, I voted to move forward with the impeachment  of Donald Trump on behalf of the women of the United States of America.  We will not stand down; we will not be broken; and we will not be  silenced. We will rise, and we will make tomorrow better than today.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time for now, but not  forever.                            ____________________
