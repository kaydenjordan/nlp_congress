 Mr. Speaker, I just passed a legislative bill, so I am a  little bit excited.   I wanted to especially thank Chairman DeFazio, Leader Hoyer, and  Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, Ranking Member Graves, Chairman Neal,  Ranking Member Brady, and the Biden administration and all the staff  for recognizing the necessity of this legislation.   I especially also would like to thank my Senate colleagues, Senators  Murkowski, Sullivan, and Cantwell, who have been partners in this  effort.   Finally, I would like to thank my chief of staff, Kevin Swanson, for  his hard work on this legislation.   We lost billions of dollars last year because of COVID in the tourist  industry, and this bill we just passed by this House unanimously will  give us an opportunity to recover not the money, but the ability to  serve the people of  [[Page H2634]]  America and the tourist industry in southeast Alaska and the rest of  the State of Alaska.   I am quite excited about this piece of legislation, and I do thank  the House and the people who did not object to this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I sincerely thank everyone for being part of an effort  to solve a problem for a State.                            ____________________
