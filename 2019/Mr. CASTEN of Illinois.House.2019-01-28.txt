 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Waters and  Ranking Member McHenry for working in a bipartisan manner to craft H.R.  624, a bill to help the Securities and Exchange Commission better  protect hardworking Americans from financial fraud.   As a new member on the Financial Services Committee, I look forward  to working together with both the chairwoman and the ranking member on  similar commonsense pieces of legislation.   However, we cannot forget that the most recent shutdown all but  caused the SEC to shut its doors. If people wanted to manipulate and  defraud financial markets that was the perfect time to get away with  it.   Now that the shutdown has ended, we have to work together to ensure  that the government stays open to protect consumers and focus on  proactive measures like H.R. 624 that will strengthen our markets.   Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 624, and I thank the chairwoman for her  leadership.
