 Mr. Speaker, on January 14, 2019, at a joint session  of the Georgia General Assembly that was held on the campus of Georgia  Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, the Honorable Brian Kemp  was inaugurated as the 83rd Governor of the State of Georgia. Upon  taking the oath of office, Brian Kemp became the third Republican to  occupy the Governor's mansion since reconstruction.   Even before taking the oath of office, Brian was already making  history, receiving more votes than any gubernatorial candidate in State  history.   As with many of Georgia's Governors, Governor Kemp comes from a  humble background. He was a small business owner, building his first  construction business with a pickup and a shovel. With hard work and  personal sacrifice, he grew that business and eventually became one of  Georgia's successful entrepreneurs, responsible for several successful  businesses.   When Brian became frustrated with the mismanagement of State  government, he determined that, instead of just complaining, he would  do something about it. He ran for a seat in the State senate, and in  2003, this young businessman from Athens was sworn in as a freshman  senator from the 46th District.   Two years after Brian took office, I was elected to the State house  of representatives and had the honor to work with him on several key  legislative initiatives. I could always count on Brian, not only to be  an ally, but to help perfect legislation as it moved through the State  senate.   Brian was, and still is, a strong conservative with the ability to  reach across the aisle to get things done for Georgians. During his  time in the senate, Brian was instrumental in fighting to cut taxes,  fees, and mandates on job creators and Georgia families.   In 2008, Brian left the State senate and returned to the private  sector, but his heart never left serving his State and his community.  In 2010, Governor Sonny Perdue called on Brian to return to public  service, appointing him to serve as Georgia's secretary of state. Brian  easily won reelection as secretary of state that same year and remained  in that post until he resigned in November 2018.   As secretary of state, Brian wanted to ensure that Georgia elections  were secure, accessible, and fair. In 2016, being a member of this  body's Committee on Homeland Security, Brian asked me to work with him  to ensure that Georgia's election data was secure from cyber threats.   During his tenure as secretary of state, Brian utilized technology  and innovation to cut bureaucratic red tape, reduce spending, and  streamline Georgia's government.  [[Page H1249]]    Brian is known around the State as a great businessman, a public  servant, and a statesman. However, Brian will tell you, his most  important job in life is being a husband and a father. Brian and his  wife, Marty, have three daughters: Jarrett, Lucy, and Amy Porter. The  Kemps are a family tightly bound by their strong faith, their  commitment to public service, and a love for their community, their  State, and their country.   From the backhoe to the boardroom, Brian Kemp understands how to  successfully create jobs, recruit startups, grow companies, and make  deals to provide opportunities for hardworking Georgians.   To communicate his commitment to further growing Georgia's thriving  economy, and to ensure all Georgians have the opportunity to live,  learn, and prosper, Governor Kemp has made the theme of his  governorship ``Putting Georgians First.'' I believe Governor Brian Kemp  will work for all Georgians, and I look forward to working with him as  he leads Georgia forward.   Congratulations, Governor Kemp.                            ____________________
