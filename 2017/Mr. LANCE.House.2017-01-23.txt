 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this bill, H.R.  423, the Anti-Spoofing Act. I am a proud sponsor of this with  Congresswoman Meng and Congressman Barton, and I commend them for their  leadership on this issue.   Caller ID spoofing occurs when a scammer calls and attempts to  disguise his or her identity by manipulating the recipient caller's  caller ID display. The scammer may be posing as an IRS agent, a police  officer, or a representative from another governmental agency. After  tricking people in picking up the line, the criminal then attempts to  entice the other person to giving up personal information.   To date, hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions, have been  defrauded, including veterans, immigrants, and senior citizens. In  Somerset County, New Jersey, a county which I represent here in the  House, scammers cloned the telephone number of the county sheriff's  office and impersonated the sheriff's staff in an effort to steal  residents' personal information.   This problem has gotten out of control. Millions of Americans  continue to get ripped off by con artists and scammers who perpetuate  this despicable crime.   Since Congress passed the Truth in Caller ID Act in 2009, new  technologies have enabled these criminals to scam consumers with  increased ease and efficiency.   This legislation is one step forward to ensure that governmental  policies keep up with these criminals. This disgraceful practice must  end, and this consumer protection legislation goes a long way toward  accomplishing that critical goal.   The bill has been passed through the House twice before, as  Congresswoman Meng has just said. And after collaboration with our  colleagues in the Senate, we now have secured enough support to see  that this commonsense consumer protection legislation will advance. I  hope it advances in the 115th Congress as quickly as possible and I  hope it reaches our new President's desk as quickly as possible.                                time  1630     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 555) to direct the Federal Communications Commission to amend its  rules so as to prohibit the application to amateur stations of certain  private land use restrictions, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 555         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Amateur Radio Parity Act of       2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) More than 730,000 radio amateurs in the United States       are licensed by the Federal Communications Commission in the       amateur radio services.        (2) Amateur radio, at no cost to taxpayers, provides a       fertile ground for technical self-training in modern       telecommunications, electronics technology, and emergency       communications techniques and protocols.        (3) There is a strong Federal interest in the effective       performance of amateur stations established at the residences       of licensees. Such stations have been shown to be frequently       and increasingly precluded by unreasonable private land use       restrictions, including restrictive covenants.        (4) Federal Communications Commission regulations have for       three decades prohibited the application to stations in the       amateur service of State and local regulations that preclude       or fail to reasonably accommodate amateur service       communications, or that do not constitute the minimum       practicable regulation to accomplish a legitimate State or       local purpose. Commission policy has been and is to require       States and localities to permit erection of a station antenna       structure at heights and dimensions sufficient to accommodate       amateur service communications.        (5) The Commission has sought guidance and direction from       Congress with respect to the application of the Commission's       limited preemption policy regarding amateur service       communications to private land use restrictions, including       restrictive covenants.        (6) There are aesthetic and common property considerations       that are uniquely applicable to private land use regulations       and the community associations obligated to enforce       covenants, conditions, and restrictions in deed-restricted       communities. These considerations are dissimilar to those       applicable to State law and local ordinances regulating the       same residential amateur radio facilities.        (7) In recognition of these considerations, a separate       Federal policy than exists at section 97.15(b) of title 47,       Code of Federal Regulations, is warranted concerning amateur       service communications in deed-restricted communities.        (8) Community associations should fairly administer private       land use regulations in the interest of their communities,       while nevertheless permitting the installation and       maintenance of effective outdoor amateur radio antennas.       There exist antenna designs and installations that can be       consistent with the aesthetics and physical characteristics       of land and structures in community associations while       accommodating communications in the amateur radio services.       SEC. 3. APPLICATION OF PRIVATE LAND USE RESTRICTIONS TO                     AMATEUR STATIONS.         (a) Amendment of FCC Rules.--Not later than 120 days after       the date of the enactment of this Act, the Federal       Communications Commission shall amend section 97.15 of title       47, Code of Federal Regulations, by adding a new paragraph       that prohibits the application to amateur stations of any       private land use  [[Page H582]]       restriction, including a restrictive covenant, that--        (1) on its face or as applied, precludes communications in       an amateur radio service;        (2) fails to permit a licensee in an amateur radio service       to install and maintain an effective outdoor antenna on       property under the exclusive use or control of the licensee;       or        (3) does not constitute the minimum practicable restriction       on such communications to accomplish the lawful purposes of a       community association seeking to enforce such restriction.        (b) Additional Requirements.--In amending its rules as       required by subsection (a), the Commission shall--        (1) require any licensee in an amateur radio service to       notify and obtain prior approval from a community association       concerning installation of an outdoor antenna;        (2) permit a community association to prohibit installation       of any antenna or antenna support structure by a licensee in       an amateur radio service on common property not under the       exclusive use or control of the licensee; and        (3) subject to the standards specified in paragraphs (1)       and (2) of subsection (a), permit a community association to       establish reasonable written rules concerning height,       location, size, and aesthetic impact of, and installation       requirements for, outdoor antennas and support structures for       the purpose of conducting communications in the amateur radio       services.       SEC. 4. AFFIRMATION OF LIMITED PREEMPTION OF STATE AND LOCAL                     LAND USE REGULATION.         The Federal Communications Commission may not change       section 97.15(b) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations,       which shall remain applicable to State and local land use       regulation of amateur service communications.       SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Community association.--The term ``community       association'' means any non-profit mandatory membership       organization composed of owners of real estate described in a       declaration of covenants or created pursuant to a covenant or       other applicable law with respect to which a person, by       virtue of the person's ownership of or interest in a unit or       parcel, is obligated to pay for a share of real estate taxes,       insurance premiums, maintenance, improvement, services, or       other expenses related to common elements, other units, or       any other real estate other than the unit or parcel described       in the declaration.        (2) Terms defined in regulations.--The terms ``amateur       radio services'', ``amateur service'', and ``amateur       station'' have the meanings given such terms in section 97.3       of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Lance) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Michael F.  Doyle) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, amateur radio, also known as ham radio, is a fun hobby  for enthusiasts who use it to communicate with people around the world  while teaching themselves the basics of communications technology. But  more importantly, amateur radio operators utilize their skills to  provide essential communication services to first responders when the  conventional networks go down in times of emergency.   In order to be eligible to operate an amateur radio station,  individuals must obtain a license from the FCC and comply with the  FCC's rules. One such requirement is that individuals must own and  install the equipment needed to operate a station. This includes a  transceiver, transmission lines, and an antenna. Currently, there are  more than 730,000 amateur radio operators licensed in the United  States, including a number of active clubs in New Jersey, the State I  represent in the House.   Because communications equipment provides a societal benefit and is a  critical part of our Nation's infrastructure, the FCC prohibits land  use restrictions imposed by governments or homeowners' associations on  certain communications equipment. However, these protections do not  extend to amateur radio equipment.   Roughly 90 percent of new housing in the United States is subject to  deed restrictions, homeowners' associations, and other land use  limitations. This is increasingly making the installation of amateur  radio equipment more challenging.   Amateur radio operators have a history and tradition of being ready,  willing, and able to lend their services during times of emergencies at  no cost to taxpayers. Due to the nature and structure of amateur radio,  hams are able to link communications between first responders using  their own networks and equipment.   The only necessity for amateur radio stations, however, is some form  of outdoor antenna. For this group of unsung heroes with a long  tradition of public service when it is needed most, Congress should  help deter barriers to their operation. H.R. 555 would extend the FCC  protections over limitations on communications equipment to include  amateur radio equipment.   Now, while I have described the critical role that amateur radio  plays during times of disaster, I also understand the concerns shared  by homeowners' associations that this bill will expose their  neighborhoods to big towers and antennas. This bill recognizes that  there needs to be a balance between the right of homeowners and their  associations with the rights of amateur radio operators. That is why  Mr. Kinzinger's bill passed without objection twice last Congress and  enjoys the support of both the amateur radio community and the  Community Associations Institute. I congratulate our distinguished  colleague from Illinois on working with both sides on this critical  issue.   Mr. Speaker, there was much discussion and hard work that went into  this bill in order to strike the right balance between the rights of  the amateur radio community and the concerns of homeowners'  associations. Both sides were willing to compromise, and we are  considering a good bill today because of that compromise. I hope all of  our colleagues will support this bipartisan piece of legislation that I  believe is critical to the safety of the American Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 555, the Amateur Radio Parity  Act. This is a bill that passed the House last Congress by voice vote  after careful negotiations in the Subcommittee on Communications and  Technology.   Amateur radio operators provide essential services in times of  emergencies, and they shouldn't be prohibited from building their  facilities. H.R. 555 will provide for new rules that will help these  operators navigate homeowner association restrictions when they are  attempting to build their stations.   The bill strikes the right balance to ensure that homeowner  associations can impose reasonable regulations for amateur radio  towers, but it would also make sure that amateur radio enthusiasts can  continue to operate.   Again, this measure passed the House by voice vote last Congress, and  I encourage Members to support it today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger), who is the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Newhouse).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 460) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to ensure the  integrity of voice communications and to prevent unjust or unreasonable  discrimination among areas of the United States in the delivery of such  communications.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 460         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Rural Call Quality       and Reliability Act of 2017''.  [[Page H584]]            SEC. 2. ENSURING THE INTEGRITY OF VOICE COMMUNICATIONS.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Lance) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F.  Doyle) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 460, the Improving Rural  Call Quality and Reliability Act, a bill that earned unanimous support  in the last Congress.   Consumers expect to be able to pick up the telephone and be connected  with businesses, friends, and loved ones across the country. In today's  connected world, that should not be a tall request. Unfortunately, for  many constituents across the country, particularly in rural areas, call  quality and reliability are just not up to par compared to their urban  counterparts.   This is due, partly, because of the call routing process where long  distance and wireless providers use so-called least cost routers. These  inexpensive third-party intermediate providers try to complete calls  for the lowest possible price, without taking measures to ensure the  call actually goes through.   I am sure that most of us have experienced the annoyance of at least  one failed or dropped call. You make a call to someone and it rings  over and over again but no one, not even the voicemail, picks up. Or,  maybe you place a call, only to hear a prerecorded message telling you  that the number you dialed is not in service, even though you know you  have the right number. Even in cases where you are able to connect, the  sound might be distorted or delayed.   For many constituents, this is more than just an annoyance. These  missed connections have significant consequences.   Folks rely on the networks for more than just staying in touch with  loved ones. Our constituents count on reliable networks to run their  businesses and receive messages from our community institutions. A  failed call can mean a lost sale for a small rural business. Another  failed call might mean that a message from your child's school or your  medical provider goes undelivered. These are real and harmful impacts.  This bill will address this situation through commonsense improvements.   For the most part, consumers are unaware of these intermediate  providers, which has allowed them to be held unaccountable. H.R. 460  takes measured steps to bring these intermediate providers out from the  shadows and into the light so that we can hold them accountable to the  consuming public.   First, the bill requires intermediate providers to register with the  FCC, and it prohibits carriers from using any nonregistered provider.  The bill also requires the FCC to establish a database and publish the  list of registered providers on its Web site. Finally, the bill  requires the FCC to establish quality standards for these intermediate  providers, which will raise the bar for all of the providers who  provide call routing services.   These straightforward measures are another step in our effort, on a  bipartisan basis, to mitigate call completion and quality issues for  the consuming public. This bill will build upon the work the FCC has  done in recent years.   Our constituents in rural areas face significant challenges compared  to their urban counterparts, but subpar call quality should not be one  of them. By raising the bar, which this bill does, we will hold the bad  actors to higher standards and allow consumers to benefit from the  improved integrity of our networks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I also rise to support H.R. 460, Improving Rural Call  Quality and Reliability Act, the bipartisan bill introduced by  Representative David Young and cosponsored by a number of  [[Page H585]]  other Members, including Representatives Welch and Loebsack from the  Energy and Commerce Committee.   We deal with a lot of high-tech and complicated issues on the Energy  and Commerce Committee, but this bill aims to address the most basic  function for a telephone system: making sure all Americans' phone calls  go through.   Many people take our modern communications tools for granted, but, in  rural America, even the basic function of connecting a call is  sometimes difficult. Consumers have been reporting to the FCC that  calls in rural areas result in false busy signals, calls not arriving,  or long pauses after dialing a number.   This isn't just an important problem for rural Americans but also for  people in all of our districts who want to reach loved ones across the  country and can't. This state of affairs is simply not acceptable. We  need reliable telephone service to keep us connected.   Problems with call completion are often related to intermediate  providers--the middlemen hired to route calls. This bill requires  intermediate providers to register with the FCC and comply with service  quality standards.   These commonsense steps should make it easier to figure out when  providers are cutting corners or not doing their jobs. Ultimately, the  bill puts consumers first by helping to make sure that we can stay  connected to one another.   H.R. 460 is a bipartisan bill that passed on suspension last  Congress, and I urge my colleagues to support it today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim the  balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. Young), the distinguished sponsor of the legislation.   Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 460, the  bipartisan Improving Rural Call Quality and Reliability Act,  legislation I introduced with my colleague from Vermont, Congressman  Welch.   This bill helps fix the significant problems rural Iowans and other  rural Americans face from dropped and poor quality calls. Reliable  communication is critical for our constituents to live their lives, for  our businesses to succeed, and for our communities to thrive. Yet, in  rural States and areas across America, phone calls are not getting  through or the connection and quality are poor.   Telephone companies often rely on intermediate providers, who are  paid to route calls from larger networks to local service providers.  Much of the time, this is to mixed results.   There simply is no excuse for these intermediate providers to not  fulfill their contracts and leave our rural constituents with  unreliable communication service. Dropped, looped, or poor quality  calls hurt rural America's quality of life, impacting our small  businesses, farmers, consumers, and our families who are in need of  emergency assistance and public services. It also gives unfair blame to  our essential local service providers when they are not the problem,  they are the solution.   A family in rural America should not be disadvantaged because of  where they live. Iowa businesses should have the same communication  access to conduct daily businesses as those in urban areas.   Improving rural call completion rates and quality are important to  ensuring the survival of small towns and granting Americans the choice  to live and thrive in whatever community is best for them and their  family, rural, urban, or anywhere in between.   Our bill will help address this problem by requiring providers to  register with the FCC in order to meet quality standards and ensure  reliable phone service in rural areas. It also prohibits providers from  using intermediary routing services not registered with the FCC.   I want to personally thank Chairman Blackburn and Ranking Member  Pallone for their attention to this important issue, as well as my  partner in this, Congressman Welch, for the opportunity to get this  bill passed. This bill did pass the House in the 114th Congress, and I  am hopeful we can get the partnership we need from the Senate to get  this to the finish line. Rural Americans deserve it.   Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time  as he may consume to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch), a  distinguished colleague on the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 599) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to consolidate the  reporting obligations of the Federal Communications Commission in order  to improve congressional oversight and reduce reporting burdens.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 599         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Lance) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Michael F.  Doyle) each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the distinguished majority whip  of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is an important step toward modernizing the  Federal Communications Commission. The FCC has served Americans since  1934, and over the past more than 80 years, this agency has been  responsible for overseeing the evolving telecommunications sector, with  collecting information and analyzing the state of competition, and the  impact of these changes on consumers.    As society has moved from one technology to the next, the FCC has  been asked to keep up with the changing technologies, and Congress has  directed the Commission with reviewing data and reporting on everything  from the telegraph, as Mr. Scalise has indicated, and the AM radio to  online video distributions like Hulu and Netflix. This bill will  eliminate reports that are no longer necessary and waste time and  resources on issues that are no longer critical to consumers.   The bill also recognizes that technology continues to progress and  consumers are no longer served by separate voice, data, or video  networks. Rather, providers are leveraging the same IP network to  provide multiple services over the same network. Providers that were  solely video providers now offer voice and data. Companies that thought  of themselves as telephone providers are also offering video and  broadband services. The game has changed, and we believe that the FCC  should change its reporting to reflect the new reality.   This bill consolidates multiple annual or biennial reports that  require the agency to evaluate competition in different sectors. We  will no longer require a separate mobile wireless or a separate video  competition report. Rather, the bill requires the Commission to  evaluate the state of competition across multiple tech industries in a  single biennial report on competition in the communications  marketplace. Our policymakers should be looking at the world as it is,  not the world that once existed.   I thank the majority whip for his leadership in sponsoring this bill.  He has always shown a keen interest in modernizing the communications  marketplace, and I welcome his continued engagement over the 115th  Congress, where he serves with such distinction as our whip.   I also thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo), the former  ranking member, for her work in ensuring that this bill is bipartisan  in nature and is successful. I certainly thank Mr. Doyle for his  leadership as well.   I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill. I look forward to more  bipartisan work on this and other issues in this Congress. I am hopeful  that this bill will reach our new President's desk as soon as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 582) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require multi- line telephone systems to have a configuration that permits users to  directly initiate a call to 9-1-1 without dialing any additional digit,  code, prefix, or post-fix, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 582         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New Jersey?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   At our subcommittee hearing last April, we heard the very moving  testimony of Mr. Hank Hunt. Hank told us the story of how his daughter  Kari was brutally murdered in a Texas motel bathroom in December 2013.  As emotional as his story was, Hank continued with the gut wrenching  details of how Kari's daughter frantically tried and failed to reach  first responders.   The little girl had done as she was always taught, dial 911 for help.  Tragically, as it turns out, that was her mistake. Due to the  configuration of the phone installed in the motel room, she needed to  dial 9 before dialing an outside number. Time after time she tried, but  the call never went through. The first responders who could have  attempted to save Kari's life were not reached in time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this commonsense bill that  has the ability to save lives. Unfortunately, it  [[Page H589]]  cost the life of Kari Hunt before the call for action was recognized.   Multiline telephone systems, like the one in that Texas motel room,  are everywhere. Many businesses, including hotels, offices, and  schools, use MLTS at their facilities across the country. They serve a  very practical purpose and make connecting to other onsite users much  easier. Unfortunately, many of these phones do not preset with the  ability directly to dial 911.   It may be routine for someone who works in an office to know to dial  9 before dialing out, but would the instinct seem so natural during an  emergency? Incidentally, I have telephones in offices here and in  several district locations in New Jersey, and in some of those offices  you dial 9 and in some you don't.   Moreover, our children should not have to be taught that sometimes  they need to dial an extra number. 911 should mean 911. Those three  numbers are one of the earliest things many parents teach their  children. Kari's Law would require multiline telephone systems to be  configured with the ability directly to dial 911 without any additional  prefix.                                time  1730    The law would also require that multiline phone systems be configured  to notify a central location within the system's facility when someone  initiates a call to 911. This provision will help ensure first  responders have the information needed to better locate and assist the  caller.   There are some businesses, including a number of hotel chains, who  have shown initiative and applied these changes in their facilities  already. I commend them, but there is more work to be done. These  simple fixes should be adopted and implemented nationwide. When dialing  to reach emergency responders, it needs to go through, period.   I thank Hank Hunt, Kari's father, who has been a tireless advocate  for this legislation. He has brought this important issue to our  attention. Kari's Law passed without objection twice last Congress, and  I urge all of my colleagues to support Representative Gohmert's bill  once again. Representative Gohmert has certainly taken the lead on this  across the United States. He is an angel of mercy in this regard. I  hope this legislation becomes law this year and will be signed into law  by our new President because I think it is critical for the safety of  the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                      H.R. 582 Kari's Law Act of 2017                     BACKGROUND AND NEED FOR LEGISLATTON         Multi-Line Telephone Systems (MLTS) serve multiple       telephone users at a single site, often an office building,       hotel, university campus, or similar location. One common       feature of MLTS is the configuration that permits shorter       dialing sequences within the system by requiring a user to       dial a digit or prefix to reach a number outside of the       system--that is, dial ``9'' before reaching an outside line.       Thus, on some MLTS a user may have to dial the prefix when       attempting to make an emergency call. In December 2013, Kari       Hunt was killed by her estranged husband in a motel room in       Texas. Her daughter repeatedly attempted to dial 9-1-1 from       the motel room, but was unable to reach emergency responders       because the motel's MLTS required users to dial ``9'' to       reach an outside line.        Kari's Law seeks to ensure that this situation does not       result in confusion in the heat of an emergency, preventing       others from accessing essential emergency services from an       MLTS phone. While many hotels and office buildings have begun       to make this change to their systems, this bill would make it       a universal requirement. H.R. 582 requires that all MLTS have       a default configuration that allows users to directly dial 9-      1-1, without the need for any additional digit or prefix,       from any phone with dialing facilities. In addition, the       system must also be configured to notify a designated central       point of contact when someone initiates a call to 9-1-1 using       the system. By notifying a central point of contact,       emergency responders are better able to access, locate, and       assist a caller who initiates a 9-1-1 call within the MLTS.                SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION         Section 1. Short title        Section 1 provides that the Act may be cited as the       ``Kari's Law Act of 2017.''        Section 2. Configuration of multi-line telephone systems       for direct dialing of 9-1-1        Section 2(a) adds a new Section 721 to the Communications       Act of 1934, as amended.        New Section 721(a) requires that any person manufacturing,       selling, importing, or leasing multi-line telephone systems       only do so if the system is pre-configured in a way that a       user may directly initiate a call to 9-1-1 without dialing       any additional digits or prefixes. This section applies to       any system that is sold, leased, offered, or imported for use       in the United States after the effective date. This includes       systems that have call control located outside of the U.S.,       but have terminals or end points in the U.S. While systems       are required to be pre-configured with the default dialing       pattern described in this section, it does not preclude the       inclusion of additional optional dialing patterns to reach 9-      1-1 (e.g. (9)9-1-1). However, if the system is configured       with these additional dialing patterns, they must be in       addition to the default pattern.        New Section 721(b) requires that any person who installs,       operates, or manages a MLTS only do so if the system is       configured such that a user may directly initiate a call to       9-1-1 without any additional digit or prefix. This section       also applies to systems installed, managed, or operated for       use in the United States.        New Section 721(c) requires that systems be configured to       provide a notification to either a central location at the       facility where the system is located, or to a contact person       or organization regardless of location. This section is       intended to assist first responders in their emergency       response by providing access and information needed to locate       the caller. This can be particularly important in large       buildings like hotels, hospitals, and schools, where on-site       personnel are uniquely suited to provide information about       the building and its occupants. This provision requires the       system to designate a central point of contact, but allows       the MLTS owner or operator some flexibility in determining       the most appropriate contact, whether in the building or       otherwise.        This subsection only applies to systems where the       configuration is achievable without an improvement to the       hardware or software of the system. The Committee intends       this provision to include upgrades to the core systems of a       MLTS, but not the addition of additional extensions or lines.       The Committee also intends this provision to apply to       substantial upgrades to the software, particularly those       requiring a significant purchase. Minor software upgrades       that are easily achieved or are made to improve the security       of the system would not be considered an ``improvement'' for       the purposes of this section. The legislation seeks to       balance the need for an onsite notification with the goal of       not placing an undue burden on MLTS owners or operators.        New Section 721(d) clarifies that this legislation does not       alter the authority of state or local agencies with       jurisdiction over emergency communications, as long as that       authority isn't exercised in a manner inconsistent with this       legislation.        New Section 721(e) allows for enforcement under Title V of       the Communications Act, but only to the extent that the       section allows for the imposition of a fine.        New Section 721(f) defines multi-line telephone system by       crossreferencing the definition in Section 6502 of the Middle       Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012.        Section 2(b) sets an effective date for the changes at two       years after the date of enactment of the Act.    Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in general support of H.R. 582. The primary  sponsor is Representative Gohmert.   This is a bill that passed the House last Congress by voice vote.   I agree that we must do all we can to make sure that consumers using  multiline telephone systems can directly dial 911 without having to  dial additional digits first. These are in many large office buildings  and hotels. Many of these systems require consumers to dial an extra 9  before they get a dial tone. You have to hit 9 before you get your dial  tone to get an outside line. Most of us know that, but too many people  do not realize that this applies to 911. If you don't dial 9 first, you  can't reach the emergency services.   Such a requirement led to a tragedy in Texas several years ago. Kari  Dunn was killed while her 9-year-old daughter tried to call for help.  She did what she was taught to do in an emergency. She dialed 911. But  because the system she was using required her to dial a 9 first, she  only heard silence on the other end of the line.   Building on the Herculean effort of Kari Dunn's family, we are one  step closer to fixing this problem once and for all. H.R. 582 is an  important step to making our systems work better in an emergency. But  for all the good this bill does, it still leaves work to be done.   Specifically, these multiline systems still often fail to deliver  accurate location information to first responders. That means that if  somebody called 911 from this very building, for instance, precious  minutes would tick by as emergency personnel struggle to figure out  where the call came from in this  [[Page H590]]  enormous complex. That delay could be the difference between life and  death.   We have to correct this problem, too, because making sure the call  goes through is only helpful if the public safety officials can find  the caller. Democrats tried to include such a provision in the version  of this bill from last Congress, and at that time we received a  commitment from Chairman Walden to work together on a separate bill to  address this concern.   We were not able to solve this problem in the last Congress, and we  expect that commitment will carry over to this Congress. I urge Members  to support H.R. 582.   Mr. Speaker, we have no other speakers on this side, so I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert), the sponsor of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers.   I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 582, the  Kari's Law Act of 2017, which amends the Communications Act of 1934 to  require multi-line telephone systems to have a configuration that  permits users to directly initiate a call 9-1-1 without dialing any  additional digit, code, prefix, or post-fix.   As a senior member of the House Committees on Homeland Security and  Judiciary, I am well aware of the importance of 9-1-1 services and some  of the challenges of E-9-1-1 to ensure that those seeking emergency  assistance receive the help they need.   H.R. 582 would create parity for landline ``9-1-1 services'' and  smartphone E-9-1-1 services'' so that emergency assistance request from  either is treated the same.   The bill requires that those engaged in the manufacturing,  importation, sale, and lease of telecommunication service or devices  pre-configured technology to dial 9-1-1.   The goal of H.R. 582 is to ensure that all emergency calls regardless  of the source are routed properly to emergency services.   Kari's Law is not intended to alter the authority of State  commissions or other State or local agencies with jurisdiction over  emergency communications.   The establishment of the Kari's Law Act acknowledges the importance  of the configuration of multi-line telephones systems for direct  dialing for 9-1-1.   Over the past two decades, the personal communications of Americans  have changed.   The Wireless Association reported that the penetration of cellular  devices surpassed 100 percent in 2012, and as of the latest 2014  report, penetration is now at 110 percent.   According to the Pew Research Center, 68 percent of U.S. adults have  a smartphone, up from 35 percent in 2011, and tablet computer ownership  has edged up to 45 percent among adults, according to newly released  survey data from the Pew Research Center.   Smartphone ownership is nearing the saturation point with some  groups: 86 percent of those ages 18 through 29 have a smartphone, as do  83 percent of those ages 30 through 49 and 87 percent of those living  in households earning $75,000 and up annually.   With so many mobile devices deployed the majority of calls to 911  emergency public safety answering points (PSAP) originate from them.   U.S. emergency dispatch agencies report that wireless callers are  responsible for at least 80 percent of their emergency call volume.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to Support H.R. 582, Kari's  Law Act of 2017.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Lance) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 582.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
