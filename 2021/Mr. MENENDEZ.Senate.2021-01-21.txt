 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate be in a period of morning business,  [[Page S88]]  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I come to the floor today to urge the  swift confirmation for Tony Blinken to be the Secretary of State.   Like we saw with Avril Haines yesterday and moving toward Lloyd  Austin today, we need to hold a floor vote on Mr. Blinken's nomination  urgently.   Mr. Blinken is well known to the Senate, having previously been  confirmed as Deputy Secretary of State, having served as the Deputy  National Security Advisor and, of course, as the staff director of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee before that.   He is superbly qualified to be the Secretary of State, and his  knowledge and thoughtfulness were on display during 5 hours of  testimony earlier this week. And since then, he has been asked to  respond to hundreds of questions. As a matter of fact, he has had an  inordinate number of questions that have been put to him for the  record. He had nearly over half a hundred before his hearing. He has  had from a couple of our colleagues nearly 600 questions, including  multiple parts to those questions. And to my knowledge, he has largely  answered them all, notwithstanding the size, the magnitude of it.   Now, I have been, since I arrived in this institution, one of the big  advocates of the prerogatives of each and every individual Senator and  of the institution. So I take a back step to no one, but there is a  difference between prerogatives and prerogatives that are abused,  which, in essence, are for the purpose of not seeking information but  for the purpose of delaying a nomination.   Now, I appreciate that Senator Risch, the present chairman of the  committee, has been working with me to try to accelerate Mr. Blinken's  nomination to the floor, but I would ask my colleagues, particularly  those on the committee, to join him and I in an effort to bring one of  the important national security positions in our government to the  floor for a vote.   I don't think we should be leaving this weekend without a vote for  the Secretary of State.   He is the right person to repair and restore our alliances, to  rebuild and renew the State Department, to reinvigorate the  relationship between the Department and Congress--something  [[Page S92]]  that I think Republicans and Democrats alike have agreed have soured  dramatically.   His testimony, his opening statement, his answers to questions show  that he will be a working partner with this institution.   But, obviously, confirming Mr. Blinken is not just about the nominee  himself. It is about doing what the American people expect and the  Constitution requires--providing advice and consent to ensure that  national security officials are in office in a timely manner.   We are facing challenges in every corner of the world. The world is  on fire--from Iran to Russia, to Venezuela, to global challenges that  define our times and defy borders, like COVID, migration, and climate  change. We can't afford delaying to put Mr. Blinken in office. We can't  allow the State Department to be rudderless.   If we don't have leadership, we can't be sure that China or Russia  and others won't fill the vacuum as they have for the last several  years or do something that is adverse to our national and economic  security.   Imagine that there is a hostage deal to be had, as I believe there  is, and you can't have another country call the Secretary of State  because the Secretary of State doesn't exist.   Imagine if there are tensions between two countries that affect our  national interests. You don't have a Secretary of State to call as  counterpart in those countries to seek to ease the tension, to remove  the threat.   Imagine if President Biden needs to have a Secretary of State engage  in some part of the world to stop a conflict, to open an opportunity,  to prevent an unintended consequence. We don't have that person, and we  cannot expect the President to pick up the phone in each and every  instance in the world as he is trying to deal with COVID at home and an  economic crisis that follows on from that. That is what the Secretary  of State does.   So Mr. Blinken also, finally, is not just critical to addressing  challenges abroad, we have to acknowledge what the role of Secretary of  State is here at home.   If we remember what just happened back on the 6th, three of the first  four officials in the line of succession--the Vice President, the  Speaker of the House, and the President pro tempore of the Senate--were  in the Capitol when domestic terrorists breached the building. Every  day we learn more details about this heinous attack, including that the  terrorists, some of whom were chanting ``Hang Mike Pence!'' came within  a minute or so of a potential face-to-face encounter with Vice  President Pence. Thank God, through the quick thinking and heroics of  our Capitol Police and other law enforcement, those three remained  unscathed, but if something had happened, it is the Secretary of State  who is fourth in line of succession to the President of the United  States. Leaving the office vacant is irresponsible. It is irresponsible  in that regard. It is irresponsible in terms of something happening in  the world and not having a Secretary of State who could work to deal  with it so that we could preserve our national security, promote our  national interests, and stop something, an unintended consequence, from  happening.    Mr. Blinken has the qualifications. The challenges facing our country  call for him to be confirmed, and I hope the Senate does not leave here  tomorrow until he is confirmed.   With that, I yield the floor.    Thank you.                            ____________________
