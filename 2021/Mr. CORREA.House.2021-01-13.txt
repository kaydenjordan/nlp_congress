 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  [[Page H163]]    Mr. Speaker, last week, Congress was under siege by a mob motivated  and directed by the President of the United States. Our Vice President  was a target of that mob. Members of Congress, both Democrats and  Republicans, were targets of this mob. And I witnessed, for the first  time in my life, Americans fighting Americans, all at the behest of our  own President of the United States. As Americans, we can do better.   I will vote for impeachment today for our Nation, for our children,  and for our grandchildren. I will be voting for impeachment so that  America will once again be the shining city upon the hill whose beacon  light guides freedom-loving people everywhere.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me and vote for  impeachment.
