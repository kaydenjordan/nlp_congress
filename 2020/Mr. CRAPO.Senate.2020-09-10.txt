 Mr. President, in honor of National POW/MIA  Recognition Day this September 18, 2020, I join in raising awareness  about the more than 81,900 Americans the Defense POW/MIA Accounting  Agency, DPAA, reports remain missing from World War II, the Korean war,  the Vietnam war, the Cold War, the Gulf wars and other conflicts. I  also commend the members of the POW*MIA Awareness Rally Corp. of  Pocatello, ID, and other similar groups that keep a spotlight on the  immense service of our American servicemembers and the ongoing need to  bring them all home.   My heart goes out to the American families who have carried on  through years, and even decades, waiting for answers to their  questions. Those who see a loved one off to war but long after the  war's end still await that loved one's return shoulder our country's  sorrow. May all servicemembers' families get the resolution of knowing  their lost family members have been returned to the country they served  so admirably.   Thank you to those who work for and assist the DPAA and related  efforts to get needed answers and bring all American servicemembers  home. Piecing together the circumstances, whereabouts, and lives of  those lost cannot be easy, especially during a global pandemic, but  bringing them home is critical to honoring their service. The DPAA  reports that 75 percent of lost Americans are located in the Indo- Pacific, and more than 41,000 of the missing are presumed lost at sea.  Despite the difficulty, the agency announced accounting for more than  70 missing servicemembers since March. Their locations included  Germany, Laos, North Korea, Papua, Pearl Harbor, the Philippines,  Romania, Saipan, South Korea, and Tarawa.   To help with this effort, I have supported and introduced the  bipartisan Bring Our Heroes Home Act, which would address obstacles  preventing families and caseworkers from accessing the records needed  for recovery efforts by putting one entity in charge of prioritizing  and facilitating the declassification of records related to missing  servicemembers. We cannot let up in bringing home all our Nation's  heroes, including the 359 Idahoans, who have yet to be returned. Those  who have served our Nation deserve no less than to rest at home, and we  cannot rest until they do.                            ____________________
