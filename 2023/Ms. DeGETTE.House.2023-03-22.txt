 Madam Speaker, Colorado mourned one of its finest public  servants this week when we lost former Congresswoman Pat Schroeder.   Pat was a pioneer for women's rights, and she was the first woman  ever elected to represent the State of Colorado in the U.S. House. For  24 years, she fought tirelessly in this Chamber to expand the rights of  women, families, and children across this country.   She cofounded the Congressional Women's Caucus, and she was the first  woman ever selected to serve on the House Armed Services Committee. She  championed legislation to protect pregnant workers and women in the  military, and she was the driving force behind the Family and Medical  Leave Act.   What made Pat so unique, though, wasn't just the brilliance that she  had or her passion for public service. It was her razor-sharp wit.   Pat could trade barbs with anybody at a moment's notice on any  subject. She could disarm her most harsh critics with humor and grace,  and she had  [[Page H1318]]  an unrivaled ability to light up almost any room she walked into. We  can all agree there will never be another Pat Schroeder.   I am grateful for the time I got to spend with her and for the  friendship and mentorship she provided to me over the years.   This is something that doesn't happen very often: Pat was elected to  Congress when I was in high school; I never voted for anybody for  Congress except for Pat Schroeder and myself.   She is a giant whose shoulders we all stand on today, and she will be  missed by everybody here, by everybody in the First Congressional  District of Colorado, and by millions of people whose lives have been  made better because of the legacy of Pat Schroeder.   Madam Speaker, I thank you for helping me honor the memory of Pat  Schroeder by observing a moment of silence.                            ____________________
