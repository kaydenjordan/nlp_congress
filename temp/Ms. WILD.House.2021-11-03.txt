 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 760 and in  solidarity with the Cubans who, have over the past months, turned out  in large numbers to engage in peaceful demonstrations for a better  future.  [[Page H6154]]    They did so with the full knowledge that they were braving an  authoritarian regime that criminalizes dissent.   According to Amnesty International's Americas director: ``In response  to the protests of 11 July, the Cuban authorities have applied the same  machinery of control that they have used to target alternative thinkers  for decades, but now amped up to a scale we haven't seen in almost 20  years, and with new tactics, including the use of internet  interruptions and online censorship to control and cover up the grave  human rights violations they have committed.''   These are sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, husbands and  wives. Above all, they are human beings who are entitled to fundamental  rights denied to them for far too long.   As the House of Representatives takes this vote, let us stand with  every prisoner of conscience and dissident facing persecution in Cuba  and in every corner of the world.
