 Mr. Speaker, earlier this month we  celebrated National Food Bank Day. Each year on the first Friday in  September, we have an opportunity to recognize the valuable role that  food banks play in our communities and offer thanks to the tireless  volunteers who help feed hunger-challenged families nationwide.   No matter the time of the year, food banks and food pantries support  our neighbors in need with access to food, and throughout the pandemic,  we have seen just how critical this access can be.   In 2018, more than 37 million Americans were considered food  insecure, including 11 million children. The Department of Agriculture,  defines food insecurity as ``a lack of consistent access to enough food  for an active, healthy life.''   Healthy families need access to quality, nutritious food. As a former  chairman of the Committee on Agriculture Subcommittee on Nutrition,  Oversight, and Department Operations, this is an issue that I feel very  passionately about.   I am pleased to see the success of USDA's Farmers to Families Food  Box program and have heard a lot of positive feedback from volunteers  and food bank staff in my district.   Through the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, or CFAP, the USDA  has delivered more than 90 million boxes of fresh, delicious,  nutritious food to families in need. Fresh fruits and vegetables, milk  and dairy products, meat and more have been distributed by food banks,  community centers, and churches nationwide.   I would be remiss if I didn't mention how helpful this has been for  our farmers and ranchers as well. Earlier in the pandemic, we heard too  many stories of dairy farmers dumping their milk and crops going to  waste. The Farmers to Families Food Box program allows farmers to sell  their products and crops to be used in the boxes which has reduced  waste.   John, from the Christian Food Bank of Elk County in my district,  called the boxes a ``Godsend,'' noting that recipients were deeply  appreciative and amazed by the quality and variety of the food.   Mel Curtis, director of the Centre County YMCA, said the boxes have  been extremely helpful for families because the boxes provide goods  that individuals and families with limited income may have to forego at  the grocery store.   I would like to give a special shout-out to Mel Curtis and all of the  other hardworking people at the Centre County YMCA. I have been  particularly impressed with their high energy, can-  [[Page H4651]]  do spirit, and constant commitment to serving families in the Centre  region. Mel and his team are always innovating and thinking of new ways  to reach out to the community.   I was pleased to join the Centre County YMCA this summer for a  Travelin' Table event to collect donations of food and to pack grab- and-go lunches for local students. Travelin' Table is a mobile feeding  bus. Typically, the bus makes six to eight stops a day delivering food,  but operations have been kicked into high gear during the pandemic  thanks to the YMCA team.   Mr. Speaker, that Travelin' Table, that mobile feeding bus, was made  possible largely through a grant from USDA with rural economic  development, and just a tremendous impact that that has had at a  critical time that all of our families across this Nation are facing.   This kind of attitude and commitment to service is a beacon of hope  during these times, Mr. Speaker.   I thank the Centre County YMCA, the Christian Food Bank of Elk  County, and all of our other food bank staff and volunteers who are  helping families in their communities.   A special shout-out also to Patti Long, for her volunteer efforts in  my own home community of Howard.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize September as National Recovery Month, an opportunity to raise  awareness about substance abuse and mental health, and to shed light on  the resources available to help those on the road to recovery.   Before my time in Congress, I spent 28 years as a therapist and  rehabilitation services manager. I have seen firsthand how substance  abuse and mental health disorders can impact an individual and their  loved ones.   Substance abuse and mental health disorders do not discriminate. They  do not see race, gender, or socioeconomic status. This is a  particularly difficult time to be struggling with a substance abuse  problem or mental health disorder. COVID-19 has put an enormous strain  on the American people over the last several months, and mental health  has been undoubtedly impacted.   We can all play a part in helping those who are struggling. I would  like to encourage anyone in need to take advantage of the resources  available through the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration by visiting their website or calling 1-800-662-HELP.  Sometimes just a phone call can be a big step on the road to recovery.                            ____________________
