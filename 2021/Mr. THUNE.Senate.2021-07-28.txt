 Mr. President, not content with their $1.9 trillion so- called COVID relief bill--paid for entirely with money borrowed from  younger generations of Americans and our children and grandchildren-- Democrats are readying another partisan spending spree.   Democrats are preparing to consider a $3.5 trillion tax-and-spending  package, this one at least partially paid for by massive tax hikes--tax  hikes on small businesses, tax hikes on large businesses, tax hikes on  investment, tax hikes on well-off Americans, and tax hikes on the  middle class. That is right, tax hikes on the middle class.   Now, President Biden is fond of repeating that he won't raise taxes  on anyone making under $400,000 a year, but the new death tax he is  proposing will definitely hit some middle-class Americans. Let's talk  about that new tax.   President Biden and congressional Democrats are proposing to  eliminate a part of the Tax Code known as ``step-up in basis'' or  referred to often as ``stepped-up basis.'' Under our current Tax Code,  when you inherit something from an estate, whether that is stocks or a  house, the value of that item is stepped up from its original value to  its current market value when you receive it. This prevents you from  having to pay capital gains taxes on the amount that your parents'  house increased in value when it was owned by your parents.   Let's say you inherit a house that your parents bought for $100,000,  but it is now worth $500,000. Under current law, when you inherit that  house, you are not liable for taxes on the increase in value from the  time your parents bought it. The house is transferred to you at its  current market value of $500,000. So if you sell the house right when  you inherit it, you will receive the full value of the house instead of  having to pay taxes on the amount that the house increased in value  while your parents owned it. If you sell that house 2 years later for  $650,000, you are only required to pay taxes on the $150,000 in value  it gained while it was in your possession.   Under the Democrats' proposal, however, capital gains taxes would  automatically be triggered upon death if the increase in value of an  individual's estate has exceeded a certain amount. So, if your parents'  house or the family farm or other assets have increased in value more  than Democrats deem desirable, you would now owe capital gains taxes on  the amount of that increase immediately after your parents' death minus  the amount Democrats choose to exempt.   There are plenty of middle-class Americans around this country who  would be paying this tax. You wouldn't be protected just because you  make under $400,000 a year.   Now, the President has tried to get around this by arguing that  Democrats would be taxing dead individuals, not living ones. So if your  parents die and pass on their estate, the argument suggests the tax  that you have to send to the Federal Government isn't a tax on you but  on your parents. Well, who does he think he is fooling? Who is going to  experience the loss of that money--you or your parents? Who is going to  be writing the check to the Federal Government? You will.   Let's imagine that a woman's parents die and leave her their estate,  and 2 weeks later, a thief comes in and steals part of that  inheritance. Who are people going to think was robbed--the daughter or  her deceased parents? I think all of us would recognize that it was the  daughter who was robbed. The same thing applies to Democrats' proposed  new death tax. It is not dead Americans who would be writing checks to  the Federal Government. Sure, the tax is owed by the decedent or  transferor, but for all practical purposes, the costs would be borne by  their descendants.   The truth is, even if we accept the argument that Democrats' new  death tax is a tax on deceased Americans and not their descendants,  this tax would still hit some middle-class Americans. After all, it is  perfectly possible to work hard your whole life and invest wisely and  see your estate appreciate in value by more than $1.25 million--the  proposed individual exemption level--over the course of your life  without ever exiting the middle class. We are not talking about  confining this taxation to individuals with a yearly income of $1.25  million; we are talking about the increase in value on an estate over a  person's lifetime. There is no question that this tax would fall on the  estates of some thoroughly middle-class Americans.   The problems with this new death tax aren't limited to the fact that  it breaks President Biden's pledge not to raise taxes on individuals  making under $400,000 a year. There are a lot of additional problems,  starting with the administration and compliance costs of this tax.   Congress actually passed a similar proposal in the 1970s but repealed  it before it went into effect because it was so complicated and  unworkable. That is right. Congress repealed the proposal before it  was even implemented because it was clear that collecting this tax was  going to be too complicated.    Forty-odd years later, collecting this tax would still be an  enormously complicated matter. It would put incredible new  recordkeeping requirements on a lot of American families, and it would  strain the capabilities of the IRS, although those 87,000 new IRS  employees President Biden wants to add to the Agency would certainly  increase the available manpower to levy new tax hikes.   Plus, I can only imagine the litigation that would arise over the  valuation of assets. What happens if the IRS disagrees with the  estimate of the value of your family farm or business? Do you have to  take the IRS to court? Will the IRS take you to court?   In addition, there is a very real danger that Americans would be  paying taxes on nonexistent gains, in part due to inflation and the  natural expansion of the economy. Recent economic reports are raising  concerns that, with the administration's robust new entitlement  spending, Americans could be shouldering the burdens of significant  inflation now and long into the future. But Democrats' new death tax  would not account for inflation on an asset, like a family-owned farm  or business, which means Americans could be paying a lot of money in  taxes on nonexistent gains.   Finally, I want to talk about the threat this tax poses to family  farms and businesses.   Now, Democrats claim that they will defer this tax for family farms  and businesses as long as a member of the family inherits and then runs  the farm or business, but it is completely unclear what this will look  like in practice. Will ``family members'' refer only to sons and  daughters? What if a stepson wants to take over the farm, or a niece?  Will the inheritors still be subject to the tax then, which could  result in their having to sell that farm the niece wants to run? What  happens if two or more of the children want to run the farm? There are  a lot of unanswered questions.   Of course, it is important to remember that Democrats will only be  deferring the tax. So if the time ever comes when the family wants to  sell the farm--maybe it is getting hard to run and a neighboring family  is willing to buy it--the family would have to pay those taxes that  were deferred when their mom or dad died. If that family farm has been  handed down through a few generations already, it is completely  possible that paying those taxes would consume a big part of that  legacy.   There is a reason 13 House Democrats sent a letter to House  Democratic leaders expressing their concern about the proposed step-up  in basis repeal. It is because this tax would pose a real threat to the  continued existence of family farms and businesses. It is the same  reason that those in agriculture and small business communities oppose  this new death tax.  [[Page S5119]]    I was proud to lead all 50 Senate Republicans in a letter last week,  urging President Biden to drop this misguided proposal, and I will  continue to do everything I can to protect family farms and businesses  from this new tax.   There should be a limit on how many times the Federal Government can  tax you. Americans' bank accounts should not be regarded as a  bottomless barrel of money to pay for Democrats' preferred government  programs, because that is exactly what is happening here. Democrats  want to massively and permanently expand government, and they are  looking to Americans and American businesses to pay for their social  experiments. They apparently haven't spent much time considering how  our economy or American families would suffer as a result of their tax- and-spending spree.   Middle-class Americans should not have to see their inheritances  shrink to pay for Democrats' spending, and family farms and businesses  that already face challenges from our current death tax should not have  to be worrying that a new death tax will spell the end of their hard- earned legacies.   I hope the Democrats will think twice before moving forward with this  new tax increase on Americans.   I yield the floor.
