 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the bills before  the House.   In Colorado, our small businesses are struggling under these  unprecedented economic circumstances. From the mom-and-pop taverns in  Gilpin County and Winter Park; the restaurants in Loveland, Fort  Collins, and Boulder; Main Street businesses in Nederland and  Breckenridge; and the many Colorado businesses that rely on outdoor  recreation and ski season, in particular, they never could have planned  for this pandemic. We cannot expect them to weather this crisis alone.   The Payroll Protection Program has provided critical funds to keep  many of these businesses afloat and workers employed. But as we have  heard from both sides of the aisle today, many fixes are needed, and  that is what we are here today to do.   We must ensure that loan forgiveness periods are extended so that  small businesses are not on the hook for this money while their doors  remain shut. We must extend the program past June 30 as so many of our  businesses face increased uncertainty and as our country faces  uncertainty about what the future holds in the coming months. We must  expand access and transparency and prioritize our veteran-owned and  economically disadvantaged businesses.   At the end of the day, we must continue to support our local small  businesses because they are the lifeblood of our communities, for the  sake of our families, our local economies, and our future.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her strong leadership over  the course of this pandemic and my freshman colleague, Representative  Phillips, for his leadership in bringing this bill forward. I am proud  to support it. Let's get this done for small businesses in Colorado and  across America.                                time  1030
