 Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to an  exceptional man in my home State of Maine, Nick Archer. I have been so  fortunate to have been surrounded by outstanding people both as my time  as Governor of Maine, as a private citizen of Maine, and now as U.S.  Senator. Some of those people have been woven into my world through all  facets of my career, and Nick Archer is one of those individuals.   Nick recently retired from the Maine Department of Environmental  Protection after nearly 35 years of employment. But to Nick--and  thankfully for all of us Mainers--his position at Maine DEP was more  than a job. His interest in protecting the environment spans over four  decades and extends into so many of his passions in life. Not being one  to shy away from difficulty, Nick understood the history and the  importance of industry, agriculture, and forestry in Maine but also  realized the environment needed to be protected for the vibrant future  of Maine's land and waterways. He worked throughout his career to build  partnerships and build on communications between the two and was known  for his common sense and matter-of-fact approach. Nick's approach was  always in the spirit of compromise but firmly rooted in the protection  of our great resources. Solution focused--he set expectations high for  integrity, innovation, and ingenuity and enjoyed thinking outside the  box.   As if his career wasn't impactful enough, Nick also gave his time to  so many community service activities. An avid outdoorsman, he was in  leadership roles at both the local and State levels in Fish and Game  Clubs and Sportsman's Alliance of Maine. If there was a need at a  fishing derby or any outdoor activity involving youth engagement, Nick  Archer was the first to sign up and donate both time and money. He is a  cheerleader for a myriad of causes from veterans organizations to local  Rotary clubs. I am thankful Nick is staying in the great State of Maine  for his next chapter and spending time with his favorite people, his  family.   In Maine, we are blessed with people who have exceptional work ethic  and a piece of their heart in their communities and those people often  do not want any recognition. I am sure Nick is one of those people, but  having known him, having his assistance to my office staffers, and  knowing his truly altruistic nature, I will take the risk and am so  proud to honor him and his dedicated service and commitment to the  State of Maine and to the communities it encompasses.                            ____________________
