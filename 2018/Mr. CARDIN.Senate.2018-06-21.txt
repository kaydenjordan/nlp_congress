 Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Dr.  J. Alex Haller, Jr., a pioneer in the field of pediatric surgery, who  died on June 13 at the age of 91. Theodore Roosevelt once said, ``The  greatest gift life has to offer is the opportunity to work hard at work  worth doing.'' Alex Haller certainly spent his life working hard on  something worthwhile. He was a professor emeritus of pediatrics,  surgery, and emergency medicine at the Johns Hopkins Medical School and  was the surgeon in charge of the Johns Hopkins Children's Center for  nearly 30 years. Over the course of his distinguished career, he became  known as the ``father of pediatric trauma care.'' Throughout his life,  Dr. Haller pushed the boundaries and transformed how we care for our  children.   Dr. Haller was born in Pulaski, VA, in 1927. He earned his bachelor's  degree from Vanderbilt University and then came to Baltimore to earn  his MD from the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. After he  graduated from Johns Hopkins in 1951, Dr. Haller spent a year as a  fellow in pathology at the University of Zurich, and then served in the  military for 2 years. He returned to Johns Hopkins to complete his  residency. In 1959, he went to Louisville General Hospital, where he  served as chief of cardiac surgery for 4 years. Then, Alfred Blalock,  the chief of surgery at Johns Hopkins, asked him to return to head the  new pediatric surgery division Blalock planned to launch.   During his time at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Haller was responsible for  helping to make Johns Hopkins one of the best hospitals for pediatric  care in the country. For almost 30 years, he served as the surgeon in  charge of the Johns Hopkins Children's Center and was the founding co- director of the division pediatrics. He created the regional trauma  center for children, the first such program of its kind in the United  States, and at his urging, Johns Hopkins became the first academic  medical center to implement pediatric surgery subspecialties.   Outside of Johns Hopkins, Dr. Haller created opportunities for his  colleagues to learn from one another. He was one of 24 pediatric  surgeons who founded the American Pediatric Surgical Association and  played a key role in developing the Pediatric Advanced Life Support, or  PALS, protocol, which details the steps and procedures for stabilizing  critically injured children or those with other emergency conditions.   Nelson Mandela once said ``There can be no keener revelation of a  society's soul than the way in which it treats its children.'' Dr.  Haller spent his life ensuring that our children will have the best  care that modern medicine can offer. He leaves a lasting legacy in the  lives of children whom he saved and who will be saved because of his  pioneering work and because he trained so many other doctors and  surgeons who carry on the mission. On behalf of my colleagues, I send  my deepest condolences to his wife of 67 years, Emily Simms, whom he  met in college and who became an obstetrician; his daughter, Dr. Julia  Haller, ophthalmologist in chief at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia;  two sons, J. Alex Haller III of Asheville, NC, and Frederick B.  ``Fritz'' Haller of Winston-Salem, NC; another daughter, Clare Haller  Hughes of New Canaan, CT; and 16 grandchildren. In the midst of his  family's grief, I hope they can find solace in reflecting on what a  truly great and kind and humane person Dr. Haller was. The Baltimore  Sun contained an obituary and I ask that the obituary be printed in the  Record following my remarks. The obituary, I think, captures Dr.  Haller's wonderful humanity, which should serve as a beacon for all of  us to follow.   The material follows:  [[Page S4340]]                        [From the Baltimore Sun, June 6, 2018]  J. Alex Haller Jr., Johns Hopkins Pediatric Surgeon Who Gained Fame in                      Separating Conjoined Twins, Dies                             (By Jacques Kelly)         Dr. J. Alex Haller Jr., a retired Johns Hopkins pediatric       surgeon recalled as the ``father of pediatric trauma care,''       died of respiratory arrest June 13 at his Glencoe home. He       was 91.        He was a professor emeritus of pediatrics, surgery and       emergency medicine at the Johns Hopkins Medical School and       was the surgeon-in-charge of the Johns Hopkins Children's       Center for nearly 30 years.        ``Putting yourself in a child's shoes is part of being a       good surgeon,'' he once said.        Born in Pulaski, Va., he was son of J. Alex Haller, a       dentist, and his wife Julia Allison.        Emerging from scarlet fever as a young child--he lost his       hair permanently as a result--he was determined to go into       medicine.        After the death of his mother, he was raised by his father       and two maiden aunts who instilled a strong moral sense in       him. An Eagle Scout, he was a 1944 graduate of Pulaski High       School, where he played basketball.        He obtained a bachelor's degree at Vanderbilt University,       where he met his future wife, Emily Simms. She would go on to       become an obstetrician.        In a 2008 oral history, he said he came to Baltimore in       1947 and hailed a cab at Penn Station to take him to Hopkins.       He wound up, incorrectly, at the Homewood campus in North       Baltimore. From there he caught a streetcar to the East       Baltimore medical school.        ``I went down through every imaginable slum area, and it       got worse and worse as I went deeper and deeper into East       Baltimore and finally ended up right there at the hospital,''       he said. ``I got out and said to myself, `Oh, my. This is the       end of the world.' . . . So I registered and that was the       beginning of my medical school journey.''        While in medical school, Dr. Haller also studied at Boston       Children's Hospital, where he developed an interest in       pediatric surgery. After graduating from Hopkins in 1951, he       studied pathology at the University of Zurich.        He did his military service in the Coast Guard--he said he       was mainly called upon to remove tattoos--and at the National       Institutes of Health.        He performed his residency at Hopkins and joined the       faculty of the University of Louisville in 1959, where he       served as chief of cardiac surgery at the Louisville General       Hospital. The renowned Johns Hopkins surgeon Alfred Blalock       asked him to return to Baltimore to head a new pediatric       surgery division.        In 1971 Hopkins opened the country's first pediatric       emergency room within a general hospital. In an article in       The Baltimore Sun about the opening of the new facility, Dr.       Haller said he did not like mixing children with adults in       crowded general emergency rooms.        In 1982 he led a surgical team that separated conjoined       twins, who were connected at their chests. The twin girls,       Emily and Francesca Selvaggio, were separated in a 10-hour       surgery.        ``Dr. Haller was a pioneer in pediatric surgery and       responsible for training innumerable surgeons and leaders in       the field,'' said Dr. George Dover, former director of the       Department of Pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins University       School of Medicine and former pediatrician-in-chief of the       Johns Hopkins Children's Center.        He said Dr. Haller ``was responsible for the concept of the       Children's Medical and Surgical Center . . . the first       building to house all children in a separate facility at       Johns Hopkins. His impact on pediatric medicine was       enormous.''        Dr. Haller also worked with the University of Maryland's       shock trauma pioneer, R Adams Cowley, to organize a statewide       shock trauma system, the Maryland Emergency Medical Services       system.        ``By far, the leading cause of pediatric death was then and       remains trauma--injury from auto accidents, falls and       burns,'' said Dr. James A. O'Neill, a friend for more than 50       years.        ``The basis of trauma medicine was military experience in       Korea and Vietnam. Very little was known about how to treat       children involved in accidents,'' Dr. O'Neill said. ``Dr.       Haller led the effort to treat injured children and is truly       the father of pediatric trauma care.''        Dr. O'Neill, a professor of pediatric surgery at Vanderbilt       University, also called Dr. Haller ``a true social genius. He       could relate to anyone. He was charming, outgoing, calm,       humble and sensitive to other people. He had a fantastic       sense of humor and an appreciation for other people's       strengths as well as their foibles. He never cared about       money.''        ``He was one of the best-known and well-beloved persons to       walk the halls of Hopkins,'' said his daughter Dr. Julia       Haller, ophthalmologist-in-chief at Wills Eye Hospital in       Philadelphia, Pa.        ``As a father, he gave us a wonderful childhood,'' she       said. ``He shared his enthusiasm about the world with all of       us.''        He published more than 350 scholarly papers and 60 book       chapters. He also wrote the 1967 book, ``The Hospitalized       Child and His Family.''        His daughter said her father and mother were a well-known       couple, particularly in the Hopkins medical community.        ``They were true partners, and each year hosted back-to-      back Christmas parties on Friday and Saturday nights so that       whoever had the weekend rotation could attend,'' she said.        ``They served country ham and crab dip. Everyone sang       Christmas carols late into the night,'' she said. ``On family       vacations, they canoed together. When we were young, they       spent a month as camp doctors in western North Carolina. My       father threw himself in all the camp activities, too.        ``It's not hard to see why children loved him,'' she said.        He was the recipient of the American Academy of Pediatrics'       William Edwards Ladd Medal, the Denis Browne Gold Medal, the       British Association of Pediatric Surgeons' award and the       Vaclav Kafka Medal from the Society of Pediatric Surgery of       Bohemia.        A funeral will be held at 11 a.m. June 23 at the Episcopal       Cathedral of the Incarnation, University Parkway and St. Paul       Street.        In addition to his wife of 67 years and daughter, survivors       include two sons, J. Alex Haller III of Asheville, N.C., and       Frederick B. ``Fritz'' Haller of Winston-Salem, N.C.; another       daughter, Clare Haller Hughes of New Canaan, Conn.; and 16       grandchildren.                            ____________________
