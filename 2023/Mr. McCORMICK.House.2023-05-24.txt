 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the legislation efforts that  we have had recently to define fentanyl as poison and to address a very  serious problem in the United States where we had 110,000 people die  last year alone.   As an emergency medicine physician, to see anywhere from one to five  overdoses per night, to see four patients come in that I could not  revive and that are no longer with us is a serious problem.   I caution everybody in Congress--from my conservative roots and the  conservative values that made this Nation what it is--not to turn to  legislation to solve this problem. We need to understand that this is a  people problem.   Ultimately, you can spend a trillion dollars overseas, you can fight  wars, you can secure your border, but until we get our hearts straight,  we will not solve this very real problem.   Until we understand that when our children are taught that they are  supporting murderers and rapists and child traffickers, people who  would do harm to all of us, then they will stop the incentive of  creating the demand, and the problem will go away.   This is a problem of our house but not this House, the house of our  family.                            ____________________
