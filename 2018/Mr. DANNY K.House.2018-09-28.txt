 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  opposition to another tax giveaway to the wealthiest in this country  who need it the least.   The Republicans' tax cut already has damaged the health of the  Medicare trust fund. This bill is more of the same.   After decades of wage stagnation, when over 41 million laborers earn  less than $12 an hour, when almost none of their employers offer health  insurance, when more than one-quarter of Americans struggle to cover  housing costs, this Republican bill helps millionaires giving an  average tax cut of over $39,000 to the top 1 percent.   The Republican plan will permanently double tax over 40 million  families due to the cap on the State and local income tax deduction.   The Republican plan permanently takes away critical personal  exemptions from millions of families with children which we need to  help. We need to help hardworking, middle-class citizens. We don't need  to give $39,000 tax breaks to the wealthy.
