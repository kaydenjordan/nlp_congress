 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5763) to provide an extension of Federal-aid highway,  highway safety, and transit programs, and for other purposes.

(e) Conforming Amendment.--Section 201 of the Surface       Transportation Extension Act of 2021 (Public Law 117-44) is       amended by striking subsection (d).       SEC. 5. PRIOR ENACTED AUTHORIZATION.         If H.R. 3684 (117th Congress) is enacted before the date of       enactment of this Act, this Act shall not take effect and the       provisions of this Act shall not be executed.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 5763.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5763, the Further Surface  Transportation Extension Act of 2021.   Here we are again, calling up yet another short-term extension of  Federal highway, transit, highway safety, motor carrier, research, and  transportation financing programs.   As I stated when the House took up the first extension on October 1,  the House of Representatives did its work last summer, which included a  5-year authorization of surface programs, well in advance of the need  for any extensions. And the Senate did later pass a 5-year  authorization.   We haven't yet found a path forward for both Chambers to pass the  same version of the bill, but we need to act immediately to be certain  we don't have a lapse in authorization. There are adequate funds in the  highway trust fund to cover this extension. No additional funds will be  necessary.   If we don't, on October 31, 3,700 employees will again receive  furlough notices that they cannot report to work on November 1, or have  to work without pay, with a temporary shutdown of those programs.   The Federal Highway Administration won't be able to provide any new  funding to States, the District, or territories. They will be able to  continue reimbursing, but a lot of States are beginning--they have  initiatives and applications pending for new programs, and all those  would be set aside and delayed.   The Federal Transit Administration won't be able to issue new funding  to 1,300 transit grantees that rely on Federal grants to fund  construction; buy vehicles and equipment, an ongoing process; and, in  some cases, pay for operating costs. The FTA can continue to make  payments for grants issued before October 1--again, not adequate  looking at future needs.   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration cannot award new  grants, and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration must stop  issuing new motor carrier safety grants.   And the Office of the Secretary will not be able to make any further  TIFIA loans.   The Further Surface Transportation Extension Act of 2021 will allow  the Department of Transportation to restart operations of programs  funded by the highway trust fund through December 3, 2021, which will  be a momentous day around here. It also authorizes DOT to provide  backpay for employees in the event of a temporary shutdown.   I urge my colleagues to support this extension which will help  provide additional time to work through the final resolution of a long- term surface transportation bill.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I have no additional speakers, and if the  gentleman is prepared to close, I would be prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, just to reiterate for colleagues that may be  listening, this extension goes till December 3. There are adequate  funds in the highway trust fund to fund all the regular programs. This  will be at current authorization levels.   It will allow States to move forward and propose new highway and  bridge projects. It will allow transit agencies to go ahead and acquire  new equipment and make other necessary repairs or improvements to their  systems.   The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the National  Highway Traffic Safety Administration will be at full operating and  full funding, so there will be no lapse should we pass this now. I urge  an ``aye'' vote.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
