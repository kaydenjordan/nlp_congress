 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the CARES Act, and  I am so proud of the emergency housing priorities, including a  temporary moratorium on evictions and foreclosures of homeowners with  federally backed mortgages. There is $4 billion for emergency grants  for homelessness, $5 billion for CDBGs, and $1 billion for project- based rental assistance.   We are in this fight together, and we will not be broken. Viruses  come and go, but the courage of the American people endures.   God bless you all.
