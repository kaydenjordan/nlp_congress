 Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of myself  and my colleague from Delaware, Senator Chris Coons, to pay tribute to  Jennifer Cohan, secretary of the Delaware Department of  Transportation--DelDOT--who has been a tremendous leader and public  servant in the State of Delaware for more than three decades. Jen has  served as the secretary of the DelDOT, since 2015 where, as the third  woman to serve as secretary in the department's 100-year history, she  developed and implemented the State's largest ever roadway  infrastructure program. She previously served as director of the  Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles--DMV--for 8 years and was the first  woman to serve in that position in State history.   After 31 years of public service to the State of Delaware, Jen is  retiring from DelDOT at the end of this month. She will be taking on a  new role as the chief executive officer of Leadership Delaware. In this  new role, Jen will lead this highly regarded organization in its  mission to recruit outstanding young Delawareans and help equip them  with the knowledge, vision, integrity, and connections they will need  to become the future leaders of communities, nonprofits, businesses,  and organizations within the First State.   As secretary of DelDOT, Jen contributed not only her intellect,  innovative ideas, and immense technical capacity, but also an uplifting  positive energy that motivated everyone fortunate enough to serve on  her team.   Over the course of her distinguished career with the State of  Delaware, Jen has held a range of leadership roles. In addition to her  leadership of DelDOT, Jen is currently the chair of the Intelligent  Transportation Society of America, where she has highlighted DelDOT's  work to prepare Delaware's transportation system for the future.  Previously, in her capacity as director of the Delaware DMV, she  transformed the agency by investing in technology and enhancing  customer service. She also previously managed Delaware's clean water  program at the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and  Environmental Control and analyzed budgets for the General Assembly in  the office of the controller general. As if that were not enough, Jen  has also spent the last 12 years as an adjunct professor at Wilmington  University, teaching leadership and public policy in the master's  program there.   On this occasion of your retirement from public service, Jen, Senator  Coons and I want to convey to you the gratitude of all Delawareans for  the enthusiasm, dedication, and entrepreneurial spirit that you have  consistently brought to your many leadership roles and for your service  to the people of Delaware. We also want to extend our heartfelt thanks  to your family for sharing you with all of us for the past 31 years. In  closing, Jen, please accept our warmest congratulations and best wishes  and our thanks for dedicating the past three decades of your life to  advancing mobility, improving infrastructure, and enhancing the quality  of life for all of us who call the First State home. Bravo Zulu. God  bless.                            ____________________
