 Mr. Chair, I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 5283,  Protecting our Communities from Failure to Secure the Border Act, and I  thank my fellow New Yorker, Congresswoman Malliotakis, for introducing  this critical legislation.   President Biden's border crisis has made every State a border State,  every city a border city, every county a border county.   As the crisis continues, we have seen migrants being housed in a  facility at JFK Airport and, more recently, we have witnessed migrant  shelters being erected at Floyd Bennett Field. The Floyd Bennett Field  shelter will house hundreds and eventually thousands of migrants on  land owned and operated by the National Park Service, a plan I  continuously have been critical of.   I am proud to be a former member of the NYPD, having spent well over  a decade investigating crimes in the Big Apple. Floyd Bennett Field  houses  [[Page H5967]]  many critical components of the NYPD, and as the NYPD works to  negotiate a new lease to stay on Floyd Bennett Field for years to come,  the city is moving in thousands of migrants. This decision is both  unwise and unsafe.   We must find solutions to the migrant crisis, and the answer is  securing our border.
