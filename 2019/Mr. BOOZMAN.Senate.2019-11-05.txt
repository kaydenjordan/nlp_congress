 Madam President, I rise today to recognize  Arkansas Farm Bureau President Randy Veach for his years of dedication  to Natural State farm families and rural communities and celebrate his  leadership, advocacy, and passion for agriculture as his service as  president comes to a close.   As a third-generation farmer, Randy has made advocating for the rural  way of life his calling. He grew up on his family's farm in the  community of Lost Cane in Mississippi County. He continues farming on  that land with his wife Thelma where they grow cotton, soybeans, rice,  wheat, corn, and milo.   His commitment to the industry has extended beyond his own fields.  For decades, Randy has been a voice for Arkansas agriculture producers,  working to develop policies that benefit farmers. He has served in a  number of leadership positions at the local level up to the national  level. He is a member of the American Farm Bureau board of directors,  and in 2015, he was appointed to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's  Trade Advisory Committee for Tobacco, Cotton, and Peanuts.   For 11 years, Randy has been at the helm of Arkansas Farm Bureau  where he worked to advance the priorities of farmers and ranchers. As a  member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I have been blessed to have  Randy's knowledge, experience, and insight to help craft farm bills and  ag policy that support Arkansas' agricultural industry and strengthen  rural communities throughout our state.   I am grateful for the friendship we have built, for his advice, and  most importantly, his service on behalf of our State's farmers and  ranchers. Although his time as president is ending, I know his advocacy  for agriculture will continue.   I wish Randy and Thelma much happiness in this next chapter of their  lives.                            ____________________
