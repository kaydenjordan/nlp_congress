 Madam President, I am speaking today to highlight  a service-disabled veteran and my constituent, Terry Hill, who is the  CEO and cofounder of Rapid Application Group, an additive manufacturing  facility just outside of my hometown of Tulsa in Broken Arrow, OK. Mr.  Hill is a hero who served his Nation nobly as a UH-60 Black Hawk  medical evacuation pilot, flying more than 750 combat missions serving  in the U.S. Army.   Due to Mr. Hill's experience, he knows better than anyone just how  essential the technology of additive manufacturing can be in the field  to support nonflight-critical parts to increase the overall readiness  and force of our military. Additive manufacturing has improved military  readiness and enabled the military services to be more self  sustainable. Continued advancement in this area will further improve  our military's readiness and overall ability to accomplish the mission  at hand.   When Mr. Hill returned home and started his business, he continued to  serve our Nation by taking care of his fellow veterans. He is committed  to hiring veterans to work in his facility and is known within our  community for seeking out opportunities to help those who have worn the  uniform. I take this opportunity today to highlight and thank Mr. Hill  for his service in the U.S. Army, but also for his continued service in  delivering needed tools to the warfighter and for supporting our  veterans.
