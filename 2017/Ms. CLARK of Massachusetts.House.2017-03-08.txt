 Mr. Speaker, well, here we are, on  International Women's Day, 7 years from when we started the Affordable  Care Act, 60 votes to repeal behind us, and yet only this week we have  had the big reveal of what the plan will be for replacement. What are  we seeing? We don't have any cost information, but we know we are going  to protect wealthy insurance executives, and we know that an estimated  15 to 20 million Americans will have their health insurance ripped away  from them.   Let me introduce you to one who is concerned about her ongoing  coverage. Her name is Stephanie Chaney, and she is from my district in  Framingham, Massachusetts. She is a recent grad student at Lesley  University, where she studied to be a clinical counselor and dance  therapist. She was diagnosed with a rare and extremely painful joint  disease, and because of the ACA, she got the treatment she needed.   Because she was a student and not employed, the healthcare law and  the changes we make are going to have a direct impact on her life. She  worries that if she cannot find another affordable plan, she will have  to start over again. Let's think of her and do the right thing by  Americans with their health care.                            ____________________
