 Madam Speaker, today, we legislate for the people.   Our passage of H.R. 1 is deeply personal to me. Unlike many of the  people we are used to seeing in our politics, I don't come from money  or from a political family. I was raised by a young, single mother who  worked multiple jobs to make ends meet, and we still needed Section 8  housing and food stamps to get by.   Of course, my family struggles could be traced to one common cause,  and that is our broken democracy. At the root of why housing, higher  education, and healthcare are out of reach for so many millions of  Americans is the fact that our democracy does not reflect the will of  the American people. Independent redistricting commissions would change  that.   When I ran for Congress, the first question political insiders asked  me wasn't what I would be campaigning on or how much support I had in  my community, but, rather, how much money could I raise?   Public campaign financing would change that.   Many people were surprised that I defeated a billionaire who tried to  purchase this congressional seat. But my election should not be the  exception to the rule; rather, it should be the norm. Once we pass H.R.  1, it will be.                                time  0945     Madam Speaker, I rise to vindicate the right to vote as  precisely that, a constitutional right, not a privilege, a right.   It is a travesty that our Nation's laws do not fully protect the  right to vote. The reason, of course, is white supremacy. Over 150  years ago, during Reconstruction, we tried to build a multiracial  democracy in this country. For the first time, Black people won seats  in this very Chamber, but white supremacists were not having it. So,  like today's Republican Party, they devised ways to deny Black people  the right to vote.   Madam Speaker, thanks to the 15th Amendment, they could not expressly  prohibit Blacks from voting, so they barred prisoners from voting. Then  they invented excuses to put Black people in those prisons. It took 70  years for a Black candidate to win a seat in this Congress from the  South again.   These Jim Crow laws remain on the books. They are why over 5 million  incarcerated people are barred from voting. These people look like me.  They are parents. They are children. They fall in love. They make  mistakes just like we do. They are citizens of the United States of  America just like we are, and they deserve the right to vote.
