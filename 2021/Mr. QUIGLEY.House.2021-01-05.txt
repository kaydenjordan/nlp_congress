 Mr. Speaker, I proudly rise in support of my  Congressional Budget Justification Transparency Act, H.R. 22.    Mr. Speaker, it is a bipartisan bill that addresses the  lack of transparency around the documents that explain why executive  agencies are requesting funds from Congress. These justifications shed  light on the work and priorities of the Federal Government far more  effectively than high-level spending figures.   Mr. Speaker, in 2018 and 2019, Congress encouraged OMB to publish all  executive branch congressional budget justification materials on a  centralized web portal. However, there is no legal requirement for  congressional budget justifications to be posted on a centralized  portal or on agency websites.   For these reasons, agencies are inconsistent in posting congressional  budget justifications online, making them difficult to access because  they are either not publicly available or are scattered across the  internet.   Mr. Speaker, my bill will strengthen Federal Government transparency  by requiring Federal agencies to publish their annual budget  justifications online in a central location. This will better allow  oversight of our government and allow the American people to verify  that their taxpayer dollars are being used wisely to invest in their  communities.    All Illinoisans and Americans should get the transparency they  deserve on government spending, and the bill does just that.   Mr. Speaker, I recognize Chairwoman Maloney and Ranking Member Comer  for their unwavering support for this bill and for prioritizing this  legislation early on in the 117th Congress. I thank them again for  their leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.
