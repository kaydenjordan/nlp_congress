 Madam Speaker, the contrast between Republicans and  Democrats on the issue of healthcare could not be any clearer.   Why do Republicans in the Trump administration want to make Americans  sick again?   They want to eliminate protections for people with preexisting  conditions. They want to take us backward.   Democrats, on the other hand, want to make America healthy.   We want to expand healthcare access. We want to strengthen the  Affordable Care Act, and we want to make sure that people with  preexisting conditions are not denied insurance coverage.   Madam Speaker, more than 200,000 people in New Jersey who purchased  their insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace have  preexisting conditions. That is why H.R. 986, the Protecting Americans  with Preexisting Conditions Act, is so important.   It would block the Trump administration's efforts to weaken the  Affordable Care Act's protections for preexisting conditions, because  there is no going back to healthcare discrimination.                            ____________________
