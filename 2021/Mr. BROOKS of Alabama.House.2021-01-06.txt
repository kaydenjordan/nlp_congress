 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  objection.    Madam Speaker, for years, Democrats and their  media allies deceived America about Trump-Russian collusion and the  extent of foreign interference in the 2016 elections. Yet, in 2020,  Democrats promoted massive foreign interference in American elections  by helping illegal aliens and other noncitizens vote in American  elections, thereby canceling the votes of and stealing elections from  American citizens.   Want evidence? Exhibit A. In 1993, Democrats rammed through Congress  the National Voter Registration Act, making it illegal--illegal--to  require proof of citizenship that prevents illegal aliens and  noncitizens from registering to vote.   Why did Democrats do that? Simple. To steal elections, of course.   Exhibit B. How bad is the noncitizen voting problem? In 2005,  Democrat President Jimmy Carter's Commission on Federal Election Reform  warned that ``noncitizens have registered to vote in several recent  elections'' and recommended that ``all States should use their best  efforts to obtain proof of citizenship before registering voters.''   Exhibit C. A June 2005 General Accountability Office report  discovered that up to 3 percent of people on voter registration lists  are not U.S. citizens.   Exhibit D. In 2008, Electoral Studies surveyed 339 noncitizens. Eight  percent admitted voting in American elections.   As an aside, I have seen higher percentages in other studies.   Exhibit E. The 2010 Census counted 11 million illegal aliens in  America.   Exhibit F. A 2018 Yale study estimated as many as 22 million illegal  aliens in America.   Exhibit G. The math means between 880,000 and 1.72 million illegal  aliens illegally voted in the 2020 elections.   Exhibit H. In 2014, Old Dominion University and George Mason  University professors surveyed noncitizens and illegal aliens and found  they vote Democrat roughly 80 percent of the time.   Exhibit I. The math is again straightforward. The 60 percent Biden  advantage times the illegal alien voting number means Joe Biden gained  roughly 1,032,000 votes from illegal alien voting. That is the high  number.   Exhibit J. While no one knows for sure how massive the illegal alien  voting bloc is, we do know Joe Biden and his campaign believed it large  enough and critical enough to winning the Presidential race that, at  the October 22 Presidential debate, Joe Biden publicly solicited the  illegal alien bloc vote by promising: ``Within 100 days, I am going to  send to the United States Congress a pathway to citizenship for over 11  million undocumented people.''   Ladies and gentlemen, Madam Speaker, that is the pot of gold at the  end of the rainbow for illegal aliens. Joe Biden knew exactly what he  was doing by seeking the illegal alien bloc vote. After all, on May 11,  1993, then-Senator Joe Biden voted for the National Voter Registration  Act, which makes it illegal to require proof of citizenship from  illegal aliens and other noncitizens when they seek to register to  vote.    Madam Speaker, the evidence is compelling and irrefutable.  Noncitizens overwhelmingly voted for Joe Biden in exchange for the  promised amnesty and citizenship and in so doing helped steal the  election from Donald Trump, Republican candidates, and American  citizens across America.   Madam Speaker, in my judgment, if only lawful votes cast by eligible  American citizens are counted, Joe Biden lost and President Trump won  the electoral college.   As such, it is my constitutional duty to promote honest and accurate  elections by rejecting electoral college vote submissions from States  whose electoral systems are so badly flawed as to render their vote  submissions unreliable, untrustworthy, and unworthy of acceptance.    Mr. President, I and 55 other Members of the  United States House of Representatives object to the electoral vote for  the State of Nevada in order to protect the lawful votes of Nevada and  all other American citizens.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Sections 15 and 17 of title 3 of the United  States Code, require that any objection be presented in writing and  signed by a Member of the House of Representatives and a Senator.   Is the objection in writing and signed by a Member and a Senator?    Mr. President, it is in writing, but,  unfortunately, no United States Senator has joined in this effort.   The VICE PRESIDENT. In that case, the objection cannot be  entertained.   Are there any further objections to counting the certificate of vote  from the State of Nevada that the teller has verified appears to be  regular in form and authentic?   There was no objection.   The VICE PRESIDENT. This certificate from New Hampshire, the  Parliamentarians have advised me, is the only certificate of electoral  vote from that State that purports to be a return from the State and  that has annexed to it a certificate of an authority of the State  purporting to appoint or ascertain electors.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 6, 2021, on page H97, second column and sixth paragraph,  the following appeared: The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, the certificate of the electoral vote  of the State of New Hampshire seems to be regular in form and  authentic, and it appears therefrom that Joseph R. Biden, Jr., of the  State of Delaware received 4 votes for President and Kamala D. Harris  of the State of California received 4 votes for Vice President.   The VICE PRESIDENT.
