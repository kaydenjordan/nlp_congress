 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts  for yielding, and I rise today in  [[Page H5320]]  strong support of the rule and underlying bill. I also want to thank  Chairman Smith for his leadership on the bill and all the members of  the Armed Services Committee for the work they put in to ensure that we  have an NDAA that fully addresses the modern challenges facing our  country.   This bill takes steps to address the threat of climate change, long  identified by the DOD as a threat to national security, by requiring  the Department to plan around climate vulnerabilities in future  projects.   This bill also protects military families. In addition to the widow's  tax issue, it protects low-income servicemembers by bridging the gap  for those who need SNAP assistance. It upgrades military housing and  provides support for childcare and education for military families.   It also promotes diversity in our Armed Forces by requiring DOD to  issue a new diversity and inclusion strategy and address existing  inequities.   This NDAA goes further to ensure that our Armed Forces are fully  ready for the threats we face today and prepared for the threats we  will face in the future.   Of particular concern to my district is the CH-47 aircraft, better  known as the Chinook. Like the residents of my district who proudly  build these machines, the Chinook is a workhorse that can always be  relied upon to get the job done, even in the toughest and most  unforgiving of conditions. This bill makes it clear that Congress has  no intention of abandoning this vital program.   On top of being one of the most versatile and crucial aircraft in our  Armed Forces, the Chinook program supports more than 20,000 jobs and  200 suppliers in 38 States. I am pleased that this program is in the  bill, and I look forward to supporting its passage.
