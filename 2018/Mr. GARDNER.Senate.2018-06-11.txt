 Madam President, as the eyes of the world are fixed on  Singapore, I rise today to discuss another important development in our  Nation's diplomatic efforts in the Indo-Pacific.   Tomorrow, we will open a new chapter in the relationship between the  United States and our longstanding friend and ally Taiwan by opening  the new complex of the American Institute in Taiwan, or AIT, which  serves as a de facto U.S. Embassy in Taiwan. You can see the ``Strong  Foundation, Bright Future''--this incredible new facility in Taiwan to  replace the existing facility we have. I am pleased that Marie Royce,  the Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs,  will attend the ceremony on behalf of the United States. Along with my  colleagues, Senators Rubio, Inhofe, and Cornyn, I sent a letter and  called for a Cabinet-level official to attend the ceremony as well.  There are a lot of things going on in Asia on June 12.   The opening of this state-of-the-art complex comes at a most  opportune time as a demonstration of strong U.S. support for the people  of Taiwan. I join my colleagues in Congress in welcoming this new  facility and thanking the men and women of our Foreign Service in  Taipei and around the world for their service to our Nation.   The new AIT facility will cultivate the relationship between the  United States and Taiwan and further demonstrate the commitment of the  United States to bolster its friendship and commercial and defensive  partnership with Taiwan.   Today, I also announce that I will be introducing a resolution  welcoming the new AIT complex. I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor  this resolution to express our support and excitement for this new  facility.   Taiwan is a free, democratic, and prosperous nation of 23 million  people and an important contributor to peace and stability around the  world. In many ways, Taiwan should serve as the model for a free and  open Indo-Pacific.   The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which governs our unofficial  relations with Taiwan, calls ``to preserve and promote extensive,  close, and friendly commercial, cultural, and other relations between  the people of the United States and the people of Taiwan.'' The Taiwan  Relations Act also unequivocally states that it is the policy of the  United States ``to resist any resort to force or other forms of  coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic  system, of the people on Taiwan.''   Since the election of President Tsai in 2016, Taiwan has been under  unrelenting pressure from Beijing in a shameful and dangerous effort to  deprive Taiwan of international legitimacy and to undermine the fragile  status quo between Beijing and Taipei. In the last month alone, Taiwan  lost  [[Page S3400]]  two diplomatic allies--the Dominican Republic and Burkina Faso. Taipei  has also once again been shut out of the World Health Assembly due to  pressure from Beijing. Despite this decision, despite this treatment,  Taiwan has nevertheless made a very generous donation of $1 million to  the World Health Organization for Ebola-related relief efforts.   It is time for the United States to aggressively push back against  Beijing's effort to undermine a free Taiwan. Two weeks ago, I had an  opportunity to visit Taipei and meet with President Tsai and personally  thank her for her friendship and Taiwan's valuable contributions to  global peace and stability. I think that friendship can be seen in this  new AIT facility.    I have also introduced two bipartisan bills in the Senate that will  enhance U.S. relations with Taiwan and send a very strong message to  Beijing that the United States will never--the United States will  never--abandon our friends in Taipei.   The first bill is the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, or ARIA, which  is a bill that presents a new, comprehensive policy framework for U.S.  policy toward the Indo-Pacific.   We introduced ARIA on April 24, 2018, with a group of bipartisan  cosponsors, including Senators Markey, Cardin, Rubio, and Young.  Senators Sullivan and Perdue, with whom I traveled to the Shangri-La  Dialogue in Singapore last week, have also joined in this effort.   ARIA recognizes that Taiwan should be front and center in our Indo- Pacific strategy. ARIA states that it is the policy of the United  States to faithfully enforce all existing U.S. commitments to Taiwan,  as enshrined in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 and the six assurances  offered by President Ronald Reagan in 1982.   ARIA also authorizes the sale of advanced weapons, weapon parts, and  upgrades to Taiwan, consistent with U.S. law, and urges the President  to regularize the arms sales consultation process with Congress.   Finally, it authorizes high-level military and diplomatic contacts  with Taipei, consistent with the Taiwan Travel Act, which was signed  into law by President Trump on March 16, 2018.   Last week, the Wall Street Journal editorial board endorsed ARIA,  including writing that the bill ``notably encourages regular weapons  sales to Taipei.''   I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal editorial,  titled ``China's Military Escalation,'' dated June 4, 2018, be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                [From The Wall Street Journal, June 4, 2018]                        China's Military Escalation                          (By The Editorial Board)         While President Trump focuses on trade and North Korea,       China is aggressively building military outposts beyond its       borders in the South China Sea. Beijing wants to push       Washington out of the Indo-Pacific, and the Trump       Administration and Congress may finally be developing a       serious strategy to respond.        Trillions of dollars of trade annually float through the       Indo-Pacific, which stretches from East Africa through East       Asia. In recent years China has built military bases on       artificial islands hundreds of miles from its shores,       ignoring international law and a 2016 ruling by a United       Nations tribunal.        The buildup has accelerated in recent weeks, as China has       deployed antiship missiles, surface-to-air missiles and       electronic jammers on the Spratly islands and even nuclear-      capable bombers on nearby Woody Island. This violates an       explicit promise that Chinese President Xi Jinping made to       Barack Obama in 2015 that ``China does not intend to pursue       militarization'' on the Spratlys.        The next step could be deployed forces. At that point       ``China will be able to extend its influence thousands of       miles to the south and project power deep into Oceania,''       Admiral Philip Davidson, who leads the U.S. Indo-Pacific       Command, said in April.        In the face of China's buildup, the U.S. has shown uneven       commitment. Mr. Obama limited freedom-of-navigation patrols       to avoid a confrontation and never committed the resources to       make his ``pivot to Asia'' a reality. China saw Mr. Obama's       hesitation and kept advancing. The growing concern is that       China will begin to dictate the terms of navigation to the       world and coerce weaker neighboring countries to agree to its       foreign policy and trading goals.        Defense Secretary Jim Mattis lately has been putting this       concern front and center. He recently rescinded an invitation       to the Chinese navy to participate in the multinational       Rimpac exercises off Hawaii this summer. And at the annual       Shangri-La security dialogue in Singapore this weekend, Mr.       Mattis said that ``the placement of these weapons systems is       tied directly to military use for the purposes of       intimidation and coercion.''        He pointed to the Rimpac cancellation as a ``small       consequence'' of this behavior and said there could be       ``larger consequences,'' albeit unspecified, in the future.        One such consequence could be more frequent and regular       freedom-of-navigation operations inside the 12-mile       territorial waters claimed by China. Joint operations with       allies would have an even greater deterrent effect, and the       U.S. should encourage others to join. Beijing will try to       punish any country that sails with the U.S., but that will       underscore the coercive nature of its plans.        Believe it or not, Congress is also trying to help with the       bipartisan Asia Reassurance Initiative Act (ARIA). The Senate       bill affirms core American alliances with Australia, Japan       and South Korea, while calling for deeper military and       economic ties with India and Taiwan. It notably encourages       regular weapons sales to Taipei.        The bill authorizes $1.5 billion a year over five years to       fund regular military exercises and improve defenses       throughout the region. It also funds the fight against       Southeast Asian terror groups, including Islamic State. This       will help, but more will be needed. This year's $61 billion       military spending increase was more backfill than buildup,       and China recently boosted its defense budget 8.1%.        ARIA also tries to address Mr. Trump's major strategic       blunder of withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership       trade deal, which didn't include China. The Senate bill       grants the President power to negotiate new bilateral and       multilateral trade deals.        It also calls for the export of liquefied natural gas to       the Indo-Pacific and authorizes the U.S. Trade Representative       to negotiate a deal with the Association of Southeast Asian       Nations (Asean). If the U.S. had a trade rep who believed in       trade, this could strengthen the U.S. relationship with       Vietnam and the Philippines--countries at odds with China       over its territorial claims and militarism.        The bill is backed by Republicans Cory Gardner and Marco       Rubio and Democrats Ben Cardin and Ed Markey, which is a wide       ideological net. China's rise, and Mr. Xi's determination to       make China the dominant power in the Indo-Pacific, is a       generational challenge that will require an enduring,       bipartisan strategy and commitment. A firmer stand to deter       Chinese military expansionism is an essential start.    On May 24, 2018, I also filed the Taiwan International  Participation Act, or TIPA, with Senator Markey. This bipartisan effort  establishes that it should be the policy of the United States to  support Taiwan's participation in appropriate international  organizations, to instruct U.S. representatives in international  organizations to use the voice and vote of the United States to support  Taiwan's inclusion in appropriate international organizations around  the globe, and to direct the President and his representatives to raise  Taiwan's participation in appropriate international organizations  during relevant bilateral engagements with the government of the PRC.   I call on my colleagues to support both of these important pieces of  legislation, which are efforts to show our strong support for the  people of Taiwan. There is much more we can do and we should do to  enhance our relationship with Taiwan, and I call on the administration  to undertake all efforts allowable under U.S. law to enhance our  relationship with Taipei.   The opening of this new facility tomorrow, this new AIT complex--in  fact, just a few hours from now--is a great sign of friendship and  commitment from the United States, and I congratulate all those who  have made this possible.   I know Senator Rubio is on the floor today to talk about this and the  important support the United States continues to show for Taiwan, but I  will finish on this before I yield the floor.   In my conversation with President Tsai, I talked about how Taiwan is  really a great leader from whom we should learn and recognize and value  their leadership around the globe. I think the million-dollar  contribution they made to combat Ebola issues is just one small signal  that they have an important role to play on the world stage, and I hope  our allies around the globe will continue to engage Taiwan, as  appropriate, and make sure they have that strong international voice  that they sometimes feel to be lacking today.   I encourage my colleagues to stand up to support Taiwan. I  congratulate AIT on this new facility and certainly look forward to  engaging Taiwan even more as we move forward.   I yield the floor.
