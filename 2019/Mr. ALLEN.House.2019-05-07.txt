 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, I had the great privilege of  joining President Trump and many others at the White House Rose Garden  as Tiger Woods was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.   I want to take this opportunity to congratulate Tiger, not only for  winning our Nation's highest civilian honor, but also for his standout  victory at the 2019 Masters Tournament in my hometown of Augusta,  Georgia.   In 1997, Woods became the youngest man and first African Asian  American to win the Masters at the young age of 21. After being tested  by possible career-ending injuries and adversity, Tiger's comeback to  win his 81st PGA tour event, 15th major championship, and fifth green  jacket 22 years later is nothing short of remarkable.   Now Tiger adds the Presidential Medal of Freedom to his already  stellar resume, becoming only the fourth golfer to do so, joining the  likes of Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Charlie Sifford.   Congratulations to Tiger and his family for receiving such a well- deserved distinction. As the President said, Tiger, you are a ``true  legend.''                            ____________________
