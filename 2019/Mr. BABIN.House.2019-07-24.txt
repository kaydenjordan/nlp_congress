 Mr. Speaker, I ran for Congress to take on and address the  tough issues facing our Nation and the world and leave it a better  place for my grandchildren, which I will note climbed to number 16 with  the arrival of Truett Ryan Babin just yesterday.   When I say the tough issues, I mean the ones most of us would agree  on: border security, immigration, taxes, trade, national security, and  on and on.   But when you take this job, you realize that working on behalf of  your constituents as their elected Representative to the Federal  Government can mean taking on issues that you weren't expecting to, and  this is certainly one such case.   But I am proud and honored to be here, and I thank the leaders from  both sides of the aisle who have come together and worked with us to  get H.R. 759, the Ysleta del Sur Pueblo and Alabama-Coushatta Tribes of  Texas Equal and Fair Opportunity Settlement Act, passed favorably out  of committee and here to the floor today.   I am not in this fight because of a love for gaming. I am here  because it is about fairness. It is about equal treatment under the  law, jobs, and economic development and opportunity.   With the exception of a few years in the military, I have lived in  southeast Texas all of my life, and I have seen firsthand how these  proud Native Americans have provided jobs and economic opportunity not  only for members of their Tribe but for Texans throughout our entire  region. That is why the 32 government and civic organizations who live  and work closest to this reservation have given their strong  endorsement of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the letters and resolutions from  every one of them.

Commissioner, Alvin Roberts,                                   County Commissioner, Precinct 4.    All I want is for this Tribe in my district to simply have  the same rights and the same opportunities as their counterparts at the  Kickapoo Tribe of Texas facility in Eagle Pass, Texas, and what they  deserve under a fair interpretation of IGRA, the Indian Gaming  Regulatory Act.   Why should one Tribe be able to play bingo and another Tribe not be  able to in the same State of Texas?   Poverty and joblessness are a scourge in many communities across this  country, but the consequences are especially dire on the reservation  lands of the Native American peoples across this Nation.                                time  2145    This facility has already helped turn that tide of poverty away from  my district, creating over 500 jobs, contributing $140 million in  economic activity each year. But all of those benefits and more aren't  just at risk if this bill doesn't pass. They are guaranteed to go away.   So please join us today and stop that from happening, and please  support this bill.
