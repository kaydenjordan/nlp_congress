 Mr. President, in 1945, a World War II veteran named  Raymond Weeks from Birmingham, AL, recognized the need for a day to  honor all veterans. He led the petition to then-Army Chief of Staff  Dwight Eisenhower for a national veterans day and organized the first  veterans day parade in Birmingham on November 11, 1947.   In 1954, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed a bill officially  establishing ``Veterans Day.'' President Eisenhower said, ``Let us  solemnly remember the sacrifices of all those who fought so valiantly  on the seas, in the air, and on foreign shores, to preserve our  heritage of freedom.''   It is fitting that the ``Father of Veterans Day'' was an Alabamian,  symbolizing a longstanding tradition among our residents to recognize  and show appreciation for our veterans and servicemembers. Every year,  we continue this tradition of pausing to recognize our veterans--past  and present.   Veterans Day reminds us that freedom is a sacred gift, and it is not  free. Some endured unthinkable battles and hardships so that we can  live in peace. Most have relinquished their autonomy, moving themselves  and their families across the country and around the world, with little  to no notice, spending holidays and major life events separated from  loved ones.   And all joined willing to lay down life and limb for their country.  Alabama is home to more than 400,000 of these heroes, and today, I will  be recognizing seven of them for their sacrifices to make our country  safer. They embody what it means to be a member of our Armed Forces-- but also what it means to be an American. Their service did not end  when their time in the military did; they are investing in their  communities even after taking off their uniforms. Each of them chose to  use their experiences to uplift those around them. If you ask them  about their heroic actions or how they have contributed to making a  difference in others' lives, they will humbly tell you it has been  their honor to do so.   I am proud to recognize their military service and the unique ways  they are investing in our communities, like SGT Chris Amacker of  Slapout, AL, a  [[Page S6660]]  gun truck commander in the Army's 465th Transportation Unit, where he  moved ammo and equipment during the Iraq war. He faithfully carried out  his duty, traveling more miles for his unit than any other driver  during his time. His military service was cut short after suffering  brain and spinal injuries following an explosive attack on his unit.   Sergeant Amacker spent more than a year in an Arkansas rehabilitation  facility, relearning how to walk and talk. But you wouldn't guess that  Sergeant Amacker had been through so much from his positive outlook and  passion for helping others lead meaningful lives. He considers himself  blessed to be alive and doesn't regret his decision to join the Army.   Today, Sergeant Amacker is actively involved in his community and  several veterans' organizations, including the American Legion in  Middlebrook. He supports other veterans coping with service-connected  issues like PTSD by listening to their struggles and connecting them  with other veterans to help break down isolation barriers. He also  helps them find jobs to ease their transition to civilian life.   Sergeant Amacker is a devoted dad, cheering on his children at soccer  games and in the band. He is described by someone in the community as  ``a one-in-a-million man who will do anything to help anyone,  particularly a fellow service person.''   There is no more commendable action than using skills learned in the  military to help others succeed, like Officer Eric Prewitt from Havana,  AL, does, day in and day out. A graduate of Hale County High School,  Officer Prewitt enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1992, where he served as a  yeoman second class. During his time in the military, he served as  administrative support for military officers in assignments, with  Active-Duty assignments in Guam, Australia, and the Philippines.   Officer Prewitt felt led to return to west Alabama after his time in  the military and use his skills to assist veterans wishing to use their  GI Bill benefits. In 2005, he became the Veterans Affairs officer and  diversity training liaison at Shelton State Community College in  Tuscaloosa, AL.   When speaking about his job, Officer Prewitt shared how the military  invested in him and that he wants to continue investing in our  servicemembers and veterans. His role is a huge benefit to not just  west Alabama but our entire State.   He helps nearly 400 veterans and their dependents annually to get the  assistance they need while attending college. Officer Prewitt's efforts  have helped increase the veteran student population retention rate and  make it possible for them to achieve their educational goals.  Additionally, his office leads his community in making sure veterans do  not feel alone or forgotten, including participating in ``Operation We  Remember'' to raise awareness about veteran suicide.   Some servicemembers were not well received upon their return to  American soil. They fought a thankless war without feeling supported,  but still fought out of devotion for their country. This was the case  for combat LTC Jeff Wishik of Madison, AL. Born in Montgomery, he was  commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army through Marion  Military Institute's early commissioning program.   He deployed to Vietnam with the 101st Airborne Division, directed to  find and engage enemy forces. In one particularly intense engagement  with the North Vietnamese, Wishik charged through an onslaught of  bullets to take command of the injured front element and order the  wounded troops to safety. His quick action and leadership allowed the  unit to move the wounded out of the conflict zone.   While scouting for a landing zone for a helicopter to evacuate them,  Lieutenant Wishik was struck by numerous enemy attacks, including one  explosion that blew him into the air, knocked him unconscious, and  killed all but three in his scouting group.   After he and the two other soldiers realized they were outnumbered  and unable to turn back, they spent the night pretending to be dead to  avoid being captured by the enemy. He recalls enemy troops walking  within inches of them and unknowingly stepping on them as they tried to  remain quiet despite their serious injuries.   During the night, a North Vietnamese soldier discovered Lieutenant  Wishik, looking for his food rations. Lieutenant Wishik used his last  bit of strength to take out the enemy before passing out again, saving  himself and the remaining two soldiers from his scouting group. He  spent time recovering in multiple medical facilities before returning  to Vietnam as a pilot for a second combat tour.   He received many awards for his courageous actions, including the  Distinguished Service Cross, Bronze Medal, and a Purple Heart. He went  to work for Lockheed Martin for 24 years following his retirement from  the military in 1988 and has devoted his time throughout the years  volunteering in various organizations, including the Semper Fi  Community Task Force of North Alabama and as compliance lead in support  of Madison County's Veterans Court.   Lieutenant Wishik's wise reminder to Americans based on his  experience is that, ``You may not agree with the politics of the  country, but you don't take it out on American servicemembers.''   The call to serve may ``run in the family,'' where, for some  veterans, the lessons and values learned in military service are worth  passing on generation to generation. This is the case for SGT Janet  Pray of Geneva, AL, who served in the U.S. Army from 1989-2003.   Sergeant Pray grew up in a military family, and after graduating from  Alabama State University with a degree in social work, she decided to  enlist. Her first assignment was in Germany, driving a 5-ton truck back  and forth from the airfield to refuel aircraft.   Upon returning to the States, the Army selected Sergeant Pray for a  professional leadership development course. For a while, she moved  around, serving at Fort Campbell and Fort Hood before being sent to  Korea, reaching the rank of staff sergeant. Her final tour of duty was  in Germany during the Iraq war, where she prepared her unit for  deployment as part of the 19th Support Group.   After retiring from the Army, Sergeant Pray continued supporting the  Department of Defense in various roles, including as an administrative  assistant at Ft. Rucker. Her love for education and empowering the next  generation prompted her to become a substitute teacher and aide for the  Geneva City Schools System.   Her encouragement and tenacious spirit has touched the lives of  countless students and teachers. Though she retired from teaching  earlier this year, Sergeant Pray's influence lives on in her four  grandchildren. One of her grandsons is currently on track to become an  officer in the military after he graduates college. Sergeant Pray says  the military taught her to lead by example and be responsible for her  own actions--lessons she continues to pass on. People like Sergeant  Pray keep the American dream alive by inspiring others to take  advantage of opportunities our country has to offer and leading by  example.   For veterans like 100-year-old George Hamilton of Pleasant Grove, the  idea of ``service'' has no age limit. The World War II Navy veteran  participates in different events around Jefferson County to share his  story and is active in his local congregation at Bethel Baptist Church.  Mission work is a huge part of his life. He has been on 11 trips to  Nicaragua and is planning to go again soon.   Following the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, then-19-year-old Mr.  Hamilton chose to enlist in the Navy. He served as a radarman second  class aboard the USS King, helping protect the west coast and the North  Pacific around the Aleutian Islands.   Mr. Hamilton says his only regret about his time with the Navy is not  signing up sooner. He reflects fondly on his service, but also on how  united Americans were during World War II, with a huge desire to do  whatever was necessary to defeat our common enemy and defend our way of  life. Mr. Hamilton continues to remind us of our country's potential  when we are united, saying, ``If we could get that feeling back in our  country today, we could get out of this situation we're in without  fail.''   Many heroes gave our country some of the best years of their lives so  that we could freely enjoy ours. One such hero is SGT Lonnie Phillips  of Pell City, AL. The two-time Purple Heart recipient left home when he  was just 17  [[Page S6661]]  years old to join the Marines, serving in the Vietnam war for 1 year  and 11 months.   During his time in Vietnam, Sergeant Phillips survived two attacks  but sustained life-changing injuries. He tearfully recalled losing most  of his buddies when his unit came under gunfire while patrolling  through a rice field. Sergeant Phillips woke up in the back of a  medical vehicle with multiple injuries, including a severe blow to his  left leg that required the removal of most of his calf. Decades later,  he still has shrapnel in his hip, a painful reminder of the cost of  freedom.   Sergeant Phillips says he doesn't regret his service because he hopes  it will keep today's youth from facing the same hardship. He gives his  time in the military credit for teaching him discipline and the sacred  value of life.   Now, Sergeant Phillips takes pride in raising honeybees and growing  fresh produce for the St. Clair County community. But he doesn't see  himself as a hero--just a man who did what his country asked of him  during a difficult point in history. His humility and devotion are an  inspiration to us all.   The sacrifices made by our servicemembers are often overlooked or  taken for granted by those of us who benefit from them. Even during the  Korean war, often referred to as the ``Forgotten War,'' there were men  and women who willingly answered the call to serve--not for fame or  recognition, but to keep our country safe from evil, like Sergeant Dave  Jensen of Foley, who enlisted in the U.S. Air Force at 19 years old.   His job was to help assess aerial photography used for enemy  surveillance. His first overseas assignment was in North Africa  supporting those who flew along the Russian lines before doing stints  in Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam. After honorably discharging, Sergeant  Jensen made another commendable decision to enter public education,  teaching the art of woodworking and mechanics during his 30 years as a  shop instructor. Sergeant Jensen is an example of someone who knew the  importance of his role to the overall mission and honorably carried out  his part.   These veterans--Chris Amacker, Eric Prewitt, Jeff Wishik, Janet Pray,  George Hamilton, Lonnie Phillips, and Dave Jensen--are all heroes. Our  country is safer because of their efforts, and Alabama's communities  are better off because of their service and continued service. Their  sacrifices--whether loss of mobility, time spent away from family,  postwar trauma, or the most vibrant years of their youth--demonstrate  America's strength to the world. President Ronald Reagan summed it up  best when he said, ``Veterans know better than anyone else the price of  freedom, for they've suffered the scars of war. We can offer them no  better tribute than to protect what they have won for us.''   I hope we will remember the price of freedom and those who have paid  it. To all of our veterans, thank you for your sacrifice and endeavors  to ensure America remains the country of freedom and opportunity for  generations to come.                            ____________________
