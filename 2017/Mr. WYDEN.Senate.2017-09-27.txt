 I will be happy to.    I will be happy to.    Mr. President, often late at night when the Senate passes  a piece of legislation by unanimous consent, people often don't get a  chance to understand what it really means, and usually there is a sense  of, well, this maybe won't be the most important thing coming down the  road, and everybody just said OK, and so it passed the Senate.   Last night, the Senate took action on Medicare. At a time when 10,000  people will turn 65 every day for years and years to come, Medicare is  something millions of older people rely on, and their kids and  grandkids make plans to make sure their grandparents are taken care of,  but also they want to know what their future is going to be all about.   What the Senate did last night--Democrats and Republicans coming  together--is, in my view, transformational for seniors today and the  beginning of an effort that is going to evolve in the days ahead for  kids and their parents and their grandparents to, in effect, benefit  from an updated Medicare guarantee that will stand the test of time for  many years to come. The reason I say ``updated Medicare guarantee'' is  that Medicare is not a voucher. It is not a piece of paper. It is not  something you get and then, well, maybe it will do you some good, but  if your healthcare costs go above your vouchers, you are going to get  buried in costs. Medicare is a guarantee that vital services are going  to be available to those over 65.   Last night, all Senators voted to send to the House of  Representatives a bipartisan effort that was years in the making to  update the Medicare guarantee to start focusing on chronic illnesses,  such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and Alzheimer's.   Mr. President, I am going to make this a little bit personal. I am so  grateful to Chairman Hatch, Senator Isakson, Senator Warner--the  bipartisan group in the Senate that has been working on this.   What I can tell the Senate tonight is that back when I was director  of the Gray Panthers and ran the legal aid services for older people,  Medicare was a very different program. Back in the 1970s when we were  getting the Gray Panthers off the ground, it was a very different  program than it is in 2017. Medicare really consisted of two parts.  There was Part A. If a senior broke their ankle or needed surgery for a  broken hip, they went to the hospital, and Medicare Part A would be  there to cover a senior's surgery. If a senior had an awful bout of the  flu, he or she visited the doctor and they used Part B. That is not  Medicare in 2017. Medicare in 2017 is not primarily about treating the  flu or a broken ankle. It is there for those conditions, and we are  very glad that it is, but more than 90 percent of the Medicare dollars  go to treat  [[Page S6181]]  older people with two or more chronic conditions. I will tell you,  until the Senate Finance Committee, on a bipartisan basis, began to  deal with this problem--and fortunately, we had a couple of colleagues  in the House who picked up on it as well--my sense is that, basically,  both political parties had missed it. They really missed the fact that  most of the Medicare dollars--90 percent--go to seniors who have two or  more of these chronic conditions. They might, for example, deal with  diabetes and heart problems.    But today's seniors really face the kinds of conditions that didn't  dominate the program back in the days when the Gray Panthers were  getting off the ground. Today, seniors get their care in a variety of  different ways. It is not just fee-for-service medicine. We have the  Medicare Advantage Plan, Accountable Care Organizations, and other new  systems under development.   So keeping up with those changes--updating the Medicare guarantee-- ought to be a real priority for policymakers. That is why the Finance  Committee has put so much effort over several years to get the bill  that passed late last night across the finish line. There are still  more steps before the policies reach the President's desk with strong  bipartisan backing of the entire Senate. I am confident the job will  get done.   The CHRONIC Care Act means more care at home and less in  institutions. It will expand the use of lifesaving technology. It  places a stronger focus on primary care. It gives older people--however  they get their Medicare--more tools and options to receive care  specifically targeted to address chronic illnesses and to keep them  healthy. These, in my view, are a whole set of building blocks that you  have to set in place to update the Medicare guarantee. Still to come is  ensuring that every older person with multiple chronic conditions has  an advocate to help them navigate through the Byzantine healthcare  system in America.   I just want to highlight that point. If you have two or more of these  chronic conditions--I guess the physicians call them comorbidities--you  can be drowning, especially if you are not part of a coordinated  Medicare program or Medicare Advantage or something like that. You can  just be drowning in forms and processes and procedures. Lots of times,  over the years, I have gotten calls from a child who is a lawyer or an  engineer and they said: Ron, help me out in trying to get through all  of this maze of bureaucracy to try to get help for my parents. So I  want it understood that what the Senate has done as of last night is an  extraordinarily important beginning, but there is a lot more to do.   I want to wrap up my comments on this subject and, then, turn briefly  to one other, by handing out some very appropriate thank-yous. I think  the Finance Committee has handled this bill, in my view, as a model to  work on a bipartisan basis. I want to thank Chairman Hatch. He and I  put together the bipartisan chronic care working group two years ago,  and Senators Warner and Isakson did a first-rate job of leading it.   There is an awful lot of sweat equity put in by staff. A lot of staff  worked on these issues while they were dealing with weddings. We had  three children born in the process, and there were job changes.   Big thanks go to Karen Fisher, Hannah Hawkins, Kelsey Avery, Leigh  Stuckhardt, Liz Jurinka, Beth Vrabel, and Matt Kazan on our team.   Chairman Hatch and his team really stepped up to work with us and all  the Senators: Jay Khosla, Brett Baker, Jen Kuskowski, Katie Meyer- Simeon, and the chronic care lead, Erin Dempsey. Big thanks also go to  Senators Warner and Isakson for lending us Marvin Figueroa and Jordan  Bartolomeo.   I close this portion of my remarks by saying that I think what  happened last night--while certainly not something everybody is talking  about this evening--is something that is going to be extraordinarily  important in the years ahead. It is an issue that I know the President  of the Senate and I have talked about--this whole question of  healthcare and Medicare and the like. This was an important step to  take and an important step we can build on. I hope the other body in  the House will take action quickly.    Mr. President, today I am introducing a set of three bills  that will lower the cost of energy storage, increase flexibility in the  power grid, and create a comprehensive set of grant programs to advance  development of renewable energy technologies throughout the country.   Currently, many energy technologies--like energy storage--compete in  unfair markets, making it hard for new innovations to measure up to  more established technologies like those of the fossil fuel industry.  Congress and the Department of Energy can work hand-in-hand with  industry to level the playing field, using a fair, tech-neutral  approach when updating the electricity system, to benefit the American  consumer.   My Reducing the Cost of Energy Storage Act will provide funding to  the Department of Energy to research and develop ways to lower the cost  of energy storage technologies. Ultimately, this bill will make it  possible for renewable energy to be used on a more reliable and  affordable basis.   To protect the power supply from disruptions caused by natural  disasters, which can wipe out power to millions of homes, my Flexible  Grid Infrastructure Act will require the Department of Energy to find  and develop ways to make the power grid more flexible and responsive to  these challenges. The bill will also connect displaced workers to  training programs that will allow them to transition to high-skill  clean energy jobs. Finally, this bill will provide states and utilities  with resources to upgrade the flexibility and reliability of the power  grid.   In order to ensure private sector growth in distributed energy  technologies, my Distributed Energy Demonstration Act will create  competitive, cost-share grant programs for new small-scale, grid- connected projects such as rooftop solar panels, hot water heaters,  electric vehicles and modernized utility pricing technologies.   Together, or apart, these bills will promote a more flexible  electricity grid that can respond to power disruptions from natural  disasters and ensure reliable, low-cost electricity for consumers now  and in the future. They will also lower costs for energy storage  technologies that make renewable energy more reliable and cost- effective, boost funding for cutting-edge research and reward state and  private sector innovations, which will make renewable energy more  reliable and affordable for U.S. energy consumers.                                  ______                                         By Mr. WYDEN:   S. 1875. A bill to move the United States toward greater energy  independence and security, to increase the flexibility, efficiency, and  reliability of the electric grid, to increase the competitiveness of  the United States economy, to protect consumers, and to improve the  energy performance of the Federal Government, and for other purposes;  to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.                                  ______                                         By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Reed):   S. 1876. A bill to direct the Secretary of Energy to establish a  program to advance energy storage deployment by reducing the cost of  energy storage through research, development, and demonstration, and  for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.
