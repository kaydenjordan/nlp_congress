 Mr. Chairman, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  vote ``yes'' on the PRO Act, the Protecting the Right to Organize Act.   The right to organize in this country has become a fundamental right.  It is one of the core pillars of the American middle class.   Nowhere do we understand that better than in my home area of  northeastern Pennsylvania, where we remember that, almost 100 years  ago, anthracite coal miners went out on strike to protest unsafe  working conditions, children in the mines, terrible wages, and bad  conditions generally. They have made fair wages and safe workplaces.  They wove them into the fabric of American law.   This is all because they had the right to organize, and that is what  we are here to do. Today, we strengthen and preserve the right to  organize through the Protecting the Right to Organize Act. Let's vote  ``yes'' on it.
