 Mr. President, I strongly believe women should have the  right to choose. That freedom is under attack in many States across the  country. For this reason, I voted to move to the Women's Health  Protection Act. I will continue to fight to codify Roe v. Wade, as I  have since coming to the Senate, so that no matter where you live in  America you can access the full range of reproductive health care. I  know that many Coloradans have a moral difference of opinion on this  matter, and I respect their beliefs. In the end, I believe the value of  individual liberty demands that people, not governments, make these  most personal decisions.                            ____________________
