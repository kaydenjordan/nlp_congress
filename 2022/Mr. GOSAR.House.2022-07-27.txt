 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Yavapai  County Sheriff Sergeant Rick Lopez, who was shot and killed in the line  of duty on June 28.   R-Lo, as he was affectionately referred to by friends and family, was  callously killed by a cold-blooded murderer for simply doing his job, a  job he loved and served for more than 14 years at the Yavapai County  Sheriff's office.   The rise in violence against our brave law enforcement officers is  both staggering and deeply troubling. Sadly, shootings of police  officers have increased nearly 40 percent from one year ago. Thirty- seven officers, including Sergeant Lopez, have been killed this year. I  pray to God there will be no more.   Sergeant Lopez was not just a hero in our community, he was a husband  and a father to two beautiful children. He was beloved by his family,  his neighbors, and his fellow officers. This brave man will be greatly  missed.   To his wife and family, I offer my deepest sympathy. Please know that  Sergeant Lopez and you will continue to be in Maude and my prayers.                            ____________________
