 Mr. President.    Mr. President.    Mr. President.    Will the Senator yield for a second?    I would just seek to be recognized and just ask the  Senator if the--   --$93 trillion number comes from a Koch brothers-funded  organization.    Would the Senator yield and tell us--    Will the Senator yield?    Would the Senator from Alaska yield for a question?    I thank the Presiding Officer.   Mr. President, I would pose a question to the Senator from Alaska.    Mr. President, through the Presiding Officer, I pose a  question to the Senator from Alaska.    I thank the Presiding Officer.   I will just make this point through the Presiding Officer, which is  that the words ``fossil fuels'' are not in the resolution. No. 2,  airplanes are not banned in the resolution. No. 3, there is no  guarantee for healthcare for everyone in America in the resolution. No.  4, there is nothing that provides for those who are unwilling to work  in the resolution. None of this is true.   We know the Koch brothers paid for this $93 trillion study, and all  we are hearing from the Republican side is of a Koch brothers-produced  document that is absolutely inaccurate. There is no banning of  airplanes. There is no guarantee of Medicare for all. Neither of those  is in the resolution. This entire discussion is based upon a completely  fraudulent, bogus report that the Koch brothers produced.   What we are trying to say to the other side is we should have a  debate about the science, that we should have a debate about the human  activity, that we should have a debate about what the solutions are,  and that we should bring it out here as a great deliberative body.  [[Page S1689]]    Right now, we are debating the Green New Deal, but the Republicans  haven't given us any hearings. They have given us no scientists, no  witnesses, and no debate. They are just doing this because the Koch  brothers have produced a report at a cost of $93 trillion that is  completely and totally inaccurate. In fact, with regard to the  accusation of the banning of airplanes, PolitiFact has looked at it,  examined it, and said it is completely and totally inaccurate.   I think it is difficult to have a debate when the facts here are  those which we cannot submit to committees, witnesses, debates.  Instead, all we are subjected to is a representation of the Green New  Deal that is completely inaccurate. For that matter, the words ``fossil  fuels'' don't even appear in the Green New Deal.   This is not right. If the Republicans want to, they should set up a  debate. Then we could have it out here on whether the planet is  dangerously warming, whether human activity is principally responsible,  whether this body should take action in order to deal with that  problem, and whether, economically, we can unleash a technological  revolution to solve the problem.   That is what we should be debating out here this afternoon, not a  whole group of bogus facts that have been produced by the Koch  brothers, have been paid for by the Koch brothers, and that are being  repeated over and over again on the other side without any Republican  saying he actually believes the planet is dangerously warming, that he  actually agrees with the U.N.'s scientists who say it is an existential  threat to us, that he actually agrees it is largely caused by human  activity, and that we, the greatest deliberative body in the world,  should have a robust debate. If the Republicans believe it is serious,  they should present their own plan for debate on the Senate floor.    I yield to the leader.    I yield to the leader for a question.    Mr. President, the leader has put his finger right on it.   We want a debate. We want to see their plan. We want to know if they  agree with the science of the entire United Nations and 13 of our own  Federal Agencies that produced an identical report at the end of 2018-- that being, it is dangerous and a great threat to our country, and we  have to do something about it.   So where is the Republicans' plan? What is their answer? Of course,  they don't have one. They want to bring out the Green New Deal with no  hearings, no witnesses, and no science when they should be bringing out  their own plan.   The leader is right. It is just, basically, a condition they have,  and the number they are using--the $93 trillion in terms of the cost of  the Green New Deal--is a Koch brothers-produced number. It is their  group that put it together. So how could we possibly be having a  serious debate about something the Koch brothers have produced, in  terms of dealing with global warming, since they are central players in  this dangerous warming of our planet?   I yield to the leader.    The leader is correct. No solutions, 5 years, and it is  more dangerously warm on the planet. Four hundred billion dollars'  worth of damage was done to our country in the last 2 years. We had  fires out in the West, flooding, $400 billion worth of damage--and the  consensus among scientists is that it is only going to grow worse as  each year goes by--and still no answers. Nothing on the floor from the  Republicans, nothing that would deal with the problem, and no admission  that it is caused by human beings and that we can do something about  it.    We don't know the answer.    We don't know the answer.    We don't know the answer.    And I would be glad to yield the floor to any of them who  would be willing to be recognized, but, through the leader, the problem  is that they keep talking about a $93 trillion cost, which is a report  from the American Action Forum, a partisan, rightwing group funded by  the Koch Brothers and Karl Rove as a sister group to his Crossroads USA  501(c)(3). That is what we are now debating out here on the floor, and  not the science.    I would yield to any of my friends on the other side of  the aisle who have concrete, positive proposals for dealing with the  crisis of climate change in our country and on the planet.    Mr. President, I rise in defense of the internet. This is  a fight for innovation, for entrepreneurialism, for the American  economy, a fight for free speech--the cornerstone of our democracy--a  fight for the most powerful platform for commerce and communications in  the history of the planet. This is a fight for net neutrality.   Today nearly every Member of the Senate Democratic caucus introduced  a bill, the Save the Internet Act, to put net neutrality rules back on  the books. Congressman  Mike Doyle is leading the same effort over in  the House.   In the Senate, we have already successfully passed the proposal. The  newly introduced Save the Internet Act and the Congressional Review Act  we approved last Congress will have the same effect--overturning the  Trump administration's FCC's wrongheaded decision and restoring the  open internet order.   Last May, in a historic, bipartisan CRA vote of 52 to 47, in the  Senate on this floor, we sent a message to President Trump about what a  free and open internet means, free of corporate control, open to all  who want to communicate, engage, and innovate. We made clear this  Congress will not fall for President Trump's special interest agenda  and his broadband baron allies.   This bill does what the American people want. It restores the rules  so people are not subject to higher prices, slower internet speeds, and  even blocked websites because the big broadband providers want to pump  up their profits. With this bill, we will do right by the people who  sent us here and fight to protect the internet as we know it.   This is a fight which we can win. There is tremendous power on this  issue. Republicans and Democrats alike agree we need net neutrality so  the sky is the limit. Support for our position will only continue to  grow.   The critics claim the sky hasn't fallen since the FCC repeal, so why  do we need net neutrality at all?   The answer is simple. There is pending litigation right now in the DC  Circuit Court challenging the FCC's repeal. So there is every reason in  the world why they would not change their practices until the legal  matter is settled in court. Any prudent business would act cautiously  when there is an issue pending before a court, but once the issue is  resolved in court, there are no rules. They can do what they want.   In fact, I attended the court hearing and listened to 5 hours of oral  argument. I saw firsthand how the FCC and  [[Page S1716]]  broadband industry used tortured logic to defend the repeal of net  neutrality and reclassification of broadband.   I also organized an amicus brief with 100 other Members of the Senate  and House in defense of the net neutrality rules. I am confident we  will prevail in court. Net neutrality is just another way of saying  nondiscrimination, just another way of saying big companies can't  discriminate against small companies; that big companies can't  discriminate against small individuals; that they have equal access to  the internet. They don't have to pay extra to gain access. Net  neutrality means nondiscrimination. Those are the rules we need for the  internet in order to see explosive economic growth because of the new  ideas that are able to be introduced and at the same time so democracy  can flourish because every voice is treated equally on the internet.   So whether it is in the Halls of Congress or in the courts, we will  not stop fighting until net neutrality is fully restored. We are on the  right side of history, and we will not give up this fight until we have  won.   I thank you for the time.   At this point, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
