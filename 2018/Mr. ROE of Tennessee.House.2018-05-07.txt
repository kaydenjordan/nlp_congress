 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4910) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  provide outer burial receptacles for remains buried in National Parks,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4910         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Cemetery Benefit       Correction Act''.       SEC. 2. PROVISION OF OUTER BURIAL RECEPTACLES FOR REMAINS                     BURIED IN NATIONAL PARKS.         Section 2306(e) of title 38, United States Code, is       amended--        (1) in paragraph (1)--        (A) by inserting ``(A)'' before ``The Secretary of       Veterans'';        (B) in subparagraph (A), as designated by subparagraph (A)       of this paragraph, by striking ``The Secretary of the Army''       and inserting the following:        ``(B) The Secretary of the Army''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:        ``(C) The Secretary of the Interior shall provide an outer       burial receptacle for each such a grave in an open national       cemetery administered by the National Park Service.'';        (2) in paragraph (2)--        (A) by striking ``or in the Arlington National Cemetery''       and inserting ``, in the Arlington National Cemetery, or in a       national cemetery administered by the National Park       Service''; and        (B) by striking ``or Secretary of the Army'' and inserting       ``, the Secretary of the Army, or the Secretary of the       Interior'';        (3) in paragraph (3)(B)(ii), by striking ``or, with respect       to Arlington National Cemetery, the Secretary of the Army''       and inserting ``or the Secretary of the Army with respect to       Arlington National Cemetery or the Secretary of the Interior       with respect to a national cemetery administered by the       National Park Service''; and        (4) in paragraph (4), by striking ``or, with respect to       Arlington National Cemetery, the Secretary of the Army'' and       inserting ``or the Secretary of the Army with respect to       Arlington National Cemetery or the Secretary of the Interior       with respect to a national cemetery administered by the       National Park Service''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 4910, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I am pleased that we are considering H.R. 4910, the Veterans Cemetery  Benefit Correction Act, which was introduced by Representative Scott of  Georgia.   Current law requires VA to provide an outer burial receptacle for  each new grave in a cemetery under the control of the National Cemetery  Administration. H.R. 4910 would extend this benefit to veterans who  will be interred in cemeteries under the control of the National Park  Service.   This bill only impacts two cemeteries within the National Park  Service that are open to new interments. One of these cemeteries, the  Andrew  [[Page H3754]]  Johnson National Cemetery, is in my home district in Tennessee and has  a fascinating story.   Andrew Johnson served Tennessee as a Congressman, a Governor, and a  Senator. He was also Abraham Lincoln's Vice President in 1865 and was  sworn in as President after Lincoln's assassination. When he died in  1857, he was buried on the land that is now the Andrew Johnson National  Cemetery.   The land remained in his family until the War Department acquired it  in 1906. Finally, the jurisdiction of the cemetery was transferred to  the National Park Service in 1942. Now the cemetery provides a final  resting place for veterans who served our Nation since the Civil War,  and it is still accepting new burials.   Veterans and their family members who choose to be buried in Andrew  Johnson National Cemetery, or any other National Park Service cemetery,  should receive the same benefits as those who are buried in VA  cemeteries.   The manager's amendment incorporates some technical changes suggested  by the National Park Service and is identical to S. 2372, which was  introduced by the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee Chairman Isakson,  and passed the Senate by unanimous consent on March 1, 2018.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop), chairman  of the Committee on Natural Resources, for helping to expedite the  consideration of the bill today.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4910, as amended, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                     Washington, DC, March 27, 2018.      Hon. David P. Roe,      Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I write regarding H.R. 4910, the       Veterans Cemetery Benefit Correction Act, authored by       Congressman Austin Scott. This bill contains provisions under       the jurisdiction of the Committee on Natural Resources.        I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this bill       before the House of Representatives in an expeditious manner,       and accordingly, I will agree that the Committee on Natural       Resources be discharged from further consideration of the       bill. I do so with the understanding that this action does       not affect the jurisdiction of the Committee on Natural       Resources, and that the Committee reserves its authority to       seek conferees on any provision within its jurisdiction       during any House-Senate conference that may be convened on       this, or any similar legislation. I ask that you support any       such request.        I also ask that a copy of this letter and your response be       included in the report for the bill and in the Congressional       Record during consideration of the bill on the House floor.        Thank you for your work on this important issue.            Sincerely,                                                        Rob Bishop,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Veteran's Affairs,                                      Washington, DC, April 4, 2018.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to confirm our mutual       understanding regarding H.R. 4910.        I appreciate the House Natural Resources Committee's waiver       of consideration of provisions under its jurisdiction and its       subject matter. I acknowledge that the waiver was granted       only to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 4910, and does       not in any way waive or diminish the House Natural Resources       Committee's jurisdictional interests over this legislation or       similar legislation. I will support a request from the House       Committee on Natural Resources for appointment to any House-      Senate conference on H.R. 4910. Finally, I will also support       your request to include a copy of our exchange of letters on       this matter in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration.        Again, thank you for your assistance with these matters.            Sincerely,                                                David P. Roe, M.D.,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott), the sponsor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to  support this commonsense legislation of Mr. Scott and Mr. Bishop, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 4335) to amend title 38, United States Code, to  provide for headstones and markers for, and interment in national  cemeteries of, deceased spouses and dependent children of members of  the Armed Forces serving on active duty, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4335         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Servicemember Family Burial       Act''.       SEC. 2. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS PROVISION OF                     HEADSTONES AND MARKERS FOR, AND INTERMENT IN                     NATIONAL CEMETERIES OF, SPOUSES AND DEPENDENT                     CHILDREN OF MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES SERVING                     ON ACTIVE DUTY.         (a) Headstones and Markers.--Section 2306(b)(2) of title       38, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (B), by inserting ``, or the spouse of       a member of the Armed Forces serving on active duty under       conditions other than dishonorable, as shown by a statement       from a general court-martial convening authority, at the time       of the spouse's death if such death occurs before October 1,       2024'' after ``veteran''; and        (2) in subparagraph (C), by inserting ``, or the eligible       dependent child of a member of the Armed Forces serving on       active duty under conditions other than dishonorable, as       shown by a statement from a general court-martial convening       authority, at the time of the child's death if such death       occurs before October 1, 2024'' after ``veteran''.        (b) Interment in National Cemeteries.--Section 2402(a)(5)       of such title is amended by inserting ``, and the spouse,       minor child, and, in the discretion of the Secretary,       unmarried adult child of a member of the Armed Forces serving       on active duty under conditions other than dishonorable, as       shown by a statement from a general court-martial convening       authority, at the time of the spouse's or child's death if       such death occurs before October 1, 2024'' after ``paragraph       (7)''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 4335, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4335, the  Servicemember Family Burial Act, which was introduced by the gentleman  from California (Mr. Correa), a member of our committee.   Mr. Speaker, our Nation allows for a veteran's spouse, minor  children, and certain other dependents to be interred in a VA national  cemetery, even while the veteran is still alive. This ensures that a  family may be laid to rest together if the veteran chooses to use a  national cemetery.   But there is an unfortunate gap in the law that prevents Active-Duty  servicemembers from burying their loved ones in a VA national cemetery.  Mr. Correa's bill would extend VA burial benefits to Active-Duty  servicemembers who lose their family members before they leave the  military.   To comply with budgeting rules, the manager's amendment would sunset  this bill on September 30, 2024.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this measure, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1645     Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support  this commonsense bill, H.R. 4335, as amended, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.  [[Page H3756]]
