 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4675, the Low-Dose Radiation  Research Act of 2018.   The Department of Energy funds cutting-edge research across a variety  of disciplines. For many years, DOE stewarded research into low-dose  radiation exposure. This included studies into the effects of radiation  exposure in higher risk populations and the examination of the changes  that a cell undergoes when exposed to low-dose radiation. These  research investments resulted in notable advancements in this field and  significantly expanded our understanding of radiation exposure.   Over the past several years, this research program was ramped up and  eventually eliminated--or ramped down. However, there is much more that  should be explored, and the Department of Energy is best positioned to  lead this effort in coordination with other Federal agencies that have  a stake in this work.   Expanding our understanding of low-dose radiation could improve how  we utilize medical diagnostic tools or change how we regulate nuclear  power plants. Radiation is all around us every day. When we fly on a  plane or walk into a building made of limestone, much like the one we  are in now, we experience a small increase in our radiation exposure,  but we still don't have an answer to the fundamental question of what  that means for our health.   Are there healthy levels of radiation exposure or are they all  directly tied to an increased risk of cancer?   What is an acceptable level for long-term human health?   The answers to these fundamental questions can only be found by  properly investing in the research field. I am hopeful that  reconstituting this program at DOE will lead to more scientific  advancements and will expand humankind's understanding of radiation  exposure. DOE is the right place to do this work, and the benefits  should be numerous and invaluable.   I want to thank Mr. Marshall for introducing this bill, and I  strongly support this bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage  of the bill. I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4377, Accelerating American  Leadership in Science Act of 2018.   The Department of Energy is the home to the most advanced research  facilities in the world. For decades, we have been able to provide  scientists with the tools and resources to push the frontiers of  innovation and answer the fundamental questions of science because we  invested in our national laboratories, universities, and public-private  partnerships in science and technology.   Unfortunately, we face budget proposals from this administration that  seem to be completely out of touch with that rich history and the  realities of our global competition.   This bill will put statutory requirements in place mandating that the  Department of Energy fund crucial updates to use the facilities. The  Basic Energy Sciences Advisory Committee recommended many of these  upgrades to the DOE in a 2016 report.   In this bill, the Argonne National Laboratory would be authorized to  upgrade the capabilities of the Advanced Photon Source. This upgrade  will greatly advance our ability to determine the atomic and electronic  structure of materials, molecular systems, and their chemical  reactions.   The insight gained in these important experiments can be  transformative for science and for our economy and for our well-being.   The bill also includes upgrades to the Spallation Neutron Source of  Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The suite will soon be home to the most  advanced neutron source in the world.   If we hope to maintain our leadership in neutron science, these two  upgrades are critical.   Finally, this bill authorizes the Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility,  the centerpiece of the international collaboration on the Deep  Underground Neutrino Experiment.   U.S. leadership on this project is vital to maintaining our  reputation as the world's leader in fundamental physical sciences  research. Funding these facilities is planting the seeds of innovation  and knowledge for future generations. The fruit from these investments  will benefit our society for years to come.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this bill and I encourage my  colleagues to do the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4378, the Nuclear Energy  Research Infrastructure Act, and I am pleased to cosponsor this bill.  Mr. Speaker, this legislation marks another accomplishment in our  committee's strong bipartisan effort to support the development of  advanced nuclear energy technologies.   Today, nuclear power plays a vital role in providing our country with  clean, reliable energy; but there are currently technical, economic,  and policy challenges that prevent this resource from playing a larger  role in enabling our clean energy future. This bill, the Nuclear Energy  Research Infrastructure Act, would help address these challenges.   It expands on a provision included in another bill that I cosponsored  with Mr. Weber and the chairman, H.R. 431, the Nuclear Energy  Innovation Capabilities Act, which passed the House early last year on  a voice vote as part of yet another bill that I cosponsored with these  two gentlemen, H.R. 589, the Department of Energy Research and  Innovation Act.   The bill before us today would provide the Department of Energy with  the direction and funding it needs to create a national user facility  with critical capabilities to enable the development of a wide range of  advanced nuclear energy concepts here in the United States.   I am hopeful that, if we provide our scientists and industry leaders  with the right tools, they can fulfill the promise of clean nuclear  energy that is significantly safer, less expensive, more efficient, and  produces less waste than the current fleet of reactors.   Mr. Speaker, I also strongly support the inclusion of explicit  funding levels as part of this authorization. Providing the Department  and congressional appropriators with a funding profile for research  activities and projects is a crucial responsibility in our role as the  authorizing committee.   In particular, it helps ensure that the construction of cutting-edge  research facilities like this one have the resources they need to be  completed on time and on budget, thus, making sure that the U.S.  taxpayers who are footing these bills are getting the most value of  their hard-earned dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan  bill, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle as we strive to strengthen America's research  enterprise across the board.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of  the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4376, the Department of Energy  Research Infrastructure Act of 2018.   Mr. Speaker, the legislation includes authorizations of important  upgrades to the world-class Department of Energy user facilities at  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the SLAC National Accelerator  Laboratory.   These upgrades will enable academic and industrial users to examine  and develop advanced materials and chemical processes for a wide range  of applications, from advanced batteries to high-temperature  superconductors to next generations pharmaceuticals.                                time  1715    This bill also directs DOE to build a new cutting-edge facility that  was  [[Page H1097]]  competitively selected to be sited at Michigan State University. This  facility will enable researchers to advance our fundamental  understanding of the nature of rare nuclear isotopes, with impacts in  fields ranging from nuclear astrophysics to medicine.   Our laboratories are the crown jewels of American innovation, and the  user-driven science facilities at those labs and at our universities  are the foundation on which our leadership in science is built.   I am very pleased to support this bipartisan effort to expand our  research capabilities at DOE, and I hope this is an area in which we  can continue to work together.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3397, the Building Blocks of  STEM Act. I want to thank Ms. Rosen for her leadership on this issue.   Drawing upon her experience as a girl who codes, Ms. Rosen has been a  strong champion for creating more opportunities for talented girls and  women interested in computer science. I commend Ms. Rosen for her  efforts on this critically important issue.   The demand for computer science expertise is on the rise in all  sectors of the economy. To ensure that we have the capacity to meet  that demand, we must do more to leverage all of our human capital to  tackle the technological challenges of the future.   Research shows us that girls as young as 6 years old are adopting  gender-based stereotypes that discourage them from engaging in STEM  activities, including computer science.   H.R. 3397 directs NSF to support research into factors that  contribute to the early adoption of these stereotypes. The bill also  directs NSF to support the design, development, and implementation of  scalable models for intervention to prevent or reverse the effects of  these negative and false stereotypes.   I strongly support this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support the  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as  she may consume to the gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Rosen).    Mr. Speaker, I support the bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
