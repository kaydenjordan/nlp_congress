 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, this morning the Senate Health, Education,  Labor, and Pensions Committee is considering the nomination of Julie Su  to be Secretary of Labor.   Before joining the U.S. Department of Labor as Deputy Secretary under  President Biden, Ms. Su previously served as labor secretary for the  State of California, and in that post, she was perhaps most notable for  presiding over massive unemployment fraud during the COVID crisis.  Unemployment fraud was a significant problem during the pandemic, but  even with widespread fraud, California stood out for the scope of its  problem.   During the first 6 months of the pandemic, California had an improper  payment rate of 36.6 percent. Let that sink in for a moment--an  improper payment rate of 36.6 percent. Ultimately, the State paid out  around $30 billion in fraudulent claims between the start of the  pandemic and last spring.   Now, certainly, States faced an influx of unemployment claims during  the pandemic that put additional pressure on unemployment agencies. But  California's fraud situation was not simply a result of an increased  workload during the pandemic. It was also in part the result of Ms.  Su's decision to remove safeguards intended to help prevent fraudulent  claims.   During the early days of the pandemic, Ms. Su directed the California  Employment Development Department to--in the words of the California  State auditor--``pay certain claimants UI benefits without making key  eligibility determinations and to temporarily stop collecting biweekly  eligibility certifications.'' These directives unquestionably helped  smooth the path for widespread unemployment fraud as well as a  significant number of improper payments.   It is difficult to know what President Biden was thinking when he  decided to nominate someone who presided over massive unemployment  fraud to be the next Labor Secretary. If that is what happened when Ms.  Su was the labor secretary for a single State, it is difficult to see  her as a qualified nominee to head the Labor Department for an entire  country.   But my concerns with Ms. Su don't end there. In addition to questions  about her ability to effectively administer a Cabinet Department, I  have serious concerns that Ms. Su would use her national platform to  continue promoting policies that are hostile to workers.   During her time in California government, Ms. Su was a proponent of  Assembly Bill 5, which is a piece of legislation that reclassified many  workers who had been considered independent contractors as employees  through a set of criteria known as the ABC test.   That test proved to be so unpopular and unworkable that ultimately  dozens of occupations were exempted from the measure--so many that the  list of exemptions ended up being longer than the text of the original  bill. Even California voters recognized how problematic it was, which  is why they approved Proposition 22, which specifically designated app- based rideshare and delivery drivers as independent contractors.    Now, people tend to think of Uber or Lyft as the prime example of gig  work, but, in actual fact, gig workers and independent contractors make  up a sizable percentage of the labor force and are part of a wide range  of professions, from hairdressing to truckdriving to insurance  adjustment. And a lot of gig workers and independent contractors are  big fans of the freedom and independence that independent contracting  provides and are not looking to be reclassified as employees.   A 2017 report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that a  whopping 79 percent of independent contractors preferred their work  arrangement to a traditional work arrangement. Less than 10 percent  expressed a preference for a traditional job.   The truth is that laws like California's arise not from a groundswell  of gig worker dissatisfaction but from liberals' commitment to Big  Labor, which would like to see the majority of workers forced to pay  dues.   Laws like California's Assembly Bill 5 are supported by unions  because they would put more workers in a position where they might end  up joining unions, even if gig workers and independent contractors  themselves don't  [[Page S1278]]  want to find themselves in that position.   And Ms. Su's anti-gig-economy, anti-independent-contractor positions  aren't limited to her time in California. During her time with the  Department of Labor, Ms. Su has continued to attack independent  contracting and gig work.   She presided over the Biden administration's proposed new worker  classification rule last fall, which would force independent  contractors and gig workers, who typically receive 1099 income, to  reclassify as W-2 employees.   Gig workers who receive 1099 taxable income have the ability to  deduct expenses, like mileage in the case of an Uber or Lyft driver,  equipment rental costs, and home offices.   Forcing gig workers to reclassify as W-2 workers would mean that they  could no longer avail themselves of some of these deductions, putting  this significant sector of our economy at a financial disadvantage and  reducing worker flexibility.   This new rule would, however, offer opportunities for labor unions to  collect new members, which is, presumably, Ms. Su's and the Biden  administration's goal.   President Biden, of course, is a big fan of Big Labor and has done  everything he can to advance Big Labor's priorities. Ms. Su said as  much last year to a group of labor activists. ``The Department of Labor  stands with you,'' she said. ``The Biden-Harris administration stands  with you. . . . And you have a president who has vowed to be the most  pro-worker, pro-union president in history.''   The President's and Democrats' ultimate goal here is passage of the  PRO Act, which Ms. Su supports. This legislation, a major priority of  Big Labor's, would implement a national version of California's  Assembly Bill 5, only without the California bill's exemptions, as well  as a number of other provisions designed to appease union bosses.   And if the PRO Act passed, its anti-independent-contractor provisions  could wreak havoc on whole industries, like trucking, which would not  only be bad for affected workers but for our entire economy.   The last thing that we need during a time of supply chain problems,  for example, is an unnecessary reduction in the number of truckers  carrying food and goods around our country.   I have introduced legislation in the past to help gig workers, and I  was proud to join Senator Tim Scott this week in introducing his  Employee Rights Act, legislation that would protect both union and  nonunion workers and preserve the freedom of independent contractors to  maintain their preferred work arrangements.   And I will continue to support measures to ensure that Americans have  the freedom to choose the work arrangement that works for them, instead  of being forced into arrangements preferred by the Democratic Party and  by Big Labor.   Before I close, I also want to mention the hostility Ms. Su has  demonstrated to franchises and the franchising model, which has  provided economic mobility for so many in this Nation. She is a  supporter of another disastrous California idea, the FAST Recovery Act,  which is legislation passed by the California State Legislature and  signed by the Governor that would give government appointees authority  to micromanage franchise restaurants throughout California, including  setting wages and working hours, among other decisions.   That law is so unpopular in her own home State that a million  Californians signed a petition to add it as a ballot initiative in 2024  so that they can vote on whether the law should actually be  implemented.   And the opposition is not surprising, when you consider that the  measure would raise costs for restaurants and, according to the  International Franchise Association, could increase prices at affected  restaurants by as much as 20 percent.   Julie Su is a poor choice for Secretary of Labor, and I hope that  some of my Democratic colleagues will join Republicans in acknowledging  the serious concerns about both her policy positions and her ability to  effectively administer the Labor Department and will urge the President  to withdraw her nomination.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
