 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I am shocked that my colleague would propose  an amendment that would strike all funding for bilateral family  planning.   These services prevent unintended pregnancies, maternal deaths, and  abortions; reduce rates of infant and child mortality; empower women to  stay in school and join the workforce; create stronger and healthier  families; and improve economies.   Aren't these bipartisan policy outcomes that both sides of the aisle  should be supporting?   Family planning does exactly what it says: It helps women plan when  to have a family.   But, as we sit here today, more than 200 million women around the  world still lack access to modern contraceptives.   If we want to build the self-reliance of countries, one of the most  cost-effective measures is to increase access to the family planning  services that women so desperately seek. Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues  to oppose this amendment.   I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), a  member of the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, cutting funds to bilateral family planning  programs is simply bad foreign policy. It undermines U.S. Agency for  International Development objectives and hurts millions of women and  girls.   I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, although I am  not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, while this amendment does not have a budgetary  effect, I would like to thank my colleague for raising such an  important issue for millions of women around the world.   For more than 200 million women, female genital mutilation can mean  health problems that haunt them for the rest of their lives. The quest  for gender equality will not be complete until women are no longer  subjected to these practices.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, although I am  not opposed.    Mr. Chair, while this amendment does not have a budgetary  effect, I thank my colleague for raising such an important issue.   I was pleased to be able to increase the resources available in this  bill by $10 million, for a total of $100.6 million to combat wildlife  trafficking and poaching.   Wildlife trafficking generates more than $8 billion, annually. I am  optimistic that a comprehensive and appropriately resourced approach to  address the drivers of trafficking will help us turn the corner.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, most of us, even my friends across the aisle, agree that  climate change is a real global threat. Our military also believes  this.   Prohibiting United States contributions to the multilaterals that  combat climate change is a shortsighted, harmful policy that does not  prepare our country to face this threat.   I cannot emphasize enough that climate change is exacerbating the  root causes of conflict. We will see an increasing demand on our  humanitarian and other resources if we don't address it now.   We cannot afford to stand idly by while others address climate  change, nor will we simply avoid its impact. We already feel its  effects. This is precisely why we should not be alienating multilateral  partners who want to join us in the fight.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, in times of crisis, we seek to join forces  with multilateral partners to help mitigate and recover from damage,  and our approach to combating climate change should be no different.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, while this amendment does not have a budgetary effect, I  would like to thank the gentleman for raising such an important issue.   The International Outfall Interceptor pipeline is long overdue for  repair. When wastewater leaks from the pipeline, it poses a severe  public health risk and a threat to southern Arizona's regional economy  and drinking water.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change brings together  critical multilateral partners so the United States does not have to  combat climate change alone. By supporting the UNFCCC, we are signaling  to the world that we are committed and serious about combating this  threat.   The United States has been a party to the UNFCCC since 1992. As  chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, I will never support  efforts that jeopardize our treaty-based obligations, and I urge my  colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the United States must remain committed to  our global partners because climate change just cannot be fought alone.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Chairman, while this amendment does not have a  budgetary effect, I would like to thank my friend for raising such an  important issue.   The progress made in Armenia's transition to democracy and the Velvet  Revolution is a refreshing development at a time when so many other  countries are headed in the opposite direction. This account funds  critical programs to counter Russian aggression and influence in Europe  and Eurasia and support to key partners like Ukraine and Georgia. I am  prepared to work to provide the necessary resources to encourage  continued progress in Armenia, and I am willing to accept the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Speier).    Mr. Chair, I thank my friend for bringing this issue to  our attention.   The committee takes seriously oversight of taxpayer dollars. I concur  with the gentlewoman's remarks. The SIGAR continues to serve American  taxpayers by reporting on instances of waste, fraud, and abuse in  Afghanistan.   The language included in the House report was not intended to suggest  that the committee expects or is directing SIGAR to cease operations by  September 30, 2021. Rather, the requirement in the House report is for  SIGAR to provide a plan on its future state considering the  administration's proposing drawdown in Afghanistan.   We must protect American taxpayer funds from waste, fraud, and abuse.  I look forward to working with SIGAR on effectively achieving this  important mission as the U.S. engagement with Afghanistan continues to  evolve.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I am  not opposed.    Mr. Chair, I share the gentleman's frustration that the  current withholding, a restriction that has been in place since 2014  that has withheld $165 million to date, has not yet compelled the  Government of Pakistan to release Dr. Afridi from prison.   It has been reported that after being held for 8 years by the  Pakistani Government, Dr. Afridi's health has begun to deteriorate. We  must increase pressure on the Government of Pakistan to release Dr.  Afridi.   Mr. Chair, I support this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 431, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chairman, this en bloc includes amendments from  Representatives Cohen, Foster, Connolly, Cicilline, Boyle, Panetta,  Krishnamoorthi, Espaillat, Cox, Cunningham, Spanberger, Levin, and  Murphy.   The amendment includes a number of good ideas that were not included  in the original bill. I support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Levin), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Foster) a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline), a senior member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Spanberger), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi), a member of the House Intelligence  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield the gentleman from Illinois an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the gentleman's  amendment.    Mr. Chair, Ranking Member Rogers and I have worked hard  to craft a bill that provides the necessary tools to the Secretary of  State and the USAID Administrator to advance United States foreign  policy. The bill also upholds many bipartisan positions and  congressional interests.   I have long opposed amendments that indiscriminately apply an across- the-board cut to the carefully thought-out funding recommendations in  each appropriations bill. Such amendments make no provision for  protecting high-priority programs and activities, such as security  assistance for Israel, which would be cut by $66 million; global health  programs, which would be cut by $184 million, including $118 million  less for HIV/AIDS activities; humanitarian assistance, which would be  cut by $158 million; and funding to protect our diplomats and  development personnel and their facilities, which would be cut by $120  million.   Cuts would also impact support for other key allies, such as Jordan,  Egypt, Ukraine, Colombia, and countries in Eastern Europe battling  Russian aggression and disinformation.   Mr. Chair, Congress must strengthen, not cut, these civilian agencies  so that they can respond to foreign policy crises and protect our  economic interests abroad.   I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.    I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on the  gentleman's amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Van  Drew) having assumed the chair, Mr. Cox of California, Acting Chair of  the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R.  2740) making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and  Human Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2020, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 436, I offer  amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, this en bloc includes amendments from  Representative Kildee and Representative Sherman. The amendment  includes a number of good ideas that were not included in the original  bill.   I support this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman), a senior member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Rouda) having assumed the chair, Mr. Van Drew, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2740)  making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human  Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2020, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, Ranking Member Rogers and I have worked hard  to craft a bill that provides the necessary tools to the Secretary of  State and USAID Administrator to advance United States foreign policy.   Smart use of global health, humanitarian, and development assistance  supports the United States' interests, builds greater global stability,  and promotes American values.   The gentleman's amendment would, not trim, but entirely cut all these  investments, including support to 14.7 million people receiving  lifesaving HIV treatment, including 700,000 children;  [[Page H4682]]  70 million children learning to read with U.S. assistance; 68.5 million  refugees displaced by conflict or natural disasters; and 7,200 Peace  Corps volunteers serving as excellent representatives of the United  States.   How are these cuts in our national interest?   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``no'' vote on the gentleman's amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, our national security is strongest when  development, diplomacy, and defense are equally prioritized.   This amendment undermines United States leadership and diminishes our  engagement in the world.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Our global partners are critical in combating climate change, and the  Paris Agreement is a sign of the global commitment from these countries  to fight this scourge together.   In addition, climate change is a serious national security threat,  and we need to treat it as such by seeking allies, including  multilateral institutions to address it with urgency.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Rouda).    Mr. Chair, the best and the brightest among us--our  military, our business leaders, our scientists--all agree that climate  change is real and is a serious threat. We are already experiencing its  harmful effects which will continue if we do not act alongside our  multilateral partners. If we want to prepare our country to better  mitigate and manage climate change, then I urge my colleagues to oppose  this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, climate change is a global threat that the  United States cannot tackle alone, and the U.N. Framework Convention on  Climate Change convenes multilateral partners working together to  mitigate damage to our globe.  [[Page H4684]]    The United States has been a party to the UNFCCC since 1992, thanks  in large part to the leadership of the George H.W. Bush administration.   As chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, I will not support  efforts that will jeopardize our treaty-based obligations.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Rouda).    Mr. Chair, the United States is a world leader in many  areas, and we need to step up on climate change.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, the amendment applies an indiscriminate 14  percent across-the-board cut to all programs, projects, and activities  in the bill, apart from those administered by the Defense Department.   The members of our committee worked hard to craft a bill that  provides the Secretary of State and the USAID Administrator the  necessary tools to advance United States economic and security  interests abroad. While we did not agree on every issue, the bill  prioritizes the programs and activities that Members on both sides of  the aisle requested.   For example, under the amendment, global health programs would be cut  by $1.3 billion, including drastic cuts to HIV/AIDS, maternal and child  health, family planning, and infectious disease programs.   Humanitarian assistance, including funds to respond to those  displaced by the crises in Venezuela, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and South  Sudan, would be cut by $1.5 billion.   Embassy security, which ensures the protection of our diplomatic and  development personnel and facilities overseas, would be cut by $850  million.   Development assistance, which supports basic education, water,  sanitation programs, efforts to combat human and wildlife trafficking,  and global food security activities in the developing world would be  cut by $583 million.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on the  gentleman's amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Rouda) having assumed the chair, Mr. Van Drew, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2740)  making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human  Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2020, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  gentleman's amendment.    Mr. Chair, our committee has worked hard on a bipartisan  basis to craft a bill that provides the Secretary of State and the U.S.  administrator with the necessary tools to advance United States foreign  policy.   As I have said before, I have long opposed amendments that  indiscriminately apply across-the-board cuts to the carefully thought- out funding recommendations in appropriations bills.   Such amendments make no provision for protecting high-priority  programs and activities. For example, the amendment would cut $33  million from security assistance to Israel. It would cut $92 million  from global health programs, including $118 million less for HIV/AIDS;  $79 million from lifesaving humanitarian assistance; and $60 million  from funds made available to protect our diplomats and development  personnel and their facilities.   Cuts would also impact funding for other key allies, such as Jordan,  Egypt, Ukraine, Colombia, and countries in Eastern Europe battling  Russian aggression and disinformation.  [[Page H4686]]    Mr. Chair, I tell my friend, as a grandmother of eight, I strongly  urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close. I strongly urge a  ``no'' vote on the gentleman's amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, we must ensure we do everything possible to  expand opportunities for veterans in this country. I will continue to  encourage the State Department to increase grant and contract  opportunities for veterans and service-disabled veteran-owned small  businesses.   Mr. Chair, I support this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, although I am not opposed.  [[Page H4687]]     Mr. Chair, while deportation policy is a component of  immigration and should most appropriately be considered by the House  Judiciary Committee, I appreciate my friend raising awareness on this  issue.   The concerns expressed here today are echoed by many communities  across the country who were distressed by the administration's actions.  I commend the gentleman from California for highlighting this matter  and urge my colleagues to support the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Rouda) having assumed the chair, Mr. Van Drew, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2740)  making appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human  Services, and Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2020, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________
