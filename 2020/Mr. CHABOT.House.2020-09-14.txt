 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6133, the STEP Improvement Act  of 2020. This legislation will authorize the SBA State Trade Expansion  Program--or STEP--for the next 4 years. This important program  facilitates small business participation in trade missions and shows,  international marketing efforts, workshops, and other promotional  activities.   The Small Business Act of 2010 authorized the SBA to establish a 3- year STEP pilot grant initiative. The program has two objectives: One,  increase the number of small businesses that export; and, two, raise  the value of existing small business exporters.   The Associate Administrator of the Office of International Trade is  responsible for overseeing the program and awards, matching funds to  States and territories for participation in trade missions,  international marketing efforts, workshops, export trade show exhibits,  and other promotional activities.   The Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 renamed the  program the State Trade Expansion Program and provided a $30 million  authorization through fiscal year 2020. The act allowed the Associate  Administrator of the Office of International  [[Page H4343]]  Trade to give priority to STEP proposals from States that have a small  number of small businesses that export or proposals that would assist  rural, women-owned, and socially or economically disadvantaged small  businesses.   This legislation will improve the implementation of the program by  creating a standardized application process, increasing grant spending  flexibility, improving communication between the SBA and States, and  collecting performance metrics and reporting to Congress.   H.R. 6133 reinforces our commitment to seeing that the SBA fulfills  its goals relating to the STEP program and maximizes every dollar to  help small businesses reach their potential in the international  market. The bill provides greater flexibility to State trade agencies  and enhances accountability at the SBA--a balance that will greatly  improve program functions.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Iowa (Ms. Finkenauer), and  the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Spano), for their leadership on this  bill. And I especially thank the chair of the Committee on Small  Business for her great leadership on the committee and the bipartisan  work that we have done on this for such a long time.   Ms. Velazquez and I have had the opportunity to work on the committee  for many years now, and it is truly one of the committees in this  Congress that works because it is bipartisan, and that is why we have  been able to pass such important legislation and work so hard on the  PPP and other programs over the years.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Spano), who is the ranking member of the  Investigations, Oversight, and Regulations Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for  the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, the SBA's STEP program provides financial awards to  State and territory governments to assist small businesses with export  development.   The financial support that STEP provides helps small businesses to  learn how to export, participate in foreign trade missions and trade  shows, and design international marketing products or campaigns.   It is a commonsense, bipartisan piece of legislation. I urge my  colleagues to  [[Page H4344]]  support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in order to assist small-dollar borrowers, the SBA  offers the microloan program, where small businesses can receive loans  of up to $50,000 or less from nonprofit intermediaries.   Beyond the financing support, the microloan program also requires  these nonprofit intermediaries to deliver technical assistance and  counseling to small business borrowers.   This two-pronged approach has proven again and again to provide  lower-dollar borrowers a leg up in starting or sustaining their small  businesses. The program registered record highs in fiscal year 2019,  with over 5,500 loans approved for over $80 million.   I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Kim) and the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett) for working in a bipartisan  manner to introduce H.R. 6079, the Microloan Improvement Act of 2020.   This bill builds on the strengths of the program by introducing  flexibility and more features for small-dollar borrowers to utilize as  they move through the microloan lending process.   H.R. 6079 gives microloan intermediaries the ability to offer lines  of credit within the microloan program and increases the outstanding  limit each microloan intermediary may carry from $6 million to $7  million.   Additionally, H.R. 6079 replaces the outdated and burdensome one- fifty-fifth rule that prevents microloan intermediaries from accessing  the program in the first two fiscal quarters of each year with a  reserve fund that ensures both large and small States have the ability  to utilize the program.   Finally, H.R. 6079 introduces a flexible grant process that has the  potential to reward extra assistance to each microloan intermediary if  overflow exists.   I fully support this commonsense legislation, and I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no speakers, and I yield myself the  balance of my time for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation. Microloans offered by the SBA serve our Nation's smallest  of small businesses.   The increased flexibility this legislation permits will allow lenders  and borrowers to fully utilize the benefits of this program to the  maximum extent possible.   It is a good bill, and I would urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this extends a matter of simple fairness to American  citizens.   Currently, the Northern Mariana Islands, part of the United States  since 1975, is the only U.S. jurisdiction not included for eligibility  in certain SBA programs.   According to the SBA, there are more than 1,700 small businesses in  the Commonwealth that employ more than 18,000 people. These businesses,  these owners, these employees, and these families are no different than  those in my hometown of Cincinnati or those in the chairwoman's  district in Brooklyn.   This bill amends the Small Business Act to allow the Commonwealth of  the Northern Mariana Islands to establish a lead Small Business  Development Center, or SBDC, and to be eligible for the same funding as  the other lead SBDCs across our Nation.   Additionally, H.R. 6021 waives the requirement that the new SBDC be  established at a higher education institution because the Commonwealth  of the Northern Mariana Islands does not have a college or university  to operate an SBDC on campus.   The Northern Mariana Islands' 55,000 inhabitants deserve the same  access to SBA programs as any other American citizen, and this bill  ensures that they do. It is a very simple, bipartisan, and just piece  of legislation. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  We have no further speakers on our side, so I am prepared to close.   I would like the thank gentleman from the Northern Mariana Islands  (Mr. Sablan) and the gentlewoman from American Samoa (Mrs. Radewagen)  for their leadership on this issue.   The legislation is long overdue, and I am happy to support the bill.  I urge my colleagues to support the bill as well, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank the chair, Ms. Velazquez, for  working in a bipartisan manner on all four of these bills, and that is  why both Republicans and Democrats support all four, because we really  are working together, and that is good for the country.   Mr. Speaker, to enhance the dissemination of microloans in rural  areas and to increase transparency, this bill, H.R. 6078, the Microloan  Transparency and Accountability Act of 2020, was introduced by the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett) and the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Kim).   In order to meet the needs of low-dollar borrowers, the SBA offers  the microloan program. As with all the SBA financial assistance  program, the SBA does not make a microloan directly to a small  business. Rather, it makes direct loans to a nonprofit, called a  microloan intermediary. The intermediary, in turn, makes loans of up to  $50,000 to borrowers and is required to provide technical assistance to  its borrowers through a technical assistance grant.   The average loan within the microloan program is approximately  $14,500, and the program has grown from approving over 3,500 loans for  a total of $52 million in fiscal year 2015 to approving over 5,000  loans--5,532, to be exact--for over $81 million in fiscal year 2019.   H.R. 6078, the Microloan Transparency Act of 2020, increases  transparency for the growing microloan program and enhances microloan  options for rural areas. Specifically, H.R. 6078 requires the SBA to  perform an annual portfolio risk analysis to examine defaults and  charge-off rates to ensure taxpayer money is safeguarded.  [[Page H4348]]    Additionally, to enhance the dissemination of rural loans, the bill  introduces an opportunity for an intermediary that currently makes at  least 25 percent of its loans to a small business serving rural areas  the ability to receive a 5 percent bonus technical assistance grant.   Mr. Speaker, I would again like to thank Mr. Burchett and Mr. Kim for  working together to protect American taxpayer dollars and to ensure our  rural communities have the ability to utilize this program to its  fullest.   Mr. Speaker, I fully support this bipartisan legislation. I urge my  colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett). I thank him for his leadership  in pushing this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The recent growth of the SBA's microloan program has shown how  beneficial it can be to small-dollar borrowers. Not only does this bill  make the program more valuable to small firms located in rural areas,  it also increases transparency and allows future Congresses with  important information to help guide policy decisions.   This is a bipartisan, good government piece of legislation that  deserves each Member's support.   I thank Mr. Burchett and Mr. Kim for their leadership. I once again  thank Representative Velazquez for, as always, working together with us  in a bipartisan fashion. I very much appreciate that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
