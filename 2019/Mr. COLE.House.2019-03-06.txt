 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon) for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, we had quite the debate on this bill in the Rules  Committee last night, and I expect the debate on the floor today will  be along similar lines. Today's bill is H.R. 1, which my friends on the  other side of the aisle are calling by the misnomer ``For the People  Act.'' Unfortunately, this bill is completely misnamed.   It is not for the people. It is, instead, for the Democratic  majority, by the Democratic majority, in hopes of maintaining the  Democratic majority for many years to come. Every provision in this  bill reflects that goal.   That began with the process the majority used to put this bill  together. H.R. 1 was referred to 10 different committees, yet only one,  House Administration, held a markup. My friends hold a 2-to-1 advantage  on that committee. There are only three Republicans who can  participate.   Later, we will be hearing from some of the Republican ranking members  of these committees, each of whom will talk about provisions that they  had hoped to address, had their respective committees marked up the  bill. This failure to allow other committees with jurisdiction to mark  up the bill reinforces the desire of the majority to push this bill  through as quickly as possible without any additional consideration.  Without further hearings and markups, it is all too easy for the  majority to sweep the bill's flaws under the rug and pass it quickly  without allowing the American people to see what they are up to.   This bill would be more aptly named the ``For the Politicians Act''  or ``Welfare for Politicians Act.'' It reinforces the idea that the  majority cares only about passing a bill that will lead to more  Democrats in the House of Representatives.   We do not have time today to go over every provision in this bill,  but for now, I will take a moment to point out some of the bigger flaws  in this product.   First, H.R. 1 takes taxpayer dollars and uses them to create a  special piggy bank for campaigns. That is right, Democrats want to use  taxpayer dollars of the American people to finance their political  campaigns. H.R. 1 creates a matching program for small-dollar campaign  contributions, thereby shifting taxpayer dollars to politicians to run  their campaigns. In essence, Democrats are demanding that your tax  dollars be used to subsidize and fund political candidates.   According to the Bipartisan Policy Center, since 2000, total spending  on Federal elections has exploded, going from $2.7 billion that cycle  to $6.4 billion in 2016. With so much money being raised from private  sources, one wonders why the majority wants to waste taxpayer dollars  adding even more money into campaigns.   Second, H.R. 1 completely takes over elections, removing authority  from States and local election boards and giving it to Washington, D.C.  Currently, States have the authority to determine how they want to  structure their own elections, including voter registration, timing,  and even redistricting. But all that goes away under H.R. 1. States  would no longer be able to set voter registration requirements, nor  hold elections where and how often they want, nor reapportion voters  into appropriate districts. Instead, under H.R. 1, Washington, D.C.,  takes over all these functions.   I doubt any secretary of state or supervisor of elections in America  supports this federalization of the election process. In fact, last  night in the Rules Committee meeting, Mr. Speaker, I entered into the  record a letter from the  [[Page H2382]]  Oklahoma State Election Board opposing H.R. 1 on precisely these  grounds.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record that letter again today.                                   Oklahoma State Election Board,                                   Oklahoma City, OK, March 4, 2019.      Re Election Administration Provisions of H.R. 1.       Hon. Tom Cole,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Cole: As Oklahoma's chief state       election official, I am very proud of Oklahoma's election       system. Our state has one of the most effective and efficient       election systems in the world. It is uniform, it is fair, it       is secure, it is accurate and it is fast.        As the House of Representatives prepares to consider H.R.       1, I want to take a moment to express some concerns about       several of its provisions related to election administration.       While I believe H.R. 1 to be well-intentioned by its       sponsors, its ``one-size-fits-all'' requirements for state       election systems would require Oklahoma to make extensive       changes to the way we run elections. I am concerned that some       of H.R. 1's mandates could negatively impact the very things       Oklahoma's election system does so well.        Based on my review of H.R. 1, here is a list of my top       concerns.        ``Voting by Mail'': To combat Oklahoma's past history of       absentee ballot fraud, several decades ago the Oklahoma       Legislature enacted legislation requiring most voters to have       their identity confirmed by a notary public when voting by       absentee ballot. Oklahoma law also requires absentee ballots       to be received by the county election board no later than       7:00 p.m. on Election Day. These procedures help prevent       fraud and enable county election boards to have 100% of       absentee ballots counted on election night. Unfortunately,       H.R. 1 seems to do away with these safeguards and       efficiencies, instead requiring county election boards to (1)       accept signed affidavits in lieu of notarized ones and (2) to       accept an absentee ballot postmarked on Election Day. H.R.       1's mandates would prevent Oklahoma from counting all       absentee ballots by Election Day, would require the counting       of absentee ballots to continue for days or weeks after an       election, and would take away a critical security feature of       our election system.        ``Early voting'': In Oklahoma, county election boards       typically have a very small staff. (Many have only the       secretary and one assistant.) For federal and state       elections, Oklahoma currently allows ``early voting'' on the       Thursday, Friday and Saturday prior to Election Day. Most       counties have a single early voting site, but several have       two sites. Even with the assistance of absentee voting boards       paid for by the State Election Board, most counties barely       have enough budget and staff to successfully conduct early       voting on the three days currently required. H.R. 1's       requirement for FIFTEEN CONSECUTIVE DAYS of early voting is       simply not feasible given the small budgets and staffing       levels of the 77 county election boards. This would make it       virtually impossible for county election board staff to       perform their other critical duties (e.g., processing mail       absentee ballots, processing voter registration applications,       and preparing supplies for precinct workers) if they are       instead conducting early voting during this time.        ``Same Day Voter Registration'': Oklahoma has a very       reasonable deadline for voter registration (applications must       be submitted by the 24th day prior to an election). H.R. 1       requires county election boards to conduct voter registration       during ``early'' voting periods and on Election Day. This       mandate is not currently feasible with the current funding       and staffing levels of county election boards. The logistics       of predicting how many ballots to print and how many precinct       officials to assign to polling places, with the number of       potential voters unknown, would be extremely difficult and       inefficient. Same day voter registration increases the risk       that due to error or fraud an ineligible person is allowed to       register and vote.        ``Provisional ballots'': Oklahoma has a county-based       election system. While Oklahoma uses the same voting system       statewide, for security reasons each county's system is       siloed and does not directly interact with other counties'       systems. (For example, one county cannot print or count       another county's ballot.) Oklahoma law requires a voter to       vote in the assigned polling place in the county where the       voter is registered. Provisional ballots are issued for a       variety of reasons, and, if eligible, are counted after 2:00       p.m. on the Friday following Election Day. However, H.R. 1       requires a provisional ballot to be counted even if it is       cast in the wrong county, which creates a security risk and       is not currently possible given Oklahoma's election security       features.        ``Online Voter Registration'': Oklahoma will implement       online voter registration in the near future. Unfortunately,       H.R. 1 sets different requirements for its federally-mandated       online voter registration system than is required by Oklahoma       law. (For example, H.R. 1 does everything from defining       acceptable signature requirements, to mandating a telephone       version of an online voter registration system, to       micromanaging the features required for a state's customer       support system.) Further, Oklahoma's future online voter       registration system will require that a registrant's identity       be conformed by matching the person's information with an       existing driver license or state I.D., but H.R. 1 sets       different (and less secure) standards for confirming a       registrant's identity.        ``Federalism'': While I believe H.R. 1's sponsors are well-      intentioned, a great many of its election provisions--even       those that are not concerns--relate to policy decisions that       are best left to the states under our federal system. I am       concerned that, in its current form, H.R. 1 could lead to       costly and lengthy litigation.        While these are not my only concerns, they are the most       serious. I appreciate your representation of our state in       Congress, and I feel it is my duty as Oklahoma's chief       election official to make you aware of some of the potential       negative impacts H.R. 1 could have on our state's election       system.        If you ever have any questions about elections in Oklahoma,       please feel free to contact me or Assistant Secretary Pam       Slater. Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,                                            Paul Ziriax, Secretary,                                     Oklahoma State Election Board.     Mr. Speaker, I would also point out that, in the case of  redistricting, if the State cannot reach a resolution, H.R. 1 hands  over the redistricting function to an unelected Federal court here in  Washington, D.C. Everywhere you look, this bill represents an erosion  of traditional State authority and a power grab for Democrats here in  Washington.   Perhaps even more egregiously, the bill places limits on freedom of  speech, criminalizing actions that we would currently describe as mere  advocacy for candidates. Not since the Sedition Act of 1798 has the  Federal Government tried to pass something that tramples so heavily on  freedom of speech as H.R. 1. The bill is so bad in this regard that  even the American Civil Liberties Union is opposing it, which is a  perfect illustration of just how bad H.R. 1 really is.   Mr. Speaker, I could go on and on. Everywhere you look, H.R. 1 fails  to do what the majority has promised. They have promised it is to be  about returning power to the people. Instead, this bill only gives  power and money to Democratic politicians. It takes away authority from  States and gives it to the Federal Government, wastes taxpayer dollars  on political campaigns, weakens the voting system, and limits freedom  of speech.   In sum, Mr. Speaker, I cannot imagine how any Member can stand up  with a straight face and support this bill. I urge opposition to the  rule, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 15  seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Jordan), my good friend and distinguished Republican ranking  member on the Committee on Oversight and Reform.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Ohio an additional  15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Burgess), my good friend, fellow member of the Rules Committee,  and classmate.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis), my friend and the ranking  Republican Member on the House Administration Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Arizona (Mrs. Lesko), my good friend and fellow member of the Rules  Committee.  [[Page H2386]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Arizona.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. McHenry), the distinguished Republican ranking member on  the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an  amendment to the rule to add a provision that bars candidates from  receiving matching funds under this bill unless that candidate  certifies that no tax lien exists on any property owned by that  candidate by reason of a failure of the candidate to pay any Federal,  State, or local tax.   Mr. Speaker, the logic of this is simple. If the majority is going to  insist that millions--really, billions--of Federal tax dollars should  be spent subsidizing campaigns, then the candidates should also certify  that they have paid all the taxes due from them. If a candidate has a  tax lien against them, then they should not receive taxpayer dollars to  subsidize their campaign. This is common sense and simple fairness.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, I urge opposition to this rule and the underlying  measure. The majority has brought up a misnamed bill that instead  serves only to preserve its own power. H.R. 1 will create a taxpayer- funded ATM to waste Federal dollars on political campaigns.   Let me say that again: to waste Federal dollars on campaigns.   My friends are worried about the power of money, but they are  injecting billions of new taxpayer dollars into this. And not only  that, the taxpayer has no say in where those dollars go. They don't get  to pick a candidate or whatever. We are just going to willy-nilly have  their dollars support candidates whom they may or may not agree with.   This does not only apply to Democrats and Republicans. There are  fringe candidates who will get funding under this, too, candidates,  quite frankly, who will probably embarrass my friends and ourselves.   So I think this is an enormously misguided idea. It will take over  elections and voter registration from States and transfer power to  Washington.   Let me say that again. My friends are voting to literally turn over  the State election operations of 50 separate States and federalize  them. They haven't talked to very many secretaries of state. I think  there was only one who actually was allowed to testify in opposition to  this bill.   Instead, we are going to foist off billions of dollars in unpaid  mandates on every State in the country so my friends can continue this  misguided effort to alter the political landscape of the greatest  Republic and democracy in the world.   This bill will weaken voting systems and weaken the enforcement  mechanism that guards against fraud, and it will undermine Americans'  fundamental First Amendment rights.   Mr. Speaker, I would strongly urge my friends on the other side to  reconsider their course of action. This bill is not going to be heard  by the Senate; it will never be signed by the President of the United  States; and instead of building a bipartisan coalition for election and  campaign reform, it will partisanize this process further.   There was and still is an opportunity to have this bill considered in  markups across every committee of jurisdiction. Instead, the majority  is simply ramming it through, using a committee where they hold a 2-to- 1 majority and limiting, frankly, the ability of Members to participate  in the process of writing the bill.  [[Page H2387]]    We can do better than this, Mr. Speaker, and we should strive to do  better than this now.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous  question, ``no'' on the underlying measure, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment to  H.R. 1.   Mr. Chairman, this is a commonsense amendment that will maintain  current law. Beginning with the National Defense Authorization Act of  2012 and continuing to appropriation processes for every fiscal year  since, I sponsored an amendment that barred the government from  requiring Federal contractors to disclose campaign contributions as a  condition for submitting a bid on a Federal contract. The amendment was  adopted by the House on at least four separate occasions on a  bipartisan basis and was signed into law by President Obama.   Since H.R. 1 would remove this prohibition, I offer this amendment  today to ensure that this ban remains in law. I have strong concerns  that H.R. 1 attempts to repeal this provision.   If the Federal Government would require contractors to disclose  campaign contributions, it is only human nature that information like  that would influence decisions on Federal contracts, regardless of what  the law requires and what a contracting office is required to do. If we  are interested in enshrining a pay-to-play culture as part of the  contracting process, the Democratic proposal will do just that.   Mr. Chairman, it has never been a good idea to mix politics and  contracting. The danger of that is obvious. The information that could  be required of contractors in the absence of this protection is not  necessary to evaluate a bid made by a Federal contractor. It raises  legitimate fears of political retaliation. If the information isn't  necessary for the bid or the evaluation of the bid, then it is not  necessary for the government to have it in the first place and run the  risk that it might be misused.   All that I am asking, Mr. Chairman, is that we leave the law as it  is, the disclosure requirements as they are, and ensure that political  contributions do not become a new litmus test to receive a government  contract.   Mr. Chair, for those reasons, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman), my good friend.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I want to disagree very profoundly with my  friend.   Frankly, what this amendment does is keep politics out of  contracting. My friends want to put politics back into contracting. The  decisions, as my friend, Mr. Norman, mentioned, on contracts, ought to  be made on the basis of the quality of the bid and the quality of the  job. There is no reason to ask for political information when you are  evaluating whether or not a bridge should be built or whether or not a  road should be paved and who should do that.   Frankly, what we are going to do is inject politics by requiring the  list of political contributors. If you don't think that will matter, I  think you are being painfully naive.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
