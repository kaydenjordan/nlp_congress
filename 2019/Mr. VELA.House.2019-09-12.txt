 Mr. Speaker, at the end of a long vote series today, I  unintentionally voted nay for H.R. 1146, the Arctic Cultural and  Coastal Plan Protection Act, on rollcall number 530. Had I been able to  correct my vote at that time, I would have voted ``aye.''                             personal explanation    Miss RICE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I was necessarily absent from  votes on Thursday September 12, 2019. Had I been present, I would have  voted ``nay'' on rollcall No. 526; ``nay'' on rollcall No. 527; ``nay''  on rollcall No. 528; ``nay'' on rollcall No. 529; and ``yea'' on  rollcall No. 530.                            ____________________
