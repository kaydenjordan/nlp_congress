 Madam Speaker, years ago, I, like many women, suffered  a miscarriage. I should have been able to hold my son in my arms, but  that was not God's plan. Years later, I still grieve that loss--and not  the loss of a generic cluster of cells, but an actual baby who would  have been about this size. My son had his own unique set of DNA,  fingerprints, blood type, and a heartbeat--every marker that we use to  identify a human being.   Pregnancy is difficult on a policy and personal level, but to deny  that a child growing inside a woman is nothing more than an  inconvenience is to ignore the value of life. Losing a child changed  who I was, and it is the same for most women. We can't pretend that  this loss doesn't have lifelong consequences.   Instead of promoting ways for women to end their pregnancies, we  should be helping expectant mothers find the medical, emotional, and  financial support they need. But that has never been the Democrats'  focus. The party that claims to protect women is actively supporting  policies that devalue the lives of women and children across the globe.  Their policies have turned the human trafficking of children into a  multibillion dollar industry and supported a terrorist regime since  Afghanistan's takeover that went from educating and valuing the  contribution of women to whipping them in the streets.   This bill is called the Women's Health Protection Act. But make no  mistake, Madam Speaker, no woman is protected under this bill. Rather,  it authorizes killing for the sake of convenience. Innocent human lives  are either valued or they are not. This bill is merely another example  of the dehumanizing policy platform the Democrats have adopted. America  is founded on the protection of life.   Madam Speaker, as a Texas woman, a mother, and an American, I  encourage the Chamber to reject this barbaric bill and embrace life.
