 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a civil rights  icon. Judge Damon Keith passed away this past week. He said one of his  mentors, Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, would say to him:  When you finish Harvard law, Judge Keith, I want you to use the law as  a means of social change.   Judge Keith said: That is what I am trying to do in my lifetime.   The civil rights icon was courageous. He will be sorely missed by  many, but even more in his home community of the city of Detroit.   In one of his most famous cases, he said, in his opinion, that:  ``Democracies die behind closed doors.''   And from a recent Detroit Free Press article, in 1973, Judge Keith  ordered Detroit Edison to pay $4 million to Black employees who were  victims of job discrimination and ordered it to create an affirmative  action program.   Some of these are just a little hint of the incredible contribution  that Judge Keith had to our Nation. He will be sorely missed, but,  hopefully, his legacy on civil rights and justice for all will continue  on in our work here in this Chamber.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today recognizing the amazing  contribution of our Congressional Progressive Caucus in allowing many  of our colleagues who are pushing bold and progressive ideas,  especially around college affordability.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Porter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota  (Ms. Omar).    Mr. Speaker, we talk about opportunity a lot in this  Chamber. The opportunity to thrive, the access to get ahead in life if  you worked hard. We tell our kids every day that opportunity is  abundant. It is everywhere, in every corner. If you just work hard, you  can have access to a tremendous amount of opportunity.                                time  1900    Yet we know now that many roadblocks exist through no fault of their  own. This is why it is so critically important to talk about the  college affordability issue and crisis in our country.   There are many motivations to go to school. For many first-generation  college students like me, it is to help their families. Many want to  give back to their community, yet many are not able to fulfill this  dream because of affordability.   In fact, Mr. Speaker, Michigan ranks among States in the bottom half  in college attainment. Fewer than 30 percent of Michigan adults hold at  least a bachelor's degree. We are closing the door on those who want to  help others, whether it is their family or their broader community.   Studies show that first-generation college students go to college in  order to help their families. Sixty-nine percent of them say they want  to help their families compared to 39 percent of students whose parents  have earned a degree. This desire also extends to the community with 61  percent of first-generation college students wanting to give back to  their communities compared to 43 percent of their non-first-generation  peers.   Regarding college school loan debt, students used to think about  getting good enough grades when we go to college. That is what we were  focused on. Not anymore, Mr. Speaker. Students today are forced to make  a decision between a degree and access to that opportunity or debt.   In 2016, 64 percent of Michigan college graduates left school with  debt, an average of over $30,000 a year, the 11th highest in the  Nation. Even after factoring in grant programs, low-income families  have to pay more than 70 percent of their income to cover college  costs.   I want to share a story of my friend in college. It took him close to  a decade because he was serving our country. He came back after serving  not only as a U.S. marine but also doing civil service work for the  United States Army. He came back, and all he wanted to do was become a  schoolteacher, a public educator. He loves it. It is his passion.   As he sits in his classroom every single day educating our children,  he has to also deal with the increase in debt, with the high cost of  interest, and with all those things that now put him in a financial  crisis.   The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is that low- and middle-income  households already face higher burdens. They are less likely to have  family assistance and more likely to have other pressures such as a  part-time job or family caretaking roles in addition to their  schoolwork.   As many low-income students avoid applying to college altogether due  to costs, borrowers who are tens of thousands of dollars in debt aren't  able to purchase homes, start their families, obtain employment in  certain fields, and save for retirement.   Student loan debt is further putting low- and middle-income students  and their families into a downward spiral that leaves many worse off  than they were when they started school.   This is not how it has to be. Student debt has a greater impact on  low-income borrowers, as many of us know. In fact, borrowers in low-  and moderate-income households face education debt that has averaged 24  percent of their income in 2010 alone. The average for all households  was 6 percent.   Looking at that more deeply and really unpacking that, we also have  to look at food insecurity and housing insecurity when it comes to  college affordability. The current state of college affordability  leaves so many students in housing insecurity as well as food  insecurity.   Most college students, Mr. Speaker, attending at least half-time are  not eligible for SNAP assistance unless they work at least 20 hours per  week or they work part-time in a work-study program, have young  children, or meet certain other requirements. Again, they are stuck in  a spiral of insecurity. However, working 20 hours a week has been shown  to lengthen the time it takes to graduate, just like for one of my best  friends.   Increased college costs lead to a heightened risk of dropping out as  well. I have seen many, many of my friends who started with me who  could not finish because they couldn't afford it.   On-campus housing comprises anywhere from 24 to 42 percent of  students' total budgets. Meanwhile, the cost of off-campus housing  surrounding universities tends to be higher than the standard market  rate. We see that in all our districts across the Nation.   These steep costs have consequences. One survey alone found that 42  percent of their undergraduate students had experienced housing  insecurity within the past year.   In many cases, housing insecurity is coupled with food insecurity. In  one study, 59 percent of students at a 4-year university experienced  food insecurity. What that means is not having enough to eat, just like  my colleague from California talked about for a specific resident in  her community who only could afford to eat once a day.   The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is that the more college becomes  unaffordable and out of reach for working- and middle-class families,  the more we subject students to poverty as they try to obtain higher  education.   As income inequality increases and as we see it across our Nation  every single day, and college tuition and living expenses go up as  well, we are creating an environment where fewer people have an  opportunity to thrive, fewer people can help their families, and fewer  people have the means to help their community. This should not happen  in our country, and we should be working day in and day out to correct  this.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
