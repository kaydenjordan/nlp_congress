 Mr. Speaker, once again, we find  ourselves only hours away from the third Republican shutdown of the  Trump Presidency, and we know how we got here.                                time  1845    Seven key appropriations bills, six of them teed up with bipartisan  support, could have and should have been passed in September or, for  that matter, this very week. Instead, Republicans came up with a 6-week  continuing resolution, and now they have backed down even on that.   Instead of taking ``yes'' for an answer following last night's Senate  vote on this continuing resolution, the best House Republicans could  come up with is a craven attempt to placate the President and his anti- immigrant demagoguery.   Despite telling us for years that Mexico would pay for this grandiose  border wall, the President and the Speaker have decided that fulfilling  this foolhardy campaign promise is worth shutting down the government.   The President said so himself last week. ``I will take the mantle,''  he said. ``I will be the one to shut it down.''   To add insult to injury, as though throwing billions in taxpayer  money at the President's wall wasn't bad enough, the Republican  majority now has cynically added much-needed disaster recovery funds in  the final hour, despite knowing full well that this bill is no more  than a political stunt.   Mr. Speaker, we know we need these disaster funds. I have repeatedly  stressed the urgency of increased funding for the millions in my State  still reeling from disasters. But it is cynical; it is deceptive; and  it is cruel to hold the needs of these people hostage to fulfill  President Trump's anti-immigrant wish list.   Our Nation faces many pressing needs: disaster recovery and  comprehensive immigration reform. But the best Republicans can give us  is political games and Twitter tantrums. We have a responsibility to  our constituents to keep the government open, and by providing cover to  the President's impulses, my colleagues are failing on that  responsibility.   So let's end this charade. Let's pass the Senate continuing  resolution, and let's fulfill our most basic responsibility, to fund  our government.
