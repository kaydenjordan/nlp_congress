 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  hardworking labor force across this country.   Today, on this hot and muggy Washington, D.C., day, a thirst strike  and vigil was held on our House steps. I was proud to join my colleague  from Texas, Congressman Greg Casar, and the men and women highlighting  the dangerous new policy in Texas as they held their thirst strike on  the steps of the U.S. Capitol.   Madam Speaker, as a Representative for Nevada and the Las Vegas area,  I can tell you that I know how dangerous the summer heat can be.   The Texas Governor's dangerous new policy eliminates water break  protections while Texas, Nevada, and many other areas of our country  are experiencing record-breaking heat.   Meanwhile, the brave men and women working in outdoor jobs like  construction workers, mail carriers, and so many others continue  working in the heat.   Madam Speaker, we need Federal action to protect these workers who  are simply trying to provide for their families and to keep a roof over  their heads.   I urge OSHA and the Biden administration to take action and protect  our workers. We deserve a water break.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus- McCormick for her tremendous leadership and also Congressman Jonathan  Jackson. The two have been great co-chairs for our Special Order hour,  a time when the Congressional Black Caucus comes to the floor to  discuss important issues affecting all of America.   Today, my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus are here to  recognize the impact that gun violence has on Black communities and  communities all around our country.   In recent years, our Nation has bore witness to horrific acts of gun  violence in our communities, from the racist murder of nine  parishioners at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South  Carolina, to the attack at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York, to  police-involved shootings of unarmed Black men, women, and children.   Time and again, when these tragic events happen, we hear politicians  in Washington offer their thoughts and prayers, but we know that  thoughts and prayers are simply not enough. They are not enough to end  the violence that traumatizes entire communities and rips family  members and friends away from their loved ones. They are not enough to  end the cycles of violence created by the systemic and structural  disadvantages of generations of racism and disinvestment in our  communities. We must do more than offer thoughts and prayers alone.   In order to solve this crisis, we must first understand the problem  before us. Data shows that Black Americans are disproportionately  impacted by gun violence in our country. Specifically, Black Americans  experience 12 times the gun homicides, 18 times the gun assault  injuries, and nearly 3 times the fatal police shootings of White  Americans.   On top of this, we know that these guns are not manufactured in our  communities, which is why we believe gun manufacturers should be held  accountable, and those who allow access to guns should be held  accountable.   Alarmingly, despite the fact that Black boys and men account for just  6 percent of the total population, they comprise more than half of all  gun homicide victims in our Nation.   Madam Speaker, and to the chairs, I know personally the effects of  losing a loved one to gun violence. My father was shot and killed when  I was 19 years old, a freshman in college.   I remember getting the call that so many loved ones fear getting,  and, in serving the district, the call that so many of my constituents  tell me that they experience, the call that says that you don't get to  say good-bye, that you  [[Page H3941]]  don't get to tell your loved one once again that you love them, that  they don't have the opportunity to see you, as my father didn't have  with me, to finish my education, to raise three children, to serve my  community, and to be here on the floor of the House of Representatives  speaking about the issue of gun safety, not just in my community but in  communities all across the country.   These are problems that can be attributed to a number of factors,  including the combination of weak gun laws as well as systemic racial  inequities, including unequal access to safe housing, inadequate  educational and employment opportunities, and a history of  disinvestment in public infrastructure and services in communities of  color.   To remedy the ongoing issue of gun violence, we must continue to  advance policies aimed at saving lives and making our communities  safer.   In the last Congress, the Congressional Black Caucus was instrumental  in the House, passing the most significant piece of gun reform  legislation in nearly 30 years with the Bipartisan Safer Communities  Act, which was signed into law by President Biden.   The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act took meaningful steps to protect  our children, keep our schools safe, and reduce the overall threat of  gun violence around our country by extending background checks for  firearm purchases, clarifying licensing requirements, funding red flag  laws and crisis intervention programs, and weakening the boyfriend  loophole.   This landmark piece of legislation was a positive step toward curbing  gun violence in our communities, but we need to take more action to  reimagine public safety, including holding law enforcement officers  more accountable, using public health resources to address mental  health crises, and ensuring all communities are well resourced with  access to job opportunities, affordable childcare, and social services  that improve quality of life.   Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Congressional Black  Caucus, as well as the partners of nonprofit organizations like  Giffords, Brady, and Everytown, for their tireless work to advance  safer communities and to save lives.   To the people who have made this Congress act last Congress and who  will demand that we act now, we know that public safety is not a red or  blue issue. It is an American issue.   There is no reason that in the most powerful country in the world, we  can't do more to save lives, reduce crime, and break the cycle of  violence. Our thoughts and prayers are simply not enough. We need  action.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Cherfilus-McCormick for her  leadership on these issues and Congressman Jackson. They experience  these tragedies every day in the communities that they both serve.   Madam Speaker, you have the commitment of the Congressional Black  Caucus and its members that we will continue to advance safety for all  of our communities.                                time  2000
