 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor former  Congressman Lou Frey, who represented the Orlando area in this Chamber  for a decade, from 1969 to 1979.   He passed away recently but leaves behind an enduring legacy.  Congressman Frey was many things, but above all, he was a loving  husband, a wonderful father and grandfather, and an extraordinary  public servant who cared deeply about central Florida and about this  country.   He was a man with strongly held views, but also one willing to make  principled compromises in the interest of bipartisan progress. His  accomplishments before, during, and after his tenure in Congress are  too long to list, but their impact can be summarized like this: Because  of him, Orlando is a better city; Florida is a better State; and  America is a better Nation.   As the chair of Future Forum, a group dedicated to empowering young  people, I regard Lou Frey as a role model. One of his most passionate  causes was helping younger Americans learn about this country, about  how our government works, and about how choosing a career in public  service can bring you a sense of inner joy and enable you to improve  the lives of others.   Lou, working with former Senator Bob Graham, was instrumental in  getting Florida to pass legislation requiring all students in the State  to complete civics education. When I saw how young Floridians responded  in the wake of the Pulse and Parkland shootings, turning those  tragedies into a resolute call for government action, I thought of and  silently thanked Lou Frey.   Rest in peace, Congressman.            Protect America from Foreign Interference in Elections     I rise in strong support of the SHIELD Act. I  helped introduce this legislation, and the House will consider it on  the floor later today.   This bill will protect our country from foreign interference in our  elections. Russia's assault on our democracy in 2016 exposed gaps in  our Nation's defenses.   It used to be that the primary threat from adversary nations was  their potential use of traditional weapons of war. But our society is  rapidly changing and so is the nature of conflict.   Today, our enemies are far more likely to use computer malware than  cruise missiles to do us harm, and they don't think twice about  exploiting loopholes in our laws in order to influence our elections.   That is why passing the SHIELD Act is so critical to maintaining the  foundation of our democracy, our system of free and fair elections.   We know Russia and possibly other foreign powers will likely use  similar tactics in 2020. And why wouldn't they? Russia has suffered  almost no consequences for their actions in 2016.   While Russia assisted a Republican on that occasion, it could aid a  Democrat in the future. That is because Moscow's loyalty is to itself,  not to any U.S. political party. My colleagues on the other side of the  aisle should never forget that fact.   To defend our democracy, we need to act now to protect our elections.  We need to pass the SHIELD Act.   I commend Chairwoman Lofgren for her leadership in drafting this  critical piece of legislation, and I urge all of my colleagues to  support it.                            ____________________
