 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 376 and ask that  it be reported by number.    My amendment, Lee No. 376, is a measure that drives  accountability and fairness in supporting Ukraine. My amendment  creatively incentivizes our NATO allied nations to shoulder their fair  share of the security burden in securing Europe.   This isn't about withholding funds from Ukraine; it is about  encouraging allies to meet their 2 percent of GDP spending thresholds  with regard to their national security.   Within Congress, we respond to the call of duty by urging NATO allies  to step up and to meet their obligations--obligations that they have  made and obligations that, when they go unmet, result in the United  States of America shouldering a disproportionate, unfair share of the  burden. We have been doing this for years, just as we have provided and  held a disproportionate share of the burden specifically with regard to  Ukraine.   Let me be very clear. My amendment ensures that funds for Ukraine  remain untouched while allies contribute their fair share.   Europe's security is indeed a collective endeavor, and Lee No. 376  motivates our allies to meet or exceed the 2 percent pledge. But for it  to be a collective endeavor, they have to pay their way. They haven't  been. This would incentivize them to do so.   I urge its passage.    I call for the yeas and nays.
