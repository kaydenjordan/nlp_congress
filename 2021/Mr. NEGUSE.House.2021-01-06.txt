 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the objection.    Madam Speaker, today is an important day. In 1862, during  the depths of the Civil War, President Lincoln submitted his annual  message to Congress, to this body, and in it, he wrote the following:  ``Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We, of this Congress and  this administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves. . . .  The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down, in honor or  dishonor, to the latest generation. . . . We shall nobly save, or  meanly lose, the last best hope of Earth.''   Madam Speaker, we gather today to ensure the survival of our grand  American experiment, the greatest democracy this world has ever known,  and there are millions of people watching today's proceedings. The eyes  of the world are on us now, my colleagues, wondering if we will keep  the faith, wondering if our constitutional Republic will hold.   Will we adhere to our Constitution, that solemn visionary document  that has guided us so well for so long and enabled the peaceful  transfer of power for the last 230 years?   Will we continue to be a country premised on the consent of the  governed, a Congress that respects the will of the people, and a  Republic that will endure?   Madam Speaker, those are the questions before us today. With respect  to my new colleague from Colorado, the question is not whether Joe  Biden was elected the 46th President of the United States. He clearly  was. The people of Arizona, like so much of the country, spoke clearly  and resoundingly. They voted in record numbers, and over 81 million  Americans selected Joe Biden as the next President.   Now, today, we hear from some in this Chamber--not all, but some of  my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--vague claims of fraud.   No substance.   No evidence.   No facts.   No explanation for why over 88 judges across this land have rejected  the very same claims.   Madam Speaker, the bottom line is this. As my colleague,  Representative Raskin, so eloquently put it, the people have spoken,  and that is why, on December 14, the electoral college met to certify  the election of a duly elected President, just as they have done for  centuries during terrible world wars, recessions, depressions, plagues,  and pandemics.   They met their duty, and they once again rose to the occasion and  certified the election. And the question now is, will we do ours?   Now, I know there are many textualists among us, many of my  colleagues who would understand that the Constitution must guide our  work today. And the Constitution is crystal clear: Our duty today is a  narrow one.   Article II, Section 1, Clause 3 reads: ``The President of the Senate  shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open  all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted. The person  having the greatest number of votes for President shall be the  President.''   That is it, period. Our job is not to replace the judgment made by  the American people with our own. Yet, that is precisely what so many  of my House and Senate Republican colleagues ask this body to do, to  substitute their judgment for the expressed will of the American  people.   In America, we don't do that. In the United States, we accept the  results of free and fair elections.   Madam Speaker, we don't ignore the will of the voters and attempt to  install a preferred candidate into power. That doesn't happen here.   Madam Speaker, I will close with this. Our duty, our task, is a very  simple one: to honor the voice of the people, to honor our  Constitution, to count the votes, to certify this election, and begin  to heal this great country of ours.   I pray each of us may find the courage to do so.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the objection.    Madam Speaker, to my colleague from Pennsylvania, I will  say this: I carry the same Constitution that you do. And the  Constitution, sir, does not allow you, me, or any Member of this body  to substitute our judgment for that of the American people. It does not  allow us to disregard the will of the American people. Because under  this Constitution, under our Constitution, Congress doesn't choose the  President. The American people do. And they have chosen in resounding  numbers, as every single Member of this body well understands.   Madam Speaker, I have been at a loss to explain what happened today,  but there is a statement that I found that largely summarized my  thoughts on the matter.   ``The scenes of mayhem unfolding at the seat of our Nation's  government'' are a ``sickening and heartbreaking sight. This is how  election results are disputed in a banana republic, not our democratic  Republic. I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political  leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for  our institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement. The violent  assault on the Capitol, and the disruption of a constitutionally  mandated meeting of Congress, was undertaken by people whose passions  have been inflamed by falsehoods and false hopes. Insurrection could do  grave damage to our Nation and our reputation.   ``In the United States of America, it is the fundamental  responsibility of every patriotic citizen to support the rule of law.  To those who are disappointed in the results of the election: Our  country is more important than the politics of the moment.''                                time  0030    Those are not my words. Those are the words of former Republican  President George W. Bush.   To my colleagues, it is after midnight tonight. It has been a long  day  [[Page H100]]  for our country, a long day for our Republic.   Let us dispense with this. Let's do the right thing. Let's honor our  oath. Let's certify the results, and let's get back to the work of the  American people.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Lofgren).
