 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for yielding.   The reforms in this bill have been needed for a long time. It is just  that the previous administration only brought out those needs in sharp  relief. This legislation will bolster accountability, ensure that  elected officials use their offices to serve the American people, not  for personal gain.   James Madison wrote, ``If angels were to govern men, neither external  nor internal controls on government would be necessary.'' If we haven't  noticed, we are down a few angels.   ``You must first enable the government to control the governed,'' he  wrote, ``and in the next place oblige it to control itself.'' How he  knew.   Madam Speaker, this bill is not about looking back, it is about  learning from our mistakes of the past to prevent future abuses of  power. I urge support for this bill.
