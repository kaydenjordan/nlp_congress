 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to control the  balance of the time of the minority.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, with all due respect, when the Democratic  majority in the House won't accept any of the Republican amendments and  the Democratic minority in the Senate won't accept any of the 20  amendments that Senator Tim Scott offered, I think it is a little  disingenuous to say that Majority Leader McConnell is the problem  towards bipartisanship here.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr.  Palmer).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I sat through this through a committee  hearing, a markup, a Rules Committee, and all day here today, and I  have heard a lot about how now is the time for bold action and now is  the time for transformational change. But what we don't spend nearly  enough time talking about is whether what we are doing and what law we  are passing is actually good policy, whether this policy will work in  as diverse communities as we have from one end of this great Nation to  another.   If there was ever a subject that requires nuanced and thoughtful  deliberation, police reform is it. Unfortunately, we seem to be  incapable of that in this town at this time.   That is unfortunate because the American people want reform, and that  reform has to start with the basic recognition that 2 million out of  2.3 million people who are incarcerated in this country are  incarcerated in State and local prisons and this inherently becomes a  community action.                                time  1745    Law enforcement is mostly a local function. And when we are talking  about reform, we must always recognize that these laws must work at  2:30 a.m. in dangerous, unpredictable, and often violent situations,  whether that officer is patrolling downtown Washington, D.C., or he is  on a rural North Dakota road where backup is measured in hours and not  minutes.   We can move quickly and thoughtfully. We can work toward policies  that hold bad officers and derelict departments accountable without  making it harder for good cops to do their jobs. Part of how we do that  is by recognizing some uncomfortable truths. I will be the first one to  say that systemic racial disparities exist in our criminal justice  system, not just in law enforcement, but throughout, whether it is in  pretrial release programs, charging decisions that determine minimum  mandatory sentences, facially neutral enhancements that have disparate  impacts on minority communities.   But we also need to recognize the truth that, when we talk about  these things, we have been talking about them for years and long before  President Trump was elected. In fact, if your claim is historical and  systemic racism, then it is sometimes hard to believe that all of these  occurred as of January 3, 2017, when President Trump took office.   For all the good intentions, we have to recognize the fact that this  bill is not just going to chase bad cops out of the business, but it is  going to dissuade good people from continuing in law enforcement. And  that is going to make our communities less safe.   This bill makes it easier to sue law enforcement. It makes it easier  to prosecute cops, all cops, not just bad cops. It ensures that there  is a public database of all complaints, whether they are completely  frivolous or not.   It takes away their ability to use equipment, whether they need it or  not. It takes away the ability for officers to use lifesaving tools,  whether they need it or not.   Combined with what is going on, and a combination between peaceful  protests and violent rioting, I have a friend and officers in  Minneapolis just this week have responded to calls where they are being  spit on and had bottles thrown at them where they are responding to  murders.   To say that these types of policies and this type of rhetoric is not  going to chase good people out of this profession is just not true.   Republicans in the Judiciary Committee did offer substantive and  quality amendments. We offered amendments to require recordings of  noncustodial interviews to enhance the use of body cameras by Federal  officers. We offered what I consider is reasonable collective  bargaining reform so that bad cops can actually get fired from their  jobs. We exempted our Border Patrol from the ban on the purchase of  surplus military equipment. We also even offered an amendment for a ban  on no-knock warrants. We just asked to collect the data during the  process while we were doing it.   So to say that everything we offered and what we tried to accomplish  either here or on the other side was not relevant to the conversation  just simply isn't true.   But there are things we agree on. We agree with body cameras for law  enforcement. We agree that more transparency is the best thing.   Congresswoman Bass has talked a lot--and I think this is actually  accurate--we wouldn't know a lot about these things without cell phone  cameras and what has gone on. That is a reality that exists. But the  other reality that exists is that we all are functioning in a digital  society. Asking our Federal law enforcement to come into the 21st  century along with us is not a terribly irrelevant nor unreasonable  request.   We agree with making sure we have a way to track officers. We don't  necessarily agree on the exact specifics, but there is a way to get  there.   I think everyone agrees that more de-escalation training is  incredibly important, and that doesn't matter if you are in a diverse  community or not.   Everybody who has talked to law enforcement knows they deal with way  too many mental health issues. We agree with those resources.  [[Page H2481]]    We all want to hold bad cops accountable and departments that have  too many bad incidents accountable. Many of us on our side agree with  qualified immunity reform. I tend to agree with my friend Congressman  Roy when he said we want significant reform. I would also argue we need  to replace it with something.   The problem with no-knock warrants isn't that they are there; it is  that they are overused. The problem with military equipment isn't that  it is utilized; it is that, in some departments, it is overused.   But if we continue to paint with a broad brush all of these things  and have it affect every department, regardless of how urban or rural  in nature, regardless if they have a history of abuse or none at all,  then we run into the real risk of alienating the people who most  closely and most want reform.   I will end on something that I think is fairly hopeful, and I do have  hope because I think this is the most criminal justice reform in  Congress we have ever seen. There are Members on both sides of the  aisle who are serious about marijuana legislation. If you want to talk  about a system in the criminal code that has a disparate racial impact,  I am not sure you need to go a whole lot further than marijuana reform.   We have had people on both sides of the aisle who have done the  juvenile justice act, the justice reinvestment act, trial penalties,  clemency for unduly harsh prisons. We have a lot of places we can do  that. I think it bears repeating, and I just truly, truly mean this.  The FIRST STEP Act, which was passed by the last Congress that was  bicameral, bipartisan, and advocated for by this President, is the  single most important criminal justice reform that has probably ever  come out of this Congress.   I don't say that from being a Republican politician. I say that from  practicing Federal criminal defense under both the Bush administration  and the Obama administration.    So in 3 years at the Federal level, we have gotten more done. But it  is called the FIRST STEP Act for a reason, because there is a second  step. I have had the opportunity through all the rhetoric and all the  partisan fighting and everything, I have also gotten to meet great,  thoughtful people on both sides of the aisle. And people on my side of  the aisle who, as short a time ago as several years, didn't believe in  some of these things believe in them now.   It is not just in the Federal Government. States all across the  country, from Colorado to New Jersey to North Dakota to Texas, are  doing criminal justice reform. They are doing it thoughtfully and  moving it forward.   I find it unfortunate that we are going to be here and that we  couldn't have this conversation. We are going to do what we do so well  in this town: talk and talk and talk and then fail to have action on  anything that has a realistic chance of becoming law.   I think, unfortunately, that is where this is going. But I do have  hope because I know there are a lot of people on both sides of the  aisle who truly want to work on this. You don't have to go very far;  350 Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have already  cosponsored bills related to criminal justice reform.   So, we will get this done, maybe not as soon as we could have, but I  am hopeful we will rise to the moment.
