 Mr. President, today, the Senate will take up a series  of votes to confirm three highly qualified nominees to the Biden  administration: Jason Miller for Deputy OMB Director, Janet McCabe for  Deputy EPA Administrator, and Colin Kahl for Under Secretary of Defense  for Policy.   And then, later this afternoon, the Senate will move forward with the  process to take up the bipartisan water infrastructure bill. I expect  the Senate will do so with significant bipartisan support.   The water infrastructure bill is as noncontroversial as it gets. It  was approved by the Environment and Public Works Committee on a  unanimous consent vote--every single Democrat, every single  Republican--thanks to the good work of Chairman Carper and Ranking  Member Capito. This water infrastructure bill is also a core component  of the Republican infrastructure proposal released last week. So I hope  this legislation will serve as a starting point for our two parties to  collaborate on infrastructure when and where we can. At the moment,  Senators Carper, Duckworth, and Cardin continue discussions with  Republican Senators about possible amendments.   But let me be very clear: The Senate must conclude its work on the  water infrastructure bill before the end of the week.   This is not a controversial bill or a complicated new program. In too  many communities, access to clean, safe, and affordable drinking water  is not a guarantee. Surely, we can all agree that in America clean  drinking water should be a fundamental guarantee.   The Senate must take first necessary steps to invest in communities  with aging water infrastructure by passing this bill, and we must do so  this week.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on nominees, yesterday, I highlighted  a number of accomplishments the Senate  [[Page S2204]]  Democrat majority made during the first hundred days of the Biden  administration. Thanks primarily to the American Rescue Plan, the most  sweeping Federal recovery effort in decades, shots are going into arms;  money is going into people's pockets; and businesses, schools, and  restaurants are starting to reopen.   Americans finally--finally--have some reason for hope. Jobs are  coming back. The economic recovery is accelerating, and the pace of  vaccinations has far exceeded even President Biden's own goals. After  one of the most difficult years in recent memory, the first hundred  days of the Biden Presidency and the new Senate Democratic majority  have seen the country turn a corner. Slowly but surely, we are proving  to the American people that government and the Senate can work for  them.   As President Biden prepares to take stock of where we have come from  and where we still need to go, with a joint address to Congress, it is  worth looking back at some of the accomplishments of these first 100  days. Among those accomplishments is the fact that the Senate has  confirmed the most diverse Cabinet in history, faster than under both  Presidents Trump and Obama, and all of them with bipartisan support.  Eleven are people of color, and 10 are women. Among them, we have a  former teacher, a former construction worker, several former veterans,  a small business man, even a musician--a far cry from the, shall we  say, less economically diverse Cabinet chosen by the former President.  Now, more than ever before, we have a Cabinet that looks like America.   In our Nation's history, the Treasury Secretary has only ever been a  White man--an unbroken streak of 77 White men in a row. This Senate  confirmed the first woman to serve as Treasury Secretary in our  history, Janet Yellen. The list of firsts goes on: the first African  American to serve as Defense Secretary, the first Black man to serve as  EPA Administrator, the first ever indigenous American, and the first  ever openly gay Secretary to lead any Cabinet Agency.   Last week, the Senate confirmed Vanita Gupta to Associate Attorney  General--the first woman of color and the first civil rights attorney  ever to hold that position.   Last month, Dr. Rachel Levine became the Deputy Secretary of Health  and Human Services, the first openly transgender Federal official in  American history.   Federal Agencies have enormous influence over the policies that  affect the day-to-day lives of the American people. Whether registering  for Social Security, filing for unemployment or veterans' benefits, or  seeking a small business loan, average folks interact with these  Cabinet Agencies every single day, hundreds of thousands, if not  millions, of times.   Having capable, experienced, and energetic public servants at the top  of these Agencies matters, and it matters, too, that they come from  different backgrounds and have lived different experiences. By  confirming historically diverse nominees, we are showing the American  people that their government represents them and that all of their  voices matter.   We also know that a Cabinet with diverse views will produce policies  that better reflect the needs of a diverse Nation.   I am proud of the nominees we have confirmed over the first hundred  days. As we move forward, the Senate will continue working with the  White House on confirming nominees and judicial appointments that  reflect the diversity and dynamism of our great country.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand that there is a bill at the  desk that is due for a second reading.    In order to place the bill on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceedings.    I yield the floor.                            ____________________
