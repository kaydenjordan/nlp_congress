 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the importance of agriculture education.   Last week, we celebrated National Teach Ag Day. This recognition of  agriculture education is more important than ever.   The average age of the American farmer is around 57 years old. It is  critical for our food security to inspire the next generation of  agricultural leaders, and this starts in the classroom.   I have had the privilege of spending time with agriculture educators  in Pennsylvania and throughout our country. Programs like the Future  Farmers of America and 4-H are strong advocates for advancing  agriculture education and exposing our youth to the agriculture  industry.   Over the past few months, I have had the opportunity to witness these  agriculture programs firsthand. I visited fourth graders at Glendale  Elementary School in Cambria County who were working closely with  seniors from the Central Pennsylvania Institute of Science and  Technology to bring textbooks to life. The lesson I participated in  focused on science, soil, and agricultural operations. I had the  opportunity to work directly with the students, where we discussed a  plant's journey from seed to full growth. We examined soil, and  students made observations of plant growth.   We interact with agriculture at least three times a day, and it is  critical that students have the opportunity to really learn about the  industry and the career opportunities that it offers.   In July, I joined CenClear and the YMCA of Centre County at the  ribbon cutting of the antihunger program at Morgan Run Farm. This  initiative will serve as a hands-on, community-centered educational  tool to further families' understanding of agriculture processes,  farming, nutrition, and community development.   Right now, more than ever, we understand food security is national  security, and a country that cannot feed itself often finds itself in  turmoil. Programs like the antihunger program at Morgan Run and the  science lesson at Glendale Elementary are the first steps in educating  our youth about our food sources.   As I mentioned earlier, we are at a critical point in our  agricultural future, with the average age of our farmers hovering  around 57 years old. It is important that we develop the next  generation of farmers. That is why, in August, I held a listening  session focused on the next generation of farmers.   We discussed how we can engage and support our next generation of  farmers and encourage youth to get involved in the agriculture  industry. We had remarkable panelists who were incredibly accomplished  in their fields. Together, we highlighted their work to promote  innovative technologies that inspire and engage the next generation of  agriculturists.  [[Page H8018]]    As a senior member of the Education and Labor Committee, co-chair of  the bipartisan Career and Technical Education Caucus, co-chair of the  4-H Caucus, and proud member of the FFA Caucus, I am passionate about  advancing agricultural education in schools.   I take this moment to thank all of our agricultural educators across  the country, the Commonwealth, and in the 15th Congressional District.  Their work invests in our agriculture education and helps prepare the  next generation of farmers, producers, and ranchers.   I always enjoy my meetings with FFA and 4-H students, as they are  clearly our future, and our conversations give me great hope in the  direction of our agricultural community.    Mr. Speaker, I, once again, thank all those involved in agricultural  education and empowering our next generation of farmers.                  Celebrating AccuWeather's 60th Anniversary     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  congratulate AccuWeather on its 60th anniversary.   Since 1962, AccuWeather has provided trusted and accurate weather  forecasts for individuals, businesses, and communities.   AccuWeather is repeatedly recognized as the most accurate weather  forecast. Their warnings have saved thousands of lives and have  protected people from harm and property from damage. Most notably,  Congress cited AccuWeather during Hurricane Katrina for saving 10,000  people, thanks to their accurate forecasts.   Today, more than 1.5 billion people rely on AccuWeather to stay safe  and plan their day.   AccuWeather currently has the largest collection of data at its  Global Weather Center, which receives more information than any other  facility on Earth.   Most importantly, AccuWeather is a proud Pennsylvania 15th  Congressional District business with more than 500 employees and is  headquartered in Ferguson Township in Centre County.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating AccuWeather; their  founder and CEO, Dr. Joel Myers; and their entire team on 60 years of  service to our communities and excellence in forecasting the weather.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, in June, I was honored  to kick off the fifth annual Brew Across America competition hosted by  Anheuser-Busch.   Brew Across America brings together Members from both sides of the  aisle through a friendly competition to brew their own varieties in  partnership with a bipartisan buddy.   My partner and I, fellow Agriculture Committee member, Congressman  Salud Carbajal, may not see eye to eye on every policy issue, but we  can both agree to set aside our differences over a good beer.   I invite all of my colleagues to join us, our competitors, and the  Anheuser-Busch team tonight at Nationals Stadium to sample each of the  bipartisan brews and help us crown a winner.   One of the awards is a People's Choice award. To participate,  individuals can text the name of their favorite beer to 202-980-4023  until 7 p.m. eastern time tonight.   The smooth functioning of democracy so often relies on finding common  ground to solve the toughest challenges, and we all know the process of  finding common ground demands mutual respect.   Beer and agriculture--since it is a great agro product--go hand in  hand, and as Republican leader of the House Agriculture Committee, I  remind us all to thank a farmer the next time you crack open a cold  one.                            ____________________
