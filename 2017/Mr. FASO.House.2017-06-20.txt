 Mr. Speaker, I come before the House today to express  support and ask my colleagues to support our  [[Page H4953]]  legislation, H.R. 2847, the Improving Services for Older Youth in  Foster Care Act.   I would also like to acknowledge and thank the cosponsors of this  legislation, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass), the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Reed), the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K.  Davis), the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence), and the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).   Our legislation is designed to help support older foster youth as  they transition into adulthood by making limited but much-needed  changes to the John H. Chafee Foster Care Independence Program.   While the Chafee program has largely enhanced outcomes for former  foster youth, there is still room for improvement. Of the individuals  who age out of foster care, nearly 20 percent will be homeless after  18, only half will be employed at age 24, and less than 3 percent will  earn a college degree. This legislation seeks to improve on those  results.   If enacted, our legislation would support the education of foster  youth who leave care by extending the age of eligibility for education  and training vouchers up to the age of 26. By changing the eligibility,  we can help improve employment outcomes and job opportunities for older  youth as they leave the system.   Additionally, this legislation will help youth who age out to  maintain benefits by ensuring that they are provided with the necessary  documentation that proves they were previously in foster care.   Finally, our legislation would extend the financial, housing,  counseling, employment, and other services for former foster care  youth. Currently, support services are only available to youth between  the ages of 18 and 21. Under this legislation, States would be able to  extend coverage up to the age of 23.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to note that this legislation is  supported by many organizations throughout the Nation, including the  Alliance for Children's Rights, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the  American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the California  State Association of Counties, the Child Welfare League of America,  Children Now, County Welfare Directors Association of California, the  March of Dimes, and the National Association of Pediatric Nurse  Practitioners.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    I encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation so that we can help improve outcomes for some of our  Nation's most vulnerable individuals.                                time  1545    Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   First of all, I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for  yielding.   I strongly support H.R. 2847, the Improving Services for Older Youth  in Foster Care Act. This bill would expand eligibility for the Chafee  Foster Care Independence Program services and education for older  foster youth, and ensure that all funds and education vouchers are  used. I want to commend my colleague, Representative Bass, for her  longstanding leadership on this bill.   As has been indicated by the ranking member, this important bill, and  the other child welfare bills we will consider today, come from the  Families First Prevention Services Act. The Families First Prevention  Services Act begins a fundamental shift in Federal child welfare policy  to preserving families rather than separating them. I look forward to  working with my colleagues to ensure that we enact the larger bill with  these important child welfare provisions and as we consider the other  bills separately today.   I would like to note that there are, indeed, five child welfare bills  on the floor this afternoon, which is a real testament to the  leadership of Chairman Brady and Ranking Member Neal. So I commend both  of them for their leadership in bringing the Ways and Means Committee  together to the extent that we can have five bills that have been  researched, that have been debated; levels of agreement have been  reached.   I strongly support the Improving Services for Older Youth in Foster  Care Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from New York?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, I rise this evening with my  colleagues from upstate New York to discuss a matter that is  extraordinarily important to all of the people throughout New York  State, but particularly to those who reside in New York State outside  of New York City.   New York State is one of the few States in America that requires a  portion of its share of Medicaid costs, which is healthcare for the  poor and the elderly, its share of Medicaid costs to be paid by local  property taxpayers. It has now been 51 years that New York State, since  the days of Governor Nelson Rockefeller, that New York State imposed  this incredibly onerous burden on the local property taxpayers in our  State.   In fact, in the entire United States of America, there is  approximately $9.5 billion being spent by local governments on Medicaid  costs which, in virtually every other State, are paid for by the State  government--$9.5 billion. But in New York State, our taxpayers pay $7.2  billion of that $9.5 billion in Medicaid costs mandated by New York  State, mandated by Albany.   This is an outrageous burden. The county property taxpayers--those  are homeowners and commercial property taxpayers in our State--pay over  $2.2 billion each year in property taxes, in mandated costs, over which  the county governments have no control whatsoever.   So tonight, Mr. Speaker, I rise, and I am pleased to have organized  this Special Order with my colleagues from  [[Page H4987]]  New York State, to discuss this dire situation that our taxpayers  endure and what our recommended solution is.   Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I were successful in including in the  American Health Care Act a provision which would, as of 2020, eliminate  the ability of Albany to impose this burden on local homeowners and  commercial property taxpayers. It would improve the real estate values  in our State. It would be one more reason for people to stay in New  York rather than to flee New York.   The thing that I hear from people over and over again in my district,  in the 19th District in the Catskills and the Hudson Valley of New  York, is their kids and grandchildren are being driven out of State  because there are no jobs, and they are being driven out of State by  high property taxes.   One of the reasons for those high property taxes is the New York  State Medicaid mandate. So, with Mr. Collins, Mr. Reed, Ms. Tenney, Mr.  Zeldin, and Ms. Stefanik, we were successful in including in the  American Health Care Act a provision which would, as of 2020, eliminate  this burden on local homeowners and require Albany to do what other  States, the 49 other States, do, which is to take control of its own  Medicaid system and not impose these burdens on the counties.   Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, you can see in the 11 counties that I  represent in the Mid-Hudson and in the Catskills of New York State,  over $224 million a year is coming out of homeowners' pockets, coming  out of commercial real estate owners' pockets and going to pay for  Albany's costs. We are ending that as of 2020 under the provision in  the legislation that I have authored with Mr. Collins, Ms. Tenney, Mr.  Reed, Mr. Zeldin, and Ms. Stefanik because we know that this burden is  unjust and it is uncalled for.   So, Mr. Speaker and my colleagues, I am delighted at this time to  yield to the gentleman from western New York (Mr. Reed), from the  Southern Tier.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Reed. I think he raises a very  timely and very good point.   The fact is the level of government that designs the program, that  confers the benefit, that says who is eligible should also be the level  of government that has to go to its citizens and say: ``Here is why we  need to raise the revenue to pay for that benefit.''                                time  1945    But, indeed, what New York does is wholly different. What New York  does is they simply say: Here is the benefit, and we are going to shift  part of the cost of that benefit to taxpayers at the local level, to  the homeowners and to the property taxpayers, and their county  governments have nothing to say over how that program is run or  operated or administered. They just have to send the bill to Albany  once a month.   This is what we are seeking to address.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Collins) who  is from Erie County.   Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud  cosponsor of the Property Tax Reduction Act introduced by my colleague  and friend from New York, Representative John Faso.   I am committed to working to provide tax relief to my constituents,  which is why Representative Faso and I worked to include a similar  measure in the Affordable Health Care Act, and I urge the Senate and  Leader McConnell to include that measure in their healthcare bill.   The State of New York saddles its residents with the highest overall  tax burden in the Nation. A main driver of this hardship remains New  York's persistently exorbitant local property taxes, which are a  symptom of irresponsible governing from Albany. Governor Cuomo  continues to rely on New York counties to foot the bill for New York  State's outrageous Cadillac Medicaid plan, which costs each recipient  44 percent more than the national average.   The Governor essentially runs up a tab and then demands that the  counties find a way to pay the bill. This is an unconscionable shift of  cost. The entity of government that spends taxpayers' money should be  the entity that pays the bill. Instead, Governor Cuomo wants this  scheme to continue shielding his outrageous spending and keeping his  actions from public scrutiny. The Governor's sleight of hand costs the  eight counties I represent over $470 million a year and my home county  of Erie almost $204 million a  [[Page H4988]]  year--nearly 83 percent of the total county property tax.   The Property Tax Reduction Act will end this outrageous cost shift,  hold Governor Cuomo accountable for the State's Medicaid spending, and  deliver much-needed tax relief to the hardworking taxpayers in my  district.   I want to thank my friend and colleague, Mr. Faso, for introducing  this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Collins' strong support. As a  former county executive in Erie County, you had that experience of  having to write the check every month to Albany for a program and  services that you had no control over. I very much appreciate it.   One of the ironies here is that New York State, with 19 million  people, spends more on its Medicaid system than Texas and Florida  combined. Those two States have more than double our population, yet we  spend more than those two States--Texas and Florida--combined. It is no  wonder so many New Yorkers have fled to places like Texas and Florida  through the years.   So I appreciate Mr. Collins' consistent leadership on this issue from  the time the gentleman was the county executive in Erie County.   Mr. COLLINS of New York. We should put it into perspective because  New York spends too much on everything. Florida now has more people  than New York. Florida's entire budget is $80 billion a year for more  than 20 million people. New York, with fewer people, has a budget of  $160 billion--you almost can't make this up--double Florida.   Now, a point that I have tried to make when you see what the position  of New York is, there was a day New York had 45 Members of Congress.  Congress is apportioned by population. Today, we have fallen from 45 to  27. We have lost 40 percent of our representation in New York because  of the high tax burden. And I know, as sure as I am standing here, we  are going to lose another seat, possibly two, in the Census coming up  in 2020.   Now, contrast to Florida that doesn't have an income tax and has much  lower property taxes, half of the budget of New York. When we had 45,  they had 7 Members of Congress--45 versus 7. Today, they also have 27.  In the next Census, they are going to grow from 28 to 29. You almost  can't make this up. Certainly the property tax burden is a big thing  that drives these people out of New York State.   They want to live there. People want their kids to be there. There  was a day in Erie County--and I was the county executive--we had 1.25  million people in Erie County in 1972, 1973. We are down to 900,000.  Forget about relative growth. We have actually lost 25 percent of our  absolute population over the last 40 years because of the high tax  burden in New York, so much so, they coined the phrase of our airport.  They called it the Runway of Tears because the parents were watching  their children and grandchildren fly off to Florida, to North Carolina,  and to other States where there were jobs and opportunities--the Runway  of Tears.   So anything we can do to help reduce that tax burden in New York and  to let our kids come home and be able to afford to live in New York  State, maybe one day again we will be the Empire State.   So I thank the gentleman for his leadership on this. Certainly I am  going to be fighting side by side with the gentleman and the other New  Yorkers to get this through.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his support.   The fact of the matter is that New York has driven away so many  people. In my 19th Congressional District, every single county has lost  population in the last 5 years. School district populations are down  30, 40 percent. Part of the reason is because of a lack of jobs and  high property taxes. What we are simply saying is there should be  accountability.   When I ran for office last year, I promised the people of my district  that I would introduce a measure, because then people would say: how  can the Federal Government get involved in this question?   The reason is because the Federal law authorized the States to impose  part of their costs on the counties or on the local governments. The  fact is that only New York State did it to the degree that New York  did. That is why it is going to require us to amend the Federal  legislation to preclude New York from doing this.   We are giving Albany 2\1/2\ years to reform their program, to  eliminate waste, and to make other priorities in its spending. There is  no reason for cuts to hospitals or nursing homes, as Governor Cuomo has  alleged falsely. What he needs to do is take full responsibility for  this program, as most of the Governors in the 49 other States do, and  then we will be able to relieve this burden on our local homeowners.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from New York  (Ms. Tenney), who was also elected with me in 2016, for her comments on  this important matter.    I appreciate the gentlewoman's remarks and her strong  support for this reform measure.   I would also point out that a 2015 report from the New York State  Comptroller indicated $513 million in improper payments in the Medicaid  program were identified. In the same report, the Comptroller questioned  an additional $361 million in transactions that would require agency  actions to reduce costs or recover funds.   In the past decade, the Office of Inspector General for the Federal  Department of Health and Human Services found 10 specific instances in  which New York State received improper Federal Medicaid payments in  excess of $50 million, with six of those instances each exceeding over  $170 million apiece.   So there is a lot of room in the New York State Medicaid program to  reduce improper payments and outright fraud that we have seen. I know  my colleague, Ms. Tenney, from her experience in the State legislature,  has seen firsthand what was going on with New York State's Medicaid  system.   Part of the reason this has occurred is because Albany was able to  spend someone else's money. The old iron rule of government and the  iron rule of family budget is that it is always easier to spend someone  else's money. What Albany has been doing for 51 years has been shifting  part of its Medicaid responsibility from the State level down to the  local level, and so Albany was less responsible.   This wasn't a Democrat or Republican thing, either. This happened  under the Republican Governors. It happened under Democratic Governors.  It is true, through the years, New York State has partially reduced the  burden that was falling upon the county property taxpayers, but they  have never eliminated it.   Do you know what? The leadership in Albany today shows no signs of  ever taking steps to finally eliminate this.   In Ms. Tenney's district, it is over $167 million a year in property  tax relief. In my district, it is over $224 million. In Mr. Collins'  district, it is close to $400 million. In Nassau County, it is over  $300 million; in Suffolk County, over $300 million; Westchester County,  over $200 million.   All throughout the State of New York, outside of New York City, the  property taxpayers are being crushed. They are being driven away. Our  jobs and our economy are being driven away, in part, because of  Albany's Medicaid mandate.   We can change it by changing Federal law. That is what we are going  to do. We have placed this provision in the healthcare legislation. It  is my hope and expectation that it can be included in the final  legislation that is passed. But regardless, I know Ms. Tenney, Mr.  Reed, Mr. Collins, Ms. Stefanik, Mr. Zeldin, and the rest of us will be  fighting very hard to make sure that we can finally eliminate this  injustice.   What Albany does is taxation without any representation. In my  District, in Ulster County, almost half of their entire property tax  levy goes to pay for Albany's Medicaid costs.   In Rensselaer County, about 57 percent of every nickel the county  raises in property tax levy goes to pays for Albany's Medicaid costs,  and they have no say over how those funds are expended, over how the  program is operated. It is truly taxation without representation.   I yield to the gentlewoman if she has anything to add in conclusion.    I thank the gentlewoman for her comments.   I would close, Mr. Speaker, simply by pointing out that New York  State has among, depending on what the measure is, either the highest  or second highest real property taxes in the entire Nation. We are the  only State that imposes this type of burden on local homeowners, local  property taxpayers.   If you look at the gross amount that people pay in their real estate  taxes, the downstate counties--Westchester, Nassau, Suffolk, Rockland-- pay the highest in gross amount. But if you calculate the property tax  burden as a percentage of the home value, the counties in upstate New  York; in western New York; along the southern tier; in the Mohawk  Valley, where Ms. Tenney lives; in the Catskills and Mid-Hudson, where  I live; and in the Adirondacks, which Ms. Stefanik represents, those  counties are being crushed. Those homeowners are being crushed by the  burden of real estate taxes.   A large part of that reason is this 50-year mandate that started  under Nelson Rockefeller that has been imposed on New York homeowners,  which is crushing them, driving them out of their homes, and this is  what we are intending to stop.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the support of my colleagues here tonight,  and I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 6 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, June 21, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
