 Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the 19 children and 2  teachers murdered in Uvalde, Texas, 1 year ago today.   One excruciating year has passed for the families of those we lost at  Robb Elementary that day. A year of empty childhood bedrooms and vacant  desks where a child should be. One full year, and what do we have to  show for it? What has this legislative body done to answer the pain of  these parents with policy?   I ask myself this: Have we passed any measures on this floor that  will stop the next Uvalde? The answer to that is an obvious no, we have  not, because in the year since the second worst school shooting in  American history, there has been 39 more.   My district is about 355 miles north of Uvalde, but the horror of  that day haunts every Texan as if it happened right next door; maybe  that is because it is happening next door, in a wave of gun violence  that has touched every corner of Texas, in every public space we once  saw as safe.   Just this month, my home of north Texas has grieved the deaths of  eight Texans in a hateful act of violence at a shopping mall. That was  the ninth mass shooting in Texas in 14 years. Fourteen years that  lawmakers in Texas and Washington have used to loosen gun regulations.   Mr. Speaker, I will tell you something: As a Texan and as an  American, I am tired. I am tired of being traumatized. Texas is tired  of the terror. It is time to do our jobs and legislate instead of  pontificate.   The 21 Texans ripped from their families last year deserve more. The  people of Uvalde who have grieved and cried and demanded change deserve  more. I hope we don't come back here in a year with the same amount of  nothing to show for these grieving families. I hope we can show up  having passed universal background checks and a ban on the weapon of  war that stole those children's lives, but if history--history that  many Republicans don't believe we should have taught in schools--if  history is any indication, then yet another year will pass, more lives  will be lost, and politicians will put on their pastoral hats and issue  prayers instead of practicing what they preach, which is to be tough on  crime and to keep these weapons of war out of the hands of the many  domestic terrorists that have, frankly, been radicalized by the  rightwing extreme rhetoric.   Regardless of what the Republicans do or don't do, regardless of  their lack of courage, I will continue doing what I do best, which is  standing for commonsense solutions that will save lives.   To my colleagues, I challenge you. Let's not fail these parents and  children again. The number one killer of children in this country is  guns right now. It is time that my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle practice what they preach and be pro-life.   Mr. Speaker, let's save some lives.
