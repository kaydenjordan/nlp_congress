 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a legend in the  Michigan motorcycle freedom and safety community, Vince Consiglio, who  announced his upcoming retirement in January. Vince is the president of  ABATE of Michigan, or American Bikers Aiming Toward Education.   Vince, who has served as president for over 30 years, joined ABATE in  1975 and has served in multiple roles, including as Michigan's chief  Motorcycle Safety Foundation instructor, teaching many MSF instructors  the importance of safe riding practices.   He has been integral in public education about issues impacting  motorcyclists, working with State legislators to increase motorcycle  awareness and protect the cherished heritage we share.   I have personally known Vince for many years and know him to be a man  [[Page H6727]]  of character and passionate about motorcycles, especially his Harley.   I wish Vince a happy and fulfilling retirement and thank him for his  service to his fellow riders and ABATE.                            ____________________
