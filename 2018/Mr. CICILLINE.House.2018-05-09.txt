 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 5645, the so-called  SMARTER Act, an assault on the Federal Trade Commission's ability to  vigorously promote competition through merger enforcement.                                time  1400    Over a century ago, Congress responded to waves of consolidation by  creating the Federal Trade Commission to promote, development, and  protect competition and the antitrust laws.   There is longstanding, bipartisan consensus that the Commission's use  of administrative litigation to address anticompetitive mergers and  conduct is core to this mission. This includes the former Republican  and Democratic chairs of the Commission under George W. Bush and the  Obama administrations, who have each raised serious concerns about this  legislation, precisely because it eliminates a tool that has been  critical in combating anti-competitive mergers and conduct, including  mergers that would have raised Americans' cost of healthcare.   Top Republican antitrust enforcers have long supported the use of  administrative litigation in merger enforcement to promote competition  and develop the antitrust laws.   In 2003, Joseph Simons, who was appointed by President Trump and  recently confirmed as the chairman of the Commission, stated as  director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition that administrative  litigation has ``substantial public policy benefits.'' He also referred  to this tool as ``an instrument for developing the law'' that  ``increases the transparency of Commission decisionmaking through  carefully written opinions that accompany a Commission final litigated  order can give considerable guidance to the bar and the business  community on applicable standards and enforcement policy.''   And in 2004, Barry Nigro, who also served as a director of the FTC's  Bureau of Competition under the George W. Bush administration, and was  appointed by President Trump to serve in the Justice Department's  Antitrust Division, stated that the ``volume of administrative  litigation is no accident. It reflects our belief in administrative  litigation as a way to take advantage of the FTC's expertise in the  development of antitrust jurisprudence, particularly in the kind of  complex matters that the FTC was created to address.''   Nevertheless, proponents of the SMARTER Act argue that the outcome of  a transaction should not depend on a ``coin flip'' to determine which  antitrust agency will review a transaction. But this claim is  untethered from how antitrust enforcement actually works in the vast  majority of cases. In fact, the determination of the moving party is  determined by each agency's jurisdictional district, or areas committed  by statute, and consistent with a well-developed body of case law, and  not by a coin toss.   In the most comprehensive study of administrative litigation to date,  Republican FTC Commissioner Maureen Ohlhausen debunked procedural  concerns with administrative litigation as ``mostly anecdotal or  theoretical,'' concluding it has been a transformative tool for  advancing competition policy.   And last Congress, Jonathan Jacobson, a leading antitrust attorney,  who currently serves as the chair of the American Bar Association's  section on antitrust law, testified that, in his decades of practice,  he has never seen a merger that turned on the differences that the  SMARTER Act seeks to address. In fact, less than 2 percent of all  mergers are blocked by the antitrust agencies, and an even smaller  percentage of these cases go to trial.   The FTC also has a pristine record when using this authority. It has  won six out of seven cases before the Supreme Court, and five of these  were brought through administrative litigation.   We should, therefore, be deeply skeptical about baseless speculation  and support of the bill. Empty rhetoric is no substitute for evidence  that the SMARTER Act actually solves a real problem.   But even more importantly, this bill is a major step in the wrong  direction on making our economy work for everybody. There is  overwhelming evidence that concentrated economic power is at historic  levels in this country, and has structurally weakened competition on an  economy-wide basis.   This lack of competition is a fundamental threat to the economic  opportunity of hardworking Americans who want lower prices, more and  better services, and better wages. We need more competition, not less.   As the nonpartisan Open Markets Institute notes, ``Given the severity  of the concentration problem in America today, and its economic and  political consequences, Congress should be looking to enhance the  powers of all of America's antimonopoly agencies.''   House and Senate Democrats have proposed a better deal to enhance  competition to reduce lower prices and more choices for consumers.   Instead of undermining antitrust enforcement on the basis of purely  speculative harms--as H.R. 5645 would do--we should be giving the  antitrust agencies the resources and tools they need to robustly  enforce the law.   In closing, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, which  does nothing to reduce concentrated economic power or address the  economic challenges working people face every day and, in fact, will  make the problem worse. It will make it easier to consolidate economic  power in the way that undermines consumer choices, consumer costs, and  will ultimately undermine hardworking American families.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I thank the  gentleman for yielding.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, prescription drug prices are rising at an  unprecedented rate, unsustainable for most American families. In fact,  Americans pay double what people in other countries pay for  prescription drugs.   Our per capita prescription drug spending is higher than any other  country. That is why last July, Democrats outlined a bold new plan to  give  [[Page H3869]]  the American people a better deal on prescription drug costs. Our plan  cracks down on price gouging, allows Medicare to negotiate discounted  prices, and requires new levels of transparency for big drug companies.   But more than 10 months since Democrats offered a way forward,  President Trump and Republicans are still silent. Instead of addressing  this crisis, the President and his allies in Congress have made the  problem even worse. They tried to take away healthcare from 23 million  Americans on more than one occasion. They gave the pharmaceutical  industry a huge tax cut, and they made it even harder for working men  and women to get ahead.   Democrats are putting the needs of working people first, ahead of big  pharmaceutical companies, and we are going to keep fighting until the  American people get a better deal on prescription drugs.                            ____________________
