 Mr. Speaker, our neighbors back home are tired  of the scam artists ripping them off, so I rise in strong support of  H.R. 2668, the Consumer Protection and Recovery Act. I thank  Representative Cardenas, Chair Schakowsky, and Chair Pallone for moving  this bill swiftly to the floor.   H.R. 2668 fixes a glitch in the laws governing the Federal Trade  Commission. Now the FTC is one of our most important consumer watchdog  agencies, and for 40 years the FTC has been able to recover ill-gotten  gains and restitution for consumers, but a recent Supreme Court  decision kind of threw it back to Congress for us to clarify the FTC's  authority.   This is very important. This is the authority that allows the FTC to  rightfully recover moneys for consumers when fraudsters cheat them out  of it. And this is especially important for seniors, folks in the  Active Duty military, veterans, and others because they are often  targeted by scams like telemarketer credit card scams, those scam  artists that claim that we are working for a charitable organization  that is going to help disabled police officers or disabled military,  these false, fake cures that say, pay us this money and you are going  to be cured of your Type 2 diabetes or you won't be in pain anymore. It  is so wrong.   The FTC is working overtime. They have particularly been working  overtime during the COVID pandemic because there have been so many  scams and frauds.  [[Page H3734]]    We have got to pass this bill so that we can empower the FTC to get  people's money back. It is that simple.   In fact, in my home State of Florida, just since July 2018, the FTC  helped recover over $81 million for over 540,000 Floridians.   So if Members don't support this legislation, you are just giving a  green light to the fraudsters to steal from consumers without penalty.   That is wrong. We can't let that happen.   I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 2668.
