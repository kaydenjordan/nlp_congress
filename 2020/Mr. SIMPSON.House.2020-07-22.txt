 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Utah for  yielding. I know that was painful.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of the Great American Outdoors Act. It  makes sense to me that, if we are going to have public lands and  preserve public lands for Americans, we should also take care of it.  That is why the LWCF funding and deferred maintenance part of this bill  are very important and a perfect combination.   With that in mind, I wrote the LAND Act in 2017, which funded these  two  [[Page H3646]]  programs without using a dime of taxpayer money.   Fast-forward to 2020 and the President specifically asked Congress to  send him a bill that funded both these programs and that he would sign  it.   Thanks to Senator Gardner, Senator Daines, Senator Heinrich, and  Senator Manchin, the Great American Outdoors Act built upon the LAND  Act and passed the Senate with 73 votes, which brings us to this  historic day.   The Great American Outdoors Act creates 100,000 jobs, preserves  public lands for future generations, and cares for our current national  parks and trails. All this is funded by energy revenue and the existing  $20 billion fund--again, not taxpayer dollars.   The bill does not expand the Federal footprint because 99 percent of  the LWCF purchases are within existing public lands.   The bill does not force anyone to sell their property since it is  willing seller and willing buyer.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill not for me and not for you,  but for future generations so that they can enjoy our great outdoors.
