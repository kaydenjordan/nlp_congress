 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a truly  remarkable family from the Fourth Congressional District of Arkansas.   The Alston family from Mena was recently named Arkansas Farm Family  of the Year. The Holly Springs Homestead, run by Luke and Deedee  Alston, is a diverse farm of Angus cattle, chicken houses, and a large  variety of fruits and vegetables grown at its location in Polk County.   Not only is the family--which includes sons Ryan and Drey--active in  traditional farming, but the Alstons are also a leader in Arkansas  agritourism, with a variety of crops bringing families to the Holly  Springs Homestead. Their work supports the Polk County economy and  brings pride to their friends and neighbors.   I send my congratulations to the Alston family on this prestigious  honor, as well as all the county farm family winners across Arkansas.                            ____________________
