 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to  4 minutes prior to the vote.  [[Page S5907]]     Mr. President, I rise in support of Harry Coker's  nomination to be the National Cyber Director. The National Cyber  Director is responsible for driving cyber security policy and strategy  all across the Federal Government.   The Office of the National Cyber Director was established by Congress  in 2021 to foster a coordinated, whole-of-government approach to cyber  security. Harry Coker is an accomplished leader and a dedicated public  servant who is well qualified to lead this important office.   Mr. Coker has over four decades of national security and cyber  security experience. He served as a naval officer and in senior  leadership roles at the National Security Agency and the Central  Intelligence Agency, where he worked to combat cyber and national  security threats. His nomination received bipartisan support from the  Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and he  has been endorsed by a wide range of bipartisan cyber and national  security experts.   During the 2 years since the Office of the National Cyber Director  was created, the office has done impressive work, including developing  an ambitious national cyber security strategy and national cyber  workforce and education strategy. The Office of the National Cyber  Director has been without a confirmed leader for almost 10 months. A  dedicated, Senate-confirmed leader is critical to building upon these  efforts and continuing to grow and mature the Office of the National  Cyber Director.   I urge my colleagues to join me in confirming Mr. Coker to this very  important role.   I yield the floor.
