 Mr. President, I am here to talk about net neutrality.  First, though, I wish to commend the Presiding Officer for the  agreement we have made on the STOP Act. He is the lead sponsor, and I  am the lead Democrat on the bill that will really get at these drugs,  like fentanyl, that can kill someone with just a grain-of-salt amount  of it, which have been coming in from China and other places through  our own Postal Service, which is outrageous for Americans. We have  valiantly worked on this bill, and the Senator has worked out an  agreement with Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden on the Finance  Committee. I want to commend him for that. We are excited the bill is  moving forward.   Mr. President, I also want to mention another completely separate  issue as we debate the NDAA, which is the issue of the Secure Elections  Act that Senator Lankford and I have put on as an amendment to this  bill.   Let me remind my colleagues that we are approaching a different kind  of warfare; that is, cyber warfare. It is certainly what we saw during  the last election, but we have seen it in the area of business--in  attacks on some of our major businesses in our own country--and, of  course, we have seen it in elections, as well, with Russia attempting  to hack into the election systems of 21 States.   What this bill does is make it easier for local elected officials to  get the information in realtime when hacks that they may not know about  are going on in other States and to have the classified information  they need by getting the security clearance they need to protect their  own election system. We have worked with the secretaries of state all  over the country on this. Senator Burr, Senator Warner, the heads of  the Intelligence Committee, support this bill.   I also thank Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator Kamala Harris, who  worked with us on the bill, and we are asking to get it on as an  amendment to the Defense Act with the simple idea that warfare isn't  the same as it was 50 years ago or 20 years ago or 10 years ago or even  5 years ago. Things are changing, and our laws need to be as  sophisticated, the protection of our  [[Page S3744]]  country needs to be as sophisticated as those who are trying to do us  harm. We are hopeful that we will be able to reach an agreement on  this, given that the Intelligence Committee has held numerous hearings  about election security, as has Homeland Security, as has Judiciary.                                Net Neutrality    Mr. President, today, I am here in opposition to the Federal  Communications Commission's action on Monday to repeal net neutrality  protections. Net neutrality is the bedrock of a fast, fair, open,  global internet. It holds internet service providers accountable for  providing the internet access consumers expect while protecting  innovation and competition.   These protections have worked and are part of the reason the internet  has become one of the great American success stories, transforming not  only how we communicate with friends and family but also the way  companies do business, how consumers buy goods, and how we educate our  kids.   Earlier this year, the FCC approved Chairman Pai's plan to eliminate  net neutrality rules. Yesterday, the final rollback of net neutrality  went through. The FCC has now given major internet service providers  the ability to significantly change consumers' experiences online. Big  internet service providers now have the ability to block, slow, and  prioritize web traffic for their own financial gain. This means they  can sort online traffic into fast or slow lanes and charge consumers  extra for high-speed internet. Internet service providers can even  block content they don't want their subscribers to access. The only  protections that are maintained are requirements for service providers  to disclose their internet traffic policies. A lot of good that will do  if, in like the State of Minnesota, you have significant rural areas  where there is no real opportunity to comparison shop or find a new  provider. If you only have one provider to go to, it has a virtual  monopoly over your internet service.    According to the FCC, more than 24 million Americans still lack high- speed broadband. We should be focusing our efforts on helping these  households get connected, not eliminating net neutrality and worsening  the digital divide. You can always pay for high-speed access. You can  pay for it no matter where you live. You can run lines to your house if  you are in a remote area--lines that will cost millions of dollars. But  that is not what they have done in other developed countries. No, they  have seen it as a virtue, as part of a democracy, that everyone should  have access to the internet and that it is part of what makes an  economy work. You don't leave people behind if they don't have the  money by themselves to afford to run lines all the way to their homes.   This isn't only about individual internet users. It will limit  competition, and it will hurt small business entrepreneurship and  innovation, which has always been at the heart of the American economy.  Without unrestricted access to the internet, entrepreneurs may be  forced to pay to have an equal footing so as to be able to compete  online, rather than to focus on growing their businesses.   When you talk to small companies--to some of the startups we have  seen out there, some of the companies that young people have started-- and you ask them: How do you break into the market when you have a big  guy out there who has millions and millions and billions and billions  of dollars and a multinational presence if you are trying to sell baby  clothes or if you are trying to have a new digital service, they tell  you: It is online. They break in because they can compete by getting  customers online. Guess what. If they start having to pay huge amounts  of money to get that access online in order to compete with the big  companies that, of course, can already pay for that and can already  afford that, you are going to have a problem, and you are going to  defeat the very idea of entrepreneurship.   Small businesses that are unable to pay for access to faster internet  service may soon find themselves struggling to compete from the slow  lane. Repealing net neutrality will hurt the very people who are  creating jobs and keeping our economy competitive. That is why I joined  my colleagues to force a vote last month on Senator Markey's bill to  repeal Chairman Pai's plan and reinstate net neutrality rules. This  bill received bipartisan support and was passed by the Senate--in this  very room. Now it is up to the House to do the same.   The internet should remain free and open for all who use it. So the  fight to save net neutrality is far from over.   I have joined Senate Democrats in urging Speaker Ryan to immediately  schedule a vote on the bill to save net neutrality protections. They  can do this. To keep the pressure on, it will take all of us, working  together--private sector partners, business, small business, nonprofit  advocates--to tell our government officials at the local, State, and  Federal levels to take that good vote in the Senate as a sign that it  is time to change the policy. The way you do that, of course, is with a  vote over in the House of Representatives. At least allow a vote.   The fight to protect net neutrality is far from over, and we need to  make our voices heard for all of the American consumers, entrepreneurs,  and innovators who rely on a free and open internet.   I yield the floor.
