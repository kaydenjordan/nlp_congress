 Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring recognition to 30- year U.S. Army veteran Sergeant Major John Thies.   During his three decades of service to our Nation, mostly as a  Special Forces Green Beret, he faced combat operations in Panama,  Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan.   Among the many highlights of his illustrious career was his  participation with the third Operational Detachment Alpha to infiltrate  Afghanistan following the attacks on September 11, 2001.   As a servicemember in all of these conflicts, John and his fellow  warriors helped to bring down dictators, defeat insurgencies, and  create conditions for the establishment of democracy. More importantly,  his sacrifices brought hope to the suffering and peace to those in need  of relief.   I believe Sergeant Major Thies' former commanders and peers  summarized his career and impact well in sharing that he was one of the  finest noncommissioned officers they had ever served with. That is high  praise from our Nation's finest.    Madam Speaker, I thank John. I thank him for putting us before  himself. We and our families slept better knowing he was on alert.                            ____________________
